<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very sleek looking, good quality.</li>
    <li> I got the 4 piece set of eyeshadow brushes and I totally love them. They are just awesome for blending shadows. There was no shedding whatsoever and the value was a steal!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what they are retailing for, but at the time I purchased them, they were five dollars. That&#x27;s about what they are worth. If they are retailing for more than five bucks I would recommend the Real Techniques brushes. These are great for in between brushes. If your regular brushes need to be washed.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller!</li>
    <li> Perfect for blending on the eyes. I use the brushes to blend my MAC paint pot.</li>
    <li> 5 stars to the seller 5 stars for the brushes all around decent product and quality for the price</li>
    <li> Good density to bristles. Super soft as well! I give them a four star because the handles are an interesting texture that does not have any sorry of grip to them.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for a fantastic price!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes.Great price!</li>
    <li> I got the 10 piece in all black and I got them today they got here very fast. I haven&#x27;t tried them but they feel great. They are soft and look and feel super professional. I like them.</li>
    <li> Does not pick up color at all</li>
    <li> Great brushes. No harsh smells. I&#x27;ve had them for several months now and no shedding or loosen handles. I used them for blending out concealer.</li>
    <li> These were just like the price I paid for them - cheap. I would not recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> These are GREAT!!  I bought a pack for my sisters too and they love them as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes are so soft and very easily take on shadows and powders.</li>
    <li> surprisingly these brushes are extremely soft they don&#x27;t eat the product. no shedding which then overall good brushes</li>
    <li> Gold things are all cruicid but i love them.</li>
    <li> Sheds like hell. Ugh waste.</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy brushes for eye products.</li>
    <li> rough, not much movement and not much color pick up. i threw them away.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. Love them for blending my eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> The flat top is the only brush I don&#x27;t really car for and that is because it is not as dense as the others. The small dome is fantastic for concealing blemishes and the others are good for highlighting or eyeshadow. They are pretty soft - but wash them first because there is a smell to them. I don&#x27;t have Sigma, so I can&#x27;t say how much these are a dupe for them - I got them to practice with before investing in higher end brushes.</li>
    <li> Well I have put this brush to the test and they failed. I wash them and the gold  strip fell off.Dont waste your money .Not a  good quality</li>
    <li> Really good quality brushes, super soft and they do the job.</li>
    <li> Okay quality. But not bad for the price. I use them to generally blend in my concealer</li>
    <li> The brushes were very soft and easy to use. I had no problems with this product. I was actually surprised that the brushes were a little more thick than I expected but I&#x27;m fine with that. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> Yes, they do smell like turpentine...and yes, they are rather large. But after a quick wash they&#x27;re perfect! Some I use for  eyes &amp; some for face, but they ALL get used...and OFTEN. They&#x27;re just as soft as my Real Techniques brushes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Brushes Love them</li>
    <li> I just received and tried these brushes. They are solid and don&#x27;t shed. They are very soft which is great for sensitive skin. You can use them to apply and blend eyeshadows on the lid, or to apply concealer. It works great with both powders and creamy concealer / eyeshadows!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are soo soft, and blend really well. I love them, they are perfect for blending and applying in the crease.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price, they get the job done. I can&#x27;t imagine any more expensive brands being &amp;#34;different&#x27; or &#x27;better&#x27; in any way.</li>
    <li> Love, love love them!, feel like expensive Mac or sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the crease and blending.&lt;br /&gt;I will re-purchase again for sure!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes their amazing and very soft  they came in about two weeks</li>
    <li> Was attracted to the price and was more impressed by the quality!! They were definitely a lot bigger than I expected, but they&#x27;ve been great so far!</li>
    <li> Bristles were too hard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received my brushes and I&#x27;m very blessed with them , they are very soft and the quality is amazing just like Sigma or MAC ... I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll repurchase again these set :) THANK YOU !</li>
    <li> First off, they&#x27;re so soft and have long handles which is good for me at least. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because 2 of my brushes broke the other day....</li>
    <li> They took a while to arrive but it was worth the wait. They are nice quality and the perfect combo of soft and dense. They arrive a bit smashed and ill shaped. I just washed them and used my brush guards to reshape them. It turned out perfect. I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes no shedding.  They blend eyeshadows really good.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting another set.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these are eyeshadow brushes...they are friggin&#x27; huge. I was expecting something a tad more dainty. The brush head / bristle portion is 3/4\\&quot; long (I checked my brushes and they are all around 1/2\\&quot;) . I&#x27;m not trying to paint on a canvas ! The handles are way too thick to hold comfortably (about 3/8\\&quot; in diameter) With the bristles included - these sucker are 7\\&quot; long.  I guess I am just surprised because I have never seen such large brushes specifically for the eyes. I&#x27;m glad I bought some eco-tools brushed  as well.  Now those are the perfect brush !  I will say that these are very soft and do not seem to shed. In this case...it&#x27;s not the quality....it&#x27;s the quantity of the brush.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are ao soft, yet sturdy!!!</li>
    <li> These were awesome very soft but sturdy at the same time plus shipping was very efficient will be ordering the set of face brushes next</li>
    <li> These are very soft and thick brushes.  Exactly what I am looking for for eye shadows, concealers, and eye primers.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft brushes. These can be used as finishing brushes, or to apply product. The price is great, as is the product! I would highly recommend this product, and I am a licensed Cosmetologist, so I love having high quality brushes around.</li>
    <li> As other reviews say they are quite long, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. The brush tips are a little larger than usual, but they are super soft and work great! Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine how to use them for eye makeup, they too huge for it! Also three of them is just blending brushes, and just one is firm enough to actually apply eye shadow. Basically eye brushes set should have one firm crease brush, one blending brush, one precise application brush and one flat brush to apply lighter colors/highlighters. Here you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The quality is fairly decent. They are nice and soft and I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding when I washed them before using them for the 1st time. Sadly though one of the brush ferrules came off of the handle on the 1st day I had them. Though I was able to fix it with a bit of glue I&#x27;m not sure how long it will hold because there wasn&#x27;t much of an overlap to the handle tip to apply the glue to affix it back on.  The other downside is the size of the brushes. I figured from the pictures that they would be larger brushes but they are bigger then half my eyelid. They are fine for blending or to use on the face elsewhere but forget being able to do much with them if you are wanting them for the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;8/5/14- It has been a few days since I glued the head back on the broken brush and I was right- there was not enough of the brush shaft to attach the head back to the brush. I am really disappointed since of the 4 brushes the broken one is the one I am most likely to use.</li>
    <li> I love my quality brushes (Mac, Morphe, sigma). These brushes are great quality. REALLY soft and nicely packed. I use them to blend, do a simple soft look.. Nothing too precise since they are on the larger side (this is what I was looking for). I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, but so far I&#x27;ve had absolutely no shedding so I don&#x27;t think there will be any issues with cleansing. Great brushes for little $</li>
    <li> nice brush set, the only issue is it takes too long to deliver and they are bent at delivery due to shipping handling but i put them all in a brush guard and they are back to shape</li>
    <li> The brushes are so incredibly soft and great quality for such a low price! They are synthetic, which is ideal for cream/wet products (Concealer, MAC paint pots, etc.) They are also great for setting and blending the cream products..just uuurrrgghh!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> GOOD QUALITY, NO NAME BRUSHES. I USE THEM DAILY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could. These brushes are crap and waaaay too big. So unless you&#x27;re an elephant on a budget, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> An awesome bargain.  I use all of the brushes in this set and don&#x27;t know how I got along without them before I got them!  I use the flat-top blender as a stippling brush for setting my under eye concealer, and the other 3 blenders are great for eyeshadows.  These blenders are relatively dense, so you may still need a fluffy blender for your collection even after buying these.  Check out Coastal Scents for that, if you don&#x27;t want to pay a fortune.  but insist on results.  ;)</li>
    <li> Excellent, soft brushes!</li>
    <li> Works great for blending concealer</li>
    <li> Great brushes a little thicker  than I anticipated if looking for thin brushes these are not thin.  They are good quality and soft,  no bristles falling out or anything.</li>
    <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m picky when it comes to brushes, as I&#x27;ve had the same ones for as long as I can recall. That being said, I really felt it was time for some new ones and I did my research before purchasing. When I came upon these gems, the price was SO CHEAP, I thought, &amp;#34;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try them...&amp;#34;  I LOVE THEM!!!  My eyeshadow goes on much more smoothly.  I really had no idea what I was missing.  -- KEEP READING  UPDATE:  After owning these brushes for not very long, every single one has fallen apart and needed to be glued back together. Where the gold part and the black part hook together- every single brush became wiggly at first and then fell came apart.  Perhaps, you do get what you pay for.  BOO.</li>
    <li> happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes very soft , had great service , goods arrived quickly and in good condition  very happy customer</li>
    <li> These brushes are just like the MAC brushes but for an AMAZING price. They are very soft, but still pick up a great deal of product, and they are so easy to clean. I will definitely be buying more and I would also recommend getting the foundation brushes they sell as well!</li>
    <li> I love this brushes, they are soft, but not flimsy they do not shed and they certainly last a long time.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft and don&#x27;t shed so far, so that&#x27;s awesome. However, I do wish that two of the brushes weren&#x27;t relatively the same. One could be a thinner version of the other. But all in all, I&#x27;d purchase them again and I&#x27;m a makeup fanatic. They pick up and apply eyeshadow very well. They&#x27;re also sleek and look pretty on my vanity.</li>
    <li> Super soft and great quality!</li>
    <li> I love theses brushes</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure if I was going to be able to use these because they are a lot larger in person. But I did find some really great uses for them. And they are a great addition to my brush collection. And the quality of the brush are great for the price.</li>
    <li> Made of very good quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> They are a good quality, I recommend it....</li>
    <li> A bit larger than I expected, but three are good for blending, and I like the pencil brush.</li>
    <li> nice soft makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I returned these because they were too big. Maybe I misunderstood the description. I returned them without a hassle.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be smaller,but they are great! They&#x27;re very soft what is important for the brush.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price. They came fast and I would definitley get again.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. Very, very soft on the skin and the bristles didn&#x27;t shed. Only thing is the handle doesn&#x27;t seem to be glued well enough because it was coming off after a few washes. Nothing superglue can&#x27;t fix. I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 if it weren&#x27;t for the handle issue. Definitely a must buy though if you&#x27;re a makeup artist or just a makeup lover. For this value, you can&#x27;t go wrong. You can buy 10 for the price of 1 professional kit and these work just as great.</li>
    <li> these brushes are kinda hard</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes and super soft. Shipping came faster than what I paid for :)</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes with thick bristles and a wide face that make blending easy. I like the four different shaped brush tips and I use some for eyeshadow and the other for powder contouring</li>
    <li> Brushes are too big but there pretty sturdy</li>
    <li> Love these brushes i ordered another set thats how much i loved them, they dont shed ,there soft i just love them !!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome for the price!!!! I love them! Will be buying another set to keep and one to give to my sister.</li>
    <li> Work pretty well although not good to travel with or carry in your purse they break pretty easily</li>
    <li> These eye-shadow brushes are very thick, and aren&#x27;t very good for fine detailing. I use mine for base eye-shadows, or for other face make-up. If you&#x27;re looking for a good eye-brush starter kit, you&#x27;ll have a better time using the &amp;#34;EcoTools Duo Brush Set&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;Real Technique Eye-shadow Starter Kit&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> the smell was overwhelming, it went away after a week; they are OK.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, just as good as the real expensive kinds.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for the price</li>
    <li> I love these brushes very soft and great quality for such a good price. I&#x27;m very happy with them. They are my go to brushes I use everyday.</li>
    <li> Worth the money! These brushes are smooth over eyes and very soft!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted these brushes which arrived in a timely manner and in neat individual packages for each brush. However upon opening the package a strong chemical-like smell (almost like paint or paint thinner) emanated from the brushes. After she washed them the smell disappeared. For the most part, my wife enjoys the use of the brushes, but she had to repair the stippling (sp?) brush only after its second use. Apparently the head of the brush (gold piece with bristles attached) fell off the stick. The quality of the brushes are ok. We&#x27;ll see how well they hold up after a couple more uses. Overall, I would recommend these if you just want some brushes. Although they are inexpensive and of moderate quality I wouldn&#x27;t imagine the brushes to last a lifetime, but they do help my wife&#x27;s stick foundation last longer (as less make up is needed with the use of a brush).</li>
    <li> all of them kept falling off.. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes along with the similar face makeup set, and when they came, I was very satisfied! These brushes are unbelievably soft, they do not shed (yet), they are comfortably firm, they do not smell, and the brushes do what they&#x27;re supposed to better than expected! The price made me very cautious, but don&#x27;t let that fool you! They feel like I will be using them for years to come. I&#x27;ll update this review once I wash them a few times, and use them a bit more.</li>
    <li> Super soft... Just wow...</li>
    <li> Contrast to what y&#x27;all may think, these are phenomenonal, why spend $16 on one sigma brush when these perform equally as well and the price is so fantastic. They took about 2 weeks to receive but it was worth the wait</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MUA and these brushes are excellent! Have nice texture and are perfect for blending and concealer. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Brushes are super soft, but when I first opened them they had a bit of a chemical smell. That got better after using them for awhile. The brushes are pretty big so they&#x27;re a bit difficult to work with. I only use the pencil brush and blending brush because the other ones are too big and I&#x27;m not really sure what to do with them.</li>
    <li> Incredibly soft, great for blending out.</li>
    <li> The Professional 4 pcs Gold Eye Brushes are great for blending out that eye shadow. They are soft, and made well. Want another set already. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes! Great quality for such a low price. I got exactly what I wanted, several good quality blending brushes! They&#x27;re soft and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They were well manufactured but when they arrived, there was a chemical scent to it. However it goes away in a couple of hours. Great quality brushes. Definitely going to try more of their products</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re extremely soft and help blend shadow very well (:</li>
    <li> Fast.  As advertised. Good quality and price</li>
    <li> Super soft, but I feel like they are starting to break already. The metal piece that holds the brush is starting to wobble for some reason.</li>
    <li> I love these blending brushes! I recently went to the sigma website and found a similar set. These brushes are the dupes for them I believe and they are great for applying eye shadow. They came in a timely matter and I definitely recommend them. Plus it&#x27;s great for the price!</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft work really well. I&#x27;m favoring them over my Mac brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent! I use them for eye makeup, contouring and highlighting. The quality is comparable to Mac and Sigma brushes or perhaps even better. These brushes are really soft, clean very well with water and soap and don&#x27;t even shed. Don&#x27;t waste money on expensive brushes...</li>
    <li> Great quality...great price! I would definitely recommend purchasing this make-up brush set to anyone who is looking for professional quality make-up brushes but does not want to spend hundreds of dollars.</li>
    <li> good brushes. it&#x27;s soft.</li>
    <li> Very good set, better for eye shadow application than those sponge-ended ones or q-tips.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> Came apart within a few weeks of use. Had to revalue them.</li>
    <li> I still have to learn how to use two of them. They are very soft.</li>
    <li> these don&#x27;t hold eyeshadow on them :/</li>
    <li> best brushes. Love synthetic kabuki</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! I love them, would be ordering more!</li>
    <li> good brushes so far they are also holding up very well!</li>
    <li> awesome!! Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Love the blender brush! Don&#x27;t really use the others...</li>
    <li> Pretty nice, they work nice and they look nice</li>
