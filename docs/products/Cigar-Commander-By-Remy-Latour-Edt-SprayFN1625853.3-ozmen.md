<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly what this cologne smells like.</li>
<li> It is very similar to the regular Cigar by Remy Latour, but with different subtle overtones.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very musky which I find relieving.</li>
<li> It was a bit too bitter for me in contrast</li>
<li> I was tired of the same old aftershave.  </li>
<li> But one bad thing to note about this product is that it does not seem to last very long.</li>
<li> I do have to say that I notice a subtle smell of tobacco oils after the alcohol evaporates.  </li>
<li> I would say that it does have a small hint of musk that is accented well by a faint scent of sandalwood.</li>
<li> you can never go wrong w CUBA.</li>

    <li> Awesome product at a fantastic price! Shipped promptly! Excellent seller!</li>
    <li> Every man just loves when i get this for them. Rich smell for any man. not over powering but lingers and keeps a fresh sent all day. you can never go wrong w CUBA.</li>
    <li> Great smoke/woody smell, many compliments from individuals that I don&#x27;t even know. The best thing is the price which is much lower than department store brands that don&#x27;t smell half as good!!</li>
    <li> Tried before. It is very similar to the regular Cigar by Remy Latour, but with different subtle overtones.&lt;br /&gt;Just had to get more!!!</li>
    <li> not what I expected, but okay</li>
    <li> I like it but not as much as the original.  Scent is nice, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.  I have to practically bathe in it to still smell it even 2 hours later.  Unsure why the efficacy of this is so much less than the original.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is nice and light but doesn&#x27;t last to long. I&#x27;ll stick to the original cigar.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the aroma of a clean, rich, and sweet cigar. It is a smell that is unlike anything else. It evokes a sense of swagger and masculinity. When I first saw that they made a cologne that would  smell like a classic cigar, I was ecstatic.  Although this cologne will not help you smell like a cigar, it does not smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to pinpoint exactly what this cologne smells like. It&#x27;s not very musky which I find relieving. I despise musk in colognes. I would say that it does have a small hint of musk that is accented well by a faint scent of sandalwood. But one bad thing to note about this product is that it does not seem to last very long. I would say in a couple hours you will have to search for where you sprayed yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would give this product a. 7/10. Not bad by any means, but it is not the equivalent of a cigar.</li>
    <li> I purchased \\&quot;Cigar Commander\\&quot; in order to get an idea of what tobacco scents smell like in the form of colognes. I also purchased \\&quot;Havana\\&quot; at the same time. Havana is also suppossed to have tobacco notes to it. If you like cigar smells then \\&quot;Cigar Commander\\&quot; is for you!!! It smells like you&#x27;re wearing fresh unsmoked tobacco. It was a bit too bitter for me in contrast Havana is supposed to have a tobacco smell as well, but I could not smell anything like tobacco in Havana.</li>
    <li> This smells about the same as the basic Cigar fragrance by Remy.  I do have to say that I notice a subtle smell of tobacco oils after the alcohol evaporates.  It doesn&#x27;t make you smell like burning tobacco, of course.  For that, you&#x27;d need to sit in the presence of a burning cigar or pipe.  Wear this fragrance to your local cigar lounge, and you&#x27;ll leave smelling quite interesting!</li>
    <li> An awesome fragrance with a manly smell</li>
    <li> Priced right and shipped quick!</li>
    <li> smells great, makes me smell like a great cuban cigar and I have buying this cologne for years. great price too</li>
    <li> Just as good as its older brother, &amp;#34;Cigar.&amp;#34;  Will order again in the future for sure.  Thanks for the opportunity.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the same old aftershave.  Thought I would try something new.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have great memories of these scent. My wife loves it</li>
    <li> VERY NICE FRESH SMELL LASTS ALL DAY</li>
    <li> Love it, wish it lasted longer</li>
    <li> Ever since I found &amp;#34;Cigar&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll not wear anything else! Best Cologne ever!</li>
