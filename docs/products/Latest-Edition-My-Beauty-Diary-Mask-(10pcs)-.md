      <li>This mask is great.</li>
      <li>So fresh and make ur skin flawless!!! &lt;3</li>
      <li>I want to love this mask, but the smell isn&#x27;t superb - doesn&#x27;t smell like lemons, and it was a task to have it on my face</li>
      <li>i love this product!</li>
      <li>I really love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried these paper masks!</li>
      <li>Very soothing and comforting, feels wonderful on the skin.</li>
      <li>It honestly smells like Sprite or 7-up soda and the box doesn&#x27;t show it</li>
      <li>It smells nice, brightens and softens my face, and just feels nice &#x3D;)&lt;</li>
      <li>It is the most effective thing.</li>
      <li>My face looked very smooth after using this.</li>
      <li>I love the mask and it has ample solution in it.  </li>
      <li>The MBD mask does a lot more for me than the clay masks I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>Most of the time, I can get 3 uses out of each mask.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully it will give me some better resolves after the 10th times.</li>
      <li>This mask is so affordable and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Yogurt - Very hydrating (not greasy), does a great job of brightening.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t keep the mask from my nose to top lip in place.</li>
      <li>it is ok and it works</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mask is very well made in terms of its shape: it comes with many cuts at the corners so that certain areas will overlap but will ensure that all areas of the face will be covered perfectly.</li>
      <li>The mask is comfortable, and the serum is pleasant feeling, but I didn&#x27;t feel any tingle and didn&#x27;t notice much after use.</li>
      <li>Other My Beauty Diary Masks - Caviar, Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid - smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>I dug into the Caviar masks first and love them!</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and take off, no fuss.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will because I&#x27;ve tried other My Beauty Diary products and they are great :)</li>
      <li>This line of products has been working wonderfully, saving my skin from the harsh winter weather in Colorado.  </li>
      <li>Really smooth after applying that.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>This company makes great facial masks!!!</li>
      <li>My face is smooth.</li>
      <li>When I took it off, my face was silky smooth and the flakiness was gone</li>
      <li>I was kinda worried that it would have a super strong lemon scent and irritate my skin/</li>
      <li>It worth you to buy it!~</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, a little tingly in a nice way, and my skin was luxuriously soft and brightened after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a great experience with the first box, I was very excited to try this Lemon mask, and expecting even more brightening results.</li>
      <li>like I said, if you are worried that the scent would be super lemon-y and burn your skin or eyes and make you tear up by getting into your nose DON&#x27;T WORRY.</li>
      <li>The masks are thin and a perfect fit.</li>
      <li>This one feels soothing but also very refreshing, especially on a humid day.</li>
      <li>I already try the other mask of beauty diary but this one is really working good!</li>
      <li>Not the same as nice review people did</li>
      <li>I have used three varieties of these masks so far and love all of them.</li>
      <li>This is the first brand of sheet masks I have tried and they have quickly become a skincare necessity for me.</li>
      <li>I did some research and found out Vitamin C is actually one of the best remedies for acne and dark spots</li>
      <li>/&gt;After I started using these masks, my face feels quenched, much more hydrated, therefore, less irritated and more prone to healthier and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Surprisingly it cut my oiliness down quite a bit.</li>
      <li>By far, this is the most cost effective masks AND has similar feels as the high end brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I squeezed the mask [very] lightly so the excess serum dripped back inside the bag then applied it to my face.</li>
      <li>If I leave it on longer than 20 minutes, or if I [gently!]</li>
      <li>Lightening fast delivery!</li>
      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Now I have a jar with serum that I can gently apply to my face after my toner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This vitamin C really brightens my skin.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t contain too much fragrance.</li>
      <li>Does seem to help with oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon - Also hydrating and brightening, but I didn&#x27;t feel it brightened as much as the Strawberry Yogurt version.</li>
      <li>Now the mask/serum has became an important part in my daily routine.</li>
      <li>Very fresh facial mask.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad i order this than the other one.</li>
      <li>I feel so relaxed and pampered when I put them on after a long day and my skin looks smooth and hydrated for days afterward.</li>
      <li>I have never used a sheet before, however, it works good, i only used two so far, the sheet its pretty big for my face, lots of serum that you have enough for your neck too.</li>
      <li>I love that this cuts down on oiliness and tightens pores without drying like a clay mask would.</li>
      <li>Plus the price here on Amazon is up to $5 cheaper than what these retail for in stores where I live!</li>
      <li>The only thing that can be better is to make the mask a lil smaller</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that when I start using a new facial product, the true consequences do not show until about after 2-3 weeks, so I will post another review in about 1~2weeks.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend saw me right after taking this one off and actually commented that my skin was much brighter.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to use it after a shower.</li>
      <li>It does moisturize well; however, I was expecting a little bit more because of all the reviews.</li>
      <li>This one on the other hand, easily absorbs into the skin, and nothing &#x27;peels&#x27; off when I rub my face with my fingers after I use the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and these</li>
      <li>I found this one to be the least soothing of the three I own.</li>
      <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t help much with my acne or acne scars, only brighten my whole face</li>
      <li>One box contains 10 masks - and each bag has full of fluid that does not dry up too soon on your face nor during storage.</li>
      <li>With the first mask I used, I had to keep rubbing the extra serum onto my neck and arms.</li>
      <li>The scent is very light, almost artificial because it does not smell like lemon - which is fine with me since I don&#x27;t care for citrus scents.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
      <li>i just wish my pimples would go away completely.</li>
      <li>It does not have natural lemon smelling but is like fragrance added.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting adult acne for years and the acne medication that I was using left my face flaky dry and full of acne scars.</li>
      <li>It certainly made me willing to try some other masks from the same maker.</li>
      <li>The bruise went away much faster than expected (1 week instead of the 2 weeks of normal recovery).</li>
      <li>am in my  30&#x27;s with extremely dry and sensitive skin, which turned me very picky</li>
      <li>My face is small so there are some issues with the fit.</li>
      <li>The scent is not overwhelming and it&#x27;s a lovely treat for the end of a long day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Especially when I have long day at work, stressed, during PMS or certain type of foods (unspecified and seems to change all the time), my face gets really really irritated so that I cannot use anything other than washing with water</li>
      <li>But for what I can tell so far, I will definitely be purchasing this again for the</li>
      <li>A package of the mask holds so much serum that I usually squeeze out much of the liquid into a little jar when I use it the first time.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive dry skin and a lot of products give me breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far and the fresh pimples on my face have virtually disappeared (meaning no scars - acne treatments usually get rid of the pimples but leaves scars)!</li>
      <li>I actually purchased My Beauty Diary black pearl masks first because of a lot of people claimed it worked for them.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this one long enough to really see any results other then softer skin</li>
      <li>of course your pimples wont go away magically, but it really gives your skin an energy against whatever bad stuff for your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used three varieties of these masks so far and love all of them. I feel so relaxed and pampered when I put them on after a long day and my skin looks smooth and hydrated for days afterward. I&#x27;ve got very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and these do not cause me irritation, break me out, or make me oily. My face is small so there are some issues with the fit. The chin area will not stay adhered to my face no matter what I do (it&#x27;s just too big for me) so I always end up with essence dripping all over the place, but I just pat it over my neck and chest so nothing is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More details about the masks I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strawberry Yogurt - Very hydrating (not greasy), does a great job of brightening. My boyfriend saw me right after taking this one off and actually commented that my skin was much brighter. I found this one to be the least soothing of the three I own. Does seem to help with oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon - Also hydrating and brightening, but I didn&#x27;t feel it brightened as much as the Strawberry Yogurt version. My face looked very smooth after using this. Surprisingly it cut my oiliness down quite a bit. Very soothing and comforting, feels wonderful on the skin. I feel like I&#x27;m at a spa when I use this one because it feels so luxurious on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Apple- Wonderful at oil control. I love that this cuts down on oiliness and tightens pores without drying like a clay mask would. This one feels soothing but also very refreshing, especially on a humid day. It is also hydrating but does not brighten as well as the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably try other varieties once these are done and will add reviews of those as well. They might seem pricey but I use one every 3-4 days so the cost really isn&#x27;t that bad. Plus the price here on Amazon is up to $5 cheaper than what these retail for in stores where I live! This is the first brand of sheet masks I have tried and they have quickly become a skincare necessity for me.</li>
    <li> I have never used a sheet before, however, it works good, i only used two so far, the sheet its pretty big for my face, lots of serum that you have enough for your neck too.</li>
    <li> Not as good as had hoped! The other viewers were correct in that there is plenty of serum in this mask, but so far I have yet to see any brightening effects. This was after a few weeks of use. It does moisturize well; however, I was expecting a little bit more because of all the reviews.</li>
    <li> This mask is great. It smells nice, brightens and softens my face, and just feels nice &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because this mask can be a little irritating to my crazy-sensitive skin if I&#x27;m not careful. If I leave it on longer than 20 minutes, or if I [gently!] rub all the remaining liquid into my face at once (instead of rubbing a little, waiting a little, rubbing a little, waiting a little, etc til it&#x27;s gone), it will make my face a little red and itchy for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very good mask that does what it claims, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lemon mask for about 2 weeks &amp; it&#x27;s very soothing and moisturizing. No adverse reactions and no irritation. The scent is not overwhelming and it&#x27;s a lovely treat for the end of a long day.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous different kinds of facial masks from very expensive brands (s*****, l* ***, **2) to those sold in drugstores as well as being a stapled member of facial spa salons. By far, this is the most cost effective masks AND has similar feels as the high end brands.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my  30&#x27;s with extremely dry and sensitive skin, which turned me very picky or I would rather say skeptical/suspicious about skin products.&lt;br /&gt;Especially when I have long day at work, stressed, during PMS or certain type of foods (unspecified and seems to change all the time), my face gets really really irritated so that I cannot use anything other than washing with water only.&lt;br /&gt;After I started using these masks, my face feels quenched, much more hydrated, therefore, less irritated and more prone to healthier and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I use these about twice a week. One box contains 10 masks - and each bag has full of fluid that does not dry up too soon on your face nor during storage. It certainly made me willing to try some other masks from the same maker.</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t contain too much fragrance. It moisturizes my skin well in Colorado&#x27;s dry air. Highly recommend to use it after a shower.</li>
    <li> it is ok and it works</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m one of those people who have troublesome skin: with no-oil products, my skin breaks out with whiteheads. With regular moisturizers, my skin breaks out with blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been finally bringing my skin under control with the help of an aesthetician, but still struggle with blemishes once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other skin-tone-evening masks in the past, where it felt as if  \\&quot;gunks\\&quot; were left on my skin to make it temporarily look shiny. This one on the other hand, easily absorbs into the skin, and nothing &#x27;peels&#x27; off when I rub my face with my fingers after I use the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 uses in a week, my skin definitely seems brighter and even-toned, not only immediately following use, but the day after and etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not feel too oily, for my skin would have broken out with blackheads if it was.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that when I start using a new facial product, the true consequences do not show until about after 2-3 weeks, so I will post another review in about 1~2weeks. But for what I can tell so far, I will definitely be purchasing this again for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The masks DO come with a lot of serum like the other reviews said: I don&#x27;t necessarily squeeze it out into a jar like other customers suggested, but just wear the mask for about 30 minutes instead. This mask definitely needs to be worn lying down though, or the serum will drip towards your chin due to gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is very well made in terms of its shape: it comes with many cuts at the corners so that certain areas will overlap but will ensure that all areas of the face will be covered perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far and the fresh pimples on my face have virtually disappeared (meaning no scars - acne treatments usually get rid of the pimples but leaves scars)! The masks are thin and a perfect fit. Also they are dripping with serum. With the first mask I used, I had to keep rubbing the extra serum onto my neck and arms. By the second one, I opened the package and squeezed the serum out into a jar. The mask was still wet after the squeezing. Now I have a jar with serum that I can gently apply to my face after my toner. The scent is very light, almost artificial because it does not smell like lemon - which is fine with me since I don&#x27;t care for citrus scents. The MBD mask does a lot more for me than the clay masks I&#x27;ve been using. I noticed an overall brightening effect the next morning and my older blemishes are fading away slowly. Don&#x27;t expect this to be a quick fix to troubled skin - but I can see how long term use of this can help skin look healthier. I&#x27;m so glad I tried these paper masks!</li>
    <li> This mask is so affordable and refreshing. It&#x27;s also scenty and last me quite a while for 10pcs. Easy to put on and take off, no fuss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting adult acne for years and the acne medication that I was using left my face flaky dry and full of acne scars. I actually purchased My Beauty Diary black pearl masks first because of a lot of people claimed it worked for them. Well, it didn&#x27;t help much with my acne or acne scars, only brighten my whole face and that&#x27;s not exactly what I want because I&#x27;m already really pale. I did some research and found out Vitamin C is actually one of the best remedies for acne and dark spots and so I decided to try this mask out. Each masks come individually in a separate plastic bag. There was a lot of serum inside the bag and the mask was soaked in this serum that it dripped when I pulled it out of the bag. I squeezed the mask [very] lightly so the excess serum dripped back inside the bag then applied it to my face. I sealed the bag with tape and put it in the fridge, thinking it would be a waste to throw away all that serum. When I took it off, my face was silky smooth and the flakiness was gone but I didn&#x27;t nothing any difference with the dark spot. Disappointed I went to sleep. The next morning I was shocked when I looked at myself in the mirror. All the dark spots were faded significantly and even my active acne were shrunk down in size. I literally pulled the bag which contained the remaining serum from my fridge and kissed it! I then ordered some amber glass bottles with dropper to store the remaining serum in the fridge so I can apply it to my face on the nights I don&#x27;t use the mask (vitamin C serum tends to go bad if exposed to light). Now the mask/serum has became an important part in my daily routine. I even stopped using my acne medication all together. Just after a month, 98% of my acne is gone and my acne scars have faded over 70%! I got ton of compliment from everybody!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the summary of my nightly routine:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash face with BB Cleanser from Skin79 &lt;--- This cleanser detoxes my skin from all the dirt and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use MBDLemon Vit-C mask on Sun and Wed (skip this step on the remaining days)&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream  &lt;--- This cream helps speeding up my skin&#x27;s recovery&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum  &lt;--- This serum helps with a few wrinkle I had under my eyes and increases the effectiveness of any cream/serum I use.&lt;br /&gt;5) Apply the remaining serum from MBD Lemon Vit-C mask (I still apply serum even on Sun and Wed, after I have applied the mask)</li>
    <li> Very fresh facial mask.  It actually makes your skin brighter. The only thing that can be better is to make the mask a lil smaller I couldn&#x27;t keep the mask from my nose to top lip in place. But out of everything I would recommend fits good everywhere else!</li>
    <li> I purchased these My Beauty Diary Lemon Vit-C masks through ShopDeal as well as a box of Caviar masks from another seller, CP Cosmetics. I dug into the Caviar masks first and love them! Very moisturizing, a little tingly in a nice way, and my skin was luxuriously soft and brightened after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a great experience with the first box, I was very excited to try this Lemon mask, and expecting even more brightening results. The mask is comfortable, and the serum is pleasant feeling, but I didn&#x27;t feel any tingle and didn&#x27;t notice much after use. Yes, it was relaxing, but didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did take the time to compare my two boxes and noticed that the packaging for this mask is different than the other masks I&#x27;ve seen. After a bit of research, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that these are knock-offs. The outer package looks the same, but the mask pouches themselves don&#x27;t have the signature design of My Beauty Diary Masks. The pouch just mimics the box ... if you are wary of fakes that you might try another seller. I will keep using these masks to see if I get any result. So far, I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
    <li> I give this mask only one star because the smell is fairly poor. Other My Beauty Diary Masks - Caviar, Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid - smell wonderful. I want to love this mask, but the smell isn&#x27;t superb - doesn&#x27;t smell like lemons, and it was a task to have it on my face</li>
    <li> It works for acne skin. Really smooth after applying that. Recommend this one!!!</li>
    <li> That really good product for me ! it makes me whitening and get a best skin,when i was used it ,</li>
    <li> I already try the other mask of beauty diary but this one is really working good! I am so glad i order this than the other one.</li>
    <li> It is the most effective thing. My face is smooth. It worth you to buy it!~ I really love it!</li>
    <li> This company makes great facial masks!!! I luv the feeling of using them. So fresh and make ur skin flawless!!! &lt;3</li>
    <li> This mask is awesome!!!  I have very sensitive dry skin and a lot of products give me breakouts.  This line of products has been working wonderfully, saving my skin from the harsh winter weather in Colorado.  A package of the mask holds so much serum that I usually squeeze out much of the liquid into a little jar when I use it the first time.  So when I&#x27;m finished with the mask, I dunk it into the jar for use.  Most of the time, I can get 3 uses out of each mask.  It makes such a difference when I put on makeup these days.  No more flakiness and my skin look so dewy all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin C really brightens my skin.  Couple weeks ago my German Shepherd puppy gave me a black eye by whacking a rope ball around.  After researching that Vitamin C helps with fading bruises, I put it on whenever I can.  The bruise went away much faster than expected (1 week instead of the 2 weeks of normal recovery).</li>
    <li> It does not have natural lemon smelling but is like fragrance added. Not the same as nice review people did</li>
    <li> Lightening fast delivery! I love the mask and it has ample solution in it.  I use a small amount out of package before using the mask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; and there is still plenty on the mask. It leaves my skin silky smooth.  thanx</li>
    <li> i love this product! i can tell that my skin has improve a lot. my skin seems like it&#x27;s fighting against my pimples. of course your pimples wont go away magically, but it really gives your skin an energy against whatever bad stuff for your skin. i just wish my pimples would go away completely. and this product gave me hope.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent. And I think it doesn&#x27;t help at all with my acne prone skin. I tried the 3rd one last night. Hopefully it will give me some better resolves after the 10th times.</li>
    <li> I was kinda worried that it would have a super strong lemon scent and irritate my skin/burn my eyes/nose but it doesn&#x27;t! I haven&#x27;t been using this one long enough to really see any results other then softer skin but I&#x27;m sure I will because I&#x27;ve tried other My Beauty Diary products and they are great :)&lt;br /&gt;But like I said, if you are worried that the scent would be super lemon-y and burn your skin or eyes and make you tear up by getting into your nose DON&#x27;T WORRY. It honestly smells like Sprite or 7-up soda and the box doesn&#x27;t show it but the little packages have lemons AND limes.</li>
