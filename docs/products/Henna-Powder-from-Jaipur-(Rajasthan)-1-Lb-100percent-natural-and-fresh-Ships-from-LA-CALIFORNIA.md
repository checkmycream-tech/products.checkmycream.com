      <li>This henna makes nice hair color.</li>
      <li>Nice quality.</li>
      <li>jamaican hibiscus) flowers, lime juice and warm water...</li>
      <li>I also liked the money I saved by buying bulk on Amazon.</li>
      <li>After blending, I transfer mix to a ziplock bag and let it sit in a warm spot (sunny window) for about 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>I filtered and used the henna as an art medium not as hair dye, great rich color, it works well for my use.  </li>
      <li>This is a very great product, very fine, and it is 100% pure henna.</li>
      <li>and it was very good from the first time i used it</li>
      <li>This is good quality henna that ships quickly and for a fair price.  </li>
      <li>This henna is very good quality, finely sifted and gave me a headful of beautiful red hair.</li>
      <li>Not the right product for dying hair (&amp;#34;PURE henna powder&amp;#34; from them is great for that), but I use this mix as a shampoo alternative</li>
      <li>The powder is very fine.  </li>
      <li>My mother has 4C, very fine kinky hair.]</li>
      <li>,it treated my hair for about three times using it,i prepared the henna with tea,olive oil,and egg then let it for about three hours after that i put it on my head for not less than 6 hours and the result was excellent coloring and texture,</li>

      <li>Buying anything in bulk is always better because it&#x27;s always on hand even when you run out of money.</li>
      <li>that did not yield much better results either...</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>

      <li>but otherwise ok.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>At this price and this quality I will never buy henna elsewhere! :)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The quality of the henna was GR8!!!! I didnt know what to expect at first, but it is just simply excellent. I will continue to order from this person...KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!!! THANK YOU SOOOOOOO MUCH!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful seller!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received my package of Henna Powder quickly and professionally packaged.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is fresh and finely sifted.&lt;br /&gt;I will definetly keep purchasing my Henna from them.</li>
    <li> This henna makes nice hair color. Just add more coffee and tea for darker color. Also I add fresh lemon juice and soak henna at least 3 hours.</li>
    <li> It has henna in it, but it is by no means pure. Like other reviewers said, it is indeed very gritty. You can&#x27;t really notice while it&#x27;s dry, but you can once it&#x27;s wet and especially when you&#x27;re rinsing it out. Took some time to get all of it out of my hair, I had what I&#x27;m assuming is sand in my scalp for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you mix it up it doesn&#x27;t turn the characteristic green of henna, it&#x27;s pretty much just brown and no matter what you do to it, it doesn&#x27;t change color. It has only the faintest smell of henna and it took half the bag to get it to the correct consistency, and then it was almost like a very thick and heavy gelatin, rather than more mud-like like most henna I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will very weakly dye skin if you leave a good puddle of it on there for long enough, however I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair at all. Over all I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on it. Now I have to figure out what to do with the other half of the bag.</li>
    <li> We were glad to have found this item online. However, the quality of the powder wasn&#x27;t as good as it could be. We still had to sift all of it to get the finest grains, which resulted in nearly half the powder being wasted. Also, after mixing with eucalyptus oil, it didn&#x27;t give the dark color we expected. Wish they had some finer powder and one that gave a darker color.     For the shipping and handling, it was top notch. The item arrived just 3 days after we purchased it. We were happy with the service we received.</li>
    <li> I bought this henna as a cheap alternative to dying my hair the healthy natural way. I was starting to get slight allergic reactions to chemically coloring my hair and decided that this would be a nice substitute. You can add to that the fact that my hair was becoming overly damaged and it was prone to breakage and had a lot of split ends. It doesn&#x27;t help that I have a thyroid problem and as such I was loosing a lot of hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to go online and find natural ways of strengthening my hair and making it healthier and less breakage prone. I came upon a link that said that henna makes hair stronger and over time it aids in the hair growth of your hair. I decided to buy it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert! I have been using henna for at least 6 months now, and for the first 4 months I was using this product. I must say it did dry out my hair a bit when I first applied it, but I already knew it would do that, so I would do a deep conditioning treatment right after hennaing to make my hair less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after 6-10 months of using henna I can safely state that henna has more than met my expectations. Where before I had a lot of split ends now I see a few here and there( my hair was very damaged and I straighten my hair every other day), and before I started to use henna my average hair growth was around 1/2 inch every month now its 1 to 1 1/2 inch every month(my new hair growth shows my gray hairs). I don&#x27;t notice as much hair loss as before and my hair is now very thick and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you might want to know what the coloring effects were for the henna and well it would dye my natural dark brown hair a deep auburn and the chemically colored hair would turn auburn, my whites turn a nice coppery red, they look more like highlights than anything and over time, they blend with the rest of the hair. At first my hair looks a bit reddish orange but over the next 2 days it oxidizes to the colors stated above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: THIS IS MAINLY IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT BELOW but this response also goes to anyone that wants to color their hair with henna, please NEVER use any hair lightening products anywhere near a month or 2 before you use henna specially not if your using indigo in your mix. Henna mixed with indigo may turn your hair a moss green. In regards to mixing the henna, I always mix the powder with anything that I know is acidic. Examples would be lemon juice, orange juice, and cranberry juice. I actually mix my powder with warm cranberry juice, mix the juice with the henna powder until its thick and not runny kind off like creamy cream cheese, I dont want to have it run down my face and neck half way through the coloring process. After letting it release the color for 4-6 hrs even over night, I mix in some honey, jojoba oil and avocado oil. I then apply it all over my hair and make sure I pile it on top of my head and cover it with a shower cap or something similar for 3 hours. Finally I rinse the heck out of my hair and make sure I remove all of the henna, use conditioner to loosen the henna particles in my hair and don&#x27;t use shampoo for 2 days to let the color set and deep condition it. My color ends up looking auburn in the sunlight with red highlights caused by my grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair comes out slightly dry, try washing your hair again, and after all the henna particles are off your hair, you will notice that your hair is thicker and noticeably stronger</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002QHB51S Henna Powder from Jaipur (Rajasthan) 1 Lb 100% natural and fresh Ships from LA CALIFORNIA]]  The quality of this henna is much, much better than I expected for the price. It gave my hair a good dark orange stain that darkened to a rich auburn after a few days. You will need to lightly sift it if you are planning to use it for tattoo&#x27;s, but it does stain the skin a dark orange color(I had a hole in my glove). I will order this product again. Added bonus: My order arrived in only three days!  Edit 10/2011 When I ordered the second time from this company, the price had gone up and the quality of the the henna had gone down. There were more stems and twigs in the powder and it took forever for dye release. I am now using Jamila henna. It works every time.</li>
    <li> So far, the henna hasn&#x27;t dyed the skin at all.  I&#x27;m trying new recipes and letting them sit longer, but my hopes are low.  If I get it to work, I&#x27;ll change my review.</li>
    <li> I´m very pleased with this henna, is finely grounded, dark green color, deep herbal odor. When I prepared muy henna paste, it turned out really smooth, like cream, no lumps at all (I added powder clove,lemons juice and water) so it was really easy to apply. It stained almost inmediately (I try a little on my leg and apreciated a little orange stain right away).</li>
    <li> This Henna was of really great quality. I used it to color my hair and got fantastic results. The  amount you get for the price is a great deal!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  Powder is fine, shipping was fast, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a 1lb/500g bag.  I used black tea instead of just water and got a dye release after two hours. OH, and just for the record, I never give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This powder is very good. I mixed it with Indigo to dye my hair. My hair turns out to be beautiful natural black. I love it. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002QHB51S Henna Powder from Jaipur (Rajasthan) 1 Lb 100% natural and fresh Ships from LA CALIFORNIA]]The seller did not post any details about this henna powder. And rightly so. This henna has such a low dye content that it gives a very light orange blond color to grey hair. And you cannot get a significantly darker result either by mixing in some indigo or by following up with pure indigo. This is definitely my worst buy of the year 2011.</li>
    <li> I wanted to return to using henna for hair color and I am very glad I placed my order here. Henna arrived in about 5 days after placing order and it worked beautifully on my hair, exactly how I anticipated - turned darker next day after coloring and covered gray, too. My hair already feels much more alive, it definitely is worth this while (have to keep it on the head for five hours), but what a delight afterwards. The package will keep me going right now at least couple/three times more, though, because my hair is rather short at the moment. And I will definitely use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I used the product for my hair and I loved the results! I was also pleasantly surprised at how quick the product came to me. I have made other purchases from All India Store and will continue to be a frequent customer.</li>
    <li> The price is good for what the amount of henna you get but the quality seems quite subpar.  First off, you can see a lot of debris in the powder, so sifting is necessary.  Also the dye release was not very good.  I do not know if this from the quality or if I got an old batch but I kept this on my hair for five hours and it barely made a color change.  I will be choosing a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me, turned out a dark red. The shipping was fast. However, I thought was just 100% pure henna instead it had a couple other ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. This is the thrd time I&#x27;ve used this place and I LOVE it. The Henna is really fine. Perfect for body art or hair. I mixed it with just lemon juice until the consistency of yogurt. I let it sit in a dark, warm place overnight and added to my hair the next day. Three hours later, I washed it out in the shower. It took three days to darken and now it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> the service, price, and quality of product i received was fantastic. i will deffinetly be ordering from this provider again! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered this twice before and I&#x27;m getting ready to order for a third time. Turns my lightish brown hair into a fantastic, natural looking red. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought the bulk 5lb henna because the price is right, and the henna reviews from this seller (whether for the 5lb henna or the 1lb henna) are mostly positive.  Whilst I think that mixed with an acidic liquid that this product is a good conditioner, I have yet to see a dye release after 2 attempts/on separate occasions of mixing the henna.  HOWEVER, I put the henna on my mother&#x27;s 1/2 gray hair, and it DID dye her grays a lighter, golden orange...I was quite skeptical too, because after letting the henna sit for 12+ hours on the low setting of a heat cap, I could  not see any type of dye release, whatsoever.    Some positives are that the seller actually shipped in a timely manner and provided instruction on how to use the henna.    Usually, I purchase from hennaforhairdotcom.  I have always loved their quality, especially the finer sift of henna, but their prices are a bit steep for me at this time, seeing how I henna every few months.  I had blended hennaforhair&#x27;s fine sift of henna with the blonde henna, and my hair felt like straw.      My mixture of All India Store&#x27;s henna and apple cider vinegar (plus spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, red pepper) seemed to help a lot with ridding my hair of the straw-like texture.  (Note: blonde henna seems to get mixed reviews, as a lot of people had said it makes their hair feel like straw.)  However, I didn&#x27;t find it odd that my hair wasn&#x27;t radiating with color like it normally does when I henna; what I thought was dye release was just the color of the spices.    For my second try, I have been \\&quot;marinating\\&quot; my henna from All India Store for first 5 and then 12+ hours (as mentioned above), and I still have no dye release.  I sifted all the henna by hand too, and I have been hoping for nearly a month to use it on my mother (a senior citizen).  I bought the squeeze bottle, the shower caps, heat cap, the lemon juice, and sifted the pulp out of orange juice just so that my mother has a pleasant henna experience.    I&#x27;m using indigo now, from thespiceworks on ebaydotcodotuk.  I will see if her hair will actually turn out black in the end. Fingers Crossed.    [In case there are questions, I have 3C curls and fine curly/kinky hair.  My mother has 4C, very fine kinky hair.]</li>
    <li> I received this henna VERY quickly and their customer service is always top notch. For these reasons Im very conflicted because the product itself is not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I am quite experienced with Henna products. I used it for years, took some time off and found that chemical dyes were destroying my hair and recently decided to return. Because funds a bit low I thought that this might be a better alternative to what I normally would get via hennaforhairdotcom. The dye release on this takes FOREVER. In fact I have yet to get a dye release when using my typically acidic (lemon juice and henna) mixture. The only way I was able to get a release was by using hot water and typically you do not want to use this mixture on body or hair because it fades to a dull orange rather than oxidizing and growing more vibrant over the coming days as it would with an acidic mixture. Typically Indian henna should only require between 4-6 hours in release time, longer if kept in the fridge. I had to sit this out for over 24 hours with the acidic mixture and nothing came of it. At this point the concern is the demise of the dye which typically can occur at about 24 hours of the mixtures creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixture was VERY gritty as well which typically denotes henna which was mixed with dyed sand. Im not saying that is the case here but that is the typical reason for a gritty mixture.&lt;br /&gt;The color that I received is ok...I wont complain about that as my hair is a bit out of shape to begin with after much abuse.&lt;br /&gt;Overall while I was very hopeful that this would work out I&#x27;m afraid I will not be purchasing from here again.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that perhaps I just received a bad batch because everything else about the company was really top notch.....</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on September 1, 2010 and received this product by September 3, 20, so I was very pleased to get my product so soon. I&#x27;m a Black woman and have very thick hair and I&#x27;ve used henna years ago and it, stregthened my hair and made my hair very healthy and grew it out longer than it had been in a few years, so I knew what to expect from henna use, I was looking to try it again for the same purposes, this one was not as strong as the henna I had years ago because my hair is naturally black and was color treated and the natural hair colored section of my hair(new growth) didn&#x27;t really change at all, but it covered my gray and the color treated section with use of chemical color was changed to a reddish aurburn color that is great for the fall and over the course of two hair washes it toned down quite a bit. My prior use with henna colored my natural black hair color as well and this one didn&#x27;t and this one made my hair a little dry but I remedied that with a hot oil treatment, so it wasn&#x27;t as stronged as I&#x27;d liked or needed it to be but overall it was ok and my hair is healthier than it would be if I were using chemical color</li>
    <li> The service, price, and quality of product is just great. I would deffinetly be ordering from this provider again.&lt;br /&gt;I used the henna for my hair very great even color, I added black henna to this one I got rich black color.&lt;br /&gt;It colored my hair but not my skin. I love it!!! I am ordering my next one!</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair with henna a few years ago, and absolutely loved it. However, the store where I bought it had to close, and I was left without. Being from southern Ohio, there is nowhere within 50 miles that has pure, natural henna. I was excited to find this on Amazon and ordered it right away. It arrived quickly, and I mixed up a small sample (vinegar and peach blossom tea)in order to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t turn my hair green. This can sometimes happen over hair that has already been dyed, is a sign of metals in the henna, and a very bad thing. I took hair from my brush, saturated it with the dye, and let it sit for three hours. Joy of joys, a lovely red! I applied my henna mixture to my entire head the next day, and (after oxidization) now have a lovely deep coppery red. Thank you so much for helping me love my hair color and protect my hair&#x27;s length! I will surely come back to this company for more when I need to reorder.</li>
    <li> My henna powder arrived early and was well packaged.  The product is the correct color for raw henna powder instead of the dyed green color you get with cheap(fake or mixed) henna.  Dye release was quick and potent.  This henna gave my hair a rich red color instead of the pale orangish color stale or dilluted hennas sometimes give.  I am unsure of how it would dye on skin but it did do a great job of dying any exposed skin a rich deep orange for a couple of days.    Very quality product, will buy again!</li>
    <li> I received my henna in a very timely manner, however, my package did not include instructions.  Could someone please tell me how to mix it.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using henna and it turned out great.  I mixed the henna powder with lemon juice, apple cidar vinegar and a little water.  It took about 2 days for the dye to release.</li>
    <li> I filtered and used the henna as an art medium not as hair dye, great rich color, it works well for my use.  have not experimented much but i recommend as there was not much to filter out, no stems or hard bits,  seems to have a bit of green dye in it but no noticable sand.  little leaf bits here and there but otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> When I reviewed this henna shortly after originally purchasing it back in 2011, I rated it with only two stars, since it seemed that the color this henna produced in my hair was neither bright nor long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after more experiments with preparing the henna, I have had much better success. The trick seems to be to let the henna rest with the dye-releasing agent you are using for at least two days. When I do this, the henna makes my hair a deep and vibrant red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technique: I mix a quarter-cup of the henna with two teaspoons of instant coffee and three egg yolks. I put the mixture in the fridge for at least two days. The longer you leave the mixture, the more red the resulting color will be; a shorter time period produces a more brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re ready to apply the henna, add enough water to make the mixture the consistency you want. I like to apply the henna in the evening, wrap my head in plastic wrap and a shower cap, and sleep on it. (Put a towel over your pillow.) Then I can wash out the henna the next morning. I just rinse out the henna with water at this point, and then wash my hair with shampoo a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have figured out a technique for releasing the dyes in this henna, I am very satisfied with the product. The price is so reasonable, the texture is fine, and the color is really fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you the best of luck with your adventures in red.</li>
    <li> Ordered and received this within a week. The quality of the henna is remarkable--the mix texture, once the powder is blended with with hot water (no acid) is actually quite gelatinous, completely unlike the dull mud I&#x27;ve experienced with other manufacturers. I let the dye release for two hours, applied applied with a tint brush, left it on the hair for two hours, and am rewarded with a head full of burnished copper hair. I&#x27;m sure it will continue to oxidize and darken for the next few days, but even now, it&#x27;s positively glowing and strong and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know you want to use henna, understand that it is a permanent commitment, and want a henna that&#x27;s body-art-quality, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending.</li>
    <li> I received the henna very quickly.  This was my first time using henna, and I&#x27;ve used it twice since I received it.  I love it.  It mixes very smoothly and rinses easily.  My first henna came out as a light copper on my grays, which was fine with me.  My second henna came out as a darker burnished copper.  I didn&#x27;t see any grit or twigs.  The powder is very fine.  I would order from them again.  I ordered two pounds on my first order, so it will be a little while before I need any more, but would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> WOW! I started using henna about two months ago - my first try was amazing so I was ready to try this henna in bulk and add it to my weekly hair regime! I was about to buy the 1lb Rajasthani recommended by natural hair bloggers however I found this at a much cheaper price and decided to try it! Wow! Was I in for a &#x27;treat&#x27;! The dye took forever to be released - I dont think it ever really released - very very very light - I just &#x27;smooshed&#x27; it on to my hair because I already took the time and trouble to mix it! I live in the Caribbean so I decided to take another reviewers advice and put it out in the sun for a while - nothing much happened...I also tried mixing it within an infusion of sorrel (jamaican hibiscus) flowers, lime juice and warm water...that did not yield much better results either...I am about to try it again - third time for this 1lb results - I hope I get some improvement!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews on Amazon for this product I ordered hoping for good results as this was the first time I have used henna on my hair. I could not be happier with the way my hair turned out. I started with ultra blonde, very long, overly processed hair and was a little worried about the results. I was willing to take a chance on henna just to get away from all of the chemicals. This henna worked GREAT! I did a test sample of hair and loved the color. This henna is very good quality, finely sifted and gave me a headful of beautiful red hair. I read the other reviews about not getting a dye release or having to re-sift this henna and I did not find any problems. I will continue to order from this seller. At this price and this quality I will never buy henna elsewhere! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used henna on my hair before. This product left no color whatsoever when I left it on my hair for 4 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used henna for a long time and this product i would rate as a very good quality. The only one issue is that this one henna is rather hard to wash out.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this henna for hair~not gritty, colors within 1 hour. Henna is inherently a messy operation , but I&#x27;ve found this product rinses out easily with no grit residue and nice color.</li>
    <li> Item was promptly received, and worked well, BUT was QUITE GRITTY. There was A LOT of sand left over in my tub when i rinsed it out of my hair. Looked like I&#x27;d been at the beach...</li>
    <li> my wife put it on her hair, and the color was horrible , really didt like it&lt;br /&gt;so take it and put it on your own risk</li>
    <li> Easy to prepare, easy to wash off, fast dye release, beautiful color too. I am very happy with the overall results!!</li>
    <li> I loved dying my hair with this product mixed with indigo. The only organic way to dye our hair!  Highly recommended if you want to get rid of chemicals!</li>
    <li> This is the best quality henna I have ever bought. The fine powder was completely free of twiggy bits. My own preference is to mix it up with hot (not boiling) coffee and a tablespoon of vinegar, along with some cinnamon (for the scent). The consistency was just right for covering my hair with almost no spatter - only a little on the sink I was leaning over. I usually have to mop up floor and even walls after applying to my long hair, but this stayed put very well. The color was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers said that they had to sift the powder but that was not my experience at all. And personally, I have never had success with the \\&quot;mix with lemon juice and leave overnight\\&quot; method, not with any of the various hennas I have tried. I have finally stopped trying as it&#x27;s a waste of henna in my experience. The above method works well for me and covers grey hairs nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and the price is certainly affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added later: two days after application the color is oxidizing to a lovely auburn as I would expect. I am not sure what problem people have with using hot water (or hot coffee, in my case) to mix henna, but I had excellent results with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added after a second order: I ordered this again, and I got the henna in a different packaging (the green cotton gas with handles). This time around the henna still worked as I described, but the henna itself seemed to have been dyed a very unreal blue-green color. When I washed the henna from my hair I could see the blue-green color in the suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the henna but distressed by the blue-green dye, which also seemed to trigger allergic reactions. I&#x27;ve never reacted to henna before.</li>
    <li> The henna was super - fresh and brightened my hair up quite nicely. It also came in the mail very quickly. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I used this for two events and the quality is great! It isn&#x27;t the darkest henna Ive used but its fresh, well sifted, and has last a long time. They were very quick to ship it out and it came with helpful tips.</li>
    <li> This is good quality henna that ships quickly and for a fair price.  I use henna to cover incoming grays.  I have very dark brown hair with red highlights, so henna blends in perfectly and looks natural.  My brown hair is pretty much unchanged by henna; only the grays are stained a vivid copper. This results in gorgeous copper highlights that blend beautifully.  TO USE: I mix enough henna to cover my roots in a plastic bowl (never use a metal bowl or spoon!) with tap water, a splash of lemon or lime juice, and cinnamon (for scent).  You want the mix to be a non-drippy paste.  After blending, I transfer mix to a ziplock bag and let it sit in a warm spot (sunny window) for about 24 hours.  To apply, I clip a tip off the bag and squeeze it on, using a rubber gloved hand to work it in.  I apply to wet, freshly shampooed, but not conditioned hair.  I cover with a shower cap and then a stocking cap (henna works best with warmth).  I rinse after 3 hours, using shampoo and lots of conditioner.  Henna stains rather orange at first but becomes more coppery after a couple days.  Warning to newbies: Henna is permanent!  It does not wash out and you CANNOT dye over it using home or salon hair coloring. The only way to remove it is to grow it out and chop. So do a strand test first.  Personally, I love henna.  It leaves my hair gorgeous: silky, vibrant, soft.  And I love that I&#x27;m not dumping toxic chemicals on my head every time I need a root job. But it isn&#x27;t for everyone. People with light colored hair or mostly grays will end up with very red hair. Which is fine, if that&#x27;s what you want.  Oh, and working with it becomes easier the more practice you have with it. My first experiences using henna were messy and awkward.  But now, I find working with henna about as stressful as throwing in a load of laundry.  It&#x27;s easy.  As for this particular henna, it&#x27;s great, and I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Been using henna for a long time, both on hair and on skin.  This stuff&#x27;s only so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I didn&#x27;t get a very good dye release.  I typically use a blend of black tea, lemon juice, and either cajeput or lavender oil (to \\&quot;terp\\&quot; the henna) for body art on skin, but because of the volume of henna mixed for the hair, terps are not recommended.  Also, since I was looking for a red color to my hair, I opted to omit the tea altogether and use a straight up mixture of plain lemon juice and henna.  This usually suffices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a glass bowl and plastic spoon, I mixed the lemon juice and the henna, covered the bowl in plastic, and allowed it to sit overnight.  In the morning I checked for dye release - hardly any.  So disappointed!  Tried a little to test on my skin - nothing.  (I should note that a similar test with Jamila will stain skin almost INSTANTLY.)  I put it in my hair, anyway, because henna is good for your hair and as long as I went to the trouble to mix it, figured even a neutral treatment would at least mitigate some of the disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixture was gritty.  Not a good indicator that it&#x27;s 100% pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did end up taking a bit of a red tint to it - but not nearly what it would have had actual dye release occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: spend the extra money and get body art quality Jamila henna.  It&#x27;s finely sifted, and the stain you&#x27;ll get both on hair and on skin is incomparable.</li>
    <li> For years, I was using another commercial henna product that worked fine but was very gritty and hard to rinse out. I decided to try this product for a change and was very pleased to find that it was a fine powder that rinsed easily out of my hair. The directions say to use a iron container and leave solution overnight which I ignored. I just boiled up some water, and mixed it it in a glass bowl along with a dash of apple cider vinegar and vanilla extract.The gray hair came out a bit lighter but I like the look and maybe in a few days, it will change a bit but it doesn&#x27;t matter. I also liked the money I saved by buying bulk on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this henna nearly two years ago and just made my last batch. I noticed a few reviews saying that they think sand or artificial dye was added to their batch. I never found any evidence at all in my batches that it is not pure henna. I add apple cider vinegar or black coffee plus a dash of oil and my henna paste is always smooth. I use this as hair color and as a conditioner. I get a nice deep red color in my hair each time. In short no complaints at all over the the course of about two years using this henna. The price is good and I hope I get the same quality when I buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product online before and paid twice the price. It is the same great quality with an affordable price. It covers my coarse gray hair very well.</li>
    <li> Much powder is out of the package and I spend 8 bucks for package and postage, why it is so poor when it is shown to me!!!  Please be responsible..</li>
    <li> First, my hair is dark brown almost black, but i&#x27;ve got premature white hairs speckling my hair. these are BRIGHT WHITE hairs, not gray. Though a 2nd process of indigo would work better for me, i&#x27;ve been sticking with pure henna so far to better see how well henna covers, and also, because i&#x27;m a little morbidly interested in watching the progression of my white hair conversion.     the powder i received was finely milled, no twigs or sediment that i could find (as mentioned in a few reviews).  smelled fresh enough. i&#x27;ve used this henna at least 6-8 times now for root growth, and while it does color, it is a very light, almost blonde orange. previous henna powders gave me a medium red orange result.     of course, i&#x27;m trying to cover perfectly white hairs, a very difficult task with henna in general. this henna might be just fine for someone with lesser needs, though i do think the results on my white roots are a fair indication that the color strength is weaker than other hennas i&#x27;ve used.      while listed as 100% henna, i&#x27;ve noticed this powder has a smoother, slightly gel-like consistency than other henna powders i&#x27;ve used. it makes for nicer application, but it makes me wonder if the powder has a small amount of cassia obvovata (a natural herb for colorless conditioning). i&#x27;ve used this herb previously in between my henna colorings. while dry cassia looks and smells similar to henna, but when wetted it has a gel-like, slippery feel. cassia is a great natural conditioner, but if this powder has some mixed in it, then i could see why the color result might be diminished since cassia gives no color. this is purely me conjecturing, i can&#x27;t be sure that the product is mislabeled.    all in all an inexpensive, okay henna. it didn&#x27;t ruin my hair if you&#x27;re worried about that, but it gives mediocre color. better for light washes of color rather than gray coverage or intensely colored hair.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but I was so happy with this henna that I had to write something.  I have never used henna before and was so nervous about trying it that I even put it off for several years.  After all the warnings and poor reviews, I finally decided on this henna, and it was perfect!  It is a tiny bit darker than I would have preferred (I am naturally a strawberry-blonde/dirty blondish with white at the temples) but very close to the red hair I had as a child.  It was pretty simple to use:  Mix 200g henna with 2 cups of lemon juice, leave it out in the hot Florida sun until it starts turning brown, then slop it on, leave for approximately 3 hours, and then RINSE, RINSE, and RINSE some more.  It was a gorgeous light red that finally oxidized to a pretty auburn, and all my natural highlights and shadows are still there.  I came back to this seller, hoping they carried indigo so I could use the henna/indigo mix on my roommate&#x27;s hair, but they don&#x27;t appear to carry it :(    Oh, well.  I will definitely be back to buy more henna when I eventually run out, and at only 25g every month or so for the roots, that might be a while.  Talk about a bargain!  Thanks, All India Store!</li>
    <li> Nice quality. I used for hair. But overpriced :). I propose there should be some sort of discount on larger quantity.</li>
    <li> i have bought henna in 5 lb bag now for a few years from this seller and am never disappointed. it always ships very fast and always works well. i use enough pineapple juice-canned, 4 or so small cans to mix with amaretto liquer-1/4 cup and the henna powder. for my medium length thick wavy hair i use about 3 cups of henna. sounds weird works fine. smells nice too. i leave mixture covered with saran wrap,in a ceramic bowl overnight-11 or so hours. i section my hair and generously blop it on. i cover my head with wrap too for 3hrs or so. rinses out with a nice shower then conditioner like v05 vanilla mint cheap stuff several times over. works for me and is worth the time and effort. i have silky beautiful hair, the color is magnificent. i redo the roots about 3wks or glop it on again monthly. i stopped using chemicals 3 years ago and my hair and i love the results!! try it, it wont make your hair feel dry and crispy. i get plenty of compliments on my hair, what a difference from my previously dry dull hair with chemical dyes. thanks to AllIndiaStore wonderful product,fast shipping, great value, and service too!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I recently purchased the henna from Parashs, and it is amazing! The dye release took only about 3 hours, and let a super dark orange stain on my hand in only 3 hours of leaving the paste on. This is a very great product, very fine, and it is 100% pure henna. Also, the packaging date was April 2012! Henna&#x27;s good for 2 years so I got some super fresh henna. I DEFINITELY will buy from Parashs again, and I couldn&#x27;t be more please.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product. Everything in the description of the product was well displaced into the received product.</li>
    <li> Great color for hair, seems to last about as long as any other henna I have tried, so for the price, go for it!</li>
    <li> This is a good henna for coloring the hair.Just add water and mix and you are ready to go. It was delivered well packaged. If you don&#x27;t already know how to mix henna powder this brand may not work for you because instructions are not included.</li>
    <li> This product came inside a cloth bag contained in two separate plastic bags.  When mixed with warm water and citric acid there is no result, even after sitting for 8 and then 24 hours.  I tried this product on samples of my hair that I collected after washing my hair.  After 24 hours and two attempts at changing the hair color there was a slight change of color which is reddish/brown to a more yellowish tone but this is a just noticeable difference.  This product should have been sealed in a UV proof package which may be why I got the results I did.  The product could just be old and no longer working as it should.  Then again judging by the color that the product produced it may be that it was neutral henna.  Wikipedia --  &amp;#34;So-called &amp;#34;neutral henna&amp;#34; does not change the color of hair. This is not henna powder; it is usually the powder of the plant Senna italica also known as Cassia obovata or a closely related Cassia species.&amp;#34;  I kept the mixed product in the refrigerator and tried to get a color release using vinegar, pure lemon juice with no results.  The product smelled like Spinach or grass clippings with vinegar and was tossed out.</li>
    <li> At 44 years old I am 95% gray all of it on top and front! Started graying out at age 9 natural color was a redhead and darkened to auburn.  I had gone to a salon to have it colored - level 3 ended up with hot roots and after 11 different times of trying to correct the problem with them I gave up.  I then went to a cosmetology school and they did correct the problem - However after 13 bad dye jobs in less than 7 months... my hair was fried, damaged, straw like thought I would just be gray forever.  I remembered something about Henna and did some research and found this.  Gave it a try... ordered, it was really green by earthy smelling.  My mix:  Henna, lemon juice, 4 red zinger teabags in 1 cup boiling water - cooled, 2 tablespoons cinnamon and ground cloves to settle the smell down a bit.  Let it sit overnight in a few feet from a space heater for about 12 hours.  Make more than you think you will need... I didn&#x27;t and had enough just for the roots.  I made it a little too thick... like mashed potatoes consistency - my hair sucked it up.  I didn&#x27;t bother doing a strand test, didn&#x27;t care what color it would be and just would have been happy with the conditioning aspect of it.  I let it sit on my head for 4 hours, had a garbage bag over it and put a heating pad on high wrapped around my head.  Rinsed, use lots of cheap conditioner to rinse it out... like rinsing a sandy mud pack out... I did not wash or use shampoo afterwards just rinse and rinse.... and rinse some more.  The result?  OMG!!!  BEAUTIFUL!!! JUST GORGEOUS!  Coppery Red - all gray is gone... looks natural... gray is highlights of beautiful coppery red immediately and if you read up... it will get a bit darker over the next couple of days.  It is shiny and gorgeous!  It has taken years off my appearance and I can&#x27;t stop smiling!  I don&#x27;t care if I have to do this once every two weeks... it is worth it!  My hair looks wonderful, feels wonderful and I smell like spice!  I wish I had bought more bags than just two as the price has gone up!  It is worth it!  I had spent so much money on bad dye jobs - home hair coloring, special shampoos and this was less than $20.00 and stuff I had in my fridge and cupboard already and just some time... my hair is soft, beautiful and looks brand new!  Thanks!  Henna needs warmth for the dye release and time.  Take your time... don&#x27;t expect a specific color and just enjoy what nature is giving you!  I will NEVER EVER go back to chemicals dyes again!  My hair loves Henna and it will stay that way!two as the price has gone up!  It is worth it!

    <li> I am very happy with the Henna I ordered.  It is the best quality I&#x27;ve used.  Also the web site had many tips left by customers which were very helpful.</li>
    <li> I let it sit on my type 4 hair over night and rinsed the following morning with cold water. It was great. However make sure you use gloves as it WILL leave your hands stained, after a few minutes for at least a week.</li>
    <li> This is high quality and finely ground.  The color is beautiful whether used for hair or skin.  It has a very nice earthy smell.</li>
    <li> This henna was extremely polished-i.e. full of dye.  Although this is a common problem with indian henna (oftentimes henna from india is processed with green dye to make it look &#x27;fresh&#x27;),  As soon as I added liquid to the powder it turned bright hunter green.  I tested it on my palm after 24 hrs and it didn&#x27;t stain very well.  I would not buy this again.  Learned my lesson!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have contacted the seller to ask about the problem (esp since I am not the only one coming accross it)  but I am apparently not computer savvy enough to figure out how.</li>
    <li> I use henna to dye my hair. I accidentally ordered this product when I&#x27;d forgotten that I&#x27;d ordered a more expensive version at another site. When I received it, I put it in the freezer, figuring I was stocked for at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it turns out that this henna is better quality than the more expensive version. The smell is not as strong, but after mixing it and letting it sit for a day, there was so much lawsone (the molecule which does the work of the dye), it had actually pooled on top of the paste. Mixing it back in was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most instructions I&#x27;ve used say you have to let it sit on your hair for four hours. Due to poor planning on my part, I had to wash it out after one and a half hours and figured I would redo it in another week. In the morning, it was clear that I wouldn&#x27;t. The color was strong, and there was no hint that my roots had only been dyed once while the remainder of my hair has been dyed multiple times. As a bonus, my hair was wonderfully conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair past my shoulders, and one-eighth of a pound was more than enough to dye all of it. With a pound, I expect it to last the rest of the year without a problem. When I&#x27;m out, I will order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering dying hair. This will give you the natural look and it is organic. If you can get a friend to help out, it will be the best. Save you a bundle!</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting/hoping to receive the Neha Herbal Mehandi shown in the customer image gallery. Instead, I received a generic plastic bag of green powder that won&#x27;t stain no matter what I try (I tested several batches using warm tea, warm coffee, distilled water, lemon juice, essential oils, unrefrigerated, refrigerated, timed from 3 to 48 hours and still waiting...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure it is henna, and it certainly isn&#x27;t fresh. I&#x27;ve had old henna in the past that had at least a light orange stain when prepared properly. This stuff turns brown immediately but leaves a greenish brown stain on my palm that washes away immediately. No hint of orange whatsoever. If it is henna, it&#x27;s completely dead, and if it&#x27;s not henna, then I certainly don&#x27;t want some mystery substance on my head or body. A big waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered through Simply Beautiful, only because it was fulfilled through Amazon Prime, and I wanted it delivered in 2 days so I could apply it this weekend. I didn&#x27;t think about it before I ordered, but there is no way to know which review is for which seller&#x27;s product unless it is specified in the review. Looking at these ratings again now, I would have chosen a seller who corresponded with  positive product reviews. Actually, I think from now on I will only order specific known brands, or body art quality (BAQ) with crop dates and known dye content. More expensive, but at least it won&#x27;t be money down the drain. This was my first bad experience ordering through Amazon; I hope it will be helpful for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I finally got a slight orange stain after 65 hours (lemon juice mixture). I believe it is henna, but it has a very low dye content and/or is old.</li>
    <li> I bough it in bulk so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out for a while- The price was also AMAZING. Quality is superb. extra fine sifted with minimal to no natural filaments (such as twigs, etc.- which i have gotten before with another company). Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna to dye my hair for more than 10 years and let me tell you - this is the best henna I&#x27;ve ever bought. The powder is very fine, and when mixed with water it produces very smooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I didn&#x27;t do anything special to release the dye - I just mixed about two ounces of henna with hot water to get a thick yogurt consistency, let the mixture to cool down a little, applied it on my wet hair, and left it on for about 3 hours. It rinses off very easily and does not leave my head full of sand and sawdust, like other products that I used before did.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair deep and vibrant color, and makes them smoother to the touch and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more of this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> As with all health and body care products on Amazon - always always always check the shipper you are purchasing from! The positive reviews you see on this item are for the original seller (All India Store) which sells the real deal. 100% henna, well sifted, no sand, excellent fast stain, double-packaged in foil to keep out light (NOT see-through plastic which leaks). I&#x27;ve purchased from each of the cheaper sellers as well and they send mixed product with little to no stain what-so-ever. Parashs sells the cheapest and even on the packaging it says it contains other ingredients (dyed my skin and hair dull yellow-orange). If you want the results shown in the customer&#x27;s pictures make sure to purchase from All India Store, it is worth the extra 5 dollars!</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I think some of these customers may NOT have purchased this product directly from the seller, which is a store called Mangup, shipped via Amazon. Please note: if you click on the \\&quot;featured merchants\\&quot; to get a different price, and you don&#x27;t buy from Mangup, you may not be getting the same product. I ordered the product featured on the main Amazon page and so this review is for what&#x27;s in the picture, which comes from Mangup. It arrived in a sealed green canvas bag with henna hand-painting designs on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of henna products, dyed my hair with various brands, and read a variety of sources to figure out how to prepare and apply it. This is basically an effective, cheap henna with a few minor cons (noted below). Please note that a pound is a lot, and henna works best when fresh. It does dry out over time, so if you leave it sitting around for a few months, it won&#x27;t work. Below are the pros and cons of this product as I used it, followed by my recipe and preparation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have very fine, blonde hair that doesn&#x27;t take synthetic/chemical dyes well (they wash out quickly). With this henna it&#x27;s a vibrant, even shade of orangey-red -- pretty much the classic henna color, but with blonde highlights showing through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very fine and already sifted, so it&#x27;s ideal for hair or body art (a lot of henna comes grainy, chunky etc., which is best sifted before use, otherwise it&#x27;s uncomfortable, messy, sticks to your head etc.)&lt;br /&gt;- Little to no mess (have you ever dyed your bathroom orange or covered it with henna sand?)&lt;br /&gt;- Almost no color bleeding after application (a lot of mixes with added dyes have incredible color but, with it, a lot of color loss)&lt;br /&gt;- Bright, intense henna color (kind of an orangey-red) after a little over 2 hours application&lt;br /&gt;- No hair loss, itchiness, or other allergic reactions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Clearly the henna powder was dyed green (how green your henna is has nothing to do with the resulting color, but some manufacturers dye it green for marketing reasons; so you can&#x27;t be sure of the source of added dyes or possible allergic reactions)&lt;br /&gt;- Henna should condition and strengthen your hair. This brand left my hair a little dry, certainly nowhere near as bad as synthetic/chemical dyes, but a little suspect nonetheless. Perhaps the henna was a little old, thinned out with sand, or maybe it&#x27;s a result of the added green dye. Or maybe I just put too much lemon juice in. Possibly, this could be fixed by adding more olive oil or other oils to the dye mix.&lt;br /&gt;- Related to the previous bullet, my hair should be shiny and lustrous after applying pure henna. I&#x27;ve deep-conditioned it twice with keratin conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t have as much shine as I like. The shine is what makes henna look like natural color and less synthetic/chemical. Again... could be that this would be remedied with a little more oil in the mix and/or less lemon juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method of Preparation:&lt;br /&gt;- Took 1 cup henna and put it in a plastic bowl. (This makes a lot of paste; I have a lot of hair but I could have done the job with .5 to .75/cup)&lt;br /&gt;- Added 1 egg (for binding)&lt;br /&gt;- Put in 1 tablespoon of olive oil to help the stuff coat hair and to add softness (might do more next time)&lt;br /&gt;- Added about 1/4 cup lemon juice (citric acid is necessary to bind with the red dye and bring it out, otherwise you might use the henna and not successfully dye anything at all)&lt;br /&gt;- Added a couple of tablespoons cold coffee (supposedly decreases brassiness in resulting color)&lt;br /&gt;- Added boiled water until the paste was about the consistency of yogurt, mixed well&lt;br /&gt;- Let sit at room temperature for 4-6 hours; you should see reddish liquid beading out of the green mush, a sign that color release is effective&lt;br /&gt;- Mixed paste again, applied first to roots, scalp line and nape of neck, then sections of hair, then piled it all up in a big goopy glob (USE GLOVES) while wearing a frumpy shirt&lt;br /&gt;- Covered head with plastic wrap for at least 2 hours&lt;br /&gt;- Rinsed, applied conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- Voilá!</li>
    <li> I ordered the henna because of the volume for the $$. I used the henna on my hair. The moment I opened the pkg and poured into my bowl I knew it was good quality. Once used on my hair, all I can say is OMG! I just fired my last henna supplier. This stuff is wonderful and the best quality seen on the market!</li>
    <li> Did not have luck with this henna.  It never did turn brown or auburn and did not color the roots of my hair.  May use it a second time, but did not work as expected.</li>
    <li> Product made hair soft and I love the color it turned out. I offered some to my friends and they feel the same way.</li>
    <li> Firstly I have only ever used one other Henna, Rainbow Brand and although it wasn&#x27;t awful I had to resift if before use in my hair, it was far more gritty. However I purchased this henna back in November I believe and finally put it to the test last week. Upon opening the silver packaging, it was also sealed in plastic double plus because I didn&#x27;t explode it everywhere. I bought a plastic container with a lid to store the rest in ahead of time, I now have alot of henna this will last awhile. I mixed it and let it sit over night in my heated bedroom on top of my desk, so I can&#x27;t really tell you if the dye releases before 12hrs, but it has great dye release, its an earthy smell but nothing strong, I add orange, grapefruit or peppermint oil to it and it masks the smell mostly. But even if I didn&#x27;t add any oil I would still use it to color my hair, I would rather this smell than the harsh chemicals of boxed dye, have used many over the years and will never use another. Color wise, I had already done 2 previous henna treatments before this one about 6 weeks apart, and I am going to try and push the next further to see how long this color lasts before it starts to fade. My hair color is gorgeous, I get compliments often, its what my mom and I call a chocolate covered cherry. I have a natural dark dirty blonde color and after 3 treatments I have delevloped a color I never could achieve with a box, my hair is thicker and I have no more itchy scalp. I would recommend this product to any henna user, or anyone who is thinking of going natural. Well natural RED because thats what henna is red and only that, you can add to it but you can&#x27;t take away the red, there will always be a hint, some streaks and red twinge. If you don&#x27;t like red this is not for you simple as that.</li>
    <li> It highlight the red in my hair, and cover the greys in an amazing and natural way, my hear is dark brown and now has a red light, plus some red highlights where the whites used to be before.</li>
    <li> Buying anything in bulk is always better because it&#x27;s always on hand even when you run out of money. Great product.</li>
    <li> But a good price :D It works ok.... just not as vibrant as I&#x27;d like....I do see a use for it for staining the skin tho since it does take awhile to release</li>
    <li> I recently stopped buying my henna from another vendor after receiving what I called &#x27;a bad batch&#x27; and horrible customer service. The bad batch seemed to be sun damaged or something...the smell was different than usual and it gave my hair not even a tint of refreshed color like it had before. The horrible customer service caused me to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched amazon and found this vendor to offer the best deal while also having good reviews. I was surprised to get a nice sized sack of Henna. So much more than I was getting before! The henna is very fine which I love and my color was absolutely perfect. My hair is dark brown and Henna gives it shimmers of auburn and red. It&#x27;s very natural and very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m african american and I use Henna quarterly to treat my scalp. I suffer from psoriasis/seborrhea dermatitis/eczema. Henna works better than anything I&#x27;ve EVER used throughout my life. It completely clears it for months at a time. Thank GOD for these wonderful things on earth!!</li>
    <li> I received this henna with perfect packaging ,my hair was damaged by coloring with chemicals,so i tried this and it was very good from the first time i used it,it treated my hair for about three times using it,i prepared the henna with tea,olive oil,and egg then let it for about three hours after that i put it on my head for not less than 6 hours and the result was excellent coloring and texture,thanks a lot for this seller and i will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Not the right product for dying hair (&amp;#34;PURE henna powder&amp;#34; from them is great for that), but I use this mix as a shampoo alternative and I love it.  I&#x27;ve ordered from this company for over three years now and have never been disappointed.</li>
