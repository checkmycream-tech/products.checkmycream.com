    <li> Love this color! Great color on toes!</li>
    <li> Very strong, vibrant long lasting colour. Everyone asks me where I got it from wherever I go. Used to get it from my nail shop in London, asked them where they got the colour, they said the US, so have purchased it from Amazon as it is a must have</li>
    <li> The most awesome, bright pink nail polish!!! Summer happy!!</li>
    <li> Not as neon as i had hoped.</li>
    <li> Basically the same shade as &amp;#34;Jackie Oh.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Went for mani-pedis with a friend a month ago and did this color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, bright, girly pink, which I couldn&#x27;t find at any local beauty supply shops.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 bottles from Amazon and am quite pleased.

    <li> Love love love this color. Always receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Great color but faded quickly</li>
    <li> This nail polish is simply beautiful color. I have been using it for over a year and this is my second buy in this color and brand( my first purchase of this color was at nail salon). The color looks pretty and it dries very fast. You can wear it all year long. I used to wear more red nails but now that I have found this one I just can&#x27;t stop using it. Definitely its a must have, or at least worth a try. When looking up this color online I would refer to Color Club original website for color samples. Most pictures online do not express true color of it so you maybe misled.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s basically it. I just love pink. And I love Color Club&#x27;s products. There really isn&#x27;t much else to it.</li>
    <li> This color does not appear as pink as it does in the bottle, unless you are in sunlight. It&#x27;s a really pretty pinkish red, and it the sun looks its true pink color. The quality of the polish is great, has lasted as long as my OPI polishes.</li>
    <li> A friend was wearing this color, and I had to have it.  She&#x27;s known for being a bit of a snoot when it comes to nail color, so I thought I was going to pay out the nose for this. It was SO CHEAP!  The color is great, the coverage is very nice, and it&#x27;s easy to paint with (that sounds silly, I know, but sometimes the polish formula, and the brush just don&#x27;t work well together).  I highly recommend this brand.  I feel like they are right up there with O.P.I and for a fraction of the price.  Fun color, and great for summer.  Can&#x27;t wait to try more colors from Color Club.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed, this dye lot is totally different than the bottle I had previously. Not enough blue &amp; very orange</li>
    <li> I initially found this color in a nice nail salon.  Every time I wear it...I get tons of compliments from all women everywhere I go!  It&#x27;s very flattering.  Cannot be found in stores.  Best source is Amazon.  Delivers quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the color club nail polish!!!  I get my toe nails done professionally and never had an issue with getting my nails done within a month of getting them done.  It lasts really long and never looks like the nail polish is getting old.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>

I am not a strict vegan but like to buy as many vegan products as possible but still look good.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It goes on smooth and lasts longer than what I had expected.  Really glad I purchased this product!  The color is a little darker, not as bright but I still love it!</li>
    <li> Color Club is my new favorite nail polish brand! This color went on opaque with only one coat and dried very quickly! It lasted about a week without any chips!</li>
