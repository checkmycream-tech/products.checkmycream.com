<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this for my son.  We had read it was good for acne.  However, it seemed to make him break out more.  So he switched back to the plain witch hazel. Better results. It may work better for others.</li>
    <li> Has aloe.  Not a returnable item.</li>
    <li> I used this to make a safe baby wipe solution.  It was perfect!</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was liking for</li>
    <li> I did not realize this product is a water-weight liquid, but it works well as an aftershave with an electric razor. Not quite enough lubrication as a pre-shave lotion. I thought it might be thicker, like aloe. But it does sooth the skin.</li>
    <li> I got it to help calm down my folliculitis while waiting to get antibiotics. It really takes away the itch and even just using it on my regular eczema calms that down too. I have EXTREMELY dry skin so it was a little drying on me, but I think for someone with normal skin it should be fine. I just used my normal skincare routine over and it was fine. Now that my folliculitis has calmed down I&#x27;m using it every few days all over my body (and face) to keep my skin calm. I love it. Doesn&#x27;t irritate whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I originally purchased it to use as a carrier for essential oils. I now use it as a daily facial toner to keep my acne at bay. It is so refreshing and has no scent whatsoever. If I feel like I need a freshen up, I just wipe my face with this in the middle of the day too! The aloe makes my skin feel so soft. Also, 3 weeks ago I had a baby and have used this on his face when I notice he is getting a breakout. It clears his spots within a day.</li>
    <li> I love this witch hazel- it has no scent at all and no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  The price is right, too!</li>
    <li> Smells so good! I love trying all they Thayers products. I bought some for my boyfriend and even recommended to my sister.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Will be ordering again. An extra cleansing step in my face washing routine. Gentle, yet very effective in removing dirt and oil.</li>
    <li> keeps your skin clean</li>
    <li> Excellent product - perfect for dry or sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This a great witch hazel toner. I love Thayers! However, mine arrived yellowed it was so old. The witch hazel, instead of crystal clear, is a definite yellow. Yuck.</li>
    <li> This product works well, it is thinner than I thought it would be,&lt;br /&gt;which is probably a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Apply right after shaving to keep skin moistened. No scent&lt;br /&gt;so you can put your favorite after shave right after applying.</li>
    <li> i used this for my DIY bug spray, and my DIY hand sanitizer with Essential Oils</li>
    <li> Just recently switched to using a safety razor. Thayer&#x27;s is the perfect way to end my new morning routine.</li>
    <li> This is a great witch hazel.  I use it as a facial toner, and it is not irritating to the skin.</li>
    <li> Boy have I been looking for this. No alcohol...plus aloe!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am using it after I wash my face in the mornings and in the nights.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> So far love this product! It seems to be helping my cystic acne issues that no other product has really had any effect on! It&#x27;s decreasing the size of the cysts and I haven&#x27;t had many new ones form in the week or so since I started using it. I apply it morning and night after I wash my face with a gentle cleanser. I am hoping my good results continue!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin but this toner is perfect to use everyday! i definitely will repurchase it. it&#x27;s good toner!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Just what I was looking for.  Excellent seller!</li>
    <li> I purchased this off a suggestion on a blog, to use in conjunction with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap as a natural and gentle facial regimen.  This arrived first and I started using immediately - twice a day.  It is gentle and soothing on my sensitive, often red (Minnesota-winter-beaten) skin.  I&#x27;ve been using for a week and a half (and using the castille soap for 3 days) and my pores are nearly invisible, my redness is way down and my skin looks and feels the most clean and fresh (and tight!) it has in years.  I&#x27;m only 28 but I had noticed some crows feet starting to form around my eyes and even those have diminished significantly.  I&#x27;m so thrilled to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Great soothing and cleaning toner</li>
    <li> I really have to write a review for this. Background: super sensitive and dry skin due to years of everyday swimming without sunscreen. My face gets red with most products, even Cetaphil so I was really hesitant to buy a toner since toners seem to dry out your skin. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and it&#x27;s been doing wonders to my skin. It feels super soft, smooth, no fbreakout, no rash and I can&#x27;t help touching my face lol.</li>
    <li> it heals my skin problem.</li>
    <li> I used this to make an all natural bug spray. Worked great!</li>
    <li> This toner is labeled as unscented, but as someone with a very sensitive nose this product smells faintly of ethanol (sort of like wine) to me. It&#x27;s definitely not a strong smell or anything and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, so not a problem. Just something I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this with a cotton pad; gives a warm sensation for some reason. Works as it should- it leaves the skin feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Delivered in a timely manner.  Like using the product.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to look into all-natural ways to protect my dog from fleas/ticks because a lot of flea medications,etc exacerbate seizures, as it turns out. Right now I&#x27;m trying (after a lot of research into &amp;#34;how&amp;#34;) home-made citrus &amp;#34;body spray&amp;#34; for her and one thing that&#x27;s called for in that recipe is a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Unscented witch hazel is perfect in diluting the essential oils and acting as the anti-bacterial preservative in mixing a body spray and the added aloe is also really nice for her sensitive skin. It was a super lucky find. Seems to have a lot of other uses as well, so will probably make sure to keep some around the house in any case.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I use it for my post-shave and to clean my face.</li>
    <li> Great deal .. Used it to make homade bug spray</li>
    <li> The Best!! Gentle and soothing lotion for your face.You do not need any $50.00 over priced cosmectic band toner. This product does it all, yay!!!</li>
    <li> This toner is fantastic, and I am seeing a noticeable difference in my skin tone and acne. I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell, and that the ingredients are organic and natural. Works wondering for my face- will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I like it very much.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> So far I love the product I have used it along with other essential oils to make a homemade bug repellent and am very pleased with the results!!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Made tick and mosquito repellent with this and essential oils</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products!</li>
    <li> Great toner, light scent. Use in my body sprays or homemade products.</li>
    <li> I use this for my ocular rosacea which is pretty painful.  The skin all around my eyes burns, itches, swells, scales and turns bright red from the ocular rosacea.  Not a pretty sight!  I&#x27;ve had this condition for 5 years and there isn&#x27;t much help for this from the traditional medicine route.  So for the first 2 years, I used Boiron&#x27;s Calendula homeopathic gel and that controlled the symptoms quite well.  That stopped working so then I moved to Lilly of the Desert aloe vera gel for the next few years and that worked pretty well.  That stopped working.  Did some research and witch hazel was recommended.  I wanted a witch hazel that had no alcohol in it so I chose Thayers. and this has been working pretty well to control the symptoms.  I use a cotton ball and squirt it with the witch hazel, close my eye and just run the cotton ball across the skin from the eyebrow down to the top of the cheekbone.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it now as a skin toner, cleanser and moisturizer for my whole face.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Love this alcohol-free Unscented Witch Hazel and according to their website no animal testing.</li>
    <li> There is no better Witch Hazel liquid formula made. This is alcohol free. Witch Hazel should never ever contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob&lt;br /&gt;_</li>
    <li> No extra additives. Pure witch hazel and no fragrance. This is high quality and a good price. Excellent for post natal recovery.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find alcohol-free toner products for sensitive skin, and this is one of them. I contacted Thayer&#x27;s directly to inquire about whether or not the witch hazel is processed completely without alcohol, and (hooray!) it is. The aloe in this formula is soothing, while the witch hazel works well to eliminate blemishes and redness. This can also be liberally applied to kitchen burns (I just pour it on) for instant relief. For sun burns, the witch hazel and aloe combination speeds healing, and prevents infection or blistering. I have nothing but good things to say about this product, and the company behind it.</li>
    <li> great product, glad its unscented</li>
    <li> Omg, I love this! So I broke out (my face is always sensitive when I move to a new place) and every time I&#x27;d manage to get a pimple to go away another would pop up. But omg I used this at night and when I woke up all my pimples had cleared up! I&#x27;m hoping that this will even my skin tone from the dark marks I have.</li>
    <li> I use this product to cleanse the skin on my face. It works better than any other product I have used. The best part is that it is natural.</li>
    <li> Great. My mom has this brand too. My fiance has poison ivy, and I know that witch hazel is a perfect herbal natural remedy for that. He&#x27;s been using it a couple times a day for 2 days now and his poison ivy is already dried up. I love witch hazel, it can be used for so many things</li>
    <li> Love the product and price plus great service!</li>
    <li> Thayer&#x27;s alcohol free witch hazel is very soothing for itchy or sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t strip it or increase irritation.  Also makes a good toner or makeup finishing mist.</li>
    <li> Great product. Feels great on the skin. Love that there&#x27;s no alcohol.</li>
    <li> Great item. Shipped fast. Used this item to make postpartum padsicles.</li>
    <li> The product has been great so far. I appreciate the fact that it is unscented and gentle for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> really love this especially since no alcohol inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use it daily to keep a glowing healthy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for offering it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a witch hazel fanatic. It started when I made aftershave for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day. Just making it made my hands soft. I started using it as an astringent, then after seeing some skin care recipes on the internet, made a face wash with it. I use water, witch hazel, liquid black soap, and some tea tree oil, and I swear is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Now I use it for all kinds of body products.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shipping speed and I absolutely love what it has done for my skin in just a few applications! I suffer from dry, acne prone skin and this has helped tremendously. But honestly aside from the product the actual company seems to really care about their customers because I ordered it on a Sunday evening  (with the slowest shipping speed) and I got it on Wednesday! Plus they emailed me to make sure I was satisfied! That&#x27;s a great company in my book!</li>
    <li> Good non-alcoholic witch hazel. Second purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the recommendations here on Amazon, and I have absolutely no regrets. This stuff is really amazing, and I want to give an specific example of how it works -- or worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved to Los Angeles from the East when I was 35 years old, and quickly bought a convertible. The sun beating on my hands as they rested on the steering wheel, all day, every day, aged them rapidly. Prior to that I&#x27;d been pretty fortunate, thanks to genetics, about aging, but I was rapidly developing old man&#x27;s hands. I tried various lotions prescribed by my girlfriend, scrubbing the hell out of the skin, etc., with no results, and pretty much just resigned myself to the fact I was a 30something dude with the hands of a 50 year-old who spent too much time outdoors. A few weeks ago, on a whim, I bought this stuff, and noticed immediate -- almost literally IMMEDIATE -- improvement. The flesh tightened up and smoothed out to a remarkable degree after just one application before bed, and I&#x27;ve been re-applying it every day since. I&#x27;d say I reversed the aged look by maybe 50% almost at once. Since then improvement has been slow, but not negligible. Even if it stops here, however, the stuff has already paid for itself a few hundred times over. The fact that it is totally odorless is also a big plus. My one issue is that it tends to leave the skin a bit tacky afterwards -- not quite sticky, but in the vicinity of sticky. But that&#x27;s not much of an issue given the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this stuff, at least for the issue in question, and I&#x27;d like to close by saying I also found this stuff for sale at my local CVS. So you might want to compare the price here plus shipping versus whatever they charge for it in your local convenience store.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this as a toner, wound cleanser, diluted eye wash.  It is a safe, affective and natural product that should be used more.</li>
    <li> love it. all natural nothing harsh. skin feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Eh. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin, and I&#x27;ve been using it nightly and occasionally in the mornings for months. Doesn&#x27;t seem to tone like other products out there. I like that there&#x27;s no smell, but I get the feeling like I&amp;#34;m just rubbing water on my face.</li>
    <li> Works well as toner for sensitive skin. Truly unscented, which I love!</li>
    <li> This product has no alcohol.  Shipped fast!  Love this brand!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and this does not irritate my skin - works great!</li>
    <li> Thayers Unscented Witch Hazel is a simple product that does what it says. It is not too drying on the skin and gives me beautiful, toned, clear skin. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Alcohol-free unscented is good for my skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my face as it irritates my skin, but it&#x27;s good for using on your bikini line after shaving</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!!!  This product has MANY uses.  I use at home, take it on trips, and even carry some in my purse at all times. Primarily, I use it to clean my face each morning, it&#x27;s gentle and the aloe is a great natural moisturizer. It keeps my oily skin in check and reduces acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to use on minor cuts and abrasions, disinfecting without the sting like alcohol. I&#x27;ve also applied it to minor burns and experienced quick relief and healing.  It&#x27;s great on bug bites, immediately reducing the sting and/or itchiness.  (My neighbor&#x27;s son was stung by a bee and I gave them some of this witch hazel to put on it right away. It was immediately soothing and the next day it was almost completely healed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep some in a small spray bottle to spritz on toilet tissue to make my own flushable wipes.  The chemicals in brand wipes seem to be harsh and irritating (the wipes themselves I hear are not so good for sewer systems).  This witch hazel is super gentle, the aloe is particularly helpful in soothing/healing a sore or tender bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen so many great uses for one simple product.  I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! It has so many uses and really helps to clear my complexion.</li>
    <li> came quickly, and alcohol free witch hazel is difficult to find, i use this in a yoga mat spry i make ,  love it</li>
    <li> Gentle and clean feeling. I have been using Witch Hazel for the past 9 months now. I was an advent Neutrogena product user for approx 20 years. I still use Neutrogena but I switched from using their toner to using Witch Hazel. I am totally satisfied with the refreshing feel of Witch hazel. No drying and no unpleasant smell. At 56, my face feels and looks baby soft.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it to make my own hand sanitizer with essential oils - works very well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I am all for natural cruelty free beauty products!</li>
    <li> I love this toner. I use it at night, It is totally natural, it cleans and smoothens your skin. Great product, great value</li>
    <li> You can always count on Thayers products! Witch hazel absolutely works wonders on my face + I use it as an anti-bacterial for cuts. When my cat was spayed, I gently applied this toner on her belly to help her heal.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love it, would recommend to friends and I would order again</li>
    <li> Have been using Thayers Unscented Witch Hazel Toner for a few months now, in lieu of another, way more expensive, toner I&#x27;d used for years.  So far, I seem to be getting the same results with the Thayers.  Really like that it is unscented; the product I previously used was not.</li>
    <li> I really like this toner.  I use it at night to cleanse my face, and it seems to have improved my complexion and reduced my pores.  It leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft afterwards.  (Marie Bedford).  A single bottle lasts a long time, as well.</li>
    <li> I use this as an aftershave. I have extremely sensitive skin and when I use balms I tend to break out from them. I put this in a spray bottle and spray my face after i&#x27;m done shaving and it the best! It helps redness and heals irritation, I don&#x27;t get any razor bumps after using this and if I do this will treat them in a hurry. It moisturizes enough that I rarely need to apply lotion afterword.</li>
    <li> Love. I could instantly feel the product working when I applies it.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Healing properties awesome</li>
    <li> I received my product very fast! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a nice product, and it does help my face feel quite nice after a fine, duel-edged razor shave.  I did notice a significant improvement in comfort once I started using this product, rather than only my preferred after-shave balm, and it comes without any harsh sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some are turned off by the aloe vera scent (earthy and a bit vegetal, but quite light) or that aloe vera slickness (that does become a bit tacky), neither bother me.  This product is not my sole after-shave, and I do not want any scent to get in the way of my after shave balm.  The same balm remedies any odd feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the most effective astringent out there, but it does have astringent effect.  If you want something stronger, you ought to look at a more traditional witch hazel product or something like an alum block or alcohol based splash--you just might have to trade some comfort for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly expensive product when compared to some other witch hazel products, so be aware of that.  Still, it&#x27;s not at all cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Feel so refreshed after. Keep a spray bottle of it in my yoga back and after class I spray my face and arm pits to help kill bacteria until I can get home and wash.</li>
    <li> Gentler than other with hazels I&#x27;ve used, thanks to the aloe vera additive.</li>
    <li> This witch hazel is perfect for sensitive skin.  It does not dry your skin out at all.</li>
    <li> I started using Thayer witch hazel unscented and loved it. The fragrance is really nothing unlike how some witch hazels can be. It is very gentle on the skin and I just love it. I have also tried the rose...love that too. I think I will have to try the others as well.&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour size:  I defiantly have seen my pours get much smaller! Especially on my nose.  Big wow for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eczema:  I tend to get eczema on my face which really sucks. This takes it right away!! Thank you ,thank you.  For those of you that suffer with eczema my number one recommendation is to stop eating grain!!  That makes a HUGE difference. That is the only way I can get rid of it.  When I cheat my body can handle it once in a while but no on a regular base.  When I start eating grain it comes back.  And then Thank goodness for Witch Hazel it takes it away quickly.  I have used steroid creams which work, but this is actually faster and all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles:  Yes, it does help. I feel my skin is tighter and I a youthful glow back to my skin.  It really is amazing. I&#x27;m 58 and look 40.  What I eat makes  a difference there too but Witch Hazel is fantastic.  (food, stay away from sugar!! Ages you fast.)  I never bothered with an astringent. What for.  I have no idea what started me on it but I will never stop.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans:  I know it moisturizes. I am not sure how but it does. I still feel squeaky clean,  I put the witch hazel on t though out the day. I leave it on the bathroom counter next to cotton balls and whenever I am there I put some more on. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne:  I don&#x27;t and never have had a problem with acne but  Every once in a while one will sneak up, usually back to when I am not eating right.  It does clear it up quickly when I use the witch hazel.  I would say in  two days. For those who say it brings on acne my only guess to that is it might be clearing out your skin big time and...what are you eating??  Can&#x27;t blame it all on thewitch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. I noticed there is lavender and many other choices.  A real keeper as far as I am concerned!!</li>
    <li> Used it as part of a natural flea remedy</li>
    <li> This witch hazel works great and has a wonderful aroma about it too!  It has many applications, including but not limited to: keeping your face free of acne without drying out your skin, dabbing on a cotton swab if your hair roots are greasy for a quick fix, putting on pads for postpartum freezer &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34;, and I even recently started making my own bug spray - all natural! And it works great! 4oz witch hazel to 2tbsp each: Rosemary and catnip.  Steep for 3 days, shaking several times a day, strain and voila!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very sturdy, in fact I reused it several times for my homemade cleaning liquids etc.  definitely purchasing again soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s as basic as it gets and works so well. Highly recommended to anyone, any skin type!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne-prone skin and this works wonderfully as a nighttime and daytime toner. I rub it over my skin with a cotton ball and the scent-free option is great for my allergies.</li>
    <li> Best toner ever!  I&#x27;ve been using different brands of toners that contain various acid combinations at outrageous prices.  Then I tried this ten dollar toner with a cotton ball, and got better results.  Try this!</li>
    <li> I received the scented version instead of this so I can&#x27;t really use it.....</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference. Sometimes I use after showering and it burns a bit after application, so something&#x27;s happening.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this product</li>
    <li> We use this product to clean our faces, treat cuts, scrapes and skin irritations as well as on our pets skin issues. We are part of an animal rescue and there is always something to treat, from skin rashes and irritations to minor scratches and abrasions. It works great as a safe and affective astringent and cleanser. Harsh chemicals and products full of additives aren&#x27;t a good choice for our family, and even the expensive, specialty astringents dry out our faces, where this product does not.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product! Came exactly as promised and on time !</li>
    <li> Nice quality and arrived safe.</li>
    <li> Great for after shave</li>
    <li> I have been using this as an alcohol-free aftershave, and it works perfectly.  It is not only more soothing than alcohol-based aftershave, but also prevents breakouts and seems to promote faster healing.</li>
    <li> Regular witch hazel has alcohol and dries my already dry skin. This is gentle and my sensitive skin looks radiant again!</li>
    <li> Incredible stuff! I use it every day, especially after shaving.</li>
    <li> best aftershave with no sting</li>
    <li> Works great, used as base for a natural bug spray as well as treating some existing bug bites on the small people, no pain or cries from burning!</li>
    <li> This witch hazel is the best I&#x27;ve found by far above others choices. It is truly unscented which I prefer. I use it for all my essential oil recipes which call for witch hazel and I will wait until I can receive it by mail rather than go and pick up some other sub par witch hazel from the local grocery store.</li>
    <li> My face feels great since using the product, it really stops my face from getting so oily. The most noticeable thing is that my pores have shrunk down a lot when I started using it. Beyond that, my face is really really soft, but I&#x27;m more worried about how it looks haha!</li>
    <li> Witch Hazel is one of my favorite toner. It&#x27;s alcohol-free i use it for my face leaves a clean, refreshing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using Thayer&#x27;s product and i love it,safe to use everyday.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just as described. It does have a VERY faint scent, but it is very faint (like Aloe).</li>
    <li> We just love this product in our house. Everyone uses it. It is so gentle and leaves your face feeling clean and soft. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, truly unscented, makes my skin feel hydrated and clean.</li>
    <li> The best toner I&#x27;ve ever used. So gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my skin red like others. I love it!</li>
    <li> So much better than the Perricone toner I had been using.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 100 stars I would. I purchased this lovely product for my wife. She has the worlds most sensitive skin. Not to mention dryness is always a problem. I thought to get her the bottle with rose water. However, I decided against it, since most fragrances plays a roll in her constant facial breakouts. Now to this product. It works amazing. She loves it and so do I. This little blessing keeps her face moisturized and remarkably smooth. It also cleared up all of her breakouts. My wife is happy. And so am I. As many times as she needs this product, I will go as far as to cross the moon to make sure she gets it. Thank you internet. Update: Today is March 14, 2015, and I am updating the review as requested by my wife. I am not taking anything that I mentioned  above back. However, we have both learned that consistent use causes her to slowly break out. She can only use said product about once a week. Which kind of defeats the purpose right? It&#x27;s like only working out for 2 minutes a day. Anyway, better luck with something else. At this point, both my wife and I are considering scheduling her to visit a dermatologist. Maybe there is more to be learned about her skin type.</li>
    <li> I love that this is natural and unscented.</li>
    <li> Great  product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> If you want to use Witch Hazel, then buy this!  It goes on very lite, but best of all it doesn&#x27;t smell.  The extra aloe helps with dry skin and with no alcohol you don&#x27;t have to worry about any stinging if you&#x27;re using this after a shave.  This is what I hope to always use as long as I can get it.  Great for healthy looking acne free skin.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  I am sensitive to fragrances.  Most men&#x27;s after-shave lotions are heaving scented.  I found this product and my husband likes it!  It works on his skin as well as the scented products.  Now I have nothing to complain about.</li>
