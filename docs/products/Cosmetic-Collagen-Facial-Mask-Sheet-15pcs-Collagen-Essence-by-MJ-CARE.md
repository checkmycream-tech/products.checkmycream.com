    <li> You can feel these masks really doing its &#x27;thing&#x27; on your skin. They come out the package wet; have someone place the mask over your face for you. 15-20 min later after taking off the mask you will find that the mask becomes dry. The collagen formula really does seep in the skin and leaves your face feeling refreshed. I use this product after I have showered and after a deep pore mask. Works great! I even got my Fianc&amp;eacute; to use them ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two shipments of these masks.  Really notice a difference in the smoothness of my skin.  I don&#x27;t use them three times a week as the packaging suggests- just once a week and even with that, I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
