<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any change or improvement yet!</li>
    <li> I love it! After a month seeing results!!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Derma Roller is a bit painful, therefore, I don&#x27;t use it as often a suggested. I am not a baby either, I get fillers in my lips and it hurts. Maybe I am to rough with the Derma Roller also. If you use it with the Vitamin C Serum you will peel.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it and then add vitamin c to the face.  feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> I dont normally write reviews for beauty product right after i used for once, but I have to say about this derma roller. I used it for once on half of my forehead( to see a difference next day) where I have some discoloration and roughness due to acne scar, and it worked like a magic. I have undergone laser therapy for my acne, but this is way better and less painful. I mean the discoloration is still there after one use, but the skin is definitely brighter and smoother compared to the second half of my forehead that I didnt use. I think this work better if you dont have &amp;#34;active acne&amp;#34;, because you might pop the cysts or whiteheads and cause more inflammation. I recommend it after your acne subsided and there is no open wound on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;70% alcohol spray the roller before and after each use, air dry&lt;br /&gt;Prep your face: clean face with cleanser, and apply a cleaning toner to avoid inflammation( i used a non alcohol, witch hazel based toner by Mario Badescu)&lt;br /&gt;Roll the roller 4 times up and down, 4 times left and right, 4 times diagonal in one area. ( I start with gentle pressure, then gradually increase if i can tolerate. but overall, my motion is on the softer side.) The area will become little bit red or more depend on areas you use it on and the thickness/sensitivity of your skin.  Don&#x27;t apply too much pressure for the first few tries.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your skin care serum while the needle has created microlesion on your skin.( I used a serum for dark spot with vitaminC by Kiels, and it works really well).&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you disinfect your roller with alcohol after use as well. I think alcohol spray is the easiest to use compare to use cotton pad to wipe the needles.</li>
    <li> Great roller--easy to use and clean.  Would buy from again.</li>
    <li> acne scars on cheeks are almost gone. Much less visible and fewer are visible</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a difference, really wanted to but I saw no change in pigment, texture or fine lines.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I decided to buy a derma roller. I saw variety of prices from 3 to 45 (Dr. Roller) and choose this one as a median price and good reviews. I wasnt disappointing with quality. I inspected it very carefully and found  that I can trust it to use it on my face. Unfortunately I can found only 1.0 mm needle size from this brand, and I wish they have more different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I put 4 stars just saying I like it, but not loving it because I didnt see any result yet with my skin. I was sent email from the selling company with instruction how often to use derma roller, and it was said once a week for the best result. While searching in internet every instruction for how often to use dermaroller says 1.0 mm derma roller for face should be used only once a month. So, thats was confusing to me. I really was afraid to use it once a week, so I choose less frequency. I using it for my scalp too for my tinning and falling hair, so I will post update if I notice any progress with my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Just started using it. Seems like it will work with my skin regiment.</li>
    <li> love this little guy! it hurts a bit but like they say... &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this one. I loved using it and had really high hopes for it. I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, but shortly after I started using it my forehead broke out bad. My forehead never breaks out. I got a bunch of little bumps that wouldn&#x27;t pop, but they looked ridiculous. I stopped using it shortly after I bought it. I wish my face hadn&#x27;t broken out, because I feel like it had the potential to help skin tone and pores, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the break out long enough to continue using.</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for about 2 months with the vitamin oil on my stomach stretch marks. I dont see any results at all.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I read the instructions. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change as of yet, as I have had it only 1 month. I have used only 1-2 times a week.</li>
    <li> Works great! Saw results in the first few weeks. Bought it to reduce old acne bumps and it did so very well</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t go deep enough to cause the trauma that is need to get the results.</li>
    <li> Never noticed a difference..</li>
    <li> people are already commenting on how young i look!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a small oven burn scar on my wrist and I must admit that the scar is fading away.</li>
    <li> didnt see any noticeable benefit as far as wrinkles,scars or pore reduction.  it made the underside of my neck feel softer, but that is not why I ordered it. There were really no instructions with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a knee scar that is really unattractive, and I&#x27;ve used it a few times. I&#x27;m not noticing any changes yet, but it&#x27;s only been a week or so (and I expect this is a several week to several month requirement). I have to say, though, that it hurts--not enough to stop using it, but more than I&#x27;d be willing to torture my face with. Shipping was fast as always, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few nice emails from the company with tips and info on how to use and clean it, as well as product tips. I&#x27;m hoping it does stimulate collagen production to help the appearance of my leg scar, but I don&#x27;t think that would entice me to cut my face on. Ouch!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what to think of it  yet besides it should give more detailed instructions. Like if you see blood spots all over your face, your pushing to hard!! How often should you use the.product? How long your face stays beet red?? Once I see results besides red skin I will give it proper review</li>
    <li> Excellent tool to use all over face, neck and hands to prepare skin for vitamin C serum, and rich oils such as argan</li>
    <li> So so. Still need time to verify the function.</li>
    <li> You want to know how to stop acne? Drink four twenty ounce bottles of water each day, and drop makeup! Makeup is crap!&lt;br /&gt;There. No acne.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, seems to work but takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> The derma roller is fabulous  . Just the right size for the face .</li>
    <li> I have used the Derma Roller for several weeks and I am very pleased with the results.  I have noticed marked improvements.</li>
    <li> Great roller! I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the benefits of this item. It seems to be working as expected! Would purchase again from this seller.</li>
    <li> It works great, thank you!</li>
    <li> still in the process of reviewing the product&#x27;s results</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! Glad I got it!! It really helps repair facial skin.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how this works, and looks scary with needles. A friend of mine recommended it to me after using it few times her acne scars disappeared. I&#x27;m a male in my 30s and have a scar that I want to get rid of. I watched few how to videos on how derma rollers work and after few uses I noticed the scar started to get smaller. I now use the derma roller once a day at night and will use it until the scar is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company sent directions how to use it also which was helpful, they recommend putting the micro needle in rubbing alcohol to cleanse it before and after use and that is all it requires to clean it. I&#x27;m really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> it really works I got the glow back</li>
    <li> I have been using the Derma Roller for approx. 3 weeks now, every other day.  I have yet to see improvements, but have heard it takes time and for me to be patient.  I will let you know after several more weeks have passed what I think of the product at that time.</li>
    <li> The roller is excellent, I have just expected something bigger because the product it is quite small. For the rest is just fine</li>
    <li> This is a natural way of healing damage skin such as scars.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is tolerable the first time I tried it on my scar on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 month now and I can see dramatic improvement of my skin. My scars are now starting to fade and I noticed a new skin starting to emerge. I know that my scar will be totally gone with consistent use of this product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my Derma Roller. As a new customer I can honestly say in the few times that I have used this product I see a noticeable improvement in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have two other derma rollers and this one is the worst. The needles are not sharp. I ended up with scratches from having to press so much harder. I threw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I had never even heard of dermarolling until I stumbled across this listing on Amazon. I decided to give it a shot seeing as how it was fairly cheap as far as beauty treatments go, and also reusable. So far I have used my dermaroller twice, about 6 weeks apart. I have used it on my face, neck, and shoulders, and also on some old stretchmarks on my lower belly and hips. I typically follow up with a vitamin C and E serum immediately after use, and an oral collagen supplement every day for at least a couple of weeks after using my dermaroller. So far, the results have been quite pleasing and noticeable. My skin seems plumper and smoother and my complexion is radiant. As far as wrinkles, I only have fine lines and I&#x27;m not sure how much of a difference the dermaroller has made, although they do seem less noticeable. My boyfriend even mentioned something about my skin looking really good, and men never notice skin.&lt;br /&gt;As far as my stretchmarks go, WOW what a difference! The little ones are almost completely gone, and the 2 big ones are faded, flattened, and have shrunk since I have used the dermaroller. I&#x27;m just so happy to have found something that I can use at home, doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, and actually produces real results!&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure to keep your dermaroller clean and sterile at all times, and to disinfect both skin and dermaroller with rubbing alcohol prior to use if you have any acne or are acne-prone. The needles can spread acne bacteria if improperly disinfected, leading to a breakout 2 or 3 days after use.</li>
    <li> I wasted my MONEY! and you will to! This Product is worth-less!</li>
    <li> Things A Derma Roller Is Great For:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Large Pore Reduction&lt;br /&gt;• Dark Spot Reduction&lt;br /&gt;• Treating Wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;• Repairing Damaged Tissue&lt;br /&gt;• Removing Surgical Scars&lt;br /&gt;• Removal of Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt;• Acne Scars Treatment&lt;br /&gt;• Treating Hyper Pigemntation&lt;br /&gt;• Stimulates Collagen Production&lt;br /&gt;• Improves Skin Elasticity&lt;br /&gt;• Cellulite Reduction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stretch marks due to having a baby and well…&lt;br /&gt;No one likes to have stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I used the derma roller to help minimize the appearance of my stretch marks hopping it would clear them up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;540 Microneedles all rolled up in a convenient and stylish roller? Now that is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This has helped me so much as well as helped my self confidence.&lt;br /&gt;We should always love ourselves for who we are, but a little help with stretch marks is always wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Call me crazy, but i love the way it feels when i roll this derma roller on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed so many changes already within the few weeks i have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel so alive and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> very well built and works great</li>
    <li> Good roller that produces good effects.  Leaves my face blushed for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;1.0 is good for the face but I would probably get a 1.5 for the body.&lt;br /&gt;because I leave it in alcohol a long time, it squeaks a little.</li>
    <li> This device is very therapeutic, the needling effect is what makes your facial, topical, beauty regiments being used to penetrate deep into your skin&#x27;s pores.</li>
    <li> Really great product, started to see improvement in about two weeks, I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few months. It looks like my little wrinkles around my mouth are getting less noticable.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it does something I tried it for my stretch marks I think it made it even worse😱</li>
    <li> I am 41, I have never been super conscious of my skin, I don&#x27;t have a complicated beauty rutine and never had a spa facial or anything like that but I have been using the roller for a month now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Yes it is a little painful but you have control over the pressure on your skin. I have noticed an incredible difference in the size of my pores and  skin elasticity. I also had some sun spots that completely disappeared. I know there are some serums recommended for after the roller treatment but I don&#x27;t use any of them, they are a bit pricey for me so I just apply the same Roc Retinol treatment I was already using and so far the results are noticeable. Now my husband wants his own roller!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this little roller.  I must warn that it stings while using, but I have extremely sensitive skin so perhaps it would not be uncomfortable for someone with normal skin.  However, the results are wonderful.  Having lived for a decade in AZ, my skin turned into a saltine cracker.  This little roller plumps the facial tissue and helps so much with absorption of serum and lotion that it looks like I&#x27;ve just had an expensive facial every time that I use it. While I have not seen a great difference in sun spot size, I have seen a dramatic reduction in wrinkles.  Despite the slight discomfort, I am anxious to use the roller and will continue its use forever.</li>
    <li> Scary to use at first since I wasn&#x27;t used to needles on my face. Had slight trouble getting the right pressure for the roller but got it right after a few tries.</li>
    <li> It works a little, I see a little difference but I expected to see a big difference, but I guess it&#x27;s alright..everybody&#x27;s skin has a different reaction</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about a month or less; however, not consistently yet I have seen results.  My forehead had dark spots due to acne and is slowly clearing. Patience and consistency is the key.</li>
    <li> I really love this derma roller. I have it for about 4 weeks and I can see a difference in my acne scars, they are seriously gone and my skin feels tighter. I tried so many things to remove those scars and nothing worked until research led me to this product. Its not painful to use and I doesn&#x27;t make my face bleed. My face now feels great and looks great. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product for making my pots smaller I love it</li>
    <li> My order was shipped timely w/o any problems.  It didn&#x27;t take long to see results but you do have to follow the directions and use it regularly.  The needle prickling takes some getting use to but I think it&#x27;s worth it because I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my overall skin texture in less than a month.</li>
    <li> I have been using the derma roller for a couple months now along with a vitamin C serum. I have seen a lot of improvement in acne scars and sun damage and also feel there has been an improvement in the lines around my mouth!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about this gadget...I used it several times and other than it Hurts like crazy I see no results. I have to give it a one star...sorry guys!</li>
    <li> do no waste your money</li>
    <li> I had been researching Derma Rollers and was quite wary of them, until I got the opportunity to try the Beaute La Royale Derma Roller! They come with all different sizes of needles for many skin problems! This particular Derma roller is a 1.0 mm size, and comes with 540 needles, which are made with Titanium Alloy! This Derma Roller can be used on the face, scalp, legs, and even your whole body! The size I got is mainly for the face area! Derma rollers can help reduce or remove stretch marks, cellulite, dark spots, acne scars, wrinkles, fine lines, scars, and dark circles!  .They also help with Skin Elasticity and Stimulate Collagen Production in the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using this Derma Roller for over three weeks now and am seeing some amazing, huge results on my skin! I use this Derma Roller every other day! I always carefully apply light pressure when I use this! Also, I sweep the Derma Roller up, down, sideways, sideways the other way, then diagonal both ways! That is to make sure that i get every inch of skin very good, which makes it more effective! Below I am making a list of things I like and don&#x27;t like about this Derma Roller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging this came in is absolutely fresh, young, and modern looking! The packaging alone made me want to try this over other brands!&lt;br /&gt;-This Derma Roller comes with a traveling storage case! I store my derma roller in this case when it is not in use!&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s super easy to understand and to use!&lt;br /&gt;-It glides effortlessly with no squeaking noise!&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s affordable and is a great way to get a beauty treatment, but without the expensive costs of going to see a dermatologist!&lt;br /&gt;-I started to see results as early as one week!!!&lt;br /&gt;-This Derma Roller has improved my skin texture, tone, and firmness immensely! My skin is now softer, smoother, and more radiant than ever! -Also, my skin firmness has improved so much that it looks like my skin has &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;-I had a scar on my chin from a hot pocket! Yes I know, that is so embarrassing! After using this derma roller my scar is almost ALL THE WAY GONE! AMAZING! I cannot believe that it healed my chin scar!&lt;br /&gt;-My face is looking younger, vibrant, and fine lines are not as noticeable! It does take a few weeks to see more drastic results, but the more I use this, the better the results!&lt;br /&gt;-The large pores around my nose and cheeks have diminished!&lt;br /&gt; -Also, some dark spots I had have now faded!&lt;br /&gt;-Immediately after using this I always apply all of my serums and moisturizers! I feel that adding that along with derma rolling, has really helped me to see results sooner! The derma roller opens my pores, which then I add my other beauty products along with, and that helps them to soak into my skin and really work!&lt;br /&gt;-It gives me confidence! I love that I can get such big results, and feel good about myself! I know after using this for a while that I feel so much better about myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-This IS painful! No, It is not the worst pain in the world, but it is quite uncomfortable! I would describe it as a stinging pain, and almost like getting a tattoo pain! I can&#x27;t really blame the Derma Roller though since the whole purpose is to poke my skin with needles!!&lt;br /&gt;-I feel the needles aren&#x27;t as sharp as they first where when I got this in the mail three weeks ago! Now when I use this I have to apply a bit more pressure, and feel it sometimes &amp;#34;drags&amp;#34; along when I&#x27;m rolling it on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;-My face looks SO red afterwards, and my skin is very warm! I have a light skin tone so after I use this it looks like I got the worst sunburn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall I am VERY satisfied with the results this Derma Roller has given me! This might take some time to see results on certain things, but for other things it works within weeks - and it&#x27;s SO worth it! I highly recommend this brand as well! They have great customer service and emailed me several times about how to usethe product, how it&#x27;s working for me, etc... Also it comes with a lifetime guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. ALL opinions are my own and MY OWN ONLY! I would never recommend a product I wouldn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use myself! ****the product, how it&#x27;s working for me, etc... Also it comes with a lifetime guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I received this product to try for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. ALL opinions are my own and MY OWN ONLY! I would never recommend a product I wouldn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t use myself! ****</li>
    <li> I give this 4 stars because the seller fulfilled my order and it arrived on time. I have used it 3 times and its not painful...but it is not a comfortable feeling haha.... after you use it , wash your face and it with feel swollen/ irritated for about 15 minutes after ....redness goes away after about an hour . It is helping with some acne scares .... I don&#x27;t have many but it works....how ever , be sure that you do not have any active acne....it will make you break out !  so , i would recommend this for people with little to moderate acne scares</li>
    <li> As I am new to derma rolling, I have spent a great amount of time viewing how to videos and reading to learn more about the process.  I have not performed derma rolling to myself yet.  Comparing this derma roller to the ones I seen in the videos it looks to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> Works really well I have the 1mm. I&#x27;ve already seen my acne scars start fading in the first week. I also use a clearasil hydro blast daily facial wash as soon after I use it so that also helps me.</li>
    <li> It is okay,  I can&#x27;t tell that it did anything but make my skin red for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I think this little device could revolutionize my whole skin care routine. Call me crazy, but I think I see a difference after just 4 uses. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a really useful product. I use this few times a week on my forehead and the rest of my face with vitamin c serum and it really does a great job. When I put make up on now I see a big difference from before. My entire complexion looks better. I purchased another micro needle as a Christmas gift for my mother and she&#x27;s just as pleased! I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased the Royal Derma Roller by Sparkle with Beauty and I must say that I am very excited to see what it can do for my skin. I used it for the first time a few days ago on half of my face before accidentally dropping it in my sink. (Clumsy me, must of been too excited or nervous --or both, to try it out lol) Anywho, the VERY next morning I noticed a difference! I kid you not! The side of my face that I had rolled felt tighter and my pores looked smaller. I do have some shallow acne scars (impressions) on my cheeks and temples and even those looked less noticeable. Unfortunately, since I dropped it, I didn&#x27;t think it wise to try to use it on my face again so I asked for a replacement and they were kind enough to send me a replacement. I really appreciate that. Definitely will be more careful. But yes, I cannot wait to see the long term results. As far as pain, it does hurt and feels uncomfortable, initially. However, after a few rolls, you become accustom to the pain more and more. I also want to try adding a bit more pressure when I&#x27;m rolling because I felt that since it was my first time, and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I went very gentle and light. But the more pressure you can endure, without bleeding, the more you will penetrate those areas and hopefully see improvement! I definitely recommend this product and I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results. Oh, and definitely, definitely use a Vitamin C serum, makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Beauty is painful because this really works! By the end of the week i was shedding massive dead skin and new skin was resurfacing. I saw an improvement with my wrinkles and its only been a month that ive been using it so unfortunately  my acne scars and dark spots are still visable. Hopefully they start to dissappear over time. Im using a soft face scrub bought from daiso along with the  Neutrogena soap bar for acne (since my skin gets super oily and breaks out easily). Also the brush is definitely a great tool to use to remove the dead skin. Its really difficult for me to stay consistant w the derma roller because its really painful -_-&#x27; is it worth the pain though? Absolutely! !</li>
    <li> I ordered my dermal roller not knowing what to expect and was surprised to get it so fast. I was nervous but when I finally used it, it was amazing! It was totally painless and I saw results after only a couple uses. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am in love with my derma roller.  I have had it for a few months now, and I have seen a dramatic improvement in my acne.  I can&#x27;t speak to its effect on wrinkles, because I never really had that many to begin with.  I use my derma roller twice per week.  I first wash my face normally.  Then I slather on some colloidal silver gel as an antibacterial.  Next, I roll my face (which does hurt, especially on my forehead). After that, I apply a night serum (I use BE active cell renewal serum), and then I finish with a light coating of coconut oil.  I just use the same oil that I use for cooking because I buy really high quality, unrefined coconut oil anyway.  I soak the derma roller in rubbing alcohol when I&#x27;m done.  I have had acne since my last year in college (15 years ago), and I&#x27;m hoping that this derma roller will keep it under control.</li>
    <li> I can see a complete difference in my skin. So can others! I will definitely purchase more when needed...I highly suggest using this...</li>
    <li> I used this for my stretch marks. it works! I saw results the first week. Id advise getting  a numbing cream then using this. its also great for wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. A necessity for skin!!</li>
    <li> No effect for me even if i countinue use it i cannot see  a difference.</li>
    <li> I used it only once, but i allready feel my skin tightening. I would recommend the roller to my friends.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Derma Roller about a month ago with the hope that it would help my sun damage. I&#x27;m a male over 50 who spent the majority of my life working and vacationing in the sun. A dermatologist gave me Retin-A nine months ago and there has been only minor improvement. A friend recommended that I use the Retin-A in conjunction with the Derma Roller. Now I roll my skin and then apply Retin-A and a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve only done this four times now, but already someone has asked me if I did &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; to my skin to make it look better. Hoping the improvements will be even greater after six months or so. I can&#x27;t stress enough how good the customer service is from this company. They have sent me several emails with directions and suggestions for use of their roller. Which is good since I wasn&#x27;t quite sure exactly how to use it. Also, I got some spray alcohol to clean the needles.</li>
    <li> So a couple of years ago, I made the mistake of getting another chemical peel.  I should have stopped after the very first one.  Any way, my face was burned so deep that I ended up with acne scars that were deep down my skin layers and were now visible.  Basically, I never had acne scaring until lately.  I purchased the derma roller about 2 months ago and I am noticing a difference.  My face is getting SO MUCH better!!!  I believe that this roller is bringing my face back to life!  I am happy I purchased this roller.  I was skeptical at first and afraid of the needles.  The needles are not sharp at all.  I will continue using.  Thank Goodness I found this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working well so far! I am very hopeful that with continued use, it will be even better!!</li>
    <li> It Works good, just need a little wait to see the results,a week or so:) But you need to use a great product  right after Derma Roller like Organic Serum C and Collagen. They work great together.</li>
    <li> I always use this in the evening after I shower along with OZ Naturals Vitamin C/Hyaluronic Acid Serum like someone recommended, and WOW, can I feel and see the difference when I wake up in the morning! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have noticed a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin. Many of the fine lines have faded and my skin is much more smooth and even.</li>
    <li> Keep rocking and rolling! It works! I also suggest this:  http://goo.gl/n05SFS  to use after every derma roller session. It helps heal the skin faster and boosts the collagen production. So many skin benefits!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! It&#x27;s very easy to use and I really love the way my skin looks. This dermaroller works well and gets my face products under the skins surface. I&#x27;ve seen progress on my skin after using this.</li>
    <li> I got this as a birthday present for my girlfriend in December and she loves the results. She highly recommends it and she recommends using vitamin c serum with it which makes the skin perfect.</li>
    <li> Just got this have just started using it. Seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> I had a bad experience with a Derma Roller that I chose not to review.  The head was loose, and it scratched the daylights out of my face. Since then, I&#x27;ve been very cautious about derma rolling, and will only use one that is stable and well made.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this one is very well made and the head is securely affixed to the handle.  The handle itself is comfortable to hold and makes the roller easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1.0 mm micro needles are the optimum size for facial use, and I love that they&#x27;re made of titanium.  This ensures a long lasting quality product.  I keep a small bottle of alcohol close at hand to disinfect after each use, and have no concerns that the alcohol will degrade the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While healthier looking skin is an immediate result of derma rolling, it takes several months to see effects on wrinkles and scars.  That&#x27;s just how it is.  If you want a non surgical treatment and are willing to be patient, derma rolling is definitely the way to go, and the Royal Derma Roller is a great investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for review, and the opinion is entirely mine.</li>
    <li> I needed to adjust to the prickly needles on my first couple of uses but once I got past the minor uncomfortableness. I think this roller is a good tool to enhance my moisturizer absorption.  I would recommend it</li>
    <li> It works on scars! Although i have not yet tried it on stretchmarks yet. Because those are in the areas that are quite difficult to reach. I do hope they come in bigger rollers and longer handles for those mentioned hard to reach areas. Try it and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I love this! My pores on my nose and cheeks have always been large. I&#x27;ve started using the Derma Roller every other day and my pores have shrunk drastically!</li>
    <li> I am new to this product, but can already see that it will be of benefit if I can just discipline myself to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, .05mm is better for face, but this is great for thigh stretch marks!!</li>
    <li> Love my derma roller.  I thought I would give this item a try and after reading through several reviews ordered.  I have been quite pleased with it.  Meghan, from Sparkle with beauty, contacted me to find out what my experience was with the roller.  I was only using it once a week at that time but Meghan suggested it was safe to use teh roller up to four times a week.  We exchanged a few emails about my experience and I am about to start using the roller two times a week and will take it from there.  I use it in conjunction with the Azure naturals Best Vitamin c Serum and the Insta Natural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer and I am quite happy with my skin; it has never looked and felt better!  Meghan thank you for your follow-up - good customer service practice!</li>
    <li> This derma roller is interesting to use. It really opens the pores and feels good. I believe it can help one&#x27;s skin a great deal if used gently every day or every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed this derma roller and let it air dry. It seems that it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One possibility with a derma roller is to use it along with a skin serum. I know people that do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma Roller provided by Royal Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t got to use it near as much as I would like to, but my skin feels younger each time that I get to use it!</li>
    <li> love this my pores have got more small and my scars look like they are clearing..</li>
    <li> I find the Derma Roller 1.0 to be very helpful with two scars that I have - one is on my leg from minor surgery and the other is on my face from a mole removal that required stitches. Both scars are more even with my skin (instead of having large indentations) and have helped to bring the skin color of the scars closer to the surrounding skin. Careful not to use it too often and allow your skin to heal. I find that using a pure hyaluronic serum afterwards helpful.</li>
    <li> Wow this works. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 months now to remove a scar on my forehead and it has been slowly fading. I never really thought this would ever work. Definitely recommend derma rollers.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical to use this product and had a few.questions prior to using it. I contacted customer service and they responded within the hour!!! I felt at ease in going ahead with it. The sensation is very different than what I&#x27;m used to. It does hurt a bit but you can control the pressure. My face has been getting much clearer and smoother since using this. Stay consistent and you will see results. I use.the roller every other night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> I love my derma roller.  What I love more, is dealing with Sparkle with Beauty.  I have never had a customer service person reach out to me as quickly and efficiently as from this company. I was asked how the product was working for me very quickly after purchasing it. I had a couple questions and I was responded to immediately.  I usually do not receive that kind of service. I would definitely recommend Sparkle with Beauty to anyone looking for a good product and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and love the result.  Ordered for my son to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using the roller on a burn I had since I was a child and the burn scar is fading, Ilve this item</li>
    <li> Five things about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. This size (1.0 mm) works well for the face.  I use it around my eyes where the problem areas lie.&lt;br /&gt;2. After running the roller across the skin, I use a vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve made this roller part of my nightly skin regimen.  It only adds a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. It pricks and stings a bit but it&#x27;s manageable.  I didn&#x27;t need any type of numbing cream.&lt;br /&gt;5. It does take time to work.  Don&#x27;t be discouraged!</li>
    <li> Amazing product.I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I been using but i stop for over week noq because my spot got dark is thisnormal</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in my facial skin texture in just two weeks. I am trying to diminish salicylic acid burns which have scarred both cheek areas. So far, my skin seems to respond to the 1.0 micro needles. The scars are less raised and my pores appear smaller. .Before using the Derma Roller, make sure you use a light moisturizer if your skin is naturally dry.  Note:  Skin can be irritated with daily use.  Every other day or 3x week worked better for me. Afterwards, I apply a Vitamin C &amp; E serum.  For any serum, please read the recommended instructions.  Don&#x27;t over apply as it may burn or cause a short stinging sensation after using the Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> Does it do anything? Who knows. Probably not, but I have not been hit by a meteor, so 3 stars I guess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a solid item, just not effective in my estimation.</li>
    <li> This derma roller from Royal incorporates 540 of the more advanced 1.0mm needles. It is well-made, with a detachable and replaceable swivelling head and a comfortably-curved handle. It is sanitary white color and comes with a plastic storage case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to clean the titanium head with alcohol both before and after use. I would also advise washing and rinsing the face and hands thoroughly before applying the alcohol, and to give the alcohol time to evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a good bit of pressure to actually puncture the skin and cause bleeding, but I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to be so aggressive with the first few treatments. Moderate pressure, carefully applied in repeated sweeps of the area to be treated, will have a noticeable effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma roller makes the skin sting as if from a mild sunburn, a very tolerable and maybe even somewhat pleasant sensation. The action of the tiny needles on the derma roller&#x27;s rotating head stimulates the body&#x27;s inflammatory response, setting off the production of cytokines and a complicated biological defensive process against the irritation, including vasodilation and a concentration of specialized cells that protect and repair the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of the derma roller followed by application of an effective skin serum will increase the benefits of either treatment. The ideal time to use the derma roller is at night after a shower or bath and before going to sleep, because the skin can then repair itself overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A derma roller was provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a month (5 times total) and maybe that is not enough time to reduce any wrinkles. I see no improvement. I just don&#x27;t know how often you are supposed to use it? I understand it takes 30 days to produce new skin so I&#x27;ve heard not to use more than once every 30 days. Then I read the 1.0 microneedle unit should be used once every 2-3 weeks. The email purchase follow-up I received from Royal states use it &amp;#34;consistently&amp;#34;. How often is that?</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected but maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Derma Roller for about a month and my skin does feel smoother and looks brighter. I&#x27;ve been applying vitamin C serum after using the Derma Roller so I&#x27;m thinking the combination of the two work together. The Derma Roller itself does leave a tingling feeling which to me means an increase in circulation. Also the Derma Roller helps any serum or moisturizer reach deeper into the skin. This is a good value compared to having a similar treatment performed in a spa.</li>
    <li> GREAT company!!! The first one I got had pretty dull needles that left some scratch marks so I e-mailed them and let them know and made sure I was using it right (because it was my first time). They said because the needles were dull they would send me a new one for free of course and I got it in about 2 days. They made sure I was happy with it and gave me lots of information! The new one works great!!! I use it with vitamin E serum and I&#x27;m getting great results for old acne scars!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the potential results but after using the Derma Roller for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. There is a definite diminishing of even deep wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been doing it every two or three days, and I use Vitamin C Serum and a moisturizer after use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not painful. Wonderful costumer service</li>
    <li> I love my derma roller! It helps my skin to absorb my beauty products better. I have seen a noticeable difference in skin texture and pore size. Would definitely recommend .</li>
    <li> my wife was anxious to get it and after using it once did not care for it. Her face broke out badly and did not ever use it again due to the initial result</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
    <li> A cute little gadget in its very own cute carrying case...I love the tingling feeling ....A very unique massage to my face. My daughter has it now so I am ordering another one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a total of 4 times since it arrived last week. I love the results so far in combination with my vitamin C serum. Easy to use, no problems. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s a must have for women who are looking for a solution for that under the skin acne. Great price and arrives quickly</li>
    <li> Great product. At first i was afraid to use because of the many needles and afraid of hurting my face. After a couple of light pass thrus on my forehead i was able to bear the pokes and go a little harder. After my treatment, my face felt numb. I apply a hyaluronic acid serum after every treatment. I use this product twice a week and have since notice the lines on my forehead has lessened. I am thinking of getting the wider tool to try on the stretchmarks on my thighs</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! Use it everyday and your blemishes and acne scares will fade away!! (Make sure to clean with with alcohol after every use) and finish off with a good facial moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Derma Roller for a month and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  My skin usually dries out in the winter and feels tight after wearing makeup all day.  Since I&#x27;ve started using the Derma Roller I&#x27;ve noticed this is not a problem.  My skin is so soft now with no dry, tight feeling.  I have had a psoriasis spot above my eyebrow for months and nothing I&#x27;ve tried makes it go away...until Derma Roller.  I use the roller every other night and always use vitamin C afterwards, I also apply a toner before using.  Yes, it is a little painful until you get used to it but I have found it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s very important to clean the roller with alcohol before or after use.</li>
    <li> The roller was delivered on time. Before it arrived the company contacted me with some great basic info. They also gave me customer service info. In case I needed to contact them. I have only been using the product for a week so i have no real results to post hence the  3. This product I feel will take a month or more of dedicated use to see results. I am excited as I do expect results. It is a little awkward to use the first few times and it is not exactly painless. I purchased a new lighted magnifier mirror for my vanity so I will keep you posted as the weeks go by. I am a senior with a few wrinkles and a few acne scars. I have some slight uneven shading, caused by aging. At this point I can see some slight evening of skin tone.  Since my budget doesn&#x27;t have room for fillers and injections i will spend the time with this product and see what happens. More later and let&#x27;s hope I will then post 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money as I see the results in her face.  I would caution that if you have sensitive skin, try to ease into it.  Don&#x27;t need to use it daily or press too strongly in the beginning.  Once a week with light presses should help your skin adjust.  I am just guessing though.</li>
    <li> I love it--It&#x27;s been about 1 month since I received the Royal Derma Roller and have been using it with Rejuvelle Vitamin C.  I am starting to see the wrinkles around my mouth and eyes lessen by quite alot.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> This derma roller is phenomenol! My skin is looking like a million bucks!!!:-) Talk about getting that skin to FINALLY look the way you have always envisioned. I now use once a week, but starting off doing it every day for about 2 weeks. Amazing results! Will not disappoint. And I used my vitamin-c serum immediately after. Thank you makers of dems roller!!!</li>
    <li> Good roller, good quality. Not too painful.</li>
    <li> Okay this thing is awesome. I have milia, the under the skin acne that takes years to go away. The dermatologist prescribed retin-A which I&#x27;ve been using for a year and half without much improvement, but after a week and a half of using this they are almost all gone! And in only two weeks I&#x27;m already seeing a marked improvement in pore size, skin discoloration, scarring. I Love The derma roller! Also using it with vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> The Micro Derma Roller is now my best friend. I have used it on my scalp for my thinning crown and it has really helped me keep the strands that I have. I&#x27;m using it on my face, under my arms, under my eyes for my dark circles and it is also helping. I have used it on my surgery scar and I&#x27;m seeing results there too. Thank you so much for this tool. I wished that I had found it earlier.</li>
    <li> works as well than the R&amp;F product - no idea if it actually works though</li>
    <li> Received in good working condition and good received on time.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and met my expectation and I think everyone should have it. Good price and quality</li>
    <li> Wanted to wait a month or so before posting my review. And yes… this works! and its amazing, i recommend it</li>
    <li> I like the device and have started to notice some changes in my skin</li>
    <li> This is amazing, have only been using for about 2 weeks and already there is a considerable improvement with the sudden acne scars I had. Tried many scar creams for months, nothing worked, I was getting worried. So happy I found this. Have been using with vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;Please be advised, this product does hurts. If you cannot take a little pain, do not buy</li>
    <li> I had an idea about using this differently, in a way that is helping me. I purchased it to use for 3-in-1-acupressure-acupuncture-moxibustion. Of course, this Derma Roller does not administer any of these traditional oriental therapies directly, but the principles are present in the device according to use.   As you probably know, traditional “Oriental” (not just Chinese but Indian/Ayurvedic) medicine attributes most, if not all, ailments, whether mild or serious, to blockage-congestion, weakness or over-activity within one or more of the meridian paths (electrical conduits) that run through the human (and animal) body. By applying needles in acupuncture, or finger pressure in acupressure, and/or heat through moxibustion to specific points along a disrupted meridian, blockage is relieved and the natural flow of energy resumes, which aids in resolving the ailment. Because the Derma Roller has needles that press in as it is moved, it can function somewhat like acupuncture and acupressure together (massage too), and because it generates heat in the skin, a simulative moxibustion effect is achieved.  If you have a meridian that you know is out of balance (for example, a cough would probably indicate the lung-large intestine meridians, which is what I used the Derma Roller for), you can find a meridian chart online and then roll the Derma Roller along the path of that meridian until you have pink/red “tracks” on your skin that match the lines on the chart, indicating that you have stimulated and warmed up all the major acupuncture/pressure points along that meridian. I rolled in a downward direction because I intuited that I needed to push energy “out” (I think “dispersing” is the word in the traditional medicine), but there might be benefit in rolling upward in certain cases, I do not know. You will know you are on the right “track” if you hit sore spots along the way, in which case you can apply a bit more pressure to those spots and work on them alittle longer. Let a week or at least three days pass before another treatment, I think (I did), and be sure to treat both the yin and yang meridian (the meridians all work in pairs) even if your “issue” seems only to fit just one meridian.  The Derma Roller works well also for hand reflexology, and for reflex points on the tops and sides of the feet, but for me, it did not have enough “dig” for a really good soles-of-the-feet reflexology treatment (try a spiked ball for that), but the Derma Roller, I feel, is made to order for meridian self-treatment, and because it has a handle, you can even reach the meridian lines that pass through the back and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product, however I must say now I NEVER want to be without one! It&#x27;s weird, at first, but the results are amazing! I looked like I had had Botox; no kidding! ♡</li>
    <li> Derma Roller is best tool that makes my skin flawless.  Only few days of using it,  I noticed the difference already.  I&#x27;m glas to have it.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, nice feel!</li>
    <li> It;s ok,but i dont see any visible changes on my skin as the other comments say here</li>
    <li> It seemed to work just fine.  I just don&#x27;t know much about these things.  It was great for the price but I haven&#x27;t really used it that much.  I saw one at a show recently that sold for $70.00.  You could get replacement rollers for it and it claimed to have two different length needles which according to them was a big plus.  This one has one length only and you cannot replace the roller, so after a few sessions you have to get another one.  I think it was a fair purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out, I have not had it long enough to be able to say if it works or not. I will update in several months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I have seen on my face !!!!!! What an amazing product. Very easy to use and follow instructions I totally recommend this product before paying thousands for surgery</li>
    <li> I can already see results!  I have been using it just over a month, only three days a week, and I can see the slight changes in the appearance of wrinkles.  Even more so, I can see some help with my adult perimenopausal acne.  It&#x27;s not that it is gone, but it helps with the new ones coming up, it sort of stops then from getting bigger or advancing.  I am so excited to get to the big result at three months, but for now, I am thrilled that something works, and even better something that is affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this derma roller!!  The company is the best I&#x27;ve dealt with following up and given tips for usage.  Almost immediately. I saw changes.  Ge most ntense change has been my neck and forehead which was very wrinkled and loose.  I an 65 and have smile lines and  around lip area which seems to be a little slower than forehead.  Forehead amazing!! Cannot believe my eyes.  Lip area improved a bit and so has wrinkles on Temple near eyes.  Have not seem much change with smile lines yet although they do look softer. I use this then out a vitamin C serum, and night mistress cream.  I also use witch hazel before the serum.  I think I could be a little more consistent than I am but this little tool will shock you in its quick results. But have also see an overall improvement in my skin texture.  Much softer and more even and brighter.  As I use it I will update since the lip area probably needs more usage of this derma roller.  Lip area a bit more sensitive and I therefore  probably have not used it as faithfully there or with enough pressure.   Try this one especially if you have deep wrinkles on forehead and neck as I had.  My forgead still has lines but they are no longer looking like I was frowning and deep.  They now are fine lines.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> The Derma Roller has exceeded my expectation. I&#x27;ll start off by saying the only reason I gave it  four stars is because there is some discomfort in using it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt but its uncomfortable. The discomfort however is worth the results. I&#x27;ve had black and white head issues for over a year now and could not get rid of them and since I&#x27;ve started using the Derma Roller over the last couple of weeks, they are practically gone now. I also use to have issue with oily skin which I&#x27;ve also noticed is less now. My skin looks so smooth and refine now and I&#x27;m loving it. I think it&#x27;s also important to note that I do use different oils on my face after use as the Derma Roller opens your pores. (Vitamin C/E serum, jojoba oil, castor oil and also olive oil)</li>
    <li> Love it, been using this derma roller for last 3 weeks, results are amazing. My pores seem smaller now, my skin tone evened out.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I&#x27;ve only had my derma roller for about a month now, but from the first use, I could see an improvement in my skin. Benefits for me include better exfoliation, less puffiness in the morning (I use mine at night before I go to bed), and increased moisture. I have a small area on my face that is perpetually breaking out, and the derma roller has been able to increase exfoliation  in that area as well, making it less of a bother for me. The needles do sting a bit, but it&#x27;s totally tolerable.</li>
    <li> Work well but it was squeaking while rolling. Real annoying and had to return it. Not sure if I just received a bad one or not. Worked very well except the squeaking was too noisy.</li>
    <li> love this roller ! feels tight and refreshed after use. I&#x27;m using this about every three days with organic coconut oil ! pretty good results so far ! no complaints !</li>
    <li> I received my Derma Roller......I love it!! Told my friends about it as well.  I am 64 years old and I can certainly use a tool like this.&lt;br /&gt;I have paid between 75-100 dollars on a Dermabrasion session and I did not see results at all, so I am very excited in using my&lt;br /&gt;new roller.&lt;br /&gt;I will do a follow up at the end of February and don&#x27;t forget use the Vitamin C following the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am ordering the 2 inch for my body.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using this product for about a month, and I am starting to see results. I am a bit skeptical still about using it on my face, but I am using it on my stretch marks on my lower belly and sides.</li>
    <li> Noticed an improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> This item works very good.</li>
    <li> Company goes above and beyond to make sure you know how to use this roller and that you are satisfied with it. The roller is a little nuts but effective, I use it with vit c and hyalauronic acid serum and def notice a difference a couple weeks after.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered quickly and as what it advertised. Interesting experiment but did nothing for tightning skin on legs or thigh or improving skin appearance.</li>
    <li> I got two of these derma rollers, one for me and one for my sister. We both started using them at the same time along with face serum and what a difference it makes. I don&#x27;t feel any pain when using it but my sister has minor pain but it&#x27;s worth the difference in look. Most likely we will keep using this derma roller for better looking skin.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  I had acne problems when I was younger and have acne scars, especially with pores on my face.  After using this, I can see my scars slowly disappearing and pores filling up.  Cleaning it is easy… just rinse and let it soak in alcohol.  The product is well built and comes with a handy case for storage.  Rolling is very smooth.  All the tiny needles may look a little intimidating, but using the product feels like a little massage.</li>
    <li> awesome for the price no complaints and my skin is definently improving i use it on my face for scars and have seen a difference by the second use</li>
    <li> This derma roller is a very good and high quality product, well worth the price. It&#x27;s cheap and effective.  I follow the direction the seller had provided and the result is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great roller great price! Susie melody roller is a dangerous imposter with bent uneven needles much better choice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my royal Derma Roller from Sparkle with Beauty, it&#x27;s awesome. I love the titanium needles too.  My order arrived early and it was free shipping. I started using it right away. I know that to see visible results, you&#x27;d have to wait a few weeks. I recommend buying from this vendor because the owner, Meghan followed up with me and also sent me using tips for the roller. I&#x27;d give this a 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I think it really helps the moisturizing products to asbsorb better.</li>
    <li> really works if you use it often. clears up acne, diminishes wrinkles and make large pores less visiable</li>
    <li> I love this Royal Derma Roller, it really works great! I just got it not to long ago &amp; wow what a difference in my face! I use it with OZ Naturals 20% Vitamin C Serum. I love them both together. I noticed a difference the first time I used it, but the more I use it the better my face looks. It even feels better. I use to tan a lot in the sun &amp; tanning salons, I was lucky not to get much sun damage or wrinkles from all the tanning. I did get sun spots though, &amp; it goes without saying I certainly didn&#x27;t like those. I haven&#x27;t even used the Royal Derma Roller that long, &amp; my sun spots are disappearing fast. My complexion is looking real nice. I just have to wonder how much money I have spent on all kinds of products, to get all the different results I am getting with just this Product along with the Vitamin C Serum. This is very affordable too, I don&#x27;t have to spend my hard earned money anymore on all kinds of things that don&#x27;t even work very well. I use this once a day, then right after I use the vitamin C serum. I will continue with these products, this certainly does what it says it will do, &amp; my face does have a more youthful appearance. No complaints at all from me, it&#x27;s all good! :)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and the results are amazing. The pores on my nose have are much smaller and I have new skin on my face</li>
    <li> My new favorite item!! In just in a two week period I have seen an amazing difference in my jaws. they are better lifted and I have used $1000&#x27;s of dollars on cream and treatments that said skin thighting or lifting without the results that I have had with the derma lift. I recommend using alcohol before and after using and start off with clean skin. I do follow up with a vitamin c &amp; E skin serum. I am 60 years new and my husband likes the way my face has lightened he says I glow.</li>
    <li> This works great! I had already had one, though from AMA Skincare in Irvine, but it was inexpensive enough to just keep in my travel bag! Great to combine with the Vitamin C Serum!</li>
    <li> I love this product it worked really quickly for my skin, I had enlarged pores and clogged pores and blackheads and stretchmarks and I use it on all of them and having only used it about four or five times I&#x27;ve noticed my stretchmarks beginning to subtly fade more and more with every use and my pores are definitely smaller and my acne scars acne less defined. I&#x27;m really loking forward to seeing the progress I&#x27;ll make on my a skin with more uses. Sparkle with beauty is an amazing amazon store and they&#x27;ve been so kind and genuine with helping me along my dermarolling journey, this is by far the best experience I&#x27;ve had buying something off amazon and I highly recommend this product to anyone on the fence about it. I also just have to mention how awesome it is that Sparkle with beauty personally contacts everyone of their costomers and I think it&#x27;s so great for a business owner to have that kind of dedication and genuine care for the customers. Thank you so much for this amazing tool!</li>
    <li> Patience us a virtue, I see subtitle positive changes, I would recommend👍👍</li>
    <li> I have only used this four times, so probably not enough to see any results. Have not seen any results as yet. I do not know if I am pressing hard enough or what, but it has not done anything for the few wrinkles I was trying to work on. I use Vitamin C serum after the Derma Roller.  I am going to continue using it and hope that I get results after a few more tries.  I love the case it is packaged in, very nice.</li>
    <li> I like this product. For sure I can see difference in the pore size and reduction in scar and pimple marks. This product works.</li>
    <li> I recently received this derma roller for free for the purpose of an honest review. All opinions here are my own and are not influenced in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this very long. I have only had it for a couple days. I purchased this because I have been told that they work wonders on stretch marks. I am hoping that it will minimize mine. Not that I want to take them all away, they are beauty marks from having four beautiful children. However, I would appreciate if they were less visible from a mile away haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theory of this roller is to create thousands of tiny puncture wounds to the skin which induces the release of growth factors that stimulate the production of new collagen and elastin. Creating dermal damage without removal of the healthy epidermis, as with other resurfacing techniques, means the healing time is rapid and does not cause any comparable discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, after you have used this roller, it opens up your skin to accept whatever cream or cleanser you are going to use (if you use one). This means that the serum, lotion, cream etc, will get into your skin, and penetrate better, hopefully causing better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come in numerous sizes (of needles). It is recommended that you talk to your doctor or dermatologist before using this. Also, make sure to clean this FREQUENTLY as stated on the package instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These help with pore reduction, stretch marks, wrinkles, damaged tissue, etc. I can&#x27;t wait until I start seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have had no issues with this product, and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I simply love the Derma Roller.  Oh my goodness!  I saw improvement almost immediately; my skin is so much clearer now and my makeup glides on like butter.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone that is in need of  softer, smoother and clearer skin.  Come on Divas you all need this product; you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I see a noticeable difference in my skin using the Derma Roller along with Vitamin C Serum.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item. I am a 63 year old woman in good shape but, I have noticed the start of crepe looking skin on my upper arms. I have been using this item for about a month and have noticed no difference at all. I actually think that after using it the next day, it looks worse.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you are 21 years old this works, but certainly not for me.</li>
    <li> Using the derma roller is effective for my beauty regimen.  This tool put my vitamin c and skin serums to work.  My freckles are lighter and my skin feels smooth. I liked it so much I gifted one for a family member.</li>
    <li> This roller is amazing. When I&#x27;m using it, I feel a little bit pian. After rolled all my face, i applied with vitamine C serum, i feel a lot of pain in a second. And then my face turned red. After one night healing, my skin looks good. And I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month, my winkles are almost disappeared now.</li>
    <li> I chose to use derma roller because of the dark bags under my eyes and my large pores. I use it twice a week  (for one month) and I have indeed noticed a change. The bags under my eyes are slowly starting to fade. The large pores I struggled with my whole life, are now actually starting to shrink. This is the only beauty product that has ever given me results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: After using the roller I try not to touch or scratch my face; so that I don&#x27;t cause more damage to my skin while it is healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying to use it and I&#x27;m only 25 years old male and I&#x27;m still using it. I love it. I loved how I look so good! Thank you, Best Brand Name. I&#x27;m feeling so Royal.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a friend who&#x27;s very satisfied</li>
    <li> I really like this Royal Derma Roller by, Sparkle With Beauty, their 1.0 mm derma roller works wonders on my skin and body. Using high quality titanium and 540 Microneedles all rolled up in a convenient and stylish roller; who could ask for more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very pleasant experience when using this for the first time, I used this on my scalp, face, and a old scar on my stomach. The needles on the roller are long enough to assist in the penetration of my skin and scalp, it is NOT painful, but does make my skin feel sensitive; after afew times the sensitivity went away altogether. After using this 3 times a week, for 3 weeks my skin looks and feels better, I&#x27;ve had a reduction in acne, and acne scars. And have high hopes that I&#x27;ll have more thicker hair after afew months! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this world and feel better then my old stainless steel one. I now will be throwing my old one away and solely use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This little thing is AMAZING. Especially being a guy in his 20&#x27;s on a budget who cares about improving his skin, 10000% recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than a co-pay for the dermatologist, amazing results. My acne scars are so much better, and even the forehead lines we all have are much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this thing about 8 times over the past 2 weeks, I can only imagine how my skin will improve after months of using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Get in the shower and steam, then use this while in the shower, that way the water will clean out your newly opened pores! Then I use after the shower and put on my serum.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Derma Roller for my wife for her birthday. At the beginning she was hesitant to use it but once she started, she felt the difference and started seeing results in about 2 weeks. I think it&#x27;s an awesome invention!!</li>
    <li> I received my derma roller about a month ago and I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement on my skin. I&#x27;m thinking it might take awhile before I see results, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it. Hope to see improvement soon.</li>
    <li> Of course it seems scary, running needles across your face, but once you try it, it&#x27;s not so bad! It is uncomfortable but far from painful. I use this about 3-4 times per week and have noticed a slight improvement. I highly recommend that you try it and definitely buy from this company because their customer service rocks! They truly care about their customers and I will continue to purchase from them! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like with continued use!!</li>
    <li> Derma rollers doesn’t work overnight. It requires several sessions before you can see the results. The idea is to stimulate collagen production and encourage skin cells to replace the old ones. A derma roller is made up of hundreds of micro needles that you roll on your face, particularly on wrinkled prone areas like the side of the eyes, forehead and to help remove blemishes Do not apply on moles and active acnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This derma roller is 1.0 mm long. If you are new to this, you can start with a 0.5mm. There are longer needles that are mainly used in beauty clinics or if you are comfortable with it, you can do it yourself using numbing cream. We don’t use the longer needles for personal reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a typical derma roller you see on the market. Nothing fancy, just a plain simple roller. Comfortable handle with 540 needles. They are titanium which is better because they don’t rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used a dollar store mini water bottle sprayer filled with alcohol to clean the needles before and after use. If you want to dry them quickly, you can use a hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I must admit that i go in phases where i use my dermaroller consistently and then, i don&#x27;t.  i can tell quite immediately that it is causing my skin to slough off..something my skin is very resistant to doing..when i first began &#x27;rolling&#x27;, my skin would lightly flake.  now that i have used it longer, i don&#x27;t flake as much.  i have also noticed that it helps to unclog the pores on my nose.  if i have a trapped blemish, i can use the dermaroller on just that area and within a day or so, the trapped oils/sebum/etc will usually come right out.  i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in fine lines/wrinkles or discoloration but perhaps that takes more time and consistent use.  it is definitely something i would recommend and will keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only negative, the sharpness doesn&#x27;t last as long as i would like.</li>
    <li> Love it ! What improvement in my skin .Hurts at first but u get used to it quickly. Great company to order from their always asking how the product is and how&#x27;s my skin doing with it they care</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it more than 4 times....no miracles yet!</li>
    <li> I used this dermaroller for approximately one month and noticed only minimal results. Perhaps I should continue using for longer, but I don&#x27;t believe this dermaroller will become an essential part of my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> So far no difference yet i bought this item like two months ago. I think ima stop using it.</li>
    <li> The only thing this item did for me was scratch my skin and made it look like I had been in a cat fight!  I don&#x27;t know how others are getting such good results but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Love this, I think it is working!  Noticed some fine lines disappearing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I am applying enough pressure to the roller and I am not quite sure as to how often to use it.  My husband has complimented on the difference that he sees...I am seeing some but it has only been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i used 0.25mm before and it hurts a little. I was concerned that this 1.0mm is going to hurt a lot that i might have to use numbing cream. but it&#x27;s actually the same - didn&#x27;t hurt more than 0.25mm, didn&#x27;t cause more redness than 0.25mm, didn&#x27;t require more recovery time than 0.25mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use 0.25mm once a while when i have time. i only use 1.0mm once every two months because i heard that it&#x27;s better not to disturb the collagen building process, which might take 6-8 weeks. i had to resist the strong temptation of doing it more often than that though... it&#x27;s hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have some dark spots on one side of the cheeks and after using the roller with vitamin c serum and vitamin a cream, the dark spots are getting lighter and lighter. but i can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the combination of all these or just one because i started them all together..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Derma Roller about 4 times now (I&#x27;ve had it for a month), and I really like the product. The first time I used it I was a lot more cautious about the pressure I applied while using the roller, I wasn&#x27;t sure how painful it would be, but since then I&#x27;ve become slightly more aggressive by applying more pressure. I don&#x27;t find it painful at all, after using it I do feel like I got a little &amp;#34;sun&amp;#34; and my skin is a little red,  for that reason I do recommend using the product at night. After I use the derma roller I apply my nighttime Vitamin E serum and a Vitamin C serum, I feel like those products are much more effective with my pores open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes in my complexion, my skin overall is pretty good, I just wanted to eliminate the minimal acne scaring  I have on my cheeks and the wrinkle I have on my forehead. However, I am not discouraged and will continue using this product, like I said, I don&#x27;t use it too often and I believe the changes will be gradual and progressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this product; be sure to follow the tips and guidelines.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t taken before and after pictures as recommended so I cannot really tell exactly how much my skin improved. I must say however, that I do see changes for better. I was reluctant to use in on my checks since I have a problem with broke capillaries and I am not sure If I can. I did use it tough on my forehead and around the nose. My forehead looks smoother now and the deeper wrinkles are less visible. I feel like the make up goes on smoother now specially around the nose where I always had the problem with dry skin. Overall satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I am seeing a huge difference in the bags and dark circles under my eyes. The left eye bag and dark circle is almost gone and the right eye is not far behind it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars but I&#x27;ve only had it a month and my skin isn&#x27;t perfect yet...it is however looking and feeling healthier. I use it every other evening followed with vitamin c oil and am well pleased with it and your service.</li>
    <li> This product is the best treatment have used for my melasma issues!  I have also notice a change in my skin appearance overall after just using 2-3 times a week for two months!  Yay!! I am so excited!!!!</li>
    <li> Great service!  I bought the derma roller to help with old acne scars.  I&#x27;ve used it two months now. My entire complextion has brightened.  I&#x27;m still working on the scars but even if they do not go away, the over-all improvement to my skin is worth using the derma roller.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month and I think it is helping to smooth lines. I started out pretty gently and have worked up to more pressure as my skin adapts. Well with the price and great customer service</li>
    <li> Works great and I can already see the difference! Not as painfull as I thought it would be either.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Have been using for about 1 month and I am starting to see some results</li>
    <li> I love it!  I thought I would need numbing cream, but it&#x27;s fine without,  just a little sting. I&#x27;m pairing it with a hyaluronic serum, healing cream and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for a long time, but I got some pealing from it and when the skin came off I could definitely see the different. I&#x27;m just not sure about how often I shoul used. I&#x27;m using for my face. For dark spots</li>
    <li> I am amzed how my large pores are no longer visible. My skin has a softer texture also. This company has sent additional emails to make sure that my experience with their product was successful. I appreciate their caring.</li>
    <li> The Derma  Roller really increases the effectiveness of the facial products I use.  Money really well spent.</li>
    <li> My shipment arrived on time and I have been using the roller for a few weeks now. It is simple to use and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
    <li> Great product! great results!</li>
    <li> Unsure what to expect buy pleasantly surprised with the results. I bought a vitamin A gel type lotion to help with the issues on my face. They&#x27;ve become nearly invisible with proper usage of this Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> Love this item!!! It works superbly for help with serum absorption!! Can barely feel the puncture but it is most definitely there!</li>
    <li> So far I like ,my face is soft in the morning. haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice results yet but hopeful. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> feels good and stimulates skin. I just need to remember to use it ever other night.</li>
    <li> I was terrified about this before I started. Yet, it was barely painful at first, and now it&#x27;s just routine—a routine that&#x27;s transformed my skin&#x27;s texture and has made my products way more effective at working. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it, thanks a lot for the fast shipping and the perfect product.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I had very bad acne scars and with in 3 weeks they were COMPLETLY gone after using the derma roller 2 times a week. I recommend this to everyone with skin issues bucause it will help, the only con I have is that I have a sensitive face and when ever I roll it on my far it stings and leaves my face red for hours after but it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> Using as directed, but not really seeing much of a difference</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this product...I&#x27;d never heard of it before and thought I would give it a try..I love the tingly feeling it gives you after using it..I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see what it can do to my wrinkles so I am looking forward to a smoother looking face..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six weeks now, and while I don&#x27;t see any reduction in wrinkles, I can say it  gets rid of blemishes about 5x faster than just waiting and using facewash.</li>
    <li> Works great and adds a gliw to my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s a good pain....that works!</li>
    <li> Painful to use and leaves your face stinging.  I suppose that is what it is designed to do.  But, I have had good results with creams and serums without using the Derma Roller.  I may try it again when I have forgotten the pain it caused the first time I used it. I followed the directions but was not happy with the pricking of the pins and the burning sensation afterwards.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think my skin would improve so quickly but it did. I&#x27;ve used this twice a week for my dark spots on my cheeks from acne and they&#x27;re almost all gone. Follow the instructions and use a good serum, it will help your skin a lot!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I got excellent results, and my skin continues to improve every day.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare it with, as this is the first time that I&#x27;m using a derma roller.  But this is easy to use, does not need numbing cream and I am seeing positive result already.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use very good products and like the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and notice my skin is more clear from acne. I use an acne serum right after using the roller and I do think the serum penetrates my skin better with the roller. I noticed my &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; by my mouth have significantly faded as well.</li>
    <li> I have found this to be very painful to use. My face hurts for hours after using. I have also not seen any difference in my skin. I need to find a numbing cream to use if I am going to try this again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to test on my own skin before buying one for my daughter, who has minor acne scarring.  I have only left a couple of reviews on Amazon, but I felt compelled to leave this one:  I have had 3 very deep pores on my face for years that I had to clean every day or they would fill and be dark.  Dermatologist shrugged his shoulders, like \\&quot;who cares\\&quot;, and said not much could be done without major cash.  One was on my upper lip and two on my forehead.  All pinhole size, though larger than a normal pore.  I have used this device 5 times since purchase.  I noticed improvement right away.  One pore has returned to normal, and the 2 larger ones are covered with fresh new skin.  I was concerned at first that covering them would trap any dirt/oil inside and it would be covered, but dark.  No worries!  They are both returning to normal, more slowly than the first due to their larger size.  I don&#x27;t over-use this, because of other reviews saying that the skin needs time to heal between uses.  Best of all:    My husband, friends, and strangers are all complimenting me on my skin.  I am late fifties and have always taken good care of my skin.  However, as we age, things \\&quot;pop on\\&quot; like little bumps, scars, tags, etc.  These are all improving with this device.  I use it from hairline to bra line :-)  Seller personally followed up after purchase - rare these days.  VERY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Been using for a few months and no change yet</li>
    <li> i really like this product. I&#x27;m being patient with the results as the reviews stated. I will order another one maybe in December.</li>
    <li> Been using it about a month,,,,, so far so good but I can not see any great change YET.. I can feel that is does open my pores, so hope the vit c I put on afterwards gets in down deep.</li>
    <li> Love Love  Love this product.  I see such a diffeence in the texture of my skin after only 6 uses</li>
    <li> After just over a month of use, I am quite happy with this so far.  I originally purchased it to help with some acne scars on my chin, but because I keep breaking out there, I haven&#x27;t seen too many results with that problem. However, I have also been using it to help with anti aging and I really feel like there has been a positive impact on the rest of my face.  Yes, it does sting a bit during and right after rolling and the redness is similar to a sunburn but it goes away in about an hour and then it looks amazing the next morning! I was told by the company that I can use it every other day but I do 2 days in between each treatment to give my skin a chance to heal and rest.</li>
    <li> I bought it recently and so far have not noticed changes in the skin, but the feeling pleasant</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. My skin feels tighter, and my moisturizer seems to be showing what it is truly supposed to be doing....giving me that glow seeping into my skin.  I think this product should be used with a skin regimen every day prior to moisturizer application. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Only used about 4 weeks can tell it has a slight change in skin texture. In continued use I believe it will work, early in review for now.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love my derma roller, I already see a big difference in my skin and my ugly acne is gone! &amp;#60;3</li>
