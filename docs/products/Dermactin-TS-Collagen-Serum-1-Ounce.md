      <li>I have been using this product for three months now, you can see the results then, you do not see the results immediately but continue using this product, you will start noticing how great it works!</li>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a month as a scar treatment and it is working wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Excellent treatment for wrinkles.</li>

      <li>It may be a good product,but it isn&#x27;t good for me--makes my skin itch terribly,so I can&#x27;t use</li>

      <li>don&#x27;t think I look any better when I wake up than I looked the day or week before, but I do think while it&#x27;s on that my skin</li>
      <li>It is not a moisturizer, but it does make skin more flexible and resilient.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made out of a cheap plastic, and I feel like I use more serum because of the faulty dropper (too drippy).</li>
      <li>it makes my skin soooooo smooth and looking healthy and glowing..</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no retinol, vitamin C or hydraulic acid in it, so despite the good reviews, I was hesitant to anticipate too much.</li>
      <li>It has the most wonderful consistency and can be used either before or after application of other serums or gels, or, even better, can be mixed with the others to make a lovely one-step product that easily smoothes into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I love it and really work</li>
      <li>This would be good for anyone who has dry skin, wrinkles, or just wants more hydration for their skin without the oil.</li>
      <li>It helps minimize and prevent wrinkles with regular use and is a good product to use prior to make up application, making it go on more smoothly.</li>
      <li>come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
      <li>And don&#x27;t wait until u see ur first line (wrinkle)!</li>
      <li>Well worth buying.</li>
      <li>but they go much deeper than I would ever do for myself and IMO very worth doing every 3 to 4 years).</li>
      <li>This is a great serum at an unbelievable inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>I am a white 58 year old woman that has used many many products for my skin.</li>
      <li>I like it better than a cream, and is very economical compared to other serums.</li>
      <li>it really hydrated my skin well!</li>
      <li>What I have noticed is that even if I use it every night, the results seem to be consistent.</li>
      <li>Fast service!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be making my skin softer,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; more younger feeler,&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a very light weight product that gently firms your facial skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it, the skin drinks it, and it looks so fine and firm after it is a dream</li>
      <li>This stuff is REALLY good,&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
      <li>It does go into the skin fast.</li>
      <li>does not do much to my face</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet</li>
      <li>Briefly: it&#x27;s a clear, unscented gel that goes on sticky at first, then absorbs rapidly.</li>
      <li>Product needs to come with the bottle or thepackage sealed, neither were and the bottle was only 2/3 full.  </li>
      <li>I think it is not a bad product, but the fact that the bottle is not sealed makes it of low quality in my opinion!</li>
      <li>it maybe a good product, at least it soft ur skin.</li>
      <li>but with a few drops of this serum, she is alive again :)</li>
      <li>I would still, nonetheless, recommend, and I plan on ordering some more when my current supply is empty.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and you can use other products over it without any problems.  </li>
      <li>I believe that using this product along with an emu based moisturizer (not at the same time) has really helped keep my skin supple.</li>
      <li>years  YOUNG,</li>
      <li>It is not on the same level as OBAGI but as a go-to for the price point I would purchase this again as an every evening use over the whole face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helped to plump the indented areas of my skin for old scars.</li>
      <li>My mom is getting old and she is loosing the freshness in her face</li>
      <li>NOT heavy on your Skin either,&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>This clear serum helps moisturize your face and gives a natural glow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it does to increase collagen or add it, but I do use it daily and like it.</li>
      <li>My skin don&#x27;t feel soft after using this product.  </li>
      <li>But I hope the bottle is made of glass, this looks cheap plastic, not confident for the quality.</li>
      <li>It does not dry my skin out (it&#x27;s winter, presently), and it seems to tighten my skin and make my light wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
      <li>it works as well as any more expensive serum but is really reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen really any difference but could be not using long enough.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and my 52 year old skin is dewey and fresh-looking with or without makeup.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy, in fact it allows other products to stay in place, I use it over my night cream.</li>
      <li>like a lot OBAGI and usually will use their under eye serum, however, it has become more and more expensive and I wanted to see if I could get my price point down by using another product that essentially does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> There wasn&#x27;t a  smell and felt weird putting on.</li>

    <li> It may be a good product,but it isn&#x27;t good for me--makes my skin itch terribly,so I can&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I&#x27;ll share it with afriend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is REALLY good,&lt;br /&gt;its NOT heavy on your Skin either,&lt;br /&gt;It feels like putting Gel  on your face,&lt;br /&gt;I myself to, like another  review  put  it over my NIGHT creme&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be making my skin softer,&lt;br /&gt;&amp; more younger feeler,&lt;br /&gt;im  60  years  YOUNG,</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have been using it for about a month as a scar treatment and it is working wonderfully. I put it on at night after I wash my face and it gives my skin a healthy glow. It feels a little thicker and a touch sticky, but it dries weightless and you can&#x27;t feel it. It&#x27;s helped to plump the indented areas of my skin for old scars.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to receive it at my door!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting from this product. There&#x27;s no retinol, vitamin C or hydraulic acid in it, so despite the good reviews, I was hesitant to anticipate too much. Briefly: it&#x27;s a clear, unscented gel that goes on sticky at first, then absorbs rapidly. I have not tried using it under makeup or in conjunction with another facial moisturizer. What I have noticed is that even if I use it every night, the results seem to be consistent. It does not dry my skin out (it&#x27;s winter, presently), and it seems to tighten my skin and make my light wrinkles less noticeable. I am 48 years old and have combination skin and a few creases between my eyes and alongside my mouth. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the bottle. It&#x27;s made out of a cheap plastic, and I feel like I use more serum because of the faulty dropper (too drippy). Plus, after I put the cap on, no matter how careful I am, there&#x27;s always serum that gets caught under the cap and leaks outside and onto the bottle. I would still, nonetheless, recommend, and I plan on ordering some more when my current supply is empty.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Didn&#x27;t do as good as a job that I thought it would.</li>
    <li> i really liked this product--- it really hydrated my skin well!</li>
    <li> Did not do anything....</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. My skin don&#x27;t feel soft after using this product.  I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> It came when they said it would.  I mix my own face creams.  This is great and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> this works really good.  It smoothes the wrinkles and tightens puffy skin around my eyes.  Love this product.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;m a 70 yr old woman with very little wrinkling and this seems to keep further wrinkles from popping up.  It is not a moisturizer, but it does make skin more flexible and resilient.</li>
    <li> The bottles do not come sealed which did not make me happy with it. The mail agent gave my package by mistake to someone else who opened it. When I got the package back I did not find that the bottles were sealed from the factory and so I had to guess whether or not the bottles were used before I got them! I think it is not a bad product, but the fact that the bottle is not sealed makes it of low quality in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I see people use this in different ways.  I use it like a primer before putting on makeup in the morning.  It does make my face look younger, but it&#x27;s temporary.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I look any better when I wake up than I looked the day or week before, but I do think while it&#x27;s on that my skin I look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not moisturizing as if I get it on my lips it dries them out so that they peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great too.</li>
    <li> Excellent treatment for wrinkles. My mom is getting old and she is loosing the freshness in her face but with a few drops of this serum, she is alive again :)</li>
    <li> I am a white 58 year old woman that has used many many products for my skin. I come from European roots and there a lady starts working on her skin when she is young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like a lot OBAGI and usually will use their under eye serum, however, it has become more and more expensive and I wanted to see if I could get my price point down by using another product that essentially does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, I began using the Lactic Acid 50% Peel about the same time. I have used both products for a little over two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using the Dermactin at night was a good plumper for the under eye area. It is not on the same level as OBAGI but as a go-to for the price point I would purchase this again as an every evening use over the whole face. I put some water with it so I get a thin film over my entire face. I live in the Midwest where right now the winter is one of the worst for blistering cold and horrible wind chills and I have a dog I have to walk 3 times a day. I believe that using this product along with an emu based moisturizer (not at the same time) has really helped keep my skin supple. It is not a miracle cure. I have been working on my skin for years, including having had 4 deep TCA peels done by a plastic surgeon (yes, it costs a lot but they go much deeper than I would ever do for myself and IMO very worth doing every 3 to 4 years). I have a savings account deduction just for this reason so that the money will be there when I feel it time to do some work if you know what I mean. I do this for other purchases as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it did not have an alcohol derivative to it but this addition does not seem to inflame my slight rosecea (?).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three months now, you can see the results then, you do not see the results immediately but continue using this product, you will start noticing how great it works!</li>
    <li> I love the texture of this serum. It&#x27;s slimey and feels really good on the skin. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference though. Maybe it is because I have great skin already, so it&#x27;s harder to see results?</li>
    <li> I love it and really work</li>
    <li> I use eveday in the morning, I recommend</li>
    <li> does not do much to my face</li>
    <li> Great Product! Fast service!</li>
    <li> This is a very light weight product that gently firms your facial skin.  It absorbs quickly and you can use other products over it without any problems.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Product needs to come with the bottle or thepackage sealed, neither were and the bottle was only 2/3 full.  I can&#x27;t say if I like it or not as I won&#x27;t use it as the bottle was not sealed on arrival.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing.  It has the most wonderful consistency and can be used either before or after application of other serums or gels, or, even better, can be mixed with the others to make a lovely one-step product that easily smoothes into the skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and my 52 year old skin is dewey and fresh-looking with or without makeup.  Well worth buying.</li>
    <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s inexpensive and it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference</li>
    <li> This clear serum helps moisturize your face and gives a natural glow. It helps minimize and prevent wrinkles with regular use and is a good product to use prior to make up application, making it go on more smoothly. I like it better than a cream, and is very economical compared to other serums. I don&#x27;t know how much it does to increase collagen or add it, but I do use it daily and like it. This would be good for anyone who has dry skin, wrinkles, or just wants more hydration for their skin without the oil.</li>
    <li> it maybe a good product, at least it soft ur skin. But I hope the bottle is made of glass, this looks cheap plastic, not confident for the quality.</li>
    <li> I like this-- it works as well as any more expensive serum but is really reasonable.  It is wonderful under any foundation ; it creates a smooth palette.</li>
    <li> It seems to have helped with my skin and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It is filling the agne scares an leave a healthier and more even skin surface.</li>
    <li> oh my god..this product is super perfect..it makes my skin soooooo smooth and looking healthy and glowing..if you love your skin try it,worth evry peny and i am gonna but it forever</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  inexpensive and gives great results, I use it all the time. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Non-greasy, in fact it allows other products to stay in place, I use it over my night cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great serum at an unbelievable inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I keep trying. Nothing works. Guess it can&#x27;t hurt but have come to the conclusion that sunscreen with a collagen moisturizer will probably do more good than anything. And don&#x27;t wait until u see ur first line (wrinkle)! Start faithfully using it in ur late 20s to mid 30s if u can and avoid sunbathing....</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t a  smell and felt weird putting on. It might because I&#x27;m not use to serums, but didn&#x27;t feel gross. It does go into the skin fast. I haven&#x27;t seen really any difference but could be not using long enough. I guess I&#x27;m onto something next.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet so I&#x27;m still skeptical.  We&#x27;ll see if I will reorder or not.</li>
    <li> Love it, the skin drinks it, and it looks so fine and firm after it is a dream</li>
