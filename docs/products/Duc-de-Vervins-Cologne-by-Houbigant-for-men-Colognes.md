    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DV ever since I was 20, and have tried so many fragrances, probably about 30 other designer brands, but this is for me the best ever.  I stopped using it and reserved it for special occasion because it disappeared from the market for quite some time (no wonder nobody knows this brand).  Later on I&#x27;m so glad that it is available in Amazon.  DV got more compliments than all of the other fragrances.  So it&#x27;s not true that this is for the oldies.  What&#x27;s true is those compliments came from all, young Black, White and Asian.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this cologne for years... My favorite all time!</li>
    <li> Perfume is great but sprayer squirts out too much at a time. No other complaints. This is the end of this review.</li>
    <li> I say this is not for guys 18-40. I have received compliments from women but they were 40+. I do think this is near perfect for business wear. It smells like \\&quot;money\\&quot; and business is all about the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;Matthew</li>
    <li> I wear this cologne daily and get compliments and comments like \\&quot;you sure smell good\\&quot; to which I usually reply \\&quot;that&#x27;s better than the alternative\\&quot;. Have used this cologne exclusively for many years.</li>
    <li> perfect -as described and fast shipping.  THANKS</li>
    <li> One heck of an aroma.I Love it. Everybody keep asking me what is that aroma? and I tell them is duc de vervins...the best. I saw the price at Nordstrom and didn&#x27;t like it so I decided to look online..I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old, but look like I&#x27;m younger.  I bought it because I thought it smelled good, but once I put it on, my mom, sisters an the girl im dating told me it smells like Old Man.  Perhaps this is more for older women to enjoy.  I&#x27;m not sure, but the moment I tried another cologne like D&amp;G Light Blue Living Stromboli or other D&amp;G colognes at the Macy&#x27;s booth, the girls said \\&quot;Now this smells good\\&quot; and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on those.  I have not received one compliment on th Duc De Vervins.  Maybe I should go test this is 50+ country club setting or at a retirement home.  I may get more compliments.    To be fair, I thought it smelled real good, but apparently it drives away the younger (less than 55 years old) girls. Who knows?</li>
    <li> If to say that it is a very good fragrance - it means nothing, this is the best fragrance for men.</li>
    <li> My husband smells delicious.</li>
    <li> Love this timeless sophisticated fragrance. This smells so good. This fragrance can be worn casual or dressy. Great for any occasion.</li>
    <li> Product arrived damaged and leaking.  The gold leaf/paint on the cap and edge of the bottle was also damaged (bubbling) from the leaking of the content (appeared as though it could have been stored in a hot warehouse for a long period).  I had purchased this as a gift to give to my father, but the damage meant I had to go to a retail store and buy a clean and new looking bottle.  Next time I won&#x27;t risk it, because Amazon will not let you return this item.  Every time I tried to register a complaint to return, I would get a pop up that said due to the nature of the product it can not be returned.  I did send Amazon and email with pictures of the damaged product, but did not hear back from them.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents. Not always appreciated by others, but I wear it for me anyway. Masculine, green, bold.</li>
    <li> this Cologne is difficult to find in the local department stores, however it is clean, fresh and doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sweet chemical&amp;#34; odor that many of the more marketed brands have.  This is truly a unique fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just love this fragrance and glad to have it back in my collection again!!!!</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time and happy with the product</li>
    <li> This scent is clean and masculine.  I got this for my husband a few years back, in addition to a few other fragrances.  This, and Cannabis Santal are the only colognes he has requested that I buy for him again.  It&#x27;s subtle, and you can&#x27;t beat the price through amazon!</li>
    <li> This is the best!  My wife loves it, so what more do you need?</li>
    <li> What A wonderful smell...&lt;br /&gt;My friend can&#x27;t stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is unique, and very rich.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good, and the amount. You get is&lt;br /&gt;More then I expected.</li>
