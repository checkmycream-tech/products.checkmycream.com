<li> ( I live in CA )</li>
<li> However, I still like the soft smell it has.</li>
<li> She knew it was supposed to be a clear green gel, not cloudy.  </li>
<li> I am 74 yrs old with very little wrinkles!!</li>
<li> My husband gave me a gift set a few years ago with this scent</li>
<li> I have used Elizabeth Arden green tea shower gel since I received it as a birthday gift.</li>
<li> So I usually end up opening the bottle</li>
<li> Its a very thick gel, so if you have problem with pumping it up just mix in some water, it will solve the problem and it blends in well.</li>
<li> That being said, the pump was broken and I couldn&#x27;t get any of the gel out of it.  </li>
<li> but this was not packaged well and arrived with a broken nozzle.  </li>
<li> Subtle but fragrant scent!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sad to think of the others that will receive an expired Green Tea Shower Gel for Christmas this year.  &#x3D;(</li>
<li> So it is difficult to dispense the gel.</li>
<li> I still use it in the shower, but it is really inconvenient!</li>
<li> THE SCENT IS WONDERFULL...,  THE PUMP DISPENSER IS AWFUL</li>

    <li> Love this fragrance.  Nothing beats it!!! It arrived on time and just as seller describes.</li>
    <li> The pump on the bottle doesn&#x27;t work all that well. So I usually end up opening the bottle the get the shower gel out. I wore this perfume and lotion many years ago. However, I still like the soft smell it has.</li>
    <li> it is a great product for face washing is good and gental for skin I am 74 yrs old with very little wrinkles!!</li>
    <li> Love the clean scent.</li>
    <li> GREAT SOAP IN MY FAVORITE PERFUME!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and had it shipped to my mom to NY ( I live in CA ) so she could wrap it for my sister for Christmas.  It arrived in perfect condition. My mom said it was packed like Fort Knox!  Only problem was my mom said it looked cloudy.  She knew it was supposed to be a clear green gel, not cloudy.  I called Beauty Encounter and they investigated what I had purchased and said the product was indeed expired and they would issue me a call tag to return the item.  That&#x27;s all well and good except it is 10 days before Christmas and now I need to replace my sister&#x27;s gift.  And as I shop for the item yet again, I notice that Beauty Encounter has not pulled this item off of Amazon.  It&#x27;s sad to think of the others that will receive an expired Green Tea Shower Gel for Christmas this year.  &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband actually. He has been wanting this product. could not find any cheaper anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I love the product...have used it for years...but this was not packaged well and arrived with a broken nozzle.  I still use it in the shower, but it is really inconvenient!</li>
    <li> The pump does not work well. So it is difficult to dispense the gel. The gel itself is fine. It is best used by pouring it out and then you have the pump in your hand to deal with.</li>
    <li> The gel itself is great!  It smells wonderful, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  That being said, the pump was broken and I couldn&#x27;t get any of the gel out of it.  So, I replaced it with another one instead of getting another one.  I think I&#x27;d buy it again though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT ITSELF, THE SCENT IS WONDERFULL...,  THE PUMP DISPENSER IS AWFUL YOU NEED TWO HANDS TO DISPENSE WHILE HOLDING A CLOTH OR SPONGE...</li>
    <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden green tea shower gel since I received it as a birthday gift. This is a good bargain size. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas who also loved it. Goes great with the honey drops moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Will buy it again)</li>
    <li> Love this shower gel.  I got the spray fragrance too which is not as strong as perfume so it is not overpowering.  Smells fresh and clean like the outdoors.</li>
    <li> My husband gave me a gift set a few years ago with this scent and I have been in love with it ever since.  The shower gel is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Subtle but fragrant scent! I receive many compliments on it!</li>
