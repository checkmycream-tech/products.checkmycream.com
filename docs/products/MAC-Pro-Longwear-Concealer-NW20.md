      <li>Worth the price!!!</li>
      <li>I love the concealer because everybody raved that it was amazing.</li>
      <li>I used to be a sponge and powder kind of girl, but I applied this with a flat concealer brush and it looks flawless.  </li>
      <li>I often heard that MAC foundations also will cause skin irritations in many people.</li>
      <li>I gotta say this is one of my top 2 concealers.</li>
      <li>I learned about this concealer from all the rave reviews from so many makeup gurus on YouTube.</li>
      <li>It works great for that, and really lasts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The top of the bottle should have a matte finish, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>

      <li>I love this product it works so well</li>

      <li>I use it with a finishing powder on top to keep it in place.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this product.</li>
      <li>It does cover well and blends easily.</li>
      <li>but I still seem to have fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This will last and look great all day.</li>
      <li>My niece recommended I try it, and she is young, gorgeous and wears makeup</li>
      <li>Coves everything needed is great for dark circles, love it.</li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job of covering up my acne scars and it goes on very smoooth.</li>
      <li>I have used Mac&#x27;s concealer for years and thought I would purchase it on Amazon for free and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>It stays on all day, the key also it a good face primer.</li>
      <li>The top is not even straight.</li>
      <li>I ordered this after watching a YouTube video on applying full coverage concealer.  </li>
      <li>and I can not live without this product, it covers up so nicely!</li>
      <li>Other than that, great stuff....</li>
      <li>I would highly recommended it :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other concealers &amp; M.A.C is the best by far.</li>
      <li>As good as their eyeshadows and other products are, I will not use this concealer and their foundations again.</li>
      <li>Pricey and in my opinion not as good as some other concealers I have tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even close to the right color and is watery.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s watery, and not even close to the right color.</li>
      <li>The only downside is the concealer is a bit heavy, and tends to break me out a bit more than others (I try to only use it on special occasions but it works so well that I&#x27;m willing to deal with the breakouts to have the perfect coverage).</li>
      <li>I just recently used it during my bridal portraits and felt great the entire time - in the rain, nonetheless!</li>
      <li>This one is so perfect and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Accidentally broke my wife&#x27;s makeup and was able to find the exact same one she needed at a reduced price than heading out to the mall.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
      <li>Love this use it all the time when I put on eyeshadow makes it last forever</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use that much!</li>
      <li>Perfect for dark circles and corrections and lightening foundation that&#x27;s too dark with just a pump or two!</li>
      <li>too messy when pressing the top!</li>
      <li>I only wear it for special occasions.</li>
      <li>I love this, but I only use it when I have occasional period break outs.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>Love it use it everyday</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, better use other products!</li>
      <li>Color is exactly as expected but then again, I was replacing a product I was already familiar with.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t live anywhere close to a Mac Retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s not one of those concealers that you can see, it makes it look like your face is natural not cakey or orange.</li>
      <li>and now I still deal with minor breakouts and pretty severe scarring.</li>
      <li>I really am a big MAC Fan, but after using this particular concealer that everyone is raving about, I developed an ekzema around my eyes.</li>
      <li>but this makes me break out with acne like no other!</li>
      <li>Works like no other!</li>
      <li>My old concealers/foundations would begin to flake halfway through the day, and they barely covered up the red/purple scarring underneath.  </li>
      <li>This makes it a big deal when trying out new concealers.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin, a lot of freckles, and I break out once in a while, and when I wear this make-up everyone says that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; Highly recommend it.  </li>

    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve used. Stays all day and doesn&#x27;t look heavy</li>
    <li> I love this, but I only use it when I have occasional period break outs. It works great for that, and really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it would be fore everyday use though, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This is not authentic mac makeup. It&#x27;s not even close to the right color and is watery. Do not order. I ordered this online because I didn&#x27;t have time to get to the mac store. I dont recommend it.</li>
    <li> too messy when pressing the top!</li>
    <li> I love MAC products and Longwear Concealer didn&#x27;t disappoint me. My niece recommended I try it, and she is young, gorgeous and wears makeup well so I trust her suggestions. It stays on all day, the key also it a good face primer. I use ELF face primer and love it too.</li>
    <li> Very awesome product! Works like no other! A must buy for those who have tried every concealer on the market!</li>
    <li> Please realize this is a CONCEALER it is meant to be lighter than your skin and the blended in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this product. My ONLY complaint is that MAC has all of their products in glass. This is very small. It slipped from my hand once and shattered all over the floor.  I&#x27;m just not sure I am willing to pay this price again for product in glass the  length of my finger.</li>
    <li> I love the concealer because everybody raved that it was amazing. So I bought it. It does a pretty good job of covering up my acne scars and it goes on very smoooth. The only problem is when I wear it I get breakouts around my mouth (under my nose, my chin). You only have to use a little and it does a good job of concealing. Maybe I&#x27;m just sensative but I have a love hate relationship with it.</li>
    <li> Seems less thick than from the MAC store- not sure if is real MAC product.</li>
    <li> I really am a big MAC Fan, but after using this particular concealer that everyone is raving about, I developed an ekzema around my eyes. I often heard that MAC foundations also will cause skin irritations in many people. As good as their eyeshadows and other products are, I will not use this concealer and their foundations again. If you have sensitive skin, better use other products!</li>
    <li> Love this use it all the time when I put on eyeshadow makes it last forever</li>
    <li> This is a really Awesome Concealer! Is really long wear and isn&#x27;t heavy or cacky! I would highly recommended it :)</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite concealer! I have pretty bad acne and I can not live without this product, it covers up so nicely! Also, it&#x27;s not one of those concealers that you can see, it makes it look like your face is natural not cakey or orange.</li>
    <li> Pricey and in my opinion not as good as some other concealers I have tried. I prefer Yves Saint Laurent Radiant Touche Eclat highlighter and concealer if I am going to spend this kind of money on concealer.</li>
    <li> Color is exactly as expected but then again, I was replacing a product I was already familiar with.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It dosen&#x27;t crease or wear off. I&#x27;ve tried other concealers &amp; M.A.C is the best by far. Matches my skin tone perfectly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after watching a YouTube video on applying full coverage concealer.  I abso-freakin-lutely love this.  I used to be a sponge and powder kind of girl, but I applied this with a flat concealer brush and it looks flawless.  I have very dry skin, a lot of freckles, and I break out once in a while, and when I wear this make-up everyone says that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; Highly recommend it.  Worth the money!!!!</li>
    <li> nothing beats this concealer hands down</li>
    <li> If I could give 10 stars I would! This is my favorite concealer ever! It covers up so well and goes on like butter. MAC pro Longwear concealer was the 1st MAC product I ever bought and now it is my go to makeup company.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have ever tried.  I recently had a laser treatment and didn&#x27;t want to be seen in public.  I ordered this and was amazed at how little you need to cover up redness.  Go to a Mac retailer and get matched for your perfect shade as this is a very light concealer.</li>
    <li> Works great. My favorite of all concealers.</li>
    <li> Coves everything needed is great for dark circles, love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect coverage.  The only flaw is the flask that wastes too much product.</li>
    <li> Definitively is long wear. It worked for me. Worth the price!!!</li>
    <li> Love it use it everyday</li>
    <li> pretty thick. will keep.</li>
    <li> This appeared to be fake MAC. I was not willing to risk putting it on my face (especially around my eyes!) I compared to another tube of prolong wear concealer by MAC and the packaging looked very different.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works so well and it doesn&#x27;t look like I put pounds of makeup on its a amazing conceler and i will buy this again</li>
    <li> This is NOT authentic Mac Pro long wear Concealer. I am returning today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s watery, and not even close to the right color. The top of the bottle should have a matte finish, and it doesn&#x27;t. The top is not even straight. I have used Mac&#x27;s concealer for years and thought I would purchase it on Amazon for free and quick shipping. I don&#x27;t live anywhere close to a Mac Retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not MAC quality. It&#x27;s runny, watery, and waaay too orange. Even the packaging isn&#x27;t the same. If you look at my pictures and are used to purchasing this product, you will see it isn&#x27;t the same. Doesn&#x27;t even smell the same! Smells like bad sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dark circles and corrections and lightening foundation that&#x27;s too dark with just a pump or two!</li>
    <li> I learned about this concealer from all the rave reviews from so many makeup gurus on YouTube. Even with the mixed reviews on amazon I decided to purchase. I gotta say this is one of my top 2 concealers. 2nd one being glo minerals. I am 29 and try and take care of my face with lots if facials etc but I still seem to have fine lines under my eyes. This makes it a big deal when trying out new concealers. This one is so perfect and a little goes a long way. I use it with a finishing powder on top to keep it in place. This will last and look great all day. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible acne for years and now I still deal with minor breakouts and pretty severe scarring. I&#x27;ve tried everything to cover them up but had no luck. My old concealers/foundations would begin to flake halfway through the day, and they barely covered up the red/purple scarring underneath.  I went to a salon for a makeup session and they used MAC Pro Longwear Concealer - I&#x27;d never seen anything look so good on my skin! My stylist used it as a foundation and concealer, since it covers so well. I immediately went out and bought some of my own. The only downside is the concealer is a bit heavy, and tends to break me out a bit more than others (I try to only use it on special occasions but it works so well that I&#x27;m willing to deal with the breakouts to have the perfect coverage). I&#x27;m also stuck in between NW15 and NW20 - but I just mix the two to get the perfect match (make sure to blend your neck area!). This stuff has saved me! I just recently used it during my bridal portraits and felt great the entire time - in the rain, nonetheless! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this!</li>
    <li> Great concealer. I use it on an age spot and under my eyes to hide dark circles.  I absolutely love this concealer!  The only negative is that a lot comes out with each pump so I end up with a lot of wasted concealer.  One pump would cover almost my entire face.  I try to only push the pump down a little way but still end up with way too much concealer.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, but this makes me break out with acne like no other! I only wear it for special occasions. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face, but the acne is ridiculous. I never break out and I always take my make up off and never sleep in it. Other than that, great stuff.... I also hate the pump because it dispenses A LOT of make up and I don&#x27;t need to use that much! I just want a dab sometimes and to get a dab of it, is impossible.</li>
    <li> This works great but it&#x27;s a bit pricey. It does cover well and blends easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for under eye coverage.  Only need a dab size for both under eyes.</li>
    <li> Accidentally broke my wife&#x27;s makeup and was able to find the exact same one she needed at a reduced price than heading out to the mall. Fast shipping too!</li>
