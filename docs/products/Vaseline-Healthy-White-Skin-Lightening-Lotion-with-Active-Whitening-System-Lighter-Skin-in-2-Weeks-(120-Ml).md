      <li>As expect cool product, it is a good product that meets the customers need,I love it</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and really was impressed with how quickly it lightened those areas and was</li>
      <li>I ordered this one and was so happy with it, I decided to order a set of 2 large for me and one for my housemate to give for  Christmas.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and still waiting for results on the lightening</li>
      <li>We both love it.  </li>
      <li>pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Been use this lotion more than 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>It made my skin tone more even and skin texture smoother.</li>
      <li>5 stars from us :)</li>
      <li>WILL ORDER MORE IN LARGE QUANTITIES!!!</li>
      <li>It applies nicely and and has a light, barely noticeable scent that I find pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed the light scent and smooth feel of this product.</li>
      <li>It is travel sized and can fit in your purse on the go</li>
      <li>AS IT ALSO IS LIGHT SCENTED.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
      <li>I have Lupus (Discoid primarily) and my skin is always taking the hit whenever I have flare-up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>IT CAME QUICKLY AND IS EASY TO USE.</li>
      <li>Item Is Definitly Worth It !</li>
      <li>so I ordered two more after the first one I used.</li>
      <li>Have not seen any significant lightening.</li>
      <li>I wear sunscreen every day, own a wide range of BB creams and lightening lotions with and without sunscreen, and consequently am able to fairly easily detect whether a product contains sunscreen or not.</li>
      <li>but so far its pretty good except</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good whitening lotion for the low price.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t use it as much.</li>
      <li>Used the whole bottle in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>maybe I could test the time and see if it really works.</li>
      <li>Amazing but too small</li>
      <li>the price is a bit high for the size</li>
      <li>120 ML is not a&lt;br /&gt;lot if you are using the product on more than just a few spots on your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll wait a few more weeks and see if continued use on my forearms (while also using sunscreen) makes any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
      <li>Works good that leaves dryness behind.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very watery also, so be careful during application, since the high viscosity liquid tends to flow out quickly at once.&lt;br</li>
      <li>sort of sketchy aspect is that on the bottle and in product description, it claims to have \\&quot;triple sunscreen to help prevent further darkening caused by the sun\\&quot; but never tells you how much SPF is contained within it.</li>
      <li>This product gave me an itchy rash on my abdomen, which no other lotion has ever done.</li>
      <li>get really dark marks on my skin which can be seen clearly from even far away</li>

<li> Bottles are too small.</li>
<li> It does work and it smells weird .</li>
<li> One week later, I used it again and the itching and rashes was sooo terrible.</li>
<li> But It Isnt All That Bad .&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <li> Amazing but too small</li>
    <li> This product gave me an itchy rash on my abdomen, which no other lotion has ever done. I discontinued use, so I can&#x27;t speak for how well it lightens skin.</li>
    <li> I have allergies to this product</li>
    <li> this product works really good!</li>
    <li> No difference in son time whatsoever. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like this product as a lotion, but I bought a very small sized bottle and have not used it long enough to notice any real lightening of sun spots. It applies nicely and and has a light, barely noticeable scent that I find pleasant.  I wish I had purchased a larger size now, though I haven&#x27;t decided whether or not I will purchase another one at this point.  I&#x27;ll wait a few more weeks and see if continued use on my forearms (while also using sunscreen) makes any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> My daughter bottle is bigger than this bottle!!! Used the whole bottle in 2 weeks. Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> Bottles are too small.</li>
    <li> amount to little to see any results.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again, only if they carry bigger ones.&lt;br /&gt;Then maybe I could test the time and see if it really works.</li>
    <li> As expect cool product, it is a good product that meets the customers need,I love it so I ordered two more after the first one I used.</li>
    <li> This product causes rashes</li>
    <li> Its great, but it took quite awhile to receive</li>
    <li> Did work as well as I wanted it too.</li>
    <li> I like it alot, this product I just got in the mail today. It is travel sized and can fit in your purse on the go and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and still waiting for results on the lightening but so far its pretty good except the price is a bit high for the size but thats about it. The writing is in english for me. (not arabic like other people says)</li>
    <li> I have received mine without leak.  Works good that leaves dryness behind.  I will use this from this day on.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> i didnt know that it would be this small!what the heck for the amount i paid?uggh,i guess i should have read and calculated it in my head!what a bummer!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL! WILL ORDER MORE IN LARGE QUANTITIES!!! -MT</li>
    <li> This products works, although it does dry my skin out. I&#x27;ve been using with jojoba oil and it greatly helps to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one and was so happy with it, I decided to order a set of 2 large for me and one for my housemate to give for  Christmas.  Best purchase made.  We both love it.  5 stars from us :)</li>
    <li> This product gave me rashes. I stopped using it thinking it could be something else. One week later, I used it again and the itching and rashes was sooo terrible. Search the net and you will see some people having the same reaction. Out to trash it went. Beware!</li>
    <li> Watery to the point that I cannot consider it a cream or lotion.  Have not seen any significant lightening. Then again its so watery I just don&#x27;t use it as much.</li>
    <li> It does work and it smells weird . I like vaseline and I will continue to use their products . Just not this one</li>
    <li> Nice product....after two months of using product I clearly see a slight difference. It has a nice smell too..will buy again</li>
    <li> I Purchased This Item About A Month Ago And I My Skin Has Lightened A Lot !&lt;br /&gt;It Has A Peculiar Smell But It Isnt All That Bad .&lt;br /&gt;This Item Is Definitly Worth It !</li>
    <li> I enjoyed the light scent and smooth feel of this product. It&#x27;s very watery also, so be careful during application, since the high viscosity liquid tends to flow out quickly at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One sort of sketchy aspect is that on the bottle and in product description, it claims to have \\&quot;triple sunscreen to help prevent further darkening caused by the sun\\&quot; but never tells you how much SPF is contained within it. Personally, I don&#x27;t believe it contains sunscreen (if that matters to you). I wear sunscreen every day, own a wide range of BB creams and lightening lotions with and without sunscreen, and consequently am able to fairly easily detect whether a product contains sunscreen or not. This product has no SPF, so wear it at night before bed/after showering or layer it with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase the largest size you can, the amount given in the default 120 Ml for a lotion that&#x27;s designed for all-over body and calls for twice per day application is simply not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good whitening lotion for the low price. Slightly impressed. It made my skin tone more even and skin texture smoother.</li>
    <li> I have Lupus (Discoid primarily) and my skin is always taking the hit whenever I have flare-up.&lt;br /&gt;I get really dark marks on my skin which can be seen clearly from even far away and it takes a&lt;br /&gt;very long time for the dark marks to clear up on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and really was impressed with how quickly it lightened those areas and was&lt;br /&gt;very pleased with the results. My only complaint is that the bottle is very small. This product should&lt;br /&gt;at least come in a standard sized option like the other Vaseline body care products. 120 ML is not a&lt;br /&gt;lot if you are using the product on more than just a few spots on your face.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS JUST AS I ORDERED. IT CAME QUICKLY AND IS EASY TO USE. THE SMELL IS NICE AS IT ALSO IS LIGHT SCENTED.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT I WILL BUY AGAIN . ALSO GREAT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells very good.  I have not noticed any lightening in my skintone.  I would like to purchase a larger size though.</li>
    <li> Been use this lotion more than 2 weeks. But no different.</li>
