<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it alot, but works well</li>
    <li> I love it. First very good price, 2nd very fast delivery</li>
    <li> With the addition of the ability to wash this item under the water and trim your eyebrows, the open blade usually found on the tip of ear and nose trimmers was removed and replaced with a standard beard trimmer in the spine of the tip of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one is a big fan of sticking trimmers in their ear or nose. If you notice, you have to stick a lot of plastic inside your ear and nose to even get to the trimmer part and then its only on one side if the plastic spine. As you would change a tire have to crank this thing around in your nose and ear and then and have this plastic piece that way in there that isn&#x27;t cutting anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are worthless. Unless you have to use trimmers just to get to the opening of your nose or ear than these have nothing to do with being nose and ear trimmers and just a washable eyebrow trimmer.</li>
    <li> A great product. Works fine on ears, nose, eyebrows, mustache,.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice. The first time I got while in the USA. I used the product for many months and had no problems. However, after I brought it to the Philippines for a couple of months it gave out. So upon returning to the USA, I purchased another. However, in less than a year it died as well. I am chalking it up to the humidity here.</li>
    <li> Worked great for two weeks, but then the razor did not turn on.  Checked the battery, but the off/on switch was broken. Although this razor did a nice job, I would not buy another one.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, does a very good job and is water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;To avoid any damage, always clean after use, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as they claim.</li>
    <li> It works great... Easy to use... Not much more to say about this product, but I would recommend it to anyone...</li>
    <li> Does all of the necessities and is very nicely constructed. This shaver is very easy to use and clean and comes at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Philips trimmer that I had for years that finally gave the ghost. Now I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long. It cuts nose hairs without pulling (we all know that feeling!) and the bend in the tip helps to get into ears better. I&#x27;d say this is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Int the words of the immortal Charles Barkley ....&amp;#34;Tuuuurable&amp;#34;. They have never worked well and doesn&#x27;t clip any hair at all.</li>
    <li> Works great! This is the second one of these I have ordered. It works great! Wish it came with a carrier.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I learned of the trimmer at my local Barber Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They use one every day for trimming the hair in patrons ears and their eye brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is used often and found to be very durable.</li>
    <li> Does what is claimed. Very easy and safe to use. So far has lasted more than a month of regular use with still the original battery.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I bought this one and have been completely satisfied so far.  It has worked even better than the reviews indicated and the price is right.  If it stops working, the trimmer is cheap enough to just replace it.</li>
    <li> This is really a good nose and ear trimmer.  I&#x27;m very particular about trimming nose and ear hair.  I used to use an old Norelco battery operated razor for about 20 years.  The blades finally wore out and I was left with the problem of replacing it.  Ordered this product and now I am completely satisfied with its performance.  As always, the packaging is the most complicated - the product is sealed as tight as Fort Knox.  Gee, I wish they could make packaging more simple to get into.  All in all, this is a very good product and does a very fine job.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My first ever nose-mower. Opted for it because the clipper-head design seemed better than rotaries. Results: good battery life, many uses with no reliability problems. Does an excellent job along all areas where the nostrils extend from the wall of the face. What a nice feeling to get that stuff shaved down to a very short stubble!     Downside: The 1/2-inch long head does not reach the concave divot area at the base of each nasal cavity just above the mustache area -- principally because the clipping mechanism doesn&#x27;t start until about 1/4 inch down from the tip of the head, and with this design that&#x27;s the only part of it that can reach that area. If you&#x27;ve got a garden of reeds growing in there as well, you&#x27;ll need a 2nd rotary trimmer to reach them... or a pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> This Norelco had some good reviews, but some said it needed more power. I don&#x27;t find that to be a problem as it handles all of my needs quite well. A good product and a good price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I have had three from the most expensive to the chain-pharmacy-bought cheapest. Its design is genius, though its engineering may be the reason it took a company that actually designed shavers for decades to actually produce this innovation. All other nose trimmers are locked into a tube-shaped design with a spinning circle of blades entrusted with the task of trimming your nose hairs. The problem with that design is that there is nothing holding the hair in place when the blade hits it (as on an electric razor which first captures the hair), so the hair can bend away from the blade. Depending only on speed and sharpness of the blade is the deficiency of an architecture that is hit and miss, and, if you push too hard to \\&quot;help\\&quot; catch the hair, you can cause a pinch of skin. Trying to trim ear hairs with a tube-shape is useless (you can actually hear when it cuts hair, which is rare). Eyebrows are not even on the menu. Norelco has simply reproduced a miniature--no, make that micro-shaver and placed it on the side of the thin, slanted tube. I have never trimmed my nose hairs with such efficiency and comfort. Ear hairs are also amazingly cut on the first pass. And the attachment for eyebrows makes the results as good--and as simple--as when my barber does it for me. I immediately bought two more for family members. Two year warranty. All literature indicates it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim nose hair.  Philips went out of their way to add features to keep this product from pulling your hair.  Unfortunately, all those features keep it from doing a good job.  It was a waste of money to me.</li>
    <li> not working after third replacement. when it works it is fine but unreliable. I think this has basic design problem with on-off poor contact that should have been simple mechanic.</li>
    <li> I used this once without any problem.  When I tried to use it a second time, it would not work at all.  Replaced batteries--still wouldn&#x27;t work.  Would recommend you stay away from this item.</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer for a month and it died on me. It did not fall and it was well kept in my bathroom cabinet. Just not reliable</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for the same product..... liked the trimmer but was lost in a move.</li>
    <li> inexpensive and effective.  You can use it on more than just your nose and ears.  It&#x27;s great for trimming in hard to reach areas, or sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Great value nose/ear hair trimmer. Designed well. As others have stated, keep it clean with the included brush and frequent rinsing, and you&#x27;re all set. Can even clean up around sideburns and edge beards in a pinch if needed.</li>
    <li> Bought in February 2014.  Died in October 2014.  8 months.  Would have hoped for a full year :(  Get what you pay for I guess.  Guess what hubby is getting for Christmas...and not this model!!!</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> after two or three times of use it stopped working. I bought another one and the same thing happen again. all happen in a 4month time frame</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a rotary trimmer before, I switched to this one because the old one wasn&#x27;t working well anymore and this one works great. I&#x27;d recommend it and as long as it has a long lifespan I&#x27;ll get the same one next time. Cuts close with out irritating the inside of my nose.</li>
    <li> The NT9110 is absolutely awesome. Having used many devices over the years this one beats them all! It is great!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product.  It was like using a chainsaw blade to cut one piece of hair.</li>
    <li> good trimmer that is so indispenable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works well in wet and dry conditions, easy to operate, and just needs one AA batt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only issue is what do i do with it when the trimmer is not sharp anymore. hmmm... something to think about.</li>
    <li> In the past I had two Panasonic trimmers.  The first one worked fairly well for several years then died.  Although it is supposed to be water resistant it appeared have gotten water inside, which killed the motor. I then purchased the Panasonic ER421KC.  It was a disappointment.  While similar to the older model I had, the screen on this is too thick to cut closely.  It also does not seem to cut a well and misses a lot of hairs.      I decided to purchase this one and am very happy.  It cuts very close, and very quickly.  It is much better than either of the Panasonic trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  The only gripe I have it that you can feel the blade against your skin a little.  It&#x27;s not painful, and almost tickles.  At first it&#x27;s a weird sensation, but you soon get use to it.      It is supposed to trim eyebrows but I&#x27;ve had mixed success with that. Maybe it&#x27;s my technique and I just need to practice more.  However I did not buy it for that so this is not an issue for me.    I&#x27;m very satisfied with this trimmer and can recommend it.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT DO WHAT IS MADE TO DO</li>
    <li> I was using a 15 year old Panasonic trimmer and the Phillips Norelco has superior trimming capabilities. Too bad it&#x27;s not offered with an LED which would make it much easier to see untrimmed hairs. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars. Performance wise this is an excellent trimmer. Although I&#x27;ve only used it three or four times as others have said, you need to flush it with water after use &amp; use the supplied brush to clean it. That is clearly stated in the instructions. Does a fair job on eyebrows (with supplied eyebrow trimming attachment) but an excellent job on nose &amp; ear hairs if you can see them. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto para la higiene personal. No jala los pelos como otros productos utilizados anteriormente y tampoco molesta la vibracion del equipo, por ende no produce cosquillas. 100/100</li>
    <li> Product lasted three months with minimal use and stopped operating for no apparent reason.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little baby for several years now, and I am very happy with it.  I bought it for nose hair but use it for ear and eyebrows also.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> I got one of these because, as I get older, I noticed more nose hairs and more ear hairs.  Gross, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that was hassle free (I don&#x27;t want to oil and clean something after every single use), but that was powerful enough to cut those ugly hairs with a swipe or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bad boy fulfilled my expectations.  I run this over the rim of my ears and all the hair disappears.  I swirl it in a nostril and all the nose hairs are gone.  It worked so well at home, I got one for work for when I forget to use it at home and need a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 4 months ago and I use it once every week. So far it&#x27;s been working fine. This is the first product like this I ever used since before I really didn&#x27;t have any hair to trim from my nose and ears. I haven&#x27;t replaced the battery in all this time so the battery lasts quite long. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the product. I don&#x27;t give it all 5 starts because it takes me like a couple of minutes to trim the nose hair, in other words, it&#x27;s a kind of slow process... not sure if other products would do it faster though.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well for eyebrows and other areas but is too large and clumsy to effectively trim nose hairs or ear hairs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty effective trimmer. The cleaning process is made easy with its water feature. For the money it&#x27;s a great product to ad in nose hair removal</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> I own a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and his feet need constant trimming.  I have a lot of hard wood floor and he&#x27;s clumsy so having trimmed feet really helps him.  I found that clipping with those tiny siccors just took way too long, and I&#x27;d make mistakes and nick his pad. Also my hand would be hurting pretty bad.  When you need to do this once every two weeks (I really like the way it looks when it&#x27;s done every week), it can be a real time suck.  So I thought this might be a great alternative!  At first I bought this pink one at a local grocery store with detatchable guards to control the length of the cut by conair.  But I found that the AAA batteries it required would just lose power after about 5 minutes and I think after all 4 feet where done, they where definitely duller than when I started.  Cavaliers have extremely fine hair, much more fine than other dogs, perhaps some types of cats would compare?  Either way, this makes it hard for most trimmers to catch the hair to cut it, but this worked great.  It only stopped on me once after the 3rd paw and running it under water did the trick.  You have to be sure that the unit has time to dry before you start again, otherwise the wet hairs jam the thing.</li>
    <li> This product barely cuts any hair at all. Probally works if you have fine hair but if you have real hair forget about it.</li>
    <li> My first nose hair trimmer was a generic $7 rotary model purchased from the grocery story.  It works to a degree, but it&#x27;s loud, pulls hairs, and is hard to clean without loosing its small internal blade.  This trimmer is a much better value because it comes with guards to buzz down your eyebrows and works well to cut off your monobrow.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The design of the single stick is a little difficult to get used to using, but after a few tries it can do a great job.  Some hairs can grow deep, so its slim design comes in handy.  Have been using for a few months and i am very pleased.</li>
    <li> The quality is very good, very satisfied</li>
    <li> Same as everyone else said-- I bought it, it worked great, it died within 30 days. Broken. I sent it back and got a new one for free, and it lasted even less than a month. The only thing you can rely on with this product is its unreliability.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews for this before buying, and with that knowledge in hand I&#x27;ve had no problems. I wash it off after every use, and I&#x27;ve never had problems, and I&#x27;m confident if I do have a problem, I can soak it in warm water and get it to work.</li>
    <li> This product is fine. But the manufacturer is an idiot - they packaged it in hard plastic that was the most difficult package I have ever tried to open in my life (now 76 years). I cut myself three times and had to use shop shears to open the damn thing. For an inexpensive thing such as a nose hair trimmer? Who steals those? Please be sure that NORELCO gets this comment - not the retailer, who tells me he has had the same problem with one he bought for his son. I&#x27;ve used NORELCO razors exclusively since 1965 but this miserable experience tells me that the next one might just well be from another manufacturer. I am furious.   RE Goodwin</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]  I find it very easy to use and very effective and effecient.</li>
    <li> It may seem like a small thing, but this kind of cleanliness is important to me. This device works so much better than similar, less substantial devices that cost just about the same. And hopefully it will last longer.</li>
    <li> Im pretty sure the average life of these things should be more than 3 months (less than 10 trims) but this thing croaked on me pretty fast. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product actually works pretty darn well, when it is functional.  I bought one of these and really liked it.  However, it broke within one week.  I don&#x27;t even have much nose hair.  I just like to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured maybe that was a fluke and went out and got another one.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be worth my time to get the company involved and try to get a free one.  I figured I would just pop over to the store and get another one.  I did, and it broke after about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have had enough and will be trying a different nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> This product works the best out of all that I have tried.  I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the rotary trimmers and the Conair type but nothing is as good as this one!  It was the most expensive but is absoultely the best in doing the nose hair trimming.  I read the reviews about how unreliable it was and those reviews were old (back in 08 and 09.  They must be doing something different because this unit comes with a 3 year warranty -- that&#x27;s unheard of in this line of appliance.  Definitely gives the closest trim with no discomfort.  I&#x27;m buying a second one for use at my condo on the beach -- I&#x27;d give this thing 6 stars if that were possible!!</li>
    <li> I used it approx 1.5 times, and it started \\&quot;laboring\\&quot; then stopped all together.    Plus, the cutter part is difficult to use...you can&#x27;t tell if you are making progress.</li>
    <li> you couldn&#x27;t ask for a more elegant design for a product whose business end meets an inglorious task.  the thing just doesn&#x27;t last, though.  the batteries outlast the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that said, the thing is so much better when it is working than anything else i have seen, i replace the broken one with another one just like it.  &amp;lt;sigh&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can we get norelco&#x27;s attention and have them fix the inside without mucking up the outside?</li>
    <li> My almost constant nose itch stopped immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I always thought allergy or worse.&lt;br /&gt;After about a half second of sting (only on first use), I moved it closer&lt;br /&gt;to the skin and it was smooth.  Apparently it cuts all&lt;br /&gt;hairs and closer.  I also think this would mean a longer&lt;br /&gt;time before it needs to be cut again, but since I have&lt;br /&gt;only had it for a week, I can&#x27;t speak for repeated use.</li>
    <li> My husband only used it less than 5 times then it didn&#x27;t work anymore.  We couldn&#x27;t return to amazon because it has passed the 30days return policy but this product has the 60days money back warranty, we shipped it to the manufacturer.  So far we still haven&#x27;t received our money yet.  It has been 2 weeks now.      The trimmer itself is more convenient than using scissors but you need to insert it deeper which is not comfortable.   Update: I received the check from the company already.  Phew! It&#x27;s a full refund.</li>
    <li> I am not sure about following the instructions to a T but I figured out how to get the results I am looking for with my own technique. Works well for nose hair, I dont have ear hair (Yet!) so I cant tell you about that. Also works for eyebrows with guard.</li>
    <li> I bought this item knowning it had mixed reviews but still thought it was cheap enought for me to give it a try....It worked for the first week and now it doesn&#x27;t even turn on..\\&quot;lifeless\\&quot;...what a piece... do not buy</li>
    <li> I have not experienced any issues with the unit breaking, and have been meticulous in cleaning the thing.  It works pretty well, but not as well as tweezers......like most old guys, I have way too much hair to deal with......I will continue using the thing, but won&#x27;t give up the tweezers any time soon.....</li>
    <li> The product is excellent, really first-rate.  But to get it out of its vacuum-molded, heavy-gauge plastic packaging, you&#x27;re going to need the following:  * heavy leather gloves  * pliers  * power saw  * acetylene torch  Be sure you have plenty of iodine and bandages ready. By the time you finally cut away the packaging you&#x27;re going to need them.</li>
    <li> I got this tool for my dad. It does an amazing job easily and the shape makes it very comfortable to hold and handle. I love the attachments to trim the eyebrows. The short one is the perfect one to trim all those long gray hairs on my dad&#x27;s eyebrows.  The price is reasonable and I am quite happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer worked reasonably well for about a year and then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the eyebrow trimmer.......but have moved on to the higher rated Panasonic.</li>
    <li> As an ear &amp; nose hair trimmer, I&#x27;d have to say this isn&#x27;t great. There are better products out there for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as I know, this is the only eyebrow hair trimmer on the market, and for that purpose the NT9110 works extremely well. Way less work and does a better job than eyebrow scissors. The principle is similar to regular hair clippers, with long and short attachments. It trims to a consistent length, and works quickly and easily. Be sure to read the instructions - there is a technique to it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some have had difficulty with this product, but I haven&#x27;t.  However, I do take the time to clean it after every use with the brush and running water, then let it dry.  The trimmer is quiet and very easy to use.  I especially like the eyebrow attachment.  This has been a really good buy.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer is not the solution.  Half the time it doesn&#x27;t even start, I have to bang it on the counter 10x&#x27;s to get the trimmer working.  When it does \\&quot;work\\&quot; it hardly cuts any hair.  Geez... I am not Sasquatch, I just want a few hairs trimmed.  It never reaches far enough near the root to come anywhere near a close cut.  Stay away!!!</li>
    <li> THE HEADING SAYS IT ALL. THE NORELCO NT9110 IS FAR ABOVE THOSE ROUND REVOLVING THINGS.</li>
    <li> The price seemed good, so I figured I would give this trimmer a try.  The first one I purchased seemed to work reasonably well for trimming ear and nose hair until it stopped working for no reason after only a few days.  Thinking it was a fluke, I returned it for a new one.  After the first use, the second trimmer sat in my bathroom cabinet for a few weeks and then also would not turn on.  Believe the negative reviews!! This is a poorly designed product.</li>
    <li> Fifty-five and hair growing everywhere but the top of my head! This trimmer is powered with an AA battery and cuts nose and ear hair with facility. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Works great and gets all the hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this new in mid-September and by December the trimmer was not working. I have never written a review before, but getting only 3 months of usage is prompting me to warn other buyers to choose something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.....honestly, who hasn&#x27;t right?  Turns out, I had to use it too.  I use it on my eyebrows and nose hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco nose trimmer for the past 6 months, at least once a week, without a single problem.  It is an absolute masterpiece.  Its very comfortable in your hand, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about your nose hairs getting pulled out.  The strong painless blades trim your hairs all the way down to your skin.      I&#x27;ve gone through quite a lot nose trimmers, and my search has finally come to an end.  I bought this trimmer, and never looked back again.    I will definitely buy this product again and again if I have to, and I&#x27;d highly recommend this to a friend or relative.</li>
    <li> This product works better then most of the other makes I have used. Would recommend  this product. I&#x27;ve had no problem with this product since using it.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well except for hairs in the center of the nostril. Great for ear hair. No pain and a lot of gain.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how long I spent plucking or clipping my nose hair. Now it takes 3 minutes maximum. I can&#x27;t speak for the quality of other trimmers, but I know that this one does that job great, and was well worth every dime.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer lets me keep up with ear and nose hair without making a big deal out of it.  Every couple of days I spend one or two minutes quickly running the trimmer and it trims all the little hairs that come with age.  It works basically like an electric razor with a single blade and a very thin head.  It clips whatever it touches, very quickly and with no pulling. A realy good solution and a real upgrade from the rotary trimmer I was using.</li>
    <li> I have purchased three different brands of men&#x27;s grooming trimmers and the Norelco is the best by far. Much better quality for about the same money.</li>
    <li> I bought one for me &amp; my husband. It&#x27;s a simple design &amp; works good. I have only used it once but i like the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer and was pleasantly surprised how well it trimmed nose hair until it completely stopped working in two weeks.  I returned it and the replacement stopped working after one week!!!  I&#x27;ve since read countless reviews stating the same problem, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The problem I had was that this device does work....for about 5 minutes.  Then it died on me. Thinking it was a fluke, I sent it back and received a replacement. Guess what...then new died after two uses.   I have no faith in these units at all!    Until they figure out why they die after one or two uses, save your money!</li>
    <li> My first impression of the Philips Norelco Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer was that it resembled a space age instrument. Space age no more, the trimmer quickly hit those spots that tweezers and scissors couldn&#x27;t reach. It was fantastic and quick. Most definitely, the twelve dollars invested was well worth it:)</li>
    <li> Philips Precision NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer worked fine ONE TIME - second time I tried to use it did not work - Checked battery - was OK - put in new battery - still did  not work.</li>
    <li> This appliance is a disappointment.  It takes too long for a simple function and you must go over and over the area.  Save your money and get a little pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these things and this is easily the best one by far.  Others are flimsy and die easily and early.  This feels solid, does the job quickly and is comfortable.  Why didn&#x27;t I use this before?</li>
    <li> Get deep in your ear canals with this trimmer,also takes care of those pesky nose hairs</li>
    <li> I have tried many trimmers in the past, and usually you have to pass over the hair a dozen times before it enters the little slots to cut anything. But not this one! It is fast and quick! Also, the eyebrow trimmer is very reliable at trimming the eyebrows to a single length. (A significant age cue for older men is unkempt eyebrows.) The ability to simply wash it off in water keeps it fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I need to start with the fact that I find ear and nose hair about the most disgusting thing about getting older. I cannot stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was purchased from a different vendor as a replacement for one of those rotary style ear/nose trimmers. The basic problem with that design is that you cannot get all the hairs with those, especially in the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit gets as close as you could get with scissors or some sort of blade and yet cannot cut the skin because of the head design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of minutes with this and my ears are pristine and as smooth as a baby dolphin.</li>
    <li> The Norelco NT9110 is the first trimmer I have owned. It works very well and there is little or no pull on the hears in the nose, ears, eye brows or back of the neck.  I have brushed and run water on the trimmer each time I have used it and it does not jam the next time I use the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these, with #2 still running fine. After each use I wash the device&#x27;s cutting blades in warm water (lightly brushing the blades with a nail brush). In between uses I remove the AA battery, reinstalling it prior to use. So far, three months without trouble.</li>
    <li> I know its only meant for your nose and ears, but it&#x27;s still a pretty wak trimmer in those areas, that&#x27;s all i have to say.</li>
    <li> I have had this for awhile and find it to fit into the cabinet very well.  The problem with it is it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs on the first pass, or the second pass, maybe the third pass.  I had better luck with the scissors!  But then again, this is bloodless, so I still like it. but it needs more refinement.</li>
    <li> Received the trimmer in good time.  I have used it multiple times, and it is still working well.  I have not noticed any pinching or pulling while using it.  The only complaint I have is the packaging.  The clam shell plastic package is difficult to open, and can be dangerous.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well - significantly better than the last two $10-$12 trimmers I bought. It is well put together. I could do without the angled tip but it is OK. If it could trim a tad closer I would toss in another star. If it were a bit smaller I would give it another 1/2 star.  As is it is 3 1/2 - but since it does work better than my last trimmers I would buy it again tomorrow if it broke by my fault.</li>
    <li> It worked fine when new, but as the weeks wore on, sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t work at all.  Jiggling the battery sometimes helped, but ultimately, jiggling the battery - even replacing the battery with a new one - didn&#x27;t work.  The thing is dead. Given that it only worked well for a relatively short time, I have no plans to invest in a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve a number of these products in the past and they all performed poorly and failed soon after purchase. This Norelco product has performed very well.</li>
    <li> I have tried several electric trimmers all of them where the rotary style. The design of this trimmer looked different so I decided to give it a try. This thing is great. Plenty of power and the angle of the cutter head lets you get right where you need it. The cutter blades do a great job as well not leaving anything behind. The lack of power was the issue with the rotary trimmers, but not with this one, you can tell right away this thing will work. And trimming your eye brow has never been easier. Getting just inside your ear canal is also a great attribute. Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve only used it once now, but was VERY impressed.  While only having used one cheezy nose trimmer once in the past, I was concerned about the usual, pulling of hair, etc.  I did not experience any such thing.  Prior to the nose, I used it to trim my eyebrows which are somewhat bushy.  I used the longer of the two guards, but will most likely try the shorter soon.  Love the fact that it can double duty those two jobs as well as ear if I need it for that later on. If I can get 5 years out of something, I&#x27;m usually happy, though small and somewhat inexpensive, I don&#x27;t see any reason, yet, why this trimmer would not last that long or much longer...</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t a finer nose trimmer available. Gets in there so far you may have to worry about poking your brain...  Just remember to oil it occasionally or it will seize up for good.</li>
    <li> I have had several types of trimmers for the purpose of ear and nose hair trimming. Due to that fact I wasn&#x27;t really expecting great results. It was pretty much what I expected.     The price if very reasonable, and the product performs at least as well as I imagined it would.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent trimmer that worked for about two weeks. And that was it. One day, it just didn&#x27;t turn on. A new battery, and then another new battery of a different manufacture, did nothing to bring it back. As I see from earlier reviews, my story is nothing new.</li>
    <li> Your hair trimmer seems to work well, though  there should be a carrying  case for it. The package it came is just that and not practical to use as a carrying case.  The packaging case should have been designed as a carrying case too.</li>
    <li> Gets in every nook and cranny with no pain and no mess. If you keep it clean it will run forever. No lie.</li>
    <li> Did I say that you should clean this?    This is a great trimmer. The best I&#x27;ve ever used.     As other reviewers have already said, you really need to clean this after each and every use, or it will jam up on you.    The eyebrow trimmer is great. The nose trimmer does a much better job than the other circular models, such as the Panasonic.    Keep it clean, and you&#x27;ll be very happy!</li>
    <li> The Philps Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer is the best ever. I read the evaluatons prior to purchase and the key to this item to consistantly perform properly is cleaning after each use. The angle and the open trimmer type action allows the trimmer to cut the hairs deep inside the nose, which the circle typs does not do. I recommend this product highly, and only wish that I had found it years ago.  jrs/2010</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be brief. I have just 2 problems with this trimmer - one is a showstopper, the other just irritating design issue.     First of all the thing just died after about maybe 5 uses at most. One nice day it simply refused to switch on. And, no, battery was full (I tried several fresh ones) and contacts were all fine. This happened after for the first time I washed the cutting tip under the running water as Norelco recommends. I was careful not to spill water on the rest of the trimmer. Then I dried it overnight before using. So my suspicion is that the tip isn&#x27;t actually waterproof and leaked water into the motor or into whatever nuclear science Norelco jammed inside its wonder gizmo. Or maybe they simply use cheap inferior motors. Who knows...    Usability thing is how Norelco choose to design switching the trimmer on or off. Instead of a simple push on/off button under your finger you have to twist lower half of the body with one hand while holding the upper half steady with the other hand. That&#x27;s already is contrived, inconvenient, slow and annoying by itself. But wait, here&#x27;s more! There are 3 very close positions denoted by very soft dents: middle is Off, right is On and when turned left lower half of the trimmer comes off along with the battery. When switching off it&#x27;s extremely easy to go past middle dent and dismember the darn thing. Happened to me few times.    Otherwise when the trimmer was working and not falling apart it was pretty usable, comfortable and was doing rather well what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Goose-neck tip is properly shaped for ear and nose access. Compared to Panasonic trimmer I had before that was using rotating wire Norelco&#x27;s cutters were safer and didn&#x27;t bite the skin. Too bad Norelco doesn&#x27;t know how to manufactures trimmers well :)</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 hair trimmers from Amazon....this Panasonic, the Phillips Norelco and the Wahl 5546-200.  Wahl and Panasonic easy to use and they work really well.  Philips Norelco one star and very difficult to use and figure out.  So if u r in the market, I suggest either this unit or Wahl...they are similar...do not buy Philips Norelco NT9110</li>
    <li> Works better than previous trimmers.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an alternative to my Wahl nose/ear trimmer, thinking it might be an improved design.  It does not do as good a job and you cannot remove the head for thorough cleaning.  It does not a good job on eyebrows with the long guard, but cuts the eybrows a little short.  I would not buy this product again and am going back to my Wahl.</li>
    <li> This product could be perfect. It is shaped in a way that reaches inside the nose to cleanly clip the hairs. Worked great until one time - approximately after a month&#x27;s use - it stopped working. New batteries did not help. I bought another one assuming the experience with #1 was a fluke. The second one lasted a week. It died - nothing I tried would make it run.     Too bad - seemed like a great design ... if you could get it to run.</li>
    <li> Used this item twice and it stopped working - checked battery and everything else on this item to no avail. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent device.  Cuts very close.  Better by far than any of the other devices I&#x27;ve used. Cleans up without problems when  simple directions are followed.</li>
    <li> great item very functional</li>
    <li> I almost needed some weapons of mass destruction to get through the outer packaging of this product.  However, once I got through, I found a really nice, efficient trimmer.  I was replacing a Panasonic ER411 that just died one day. Reviews of the new version of the same Panasonic weren&#x27;t so good, so I went with this Philips Norelco. It works great - maybe a bit better than the Panasonic - and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> i was a little worried about this type of trimmer but it works great and i havent nicked myself at all. im not even sure that this will nick. ive pressed it pretty hard on the back of my finger to test it and nothing happened. cuts hair right down to the skin, doesnt leave any stubble. the eyebrow trimming guards are good. getting older and my eyebrows are starting to get a little shaggy, this took care of that in about 2 minutes. works great, great price, 5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn&#x27;t allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost. its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and use it regularly. It does a good job of trimming without discomfort. I recommend it -- especially for its price.</li>
    <li> To the 77 Reviewers who rated this product \\&quot;1 star\\&quot;:    Did you follow the instructions of washing the blades after EVERY USE?    Because from your reviews it seems that NONE of y&#x27;all did.  All of you are saying that you changed the batteries and it didn&#x27;t start up back again; well of course it wouldn&#x27;t if hairs are STUCK in the blades and needs to be washed out lol.    From what I&#x27;ve read, the overall satisfaction of the product is GOOD once properly maintained. I HAD TO make a rating to publish my comments, so I&#x27;m rating it 5 stars just to even out the balance...lol    I suggest you 77 Reviewers follow the advice of the user \\&quot;Canocer\\&quot; dated August 2009 on page 1.    Unless someone comes and rate this product low even when they&#x27;ve closely followed the instructions in the product&#x27;s manual and says it still didn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;ll be inclined to think that there is a manufacturer&#x27;s fault.  Until then, y&#x27;all shouldn&#x27;t be rating the product 1 star if you didn&#x27;t follow the manufacturer&#x27;s guidelines when using the product. It is misleading and confusing to new buyers as myself...And that&#x27;s all I have to say about that.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of a trimmer.  It works somewhat, but it seems like you almost have to put the hair into the trimmer for it.  Definitely not what I expected.  I will look for a higher quality product, but I&#x27;m in no hurry and this will suffice.  It looks sleek and so far has been completely functional, I suppose that&#x27;s something...</li>
    <li> never owned a trimmer, so this being the first one it seems to do a good enough job - though I expected it to trim closer</li>
    <li> By far the most comfortable trimmer for nose hair... no irritation at all. Very effective for nose hair, but doesn&#x27;t work great for eyebrow trimming (even with the included attachments).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because when he goes to the barber the barber does not cut his nose hairs.  He said that it is very comfortable and easy to use and he rinses it under the tap each time to clean it and he is very happy with it and so am I because he looks well groomed.</li>
    <li> This product has great build quality but couldnt be less effective if it tried.  I have tried several different ways to trim my nose and ears with this appliance and all have been completely unsuccessful.  Very disappointing product from a company that I&#x27;ve always respected.</li>
    <li> Hey Guys, I have to tell ya, i have tried many nose/ear trimmers, but by far the Philps Norelco NT9110 is the best i have ever used or bought. This Philps Norelco 9110 is absolutely the best! If you follow the instructions/ rinse and brush it out after (every use) this product will last? who knows how long. I have had mine for 2 months now, and not a problem with anything. It dose the job of trimming my nose/ear hair better than what i exspected, all i can say is, you will not be disapointed with the performance. Best regards, Greg.  p.s. Thanks a lot Phillps for making an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably owned a dozen of this type of item over the years, and this model is the first one that was worth the price.  It feels good in your hand, has a little weight to it, and works really well.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all. I actually bought this one at the Hong Kong airport, and it&#x27;s the best for ear hair trimming. That&#x27;s why I picked up another one from Amazon, and much cheaper.Definitely worth having in the arsenal to fight unwanted hair growth.</li>
    <li> Its dont work worth a crap.. it dont even cut the hair.... never buy this item hate it will never</li>
    <li> I delayed buying a trimmer because I had never used one before and I was put-off by some of the reviews from those who had.  When Amazon priced this model with free shipping included I bought it.  Having used it somewhere between 10 and 20 times, the trimmer does what it&#x27;s supposed to do: trims nose and ear hairs.  I have had no problems and am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Cheap, easy to clean, and does exactly what you want.  The eye-brow cutters are the best part IMO and work better than expected.  It even came with its own battery!  What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product to anyone. Works great and is easy to use on your own. No tugging! Five stars!</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for over a year now and use it several times a week.  I love it, the best trimmer I have ever used.  After having used it for a few months, it began to hesitate and even refuse to start.  I thought it was finished.  Then I read a review where a customer said to throw away the trimmer cover and store the trimmer uncovered and the problem would be eliminated.  I did, and he was right....Go figure.  I have no idea why that should work, (maybe the open air helps dry it out?) but I do know that I have had absolutely no problem with it ever since.  It&#x27;s comfortable, trims close with no danger of cutting oneself, and just a great tool for what it&#x27;s designed for.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Rinse after every use!!!  My wife really appreciates the fact that nose hair is not a problem anymore.  If you have little spider legs sticking out of your nose, get this trimmer.  Looks like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> The GOOD:  -Easy to use  -Battery life is excellent  -Easy to clean  -VERY effective  -Doesn&#x27;t pull/snag hairs  -Travel friendly    The BAD:  -None that I&#x27;ve found so far    Let&#x27;s keep this short and sweet. If you grow hair in small recesses of you head, this is the trimmer to get the little buggers (buggers, not boogers). So far I&#x27;ve used this trimmer on my nose and ears, as well as to trim up some unruly eyebrows. It plows through hair like a weed-wacker on steroids. This trimmer is SUPER easy to use... just twist and go. It&#x27;s easy to clean (run under the faucet); small (toss it in your travel bag for extended trips); and the battery lasts for ages. Ok I&#x27;m sure if you try to shave your entire body the battery will run out, but for the quick trims of nose and ears every other week, the battery should last a long time.     Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry I hadn&#x27;t read the Amazon reviews before buying this on impulse in a department store. (Serves me right.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked once, then when I tried it again a couple of weeks later the battery was dead. Strange from only one use. So I replaced the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next  time I tried it it was dead... again. BUT it was also very warm to the touch. Even the battery was very warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider this device worse than useless. It is a danger. I&#x27;m glad it was not touching any tissues in the drawer or else it might possibly have started a fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing. It&#x27;s design is radically different for a nose hair trimmer. Even so, it failed to trim nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, worse than useless.  Too bad Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow ratings of negative stars.</li>
    <li> This is no better or worse than any of the others out there. I would shop for any clipper with the cheapest price.</li>
    <li> [April 27th, 2011 update: My final unit has lasted more than a year now and I have therefore added a star to the rating.  The dying problem, as some other reviews have pointed out, is actually a \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; problem. When the blades get some mucus moisture on them, they will stick after it dries out. So, when you go to turn the unit on in a day or two, the unit appears dead.  There are two possible fixes:    1) Disassemble and clean the head assembly.  2) Gently tap the side of the head assembly against a counter until it works.    I have used #2 successfully on many occasions.  Had I tried that approach on the previous units I purchased, I&#x27;m sure they would have all worked. Still, I would call this a design flaw (see below) because it sticks so easily and so often.    [July 12th, 2009 update: My fourth one just died. I think they fail when they get just a bit of moisture on the blades. I&#x27;ve contacted Norelco customer support but they don&#x27;t seem concerned. Meanwhile, the competition is figuring out that this design is pretty decent. There are other choices, like the Remington MPT-3000 Precision Trimmer]. I think this is the best nose hair trimmer design I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used several different types (rotary style, spatula style, scissors, etc).  However, I&#x27;ve had two of these Norelco&#x27;s fail on me within three weeks of usage. The last one lasted 2 months before dying.  Fortunately, I&#x27;m buying them at the local Fry&#x27;s, so I just keep taking them back and getting a new one (sorry folks, but I&#x27;d actually recommend, in this case, that you buy them locally at a place with a decent return policy).  I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s just a bad batch or if there&#x27;s a pathological design flaw.  I&#x27;m on my fourth one (fingers crossed).  When it fails, it just stops working, and I just use it occasionally for light nose trimming. I never use the accessories or travel with it. I wish a Norelco rep would step-up and deal with this. I give it four stars for design and nose trimming, and one star for quality control. Final rating: 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Maybe the worst design I have ever seen for a personal trimmer.  One major drawback is the size of the tip before the blades start, it is too large and cumbersome.  They do work but one does have to be a bit creative to get the desired effect.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like to put that much thought into unwanted hair, I just want it gone.  So something that were more efficient would be better.  I will keep them, but I will order a different one when this one dies.  If you haven&#x27;t ordered already, keep looking.</li>
    <li> Packaged in thick heat-sealed plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a carving knife, table saw, or TNT to open the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finally sawed open the package the sharp pastic edges sliced open my arm as I tried to wrestle the clipper out of the form-fitted encosure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging really is so bad that it is enough reason to not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both this one and the Panasonic ER415SC.  The Panasonic tends to grab the hairs and feels more intrusive.  This one is gentler with no pulling, and trims more closely. The eyebrow trimmer is also a nice addition.    Some have noted that the trimmer just stops dead. This is probably from a clogged cutter.  You need to keep it clean by brushing under warm running water.  Mine &#x27;died&#x27; after many months of use.  But after reading another review on this site, i tried once more to clean it under runnign water. After about 20 seconds, it came to life and is now runnig great again.   I&#x27;d highly recommend this one, especially if you have not been satisfied with the spinning cutter models.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. What a concept! I bought 2 and am ready to buy a 3rd.</li>
    <li> efficient and well built every thing I wanted it to be . not a noisy buzz saw. thank you loads</li>
    <li> The motor sounds and feels like it is well designed compared to others I have owned.  The battery has lasted longer than others as well.  The problem I have with it is that while the business end is longer than most, the blades do not go close enough to the end.  This is probably to protect the consumer from cutting themselves but it keeps you from getting all the hair.</li>
    <li> I had been struggling snipping my errant nose hairs with a little pair of scissors. Seemed that I was mostly pulling them out more than actually trimming them so I decided to buy one of these. It was the right decision.  As everyone else has mentioned, the packaging is the typical clam shell hell. Once you get it out, you pop the battery in, and you&#x27;re on your way. The bent head of the trimmer lets you get at whatever you need to without having your hand pressed up against your face. The head&#x27;s angle makes me appreciate the thought that was put into the design of this tool by those responsible for crafting it. Another pair of features that show off their attention to detail is the thickness and texture of the handle which give it about a perfect grip. Even the little cap that protects the blades fits and snaps on flawlessly. These are all little details that tell me the product is well made. Though, the design doesn&#x27;t matter if it doesn&#x27;t perform.  It comes to life with a subdued, high pitched hum that&#x27;s a little quieter than my toothbrush. I went to work to trim my nose hair first thing. I was a bit hesitant, but found I could basically slide it around my nostril without so much as a tug. I actually had to check to make sure it was doing its job; a quick glance showed it was. After this boost in my confidence in it, I was feeling adventurous and so slipped on the little eyebrow attachments. I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t shave my eyebrows off completely, and fortunately I didn&#x27;t. I doubt I&#x27;ll use that feature again as I apparently don&#x27;t have very bushy eyebrows, but to each their own. I brushed it off and ran it under water and threw it in the drawer. I had no problems whatsoever with the performance of the trimmer, and I don&#x27;t suspect I will.  My one complaint, with the few attachments it comes with for eyebrow trimming and the little brush for cleaning it it would be nice if it had a little case or bag to keep them in. I just threw them in my grooming kit with my nail clippers and such so I hopefully won&#x27;t lose them.  Otherwise, this thing performs perfectly and has finally let me groom my snout with ease.</li>
    <li> A girl at work recently asked to me,\\&quot;How is a grown ass man walking around with all those bugers in his nose?\\&quot; A great question. I was confused. I pick my nose thoughly on a constant basis. How could this be?&lt;br /&gt;She was mistaking my flowing, brunette locks of nostril hair, as bugers. I though, maybe it&#x27;s time to take action. Oh sure, I do try to pluck out the potrouding hair every now and then... but I&#x27;m talking about drastic maneuvers. I&#x27;m talking about Philips Norelco.  Now my inner nostrils are gorgeous, just breathtaking.&lt;br /&gt;Also another great thing about getting older is my eyebrow hair really started to grow out.  They got so long I thought about braiding them into corn-rows so the wouldn&#x27;t impede my vision. I took the Norelco to them and again, the results are just stunning.</li>
    <li> This is the first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The reviews were good as was the price so I went for it.  It took a little time to learn how to angle it properly and a few hairs were a bit stubborn, but after a few minutes I was done.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet and has a very comfortable grip.  Ten days after my first use there&#x27;s still no sign of the hairs growing back yet, so I&#x27;m expecting a couple uses per month at most.  Definitely glad I got it.  Thankfully I have no ear hair or bushy eyebrows so I can&#x27;t rate those aspects.</li>
    <li> Working well after several years</li>
    <li> I wanted this purely to trim nose hairs.  It does not appear to do that.  I do not know if my particular trimmer is defective or if the design is defective.</li>
    <li> It does not cut that we&#x27;ll even with new battery it just seems to move slow , I have another one that I&#x27;ve had for a long time, I just wanted a new one but it just isn&#x27;t the same</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well and is easy to clean. It is well made and a good value compared with less expensive devices that are easier to damage, harder to maintain, and don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how good the trimmer is because the clam shell packaging is IMPOSSIBLE to open.&lt;br /&gt;When will manufacturers come up with something better? I may return it half hacked into.</li>
    <li> Any guy knows manscaping is important and as i aged i realized my nose hairs came in much quicker then i realized. i had a cheap combo for trimming and it sucked. this is GREAT trimmer. works perfectly. Any guy you needs one u should purchase this.</li>
    <li> Ordered this groomer as a gift for a friend and he was very happy with it.  I would recomend this groomer on that basis.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was average at best.  I&#x27;ve found better ones, and no longer use this one.  It just didn&#x27;t do as well as I had hoped (or as well as my new one).</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands of rotary nose &amp; ear trimmers, all of them frustrating to use because of their inability to trim closely and reach all the hairs. They eventually start pulling hairs instead of trimming and finally loose power.  Phillips has revolutionized the trimming process with this new recessed trimmer technology. It&#x27;s the closest thing to a razor I have found.  The trimmer&#x27;s angled shape helps to reach the hard to reach areas and trim as far back as you need. You can even use pressure to get as close as possible without a cut.  I can trim my nose and ears in minutes and not have to touch up with scissors or plucking. Best product out on the market today.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an amazing little machine and it can be like your best friend haha totally recommended!!! You don&#x27;t feel any kind of pain or anything. It is unbelief</li>
    <li> The product is the best one I have purchased for the use of nose, ear and other hair removal. It is easy to use and the razor part can be washed with hot water. It is very safe to use and I am very impressed with its capability. The price of this unit was very economical.</li>
    <li> I have had several nose trimmers prior to purchasing this Philips Norelco NT9100 and this is the best one yet. It&#x27;s shape is very good, especially where it enters the nose. Also its cutters seem to cut very well and are easy to clean. The price at Amazon is very good for this quality of product. I would have rated it at five stars, but the five star rating implys that I love it. I like it very much but I cant bring myself to express love for any nose Trimmer.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a week....</li>
    <li> I wish I could find the manual spinning type that my father had when I was a kid. It just seems like the two differant ones I have are just not doing what they say.IMO</li>
    <li> I bought one of these without having read the reviews first. The packaging is an absolute b****h to take off. How does Phillips expect men with moisturised manicured hands to open the shrink wrap plastic packaging without the aid of a blow torch?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I admired the fact that Phillips&#x27; instructions were very conveniently placed both, including a small, wafer thin chit sheet inside the battery compartment to remind users to rinse the trimmer for 10 seconds after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few comments about the using the trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;ve ever had a nasal trimmer before, you&#x27;ll remember that crunching, snipping sound when the trimmer is working on your nasal hairs. The Phillips NT9110 also delivers the same sound but it takes a leap of faith to run the trimmer along your skin on the inside of your nose. Once you get the hang of that, the trimmer delivers the best results.&lt;br /&gt;- I liked the fact that the trimmer can be switched on by twisting the battery compartment until it clicks. It reduces the risk that the trimmer might accidentally switch itself on whilst in my wash bag. However, the compartment seems flimsy enough to want to fall off when the trimmer is switched off and I am concerned about that.&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer feels nice to hold, the bottom part of the handle has a waterproof, rubber grip surface which makes it easy to hold with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative points&lt;br /&gt;- Some versions of the trimmer come with spare parts to clean the trimmer and trim eye brows. However, the trimmer has no docking stand so the spare parts are likely to fall into the bottom of that famous drawer of tools that us men always have or live at the bottom of the wash bag until need. Would have been good for Phillips to have created a small case to hold these bits in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m going to give the trimmer 4 stars and will update this review if I find that the trimmer stops working after a few months. Although, I will follow other reviewers&#x27; advice to clean it after every use.</li>
    <li> This thing does what it says. Follow the directions, that is, wash carefully after each use.  Quality is good and is easy to use. I wish it had a little bit more power, though.</li>
    <li> Had this trimmer since October.  Its been reliable, no issues with it not working.  The packaging is a pain but thats not against the product itself.    My biggest issue is that it doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable during use around my ears and nose due to its vibration.  Also, I don&#x27;t feel it cuts close enough either.  I have since gone back to my old precision trimmer.  I still use this around my neck and all, but definitely not for what I intended to use it for.</li>
    <li> After searching for years for the ideal trimmer, I finally found it. The Philips Norelco NT9110, is it. Has the power and design that gets the job done. Easy to use and safe. Just put in the bathroom draw or vanity and use it when ready. Battery powered and is ready when you are, easy and small enough to store. The design lets you get into the narrow passages and does a close job. Get one and try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This product is a HUGE improvement over the worthless ear/nose trimmer included in Norelco&#x27;s full trimmer kits. It is quiet, free of excessive vibration, water rinsable and also trims eyebrows! Everything the trimmer in the full kit isn&#x27;t! If you are primarily looking for an ear/nose trimmer, skip over Norelco&#x27;s full trimmer kit, save yourself some money and get this product instead. As long as you rinse it off and brush it clean after each use you should have no problems with it. The only thing missing is some kind of stand or storage case. It&#x27;s also 20% cheaper than Walmart on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer some 3 weeks ago and have been using it regularly. It looks robustly built and trims nose hair so efficiently that I do not feel a pinch. There are some safe usage techniques mentioned too like &#x27;dont hold the blades close to skin, dont insert more than a quarter inch into the nose etc&#x27;. I have a large hairy nose :-) so I do not abide by these tips though :-). Ear hair is a different story altogether, the contours of this trimmer are not precisely suited to trim all the hair ears except those that grow in the ear canal. My previos product was a panasonic rotary blade trimmer. It was good in the sense it would trim hair from all over the nose. All in all this philips trimmer scores better on time savings and a clean job. Would love to see one with a mini vacuum for collecting trimmed hair.</li>
    <li> Have only used product 3 times; however it works well and is simple to operate.  What is not simple is the packaging.  They have gone overboard to make it tamperproof.</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer product and have used it only once. That being said, I like the product but there is some agitation when the actual trimming is done. Took about 5 minutes to get used to and am happy with the results. So, unless you are sure that there is some other product better than this one, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I works great on peach fuzz but is useless as a nose hair trimmer.  I would have sent it back except it didn&#x27;t seem right to return something that had been in my nose.</li>
    <li> Update: called Norelco and they replaced the malfunctioning unit quickly - has worked well for three years without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked very well, but stopped working after the first use. Manufacturer is sending a replacement, but only because it is within 60 days of purchase - otherwise I would be out of luck.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me as a replacement for my 2-headed Wahl which broke after many years of service. I had planned on picking out a replacement myself, but she surprised me and did a great job.  This trimmer is very sleek and modern looking, and the price is right too! Having a 2-headed trimmer in the past, i really like that this one only has one head, and its design allows it to be used very effectively in both nose and ears. That alone is a huge plus. Its very easy to hold and manipulate. Aside from that, its very quiet, can be water rinsed, and comes with attchments for eyebrow trimming (which i havent used and dont really plan on using).  4 stars because i&#x27;ve only had it for a couple months and im waiting to see if it will last at least a couple years.  Update: about 3 months later, the trimmer just stopped working. I tried switching out the battery a couple times, but that wasnt it. I dont think it was a problem with water getting inside, as i only used water to clean the tip a couple times, and being able to clean it with water was one of the trimmer&#x27;s features. I tried taking it back to Target, but since it was after 90 days and i didnt have the original package or receipt (who keeps this stuff?), they wouldnt give me a credit or replacement. Despite this, i liked the design so much i bought another. At only $10, i guess its worth one more try.  Update: many months later, the trimmer is still working great, so the first one i had must have been a defect for one reason or another. I use the trimmer several times a week and the batteries (2 AA) last about a couple of months before dying. I would buy this trimmer again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a trimmer I had for years that I loved. This one is solidly built and I love the fact that it can be rinsed with water. The eyebrow trimmers are helpful, but I don&#x27;t like this style as much as the older kind that I had. Otherwise, I really like the trimmer and it does very good job on nose &amp; ear hair.</li>
    <li> I have messed around with the spinning style of trimmer for long enough!  This trimmer is awesome so far.  I have had it for about 2.5 weeks so far and used it about 5x.  It is wonderful!  I advise you to buy one!  If yours is like mine, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer and the blade is very different than comparable products.  It allows you to get the trimmer deep into the noise and reach the back hairs.  Cleansd easily under the faucet.</li>
    <li> This one is just thousand times better than any electric rotary trimmer.   It takes 2 minutes and it cuts clear to skin, with no chance of missed hairs. Not sure what&#x27;s up with units that broke after 3-4 uses, my works fine for 6 mo. May be you should not expect from it to stand bathroom humidity accompanied with occasional drops on ceramic floor (hint, hint).    ps: and to mechanical trimmers fans - unless you stuck in jungles, just put them aside. They are like mowing a lawn with scissors.</li>
    <li> Overall I like the product. The only design element I did not like  is the process to open the unit to install the battery.  Very similar to the on/off functions. In any future product design I would make this a little easier to do.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used for getting at hairs in those hard-to-reach places.  It&#x27;s a definite improvement on the usual cylinder with rotating blades.</li>
    <li> I have owned many nose hair trimmers.  The turbo groomer from sharper image was the latest one I owned before this one.  It worked okay but it would make my eyes tear because the thing would pull the hairs out instead of cutting them.  I experience NO pain with this one.  I don&#x27;t mind using it.  The only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is because it seems like it might be a little flimsy but at 12 bucks who cares.</li>
    <li> This thing works well and does a great job trimming my eye brows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it with Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System for my father as a present and he is very much satisfied with both products. He said this is the best trimmer and shaver he used.</li>
    <li> Bought this due to good reviews and wasn&#x27;t dissapointed :)Almost razor like close trim or as close as you cna get.</li>
    <li> I own three Norelco shavers because they are the best.&lt;br /&gt;This nose and ear trimmer, however, is trash. There is no on-and-off switch! Instead, you unscrew the battery-cover bottom to turn it off, and then throw the resulting mess into a bag so that you can reassemble it when your nose-hair gets long again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, worked only once. Second time used, would not work. Thought it might have been bad battery, but not the case.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]This personal grooming aid is well worth the investment.  It works so well, simplifies the job, does not cut or pull, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This device seems incapable of cutting a hair. (The one star is the lowest rating available.)</li>
    <li> After using other brands, I am so glad I decided to try the Philips Norelco Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer for my husband.  Like most Amazon products, it arrived in record time in perfection condition and at a reasonable price.  My husband likes the Norelco brand and said it makes his grooming session go much faster and easier.  We haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow attachments yet, but if they are similar to other brands, the end result will be the final touch.  I enjoy the benefit of running the blade unit under water to clean after each use.</li>
    <li> Got this today and tried it right away - very happy with the performance.  The unit feels nice and sturdy in your hand; the motor seems very strong, and the clipper cleaned up my nose hair in seconds.  Great product for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Mine has never gotten stuck or pulled a hair, but the cut isn&#x27;t extremely close.</li>
    <li> I just thru out two previous trimmers as this one does the job. The others never seemed to cut what I was looking at and were reluctant to start. So far I am happy with this one and I like the comb attachment that allow me to keep my, Andy Rooney like, eyebrows under control.</li>
    <li> Works very well and the battery lasts a while. I&#x27;ve used this for over four years and haven&#x27;t changed the battery yet. (I guess I either don&#x27;t have that much nose hair or the battery will be dead at my next use.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband for a Christmas present - he says it works much much better than other ones he has purchased in the past&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a product that works&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> Gave my oldest son one as part of his birthday present, back in October.  After his positive comments about it, I got my other son and husband one  for Christmas.  They now don&#x27;t know how they did without it.</li>
    <li> This worked great for me. Battery life is great. It doesn&#x27;t sting when you use it. It cuts great. Wash it after every use and it will work again and again. Ive used it several times since Ive got it and I think it even improved my allergies because of the stuff your nose hair traps in your nostrils. Great buy and for 12 bucks you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what all the people who rated poorly are talking about. Works as advertised on ears, nose, and eyebrows!!! One review complained about the battery? Spend a penny and get some rechargeable batteries. I didn&#x27;t find a problem with the battery, but those that come with the unit never last long. I&#x27;ll just switch to a rechargeable when it goes, which it hasn&#x27;t yet. Love this item.</li>
    <li> Used it 3 times fourth would not turn on.  Changed batteries no go tossed in Gabage can.  Nice procut but stops working and if I could have rated it -5 STARS would have JUNK !!!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Cheap plastic, dollar store feel.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Hardly does the job, blades just aren&#x27;t long enough or motor powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Died July 2015. &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> Stay away.  The design is good and I was very satisfied initially.  I&#x27;ve tried two and they have both died after a fairly short period.  Changing batteries didn&#x27;t help.  Tapping on a hard surface got them running initially but they both quit again.  Others have commented on this.  Too bad, this would be a good product if it worked.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, it worked well while it lasted.  Was comfortable and easy to use.  On the minus side, it died after less than a year.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other brands of these. This one has done the best, It is quick and easy.</li>
    <li> I have older model, but it did not work at all. I saw this curved model  on the Amazon website, and I thought this is the one for me. And I have  used it and used it, now I would not be without it at all.  I would recommend it for anyone, male or female.  H. Dale Reitz</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco trimmer is an excellent compact tool to trim eyebrows and remove hair from your nose. The one drawback is  poor unit to battery contacts which frequently causes it to be  difficult to start.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other users, I made sure to keep this trimmer safely in a toiletries bag in a medicine cabinet but after a couple months it died on me.  Yes I changed the batteries ;) - It&#x27;s just a poor product, before that I had a Wahl and it lasted 6 years on the same battery until it fell from the cabinet and broke on the ground.    Very poor product, Norelco!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of this type of trimmer and never got the results that I wanted.  I bought this knowing Philips Norelco has a good reputation and should not put an inferior product in the market place.  It is the best I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> not very sharp but enough swipes and it gets everything</li>
    <li> Bought this about 6 months ago and it worked good for a while...but then stopped.  Sent it back and got a partial refund now looking for a better one.</li>
    <li> It works just as its supposed to and I am amazed at how neat it is. East to clean, doesn&#x27;t catch and tug hairs and it&#x27;s quiet. Blilliant design. buy several in case you need presents for friends.</li>
    <li> So I bought this little guy at walmart. I was getting tired of the cheap $10 ones from as seen on tv. They kept breaking on me. I was excited to use it. It does a good job of trimming the light hairs on the ear and above the eyebrow but the nose hairs........HORRIBLE!! I havent has nose hair in years I always trim it with the cheap ones, but they do an awesome job. Since I am not used to the feeling when the hair starts growing back it feels like I have somehting in my bose which can be very annoying. I used this trimmer and even after I trimmed the nose hair it still felt like I had alot of hair left. I went back to the cheap trimmer for the nose hair</li>
    <li> It does do a better job of cutting than any of the other brands of nose and ear hair trimmers I have used in the past.  However, it does not work as well as I had expected after reading reviews from previous users.  The main problem I have found is that it is hard to get the contact angle just right to cut properly.</li>
    <li> One of the best nose and ear hair trimmer i have got so far. Beautifully designed for better reach and usability. The cap is very helpful to keep it closed when not in use. A fine product for people who like to be well groomed.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all and this relatively inexpensive product is the best by far.  I believe the rotary style trimmers, like all of the Panasonics, have a blade clearance too great to give a close cut.  This trimmer, on the other hand, cuts nearly as close as a conventional safety razor.  Buy one.  You will not be disapoppointed.</li>
    <li> This little gadget gets the job done in a quick and efficient manner.  I&#x27;ve used other trimmers in the past, and none can compare to this guy! Clean up is as simple as running it under the faucet after you&#x27;re done.  It&#x27;s not about the \\&quot;angle\\&quot; as some reviewers suggest.  I mean, the angle with a nose hair trimmer is as simple as adjusting your grip and wrist - get real people!  What it IS about is an incredibly sharp yet extremely safe way to cut all the hairs in your nose, ears, eyebrows...you name it!  I&#x27;ve had this little guy for two years and have taken it all over the world with me.  The battery life...hmmm, I don&#x27;t recall having ever changed the battery.  I&#x27;m not saying I haven&#x27;t, I&#x27;m just saying that I really don&#x27;t ever remember doing it.  And if it&#x27;s that long-lasting that I don&#x27;t remember, then it actually does say a lot.  So, if you need a trouble-free, easy to clean, and otherwise great nose hair trimmer, this is it!</li>
    <li> Nice little device.  Works well but would not say great.  However, for the price it is quite decent and worth having.  Much better results than with the rotary type of trimmer I believe.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these trimmers and found it trims nose hairs reasonably well.  Not great, but okay.  But after three or four uses I tried it one day and found it didn&#x27;t run anymore.  Lifeless.  So I returned it and Amazon sent me a replacement.  The second one arrived, I used it once, and the second time I went to use it, it no longer ran.  In between the two uses, it had done nothing but sit in the medicine cabinet.  So, I rate this as the most undependable, unreliable product I have ever owned.  Philips and Norelco are both good brands and it&#x27;s unfortunate that they&#x27;ve put their name on this product.</li>
    <li> I just received this unit and agree with everyone who said how well this unit works. It is very easy to use and it does a much better job than the typical rotary trimmers, which grabbed and caused significant eye watering. In addition this unit works excellently for ear, eyebrow and moustache trimming compared to rotary trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging makes it difficult to get the unit out of the plastic without risk of cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only using the trimmer 5-6 times, over three months time, it has stopped working. I will now see if Norelco&#x27;s 2 year warranty is worth it i.e. what cost do I incur to use the warranty on a $13 product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I sent the unit off for replacement, I experimented with cleaning it as I noticed, while reading the warranty information, that the unit could be rinsed under running water. After brushing the unit and running it under warm water, it came to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now clean the trimmer, by rinsing and brushing, after every use per the instructions. I hope this will keep the unit operating for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2008 update; I am now in my 6th month of using this device and with faithful cleaning after every use (cleaning just the tip under water and brushing it) it continues to provide top notch trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2009 update: still going strong. Just goes to show that reading and following the directions provides value at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2013 update: I use this trimmer every 2-3 weeks and it is working as well as it did when it was new. Battery useage is modest so I only have to change the battery once a year. Clean this unit after every use and you will be very satisfied. I have changed my rating of this from a 4 star to a 5 star as it has performed flawlessly over a 5 year period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 2014: still working fantastically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 2017: had to buy a new trimmer as I inadvertently turned this one on while I was cleaning it with a toothbrush. The bristles of the toothbrush jammed the trimmer teeth while the motor was still trying to move them and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t work like it use to. I decided I had got my money&#x27;s worth and purchased a newer model of the same brand and design. I&#x27;m looking forward to approximately ten more years of use with this new trimmer.</li>
    <li> good product, still using.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer, what can I say, but it works better than any other trimmer I have ever had. Nose hair is not something you go around talking about but this is worth talking about. It works so well that instead of using a trimmer every week or two you can go forever it seems without needing to use it again. Highly recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the forth nose hair trimmer I have purchased over the last five years. While I have only used it a total of three times so far, my initial impression is quite good. It is easily the best of the four.    The other three trimmers all shared the same razor design. The razor was housed within a round casing with a hole at the top, and the casing was inserted into the nostril to shave. This limited the amount of hair you could easily trim, and also frequently became clogged with hairs and mucus despite frequent cleaning.    The razor design of the Philips Norelco NT9110 if similar to the sideburn groomer on an electric razor mounted to fit the anatomy of the nostril. This allows a closer and more controlled shave when compared to the other models, and is also much easier to clean.    If you have hairy nostrils, and dream of close shaves with low maintenance, this is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews I purchased this trimmer. It is exactly as described in the reviews.  Great value and works as expected and hoped.  I will purchase another one when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these nose trimmers and they don&#x27;t work very well.  Typically, they have a different kind of blade system that just doesn&#x27;t work very well, and you really have to continue trimming.  This trimmer has a different kind of blade system, and I personally love it.  It takes me like 30-40 seconds to really get rid of everything.  I usually had to spend like 3-4 minutes with typical blades, and even then, I just couldn&#x27;t get everything.  Admittedly, I have not used this trimmer, or any, for ear hair, so I cannot judge that.</li>
    <li> yes it was hard to open...&lt;br /&gt;unless you cut the side with scissors . just seemed like the common sense thing to do .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product is great , works like it should .&lt;br /&gt;perfect for the price !</li>
    <li> I have only used this trimmer once and it worked great!  It did cut all the long nose hairs I had without any trouble.  It does come with two eyebrow trimming attachments but I did not try it because I did not want to risk ending up with some funky eyebrows.  Maybe when I am on a long vacation I&#x27;ll try trimming my eyebrows with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this little trimmer. It is the perfect size and works great. I had  No problems at all with this transaction. I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> My nostrils look like a baby&#x27;s every time I use it! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My dad noted when I was around 25 that I had the nose hairs of a 50 year old, I&#x27;d laugh if it wasn&#x27;t true. Now half way through my thirties its a real quality of life issue for me to keep those little hairs at bay.  I&#x27;ve tried the rotary type trimmer and plucking and this has them beat hands down.  There have been some complaints of durability but as well as this thing works for me I&#x27;d gladly buy one every few months, especially for the price.  Give it a punt, if you&#x27;ve had a hard time with the rotary style trimmers this may been the one you&#x27;ve been waiting for.  I will say its a little tricky getting into the tip of the nose but give it a few passes from different angles and you&#x27;ll get it.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does a good job cutting ear hair as well as nose hair.  There is no pulling sensation with it.  The only negative aspect is that its blunt end prevents insertion deep into the ear.</li>
    <li> I own the Panasonic ER411 nose trimmer which is excellent; closest shave you can get with a nose trimmer.  It was getting old, so I decided to get a new one.  Panasonic replaced the ER411, with the ER415SC, so I bought it thinking it would be the same or better.  After I tried using it, I realized that Panasonic must have changed the blade setting, because it does not give a close enough shave.  So, I decided to try out this Norelco.  After the first try, it was worse than the new Panasonic model. The motor works fine, but the design does not cut nose hair close enough!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  You are better off using a small scissor.  Thing about it.  They placed the sideburn/neck trimmer on a regular shaver on this contraption to fit in the ear and nose cavity.  Now, when you use the sideburn/neck trimmer on your sideburns you are left with stubble.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but stubble in the nose is not sightly. I&#x27;m going to write to Panasonic to bring back the ER411, and you should too!</li>
    <li> This really does a heck of a job.  I was reluctant because anything cutting in your nose is kind of scary.  I took the plunge and wow what a job.  Not a bit of pull.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Great nose trimmer.  The straight edge works better than the round ones on other nose trimmers.  After being disappointed with the round nose trimmers, I recommend getting this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Even after reading these reviews I decided to try this product. I really liked it when I first used it. But sure enough after three uses it just died. Tried replacing the battery etc., but no go. Sadly when I first ordered this, I accidentally got two and just paid to ship one back to Amazon. Now I am going to return the defective one and Amazon is paying for it. Net, thanks to the poor product quality from Norelco/Philips, I actually lose money in addition to time after trying this product and hardly using it. I&#x27;ve had bad luck with Philips products before and at this point say never ever again will I buy Philips!</li>
    <li> Execellent best trimmer i ever bought,i am glad i boughtit is very quiet and it is made very well.i also like the eye trimmer</li>
    <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have ever owned! Great price and great performance. Clean it properly after each use and it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> It is little harder to work with this inside the nose since the trimmer is only on one side.</li>
    <li> Had this lemon about a year and it broke. It is worthless and is now a disposable piece of junk. It did not work very well when it was working. Do not buy this Norelco. This company should be fined for producing such junk and AMAZON needs to get a handle on the type of products it sells. This one should not be on its website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the NT9110 only a short time so I can&#x27;t attest to its reliability but the product does work!  It is very effective at trimming hair in the nostrils and ears.  The two other products I&#x27;ve tried including a Conair Model 1530 were the rotating design and were totally useless.</li>
    <li> This is a simple solution to getting rid of unwanted nose and ear hair. It&#x27;s cheap and is easy to use. The first time I tried it, it felt like a ticklish sensation in my nose, but it got rid of my nose hair fairly well. You sorta have to dig deep for the really long hairs, but that&#x27;s expected. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my ears or eyebrows (which you can do), mainly because my hair isn&#x27;t growing crazily in those areas. W/E. This is a great trimmer made by a solid brand that I love. I fully recommend that you get one if you need it!</li>
    <li> Do not buy. I got this trimmer for Christmas. It&#x27;s Jan 3rd and it doesn&#x27;t run anymore. I used it twice. Checked the battery. It doesn&#x27;t turn on. It worked well when it worked. I was the best trimmer I have tried until it refused to run. Hopefully I can return it. I cannot recommend a product that fails so quickly for no reason.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer for eyebrows.  It only cuts on the side and not the end.  It has adapters for the eyebrows.  I like the trimmers which also cut on the end for nose and ear trimming.  They seem to trim more easily.</li>
    <li> would be perfect if only it didn&#x27;t need batteries ever. Great product i have had mine for 2 yrs no problems so far.</li>
    <li> This one is much better quality than previous one by another name. It is powerful  and runs smoothly. The eye brow attachments do a neat job.</li>
    <li> The Philips NT9105 looks great, looks well designed, has many extras.... Now, if it would just cut the nasal hair it purports to be made to cut. It takes many firm (heavy) pressure passes to get 95% of the hair. Certainly nothing like the effectiveness of facial hair electric razors.</li>
    <li> Works great. Low maintenance. Rinse it off and it&#x27;s good to go. Comes with slip on guards to trim eyebrows. Does what it should: takes care of that mid-30&#x27;s what the hell is that tickling in my nose that&#x27;s had me rubbing my nose for the past two days oh my god make it stop...buzzzzzz done. Decent battery life. Mine&#x27;s been limping along on a half-dead AA for, I don&#x27;t know, a few months because I&#x27;ve been too lazy to change the battery. This thing is better to me than I am to it.</li>
    <li> This product works great - I only give it 4 stars because of the price. It wasn&#x27;t that expensive - but still seems to be about 10-20% higher than others I have seen. I bought this thinking that the Norelco brand would be better quality than some of the others out there.  Reality is that I think they are all pretty much the same - they do the job intended, so don&#x27;t waste money getting the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This is awesome for trimming eye brows.  Put on the length guard.  Pass over twice .  Your done.&lt;br /&gt;This is okay, sometimes poor for trimming nose and ear hair.  Pass over several times.  Then you still have to sort of wiggle this just right for it to cut some of the finer nose/ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works reliably.&lt;br /&gt;Never cuts the skin.  I feel safe putting this up my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Nice design.&lt;br /&gt;AA battery is convenient.  No bulky re-chargers to cram into the bathroom drawers.  Small and simple to store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my review. No biography necessary.</li>
    <li> I have owned this trimmer for approximately two months now and find that it does exactly what the product description claims. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the unit and it does a great job.    I didn&#x27;t give it five stars for the simple fact that the battery cover, which doubles as the on/off and switch comes off too easily. It doesn&#x27;t fall off on its own. I just find myself grabbing it and accidentally dislodging the cover. Otherwise a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> Guys, if you haven&#x27;t already, take a good look in the mirror at you nose.  If you see ANY hairs sticking out of your nostrils, grab your credit card and order one of these immediately. Nobody, and I repeat, nobody cares to see hairs sticking out of your nose, as well as anything else that might be stuck to them!      Every well-groomed man simply needs to have a nose-hair trimmer.  I started out using the rotary type, mainly because they&#x27;re the most popular. The problem was, it just didn&#x27;t get that close, and it was just plain uncomfortable- but what did I know?    Then I got this model.  It&#x27;s battery operated, I use it once a week for a few minutes, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it eating up batteries (I use Duracells).  But the main thing is to get one that is not rotary, but rather more like a \\&quot;sword\\&quot; like this one.  This kind of design is simply more comfortable, and allows you to be more close and precise. To boot, this one cleans up easily- I just run it under the water in the sink, and know that you can always pop off the plastic cap around the tip for a more thorough cleaning if need be.    So take my advice guys and give this one a try if you&#x27;re dissatisfied with your current trimmer.  And if you don&#x27;t use one, let me just say that people do notice excess nose hair whether they tell you or not.</li>
    <li> This nose and ear trimmer by Philips is not that bad. The quality of the product is OK and it actually works pretty well as it is supposed to be.     The feel is like of a cheap plastic.  Works very well of the products I used.  The trimmer add-ons( two sizes) are good and is the advantage of having a trimmer with cutting blades like this.</li>
    <li> The older I get, the less hair I have where I want it (head)and the more it shows up where unwanted (nose and ears)  I&#x27;ve tried those little mechanical trimmers with rotating blades which never seem to work well to begin with and eventually don&#x27;t work at all.  This trimmer actually trims close, is easy to use and generally works very well.  Even the eyebrow trimming attachments seem to work well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s confortable inside my nose and does what it has to do.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of this product on Amazon.com I decided that this was what I was looking for in a trimer.  Having now had this product for over a month I can say with all honesty that I am thrilled with it.  No longer do I struggle to trim my nose and ear hairs.  The shape makes it easy to get into those difficult areas and the speed and strength of the motor make it easy to use.  I would definitely recommend thw Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision nose and ear trimmer!</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked great when it was new. However, it only lasted a few months before it started to malfunction. Usually a tap on the side would get it to start but now I have to practically beat it on the side of the counter to get it to start up. After starting, it no longer trims like it did when new. I have owned several different types of trimmers so I know that they all wear out over a year or two and have to be replaced. I just expected this one to work for at least 6 months for the price of this model.</li>
    <li> This is the first product of this type I have ever purchased.  I chose it after reading the reviews about rotary cutters and am pleased with this Philips trimmer.  It&#x27;s easy to use and to clean.</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer, and works very well. It has a surprising amount of power for just being run off of 1 AA battery. The best part is that it does not pull your hair or cut your skin. It just cuts the hair, and does it very well. The only reason I deducted 1 star is that the design could be a little better. The on/off switch is also the opener to get to the battery compartment. If you turn the dial too far past the off setting the trimmer will come apart, as it is spring loaded to keep the battery in place. Other than that one little issue the trimmer works very well. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use the Norelco Nose and Ear Trimmer mainly for removing unwanted hair in my ears, back of my neck and eyebrows. It doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as a nose trimmer for which I use a blunt tipped barber&#x27;s scissors. If you want a convenient trimmer for between barber visits, you may find it useful as I have.</li>
    <li> As much as I like the way this thing functions, as many other reviewers have mentioned, don&#x27;t expect it to last very long. Mine died. Currently seeking a replacement. When it did work, I liked the way it cut. Did not pull hair ever. Was long enough to get all those pesky little nose hairs inside the nostrils, and small enough to do so without being uncomfortable. Too bad the quality just doesn&#x27;t allow them to last longer.</li>
    <li> When I originally ordered this product the pictures were somewhat misleading, depicting a light at the base of the cutting head. Those pictures are no longer there, and the description accurately describes the trimmer. At no time was there any mention of a light in the item description.  The trimmer works well, for ear, nose, and eyebrow hair trimming. I have used the device a couple of times, and the supplied battery is still working good. Rinsing the device is easy, and the included cover is handy for storage. A pouch would have been nice, to keep all attachments in one place.</li>
    <li> This is my second trimmer in the last few years. I had dropped the first one on the floor and it broke. I loved it so I decided to order the same kind. I use it for nose hair and for my eyebrows. Its perfect for me. My husband uses it as well. It works well. no problems.</li>
    <li> You can hear the motor turned operating, but the unit&#x27;s blade simply does not move. I had bought one of these before and the orange plastic part on the tip eventually broke. Re-ordered a new one and it arrived broken. Unfortunately I already opened it and tossed out the packaging before attempting to use it so Im not sure I can return it.</li>
    <li> The packaging is quite hard; but after some scissors and some tearing, I managed to use it for the first time. Very quiet compared to the Remington circular nose trimmer. This one cuts nasal hair swiftly without pain. It&#x27;s essentially a weed whacker, like another reviewer said, for your nose and ears. At a price of $20, it&#x27;s worth the deal.</li>
    <li> Avoid this product!  It worked great the first use.  Two weeks later,  I went to use it and it was completely dead.  Replaced the battery with new and still dead.  Not worth the hassle of returning but makes me cautious of Philips products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 19, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I finally did contact Philips service about the failure of this device.  The first customer service rep I spoke with instructed me to clean the unit by holding the cutting blades under running water.  I did that and it made no difference.  I waited a few days and called Philips again and this time the rep offered to replace the unit, which they did.  They sent me a new unit along with a pre-paid shipping box for returning the old unit.  So far the replacement has worked fine so I have upgraded the product rating to 4 stars.  I rated only 4 stars only because I had to go through the hassle of calling twice before returning the old unit.</li>
    <li> As a man, We need to take care long hairs appeared ....   This is one of great product I have...     WIth Panasonic Nose hair cutter, I use it case by case...     Easy to care for itself...       I love this product very much !!!  I could recommend for you , guys !!!    Cheers !!!  T.Aoki</li>
    <li> ASIN Norelco NT9110    The norelco ear and nose trimmer has good design and works effectively. It is superior to the conventional types. It wpould be helpful if it had a case for the unit and its parts.</li>
    <li> this product is just what they say PRECISION. By far the best nose trimmer up to date...</li>
    <li> This works really well and I would recommend it. I&#x27;ve tried other items that preform the same function but I like this one the best out of the other two I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works.  Hasn&#x27;t caused me pain yet, and does the job.  Give it a try.  I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, he says it works fine.  The price was good and Norelco usually has quality stuff. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer worked one time and did a fine job. A week later it would not turn on, replaced the battery still would not operate. It wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to re-pack and send back to Amazon, so I found a new resting place for this trimmer; It&#x27;s referred to as the \\&quot;GC\\&quot;.... Garbage Can.</li>
    <li> The product works well, if it works at all. I&#x27;m on my second, and it has stopped working. The first stopped working after one use. I got a replacement and the second packed up after one use having just sat in a medicine cabinet. Avoid this product!</li>
    <li> Worked fine until the second time I used it. Defective on/off switch.  Tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.  No hair pulling.  The cutter doesn&#x27;t extend to the end (probably a safety feature) so you have it stick it in a little further.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. Gets to all those hairs in places where hair doesn&#x27;t look good. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> the on/off switch is the stupidest design i have ever seen. the trimmer can and will cut the crap out of the inside of your nose, so be careful.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great when it works. However, every single one I have ever purchased has broken within one or two uses. If you don&#x27;t mind buying this product multiple times, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> Bought this on the basis of other Amazon buyer reviews and this trimmer is really great - what an improvement over the half dozen others I have tried over the years.  I you have a nose and are over 50 you should get this little wonder right now!!</li>
    <li> Affordable, easy to use. Good choice. I&#x27;ve used it for a while and I&#x27;m very satisfied with no problem so far. You only have to be careful and wash the trimmer immediately aftear each use.</li>
    <li> So-so as a nose and ear hair cutter;  better as an eyebrow trimmer. Gone back to my Panasonic nose hair trimmer for nose and ear trimming duty. The Norelco feels more expensive, just wished it performed better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price and delivery was fast as promised.  Does a goo job trimming unwanted hairs in hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> I was compelled to write this review after the second NT9110 I purchased stopped working after about 6 months.  It simply doesn&#x27;t turn on.  (And yes, I&#x27;ve tried a fresh battery.)  The same thing happened to the first one I purchased, but I was willing to consider it an anomaly and bought another.  There won&#x27;t be a third.    Also, the slide-on guides that ship with the unit are extremely fragile.  With both units, the guides cracked within a couple of weeks and would no longer stay in place.    It&#x27;s a shame, because when the unit worked, it worked well.</li>
    <li> Simple machine that gets the job done. Only complaint is that you have to make several passes. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received on time and in working order.  Please note that I have not had very long so I am not rating the reliability or durabilty.  It is a clean, neat, simple design.  The packaging was however difficult to open.</li>
    <li> This thing is awful. It barely cuts hair at all. I threw it in the trash instead of bothering to return it. Look elsewhere for a trimmer!</li>
    <li> Trimmer is well designed and easy to use. Sleek and stylish, it&#x27;s a must have for any man to keep well groomed.</li>
    <li> Works OK, but you have to pass over the same section multiple times and at multiple angles to get it to cut.  Inexpensive though.  Not sure if there are better options, but I&#x27;d be willing to spend a bit more for a more effective choice.</li>
    <li> My husband said this was the best trimmer he&#x27;s used. And then after using it twice, it stopped working. It sat in the bathroom for a couple of weeks before either one of us got around to doing anything about it. And then it suddenly started working again. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that mentioned similar problems, so there must be some kind of manufacturing defect. If it works, it&#x27;s great; but then you never know if it&#x27;s going to work when you need it.</li>
    <li> ... and then just stopped working.  In other words, a piece of junk, and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the worst trimmer that I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ve tried many of the ones out there. It worked once, when I first inserted the battery and wouldn&#x27;t start subsequently. I sent it back to the manufacturer, who, after some confusing customer service, sent me a replacement which did excactly the same thing.  Save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> The design of the blade head doesn&#x27;t allow for insertion into nose or ears as far as needed.  I have used others that allow for this &amp; will purchase another brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Perfect to get at those hard to reach area to eliminate hair from those Personnel places!</li>
    <li> I used this product maybe 4-6 times and it just stopped working.  I replaced the battery and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love the design and feel but in terms of functionality for trimming nose hair it does a poor job. i haven&#x27;t used this for my eyebrows or my ear so maybe it does a better job at those but idk.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work any better then the old, standard cheap nose trimmers you find at the local drug store. For some strange reason, the vibration makes one feel like it is going to nip the skin, although they designed it not to. I notice our old unit gets more use in our home.</li>
    <li> This is the best device for taking care of nose hair. All the other things out there that I&#x27;ve seen are horrible. It&#x27;s an easy 5 stars!</li>
    <li> After using all those cheap trimmers as seen on tv.  While they work they are made about as cheaply as can be.  They are underpowered and don&#x27;t last.  This one has noticeably a ton more power and is well constructed.  Stop buying the cheap POS&#x27;s and buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-9-13&lt;br /&gt;After using this trimmer for a couple of months I think I will change from 5 stars to 3 stars.  While at first this trimmer seemed to work well, after a couple of months it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut the hairs quickly.  I find myself going over and over my eyebrows to get this thing to cut.  It finally does but acts like its dull. Same with any other hair.  You have to repeatedly go over to get a trim.  It still has plenty of power but it does no good if it isn&#x27;t trimming.  Well constructed and lots of power but no cut.</li>
    <li> Works well for a short time, design looks good, but then like so many here, the piece of junk fails because the battery fails to make proper contact.  I am good at fixing things, but this does not make sense and not much you can do but throw it out.  A shame!  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Most comfortable ever, cuts really well, doesn&#x27;t pull any hair, smooth, fast...!!!  Best nose hair trimmer of all the ones out there and I&#x27;ve had several different types.  Must have if you want to trim your nose hair and not be in pain when you do it.</li>
    <li> Sounds lame but I&#x27;ve bought three of these, because my first two failed to continue working, and I never found a reasonable substitute, so I was determined to figure out how to keep this third one alive... Here it is, folks:     THROW OUT THE PROTECTIVE CAP!     Their instructions downplay too much the need to wait until after the trimmer is COMPLETELY dry before placing the protective cap over the head.     If it&#x27;s even the slightest bit damp when you place that cover on, it will NEVER run again... }X0    For this third one, I have yet to use the protective cap at all (although I also haven&#x27;t yet thrown it out: \\&quot;Do what I say, not what I do!\\&quot;).     Hope that saves some frustration out there.    (Norelco, you have to do a WAAAAAY better job emphasizing how absolutely bone dry the trimmer MUST be in order to even consider placing the cap on it).</li>
    <li> It cuts hair but not really. I already had a nose trimmer but it was the type that you have to get the hair inside the circle for it to cut so I wanted one where I didnt have to be aiming, I purchased this product and it takes forever to cut hair you have to go back and forth and it takes up a lot of time. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few of these and this one is the best. It gets very close and has very small blades so it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive areas. Other trimmers tend to give a little pinch here and there and are not nearly as gentle as this one. One very minor complaint is the twist to turn on/off. I always seem to twist too far or in the wrong direction and accidentally open the battery compartment.</li>
    <li> I use this for nose and eye brow trimming. I have never had a problem with this trimmer and it gets the job done. The price was pretty good on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Hello I saw the product on amazon , looked at it and bought it , it works really well , does not cut me the way another trimmer did it is a no brainer to use it . and it trims nose hair and other unwanted hair so great product</li>
    <li> It is really a good one. I went to the extremes like taking it into the ears and nose but as claimed by Philips, it never pulled the hair. It cleans the best. The best part is you can wash it in water!</li>
    <li> Not only does this design of trimmer not cut my nose hair but the more I kept trying to get the hair cut it gave the inside of my nose a rug burn!  I was so frustrated that it would not cut the hair that I snapped the tip off in half!  My advice take it or leave it...  Stick to the round tip design.  I have tried them all and the round devices work and these do not!  I bought this one and was not impressed!  For the technology that we have in this day and age the engineers who pay tuition to expensive schools to learn how to design these products should be able to do much better!  This product is crap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a good one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products for over 20 years and was&lt;br /&gt;expecting the precision trimmer to be as good as the&lt;br /&gt;shavers Ive owned. I was mistaken in that regard because it was not as good as a chippie one Ive been using. Most disappointed!!</li>
    <li> very compact and inexpencive does the job would be nice if was a rechargable so overall very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic while it worked; sleek design and it did its job. After a few months it simply stopped working; I replaced the batteries to no avail. I bought a second one thinking maybe this was just a dud and the second one broke even quicker with fewer than 10 uses. Very disapointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a good trimmer for a long time. This one definitely fits the bill.  It trims the closest of any I&#x27;ve had (which is important) and is built well to boot.  Does a super job on ears too!</li>
    <li> Honestly, this one works not better that any other trimmer and perhaps a bit less.  I was truely hoping this one would get much closer and not miss as many of those pesky hairs.  It didn&#x27;t.  Just my opinion of course.</li>
    <li> It arrived very fast and after using it once, I realized what a great device that is. How did I get by without it?</li>
    <li> Pay attention to detail when cleaning.  Works great if u treat it right, just like a lady.  Eyebrow trimmer could cut a bit closer but gets the job done.  Well built to boot</li>
    <li> well the product is a good quality ok..  i use the trimmer for my nose  and it works ((ok))  not the best because  most of the time its hard to  cut is several places in the nose but the good think about the product is that its good on the battery life and  you can rinse it on running water  and the best of all  it doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  This is the 3rd unit that has died.  Returned the other two, now stuck with one that doesn&#x27;t work.  Used is less than 25 times before it died.</li>
    <li> I have made the mistake of purchasing my third Norelco Trimmer in the past two years.  The battery actually lasts longer than the trimmer!  The third one, I just bought two weeks ago and it has already stopped working.  I took the battery and put it in my wireless mouse, do at least I got some value from my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years, and it still works great! Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs like the Panasonic one and the tilted head makes it VERY easy to use.  HIGHLY recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products developed to do the same as this trimmer. This one does not do the job as well as the others. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this as a (specifically requested) Christmas present, after reading reviews here for many different trimmers.  However I was a little worried about those reviews that reported the trimmer as not working after the first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience this trimmer is easy to use and very comfortable; the profile allows one to get \\&quot;inside\\&quot; enough to do a very thorough job on both nose and ears, yet stay completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the nose is a region with its own mucus, and the ear has its own wax, it is very important to run the trimmer under the tap WHILE IT IS STILL RUNNING, to clean the blades.  If you do not do so, as I suspect those who had trouble after the first time or two, the mucus will dry into a glue that WILL stop the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this trimmer every couple of weeks to keep that \\&quot;Andy Rooney\\&quot; look at bay.  Very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a nice job keeping hair out of all the wrong places. This is a nice unit for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of the cheaper versions of this and they very quickly wear out.  I have had this one now for almost 3 years and it is still going strong.  The attachments are great also.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased, and it is by far the best one. The two Panasonic trimmers I have are torture devices. They half cut the hairs, and half rip them out. This Norelco NT9110 takes a tad longer but it&#x27;s absolutely painless. I highly recommend it over any other trimmer.</li>
    <li> I shaved my eyebrows a little too short, but they&#x27;ll grow back.  Without any attachments, it will cut the hairs to the skin.  Works great and is easy to clean.  Make sure to rinse it under the faucet to clear the hair out, otherwise it&#x27;ll get jammed.</li>
    <li> I do not remember this item</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really work that well. maybe i need something more powerful? doesn&#x27;t arc well into the targeted area. better to look for one with a curved head or something. this one looks good in theory but functionally it doesn&#x27;t really translate.</li>
    <li> Nice grooming tool, use it all the time for hard to reach places</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer is a piece of junk. It suddenly stopped working after 3 months. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> I used to dread using the nose hair trimmer I had before. Every so often, it would pinch -- ow!!! This one never has. Even when used without paying attention, it won&#x27;t snag or pinch. Reliable, easy to use, and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight quibble is sometimes it won&#x27;t run when I turn it on. Easily remedied: just run the water over the blades for a second.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever had! I have had a micro trim and a panasonic personal trimmer and this one puts those to shame!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found this to work very well.</li>
    <li> I had the original MicroTouch razor for over five years before it eventually it broke down.  I was looking at the new(er) MicroTouch razor but it still looked a bit cheap. So I decided to look for a better replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is essentially the MicroTouch but with a much better design and feel to it.  The on/off rotating switch works flawlessly and is quite smooth.  The NT9110 is quite the upgrade.  The quality of parts is impressive and even the attachments fit perfectly (which didn&#x27;t really happen with the MicroTouch.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likely for safety requirements, Norelco enhanced the blade by making it smaller and flush with the head of the trimmer body.  This enhancement adds improved looks and gives it a professional appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint is that by enhancing the trimmer&#x27;s appearance Norelco sacrifices a bit of performance from the blade.  By having a slightly taller blade, the MicroTouch was very effective at removing hair.  It had this gentle \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; quality that took getting use to -- but was not uncomfortable or painful in any way.  The Norelco prevents this \\&quot;scrape\\&quot; ability since the blade is flush to the body; however, the trimming action is less effective.  Fortunatley, this change just requires a bit more pressure and force to remove those stubborn hairs.  Due to this change, I probably take twice as long than before -- a significant difference but not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleek design offers a thicker, rubber grip which allows for positive control even when using wet.  The battery compartment is well-engineered into the on/off switch.  The unit just requires (1) AA battery -- unlike the MicroTouch&#x27;s (2) AAA batteries -- which are usually more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, a rechargeable battery system with a little docking station would have been cute but the alkaline battery system makes it better for travel and less prone to charging failures.  Obviously, it saves on consumer cost too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confident that this Norelco will last a long time.  The unit is water-resistant (within reason) and is very easy to clean with a splash of water.</li>
    <li> Almost a year ago, I bought a Phillips Norelco body groomer, BG2040, I loved it out of the gate. In early May, 2012, it stopped working, (only to find out later, the charging unit had a short in it). Knowing I had registered the groomer on-line shortly after purchasing, I went to the P/N website in order to contact them about the problem. The agent on the other end of the phone understood my problem and started asking for my name, address, phone number, etc., and then said a brand new replacement was being shipped to me at no cost whatsoever. Imagine my surprise, I had expected a fight for fixing or replacing the unit because of the way one is treated by most other on-line stores. Not so the case with P/N, they stood up for their product, I hadn&#x27;t realized their items came with a full 2 year warrantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement arrived in 9 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeling very excited about getting a new razor, I purchased a nose and ear hair trimmer from P/N, NT9110. Just like the groomer, it operates quietly and smoothly and has an even better warrantee than the groomer! Go figure, instead of a 2 year warrantee, the new one was extended by 6 months which meant the trimmer now has a 2 1/2 year warrantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, i&#x27;m very happy with being treated like a person should be treated after encountering a problem with any item under warrantee. Remember, always register your new item on-line or by sending the registration card that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can strongly recommend P/N for the items I purchased, but I have to believe they would stand behind their other products the same as I just explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Phillips Norelco!</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked well for about 6 uses and now it will not run at all.</li>
    <li> Getting the trimmer out of the packaging was a major effort.  Worked once and doesn&#x27;t look good as a paperweight.</li>
    <li> I used this product just twice.  It seemed to work just fine.  I was still undecided as to its cutting ability.  However, after only two uses, it quit working!  I thought the battery was dead.  I changed batteries and nothing!  Of course I didn&#x27;t save the packaging to return it.  I threw it out!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> My first trimmer was a Panasonic ER411NC.  It was a very good trimmer, providing me with an elegant solution to a problem that most men start to have once they reach middle age: nasal hair.  The Panasonic has a circular tip that has small, slit-like openings.  Inside the tip is a spinning blade. The hair gets caught between the slits and the spinning blade.  That is how it cuts.  I wrote a review of that trimmer back in July of 2004 and gave it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second trimmer was another Panasonic, ER421KC.  This one had a small LED light to help you see while trimming under your nose.  I bought it to replace the ER411NC after it fell off the counter and damaged its blades.  The ER421NC is very uncomfortable.  Althought it uses the same blade design as the ER411NC, the motor seems to be weaker.  It is easily stopped.  The spinning blade sometimes cannot cut the hair that gets caught between the slits and itself.  The hair can force the blades to stop spinning.  It will be hard to remove without pulling the hair out.  This is very uncomfortable, to say the least.  It will bring tears to your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Norelco (the subject of this review) to replace the second Panasonic.  The design of the Norelco is different.  It cannot be forced to stop by your hair.  It uses the same cutting design as your sideburn and mustache trimmer.  So far, it has proven itself to be comfortable.  However, it does take longer and more effort to trim with the Norelco.  You will have to make sure that the hairs that you want to trim are caught between the oscillating blades of the trimmer.  And, since the blades are small, this could take a few minutes of your time.  Whereas with the Panasonic, all you need do is stick the tip in your nose and move it from side to side.  With the Norelco, you will have to be more deliberate.  However, it is the most comfortable of the three.  Plus, you can use the Norelco to trim your eyebrows, if you need that sort of thing.  It is also the easiest to clean out of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this will be a good trimmer for you, if you value comfort above any other consideration.  This trimmer is waterproof and it can be washed with warm water.est to clean out of the three.    I believe this will be a good trimmer for you, if you value comfort above any other consideration.  This trimmer is waterproof and it can be washed with warm water.</li>
    <li> Even with a new (tested) battery, it will work (maybe).  I have been a happy Norelco user for about forty years.  I purchased this trimmer right after the Arcitec razor that I have since retired as my old one was much better. (closer shaves, better on the neck and around the ears)  Both of these items are now laying on a closet shelf.  I would hope with Norelco&#x27;s capabilities that these items will be improved and restore my confidence.  Bill Knittel</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problem that most users have had with the PHILIPS NORELCO NT9110 NOSE &amp; EAR TRIMMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best nose hair trimmer that I&#x27;ve used so far. I used to use the  [[ASIN:B000136P82 As Seen on TV Micro Touch Men&#x27;s Electric Hair Groomer]] for trimming my nose hair and that one would pull and sometimes cut the skin, but with the PHILIPS NORELCO NT9110 I haven&#x27;t experienced that. It cuts quickly and efficiently and no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer comes with two guards, a short and long one, that work really well to trim your eyebrows and a cleaning brush. And you can rinse the trimmer head under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs on one-AA-Battery. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for almost one year now and so far it&#x27;s been working great.</li>
    <li> Nice design and functionality but it suddenly stopped working after 10 months of very little use.  I would recommend looking at another brand.</li>
    <li> Poor design, very poor effectiveness unless you have hair concentration of a gorilla (no offense meant). A much better choice is the old standby style with the round straight insertion type head. I put the NT9110 in the drawer &amp; that&#x27;s where it stays. I use my older version ear/nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and it seemed to do a fairly good job, but a week later it died and I could not get it to work again. Thinking it was a glitch or something, idiot me, purchased another. Well, it lasted less than a week like the first. I am going to try another since this one is very unreliable.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco doesn&#x27;t just have Precision in its name to sound cool. It is an extremely precise trimmer.    An excellent product, it gets the job done, and at the same time is easy to clean and maintain afterwords. It was much larger than expected, but the AA battery needs space I suppose.    Other than the size, which makes it a little difficult to slip into a travel bag and carry around, the Trimmer is an excellent bet, and never will cause you pain/regret for making the purchase.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll talk about my experience with Amazon. The trimmer was delivered punctually (a day or two early in fact) and was packed really well so it wasn&#x27;t damaged.  The trimmer was wrapped in one of those annoying hard-to-open packages and took a decent pair of scissors to take the trimmer out.  The trimmer works really well and with no pain or snagging.  This trimmer has two notable vices. One, there isn&#x27;t a dock or pouch to use to store the accessories that come with the trimmer. The second problem is that if you twist the trimmer too far the bottom half comes off that holds the battery and falls off, so be careful when using it.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their nose/ear hair in check painlessly and neatly.</li>
    <li> Its basically just like any other trimmer (serated blades moving back and forth), thats designed to get into small places.  Its not perfect, but it does the job.    I dont love it, I dont hate it, and the price was reasonable.  If I were to buy over again though, i&#x27;d probably look into one with a different cutting mechanism on the end.  The advantage to the way it is now though, is you can really get up in there and deforest the shnaz.  Dont be over zealous though, some hair up there has evolved to be in place for a reason (filters dust / particulates).</li>
    <li> Bought this mid last yr for hubby. Still works great and had no problems. Just keep it cleaned and it will last.</li>
    <li> Better off going back to using scissors....this did not do much after several weeks of use...I will be using scissors again</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have owned,  and I had three previously.  Much higher quality,  and more powerful.</li>
    <li> These clippers are powerful for how small they are and they have yet to cause me any problems. No pulling of hairs or anything. Small, compact, and strong. That&#x27;s all you need.</li>
    <li> This thing works fantastic on ears with plenty of powers.  It doesn&#x27;t work so well in my nose and is useless to do eyebrows.  The \\&quot;blades\\&quot; are so short they just never seem to encounter a hair in either case.  Worth it for the ears alone as trimmers with longer blades seem to do well in the other two locations but don&#x27;t trim ear hair easily or closely.  The smaller tip allows you to get right in there.</li>
    <li> Nice and quiet plus waterproof is a plus get the job done my nose is nice and clean and neck line</li>
    <li> I have used Amazon before and I found that they are an excellent company. This product has a fair price, and it works as described,</li>
    <li> Aging guys often must tackle the ear hair that blooms so profusely. I tried several trimmers whose design was not very conducive to trimming. This is the first I&#x27;ve found that really works. I assume that as the Baby Boomer bulge ages, companies are going to pay more attention to that market, and this guy seems to be one of the early outcomes. It&#x27;s quite recent, it&#x27;s quite unlike other designs, and it works like a champ. Very happy with this, not quite so happy with aging.</li>
    <li> Nice small ergonomic design. I like the tilted and thin/long tip design. Easy to use. Must be cleaned with warm water after every use.</li>
    <li> The product works very well and is very precise to satisfy any user of this product.</li>
    <li> This is built well and easy-to-handle. Much better than a similar item of another mfr. That item fell apart after one month. This one is built to last a long time. Removes every trace of hair and is much easier to clean than my old trimmer, which cost more. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best ear/nose trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  They eyebrow attachments are very good too.</li>
    <li> This item is a POS!!! I guess some of the other owners got slightly better life out of theirs, mine died after one use! It worked really well the first time, and then it just stopped! VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> I have to agree completely with E. Rudolph&#x27;s review.  I used mine a few times and it worked well once I got used to it.  Then I went to use it the other day after it had been sitting in the medicine cabinet for about a week and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Seems like a good unit when it works but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for very long.  As E. Rudolph said, it&#x27;s a shame that the Norelco/Philips name is tarnished by this product as they generally do make good products.</li>
    <li> Works well for nose hair and eyebrows. Wouldn&#x27;t use it for more than that. No pain and works pretty fast. Takes one AA battery. So it is very portable.</li>
    <li> Well, this sure beats the crap out of sticking a razor of my wife&#x27;s bikini line trimmer up my nose.</li>
    <li> i purchased this, {Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer}.and it has work very well for me. since then i&#x27;ve purchased 2 more for my parents, try one you&#x27;ll like it......ray</li>
    <li> I have purchased various tools for ears and nose hair over the years to no avail.  This product works because it is the first one that is really designed differently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried half a dozen trimmers for ear and nose hair over the last 25 years, and none has worked well for both.  This magic tool is incredible, never fails, and even comes with two spacers that fit over the cutting head to trim eyebrows to a length of your choosing.  No more need to look like an unkempt shaggy old man.</li>
    <li> This product should no longer be sold.  Mine died within 10 uses.  Obviously, I tried new batteries, and that didn&#x27;t work.  I see from others here that they had similar experiences.  Utter garbage.</li>
    <li> Works well, just keep it out of reach of small children, there&#x27;re small parts that get lost easily.&lt;br /&gt;Sensible price, delivered early.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after owning a Panasonic that I lost on a business trip. It took longer to do the same job, but was much more comfortable. Then, the other day, it just quit working. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Ok... so I read all the reviews of this product before purchasing and decided to go for it anyway, much to my disappointment. Basically, after about 3 or 4 uses, the product died completely. I tried a new battery, still nothing. I saw the other reviews that said this but thought to myself \\&quot;I&#x27;ll try it anyway, maybe I&#x27;ll get one of the good ones.\\&quot; Unfortunately, I did not. So, rather than give it another go I&#x27;m just sending it back and going to try a more reliable product. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> When this product first arrived, it worked for 1 min and promptly failed.  When replacement came, it worked for 5 days then failed.  I followed directions with great care.  Too bad - when it worked, it worked well.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> The NT9110 is well built, easy to clean and works wonderfully. Just wish it had a easy open package like many other things I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. It works great and is easy to use thanks to the angled design of the cutter head. However, I also got one that quit after 1 use. I exchanged it for a new one, because when it works it&#x27;s awesome. The second one is still working. The second one had an insert with the instructions that was not in the first one emphasizing that you have to use the included brush to clean the cutter and rinse it in hot water after using it. I have been religious about that with the 2nd one and that could be the difference in why it&#x27;s still working, so make sure you do that if you get one.</li>
    <li> Great nose and hair trimmer.  Though it came with a built in light but it does not, not sure if that matters because who would trim themselves in the dark?  Powerful and fits well in the hand.  Wish it was possible for the blade to be a little closer to the end but I realize that would be next to impossible</li>
    <li> I have had several like products that barely work. The NT9110 has some weight to it and performs well. No pulling or nicks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a year. It has held up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;This might be the last one that I need to buy for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works well for the hair on the ears. Not excited for the nose hairs. Passable. The old style circular works better for the nose.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. So far it has worked awesome for my ears, eyebrows and nose hair. Been looking for one for awhile. Not many good options out there. Many reviews say it clogs up. No issues here. Very important to rinse after each use.</li>
    <li> The product wroks well for trimming nose hair and ear hair, and also works quite well for trimming eyebrows.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> great seller, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Gets in there and doesn&#x27;t cut you all. it also works well on for any other facial trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have used other nose hair trimmers, the round kind.&lt;br /&gt;This thing shaves all that shrubbery I have in my nose ;)</li>
    <li> The best I have ever owned, I almost gave up on these trimmers!&lt;br /&gt;So glad I got this one, I cannot believe anyone would give this a bad review&lt;br /&gt;And the weird part is this is the first review I have ever written on anything ,&lt;br /&gt;I just had to on this one!!!</li>
    <li> Having used several nose/ear trimmers of different types over the years, this is the best by far. I have been using this trimmer for about two  weeks and I find it to be more comfortable, easier to use, faster, and trims closer than the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> It worked great FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS and then it just died!  Changed the battery and it still did not work.  Plan to ask for a replacement or refund.</li>
    <li> This is my first trimmer, and I am very impressed with ease and safety with which it does its job. In just 5 minutes flat, I was done and ready to roll.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great personal trimmer for nose ears and eyebrows.  I have been looking for a replacement for one I had and after using it for about a month, I highly recommend it.  It trims very close and does not pull hair at all.  The other good feature is how simple it is to clean.  You simply have to run it under the faucet while it is running and it is clean, that quick.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> i was fairly surprised with the overall quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;moment i opened the pakcage (which took forever btw)  but when it i held it in my hand&lt;br /&gt;i just could feel the solid quality  unlike some other ones that are similiarly priced that you can pick up at a local pharmcy. I definitely do like this one a lot. i only gave 4 starts due to the difficulty i had to open the package</li>
    <li> A friend at work told me that I should purchase this since he owns one.  After seeing how his worked I decided to order one.  It is great for many reasons such as it doesn&#x27;t pull on your hairs it trims nicely and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  No more embarrassing nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Price and Delivery was good, but the actual product was not what i expected.  I had a better nose trimmer some time back ($20 at a brick and mortar) and am not very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this trimmer.  However, it simply does not cut hair.  I tried it several times and would have to go over the hair multiples times before it did anything.  It is now in the trash can.  I bought another trimmer for half the price and it actually cuts hair!</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times and found it not to work at for me very well.&lt;br /&gt;tryed it for ears,nose and nack of neck...with poor results.</li>
    <li> I bougth this for my boyfriend after he complaint about not being able to find his.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should even give him this personal item but when he received it not only was he happy, he told me that it was 10xs better than what he had.</li>
    <li> I got this produce in March of 2012.  In May of 2012, it stopped working.  I had only used it a few times for minor trimming.  It worked great when it worked, but obviously, it&#x27;s not very durable.</li>
    <li> Have never written a review&lt;br /&gt;Will make exception for this product&lt;br /&gt;Clearly superior to all the competitive rotary cut devices!</li>
    <li> It works better in the ear than the nostril.  For a good job you will still have to due some &amp;#34;pruning&amp;#34; with scissors inside the nose.</li>
    <li> The facts...This OBJECT arrived quickly...it was manufactured well...The Price was OUTSTANDING!...the color or lack thereof was swell...now that Ive pasted this in to meet my review quota the specific info will follow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works like crap now...dunno if a scissor wouldnt be better</li>
    <li> This is an updated review which I had started about 2 years ago, regarding 3 different trimmers I had previously purchased, now updated with information about the Philips Norelco NT9110.  After a discussion of the prior 3 trimmers, I&#x27;ll review the Philips Norelco NT9110.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally started by buying the Wahl nose hair trimmer, but it died pretty quickly. It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but it trimmed the hairs okay. The quality was sub-par, and the top would constantly pop off, so when it died I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I bought the Panasonic ER421KC. The quality &amp; power was much better than the Wahl, and the Panasonic trimmed better too. But I was pretty disappointed that it only lasted about a year and a half before it died as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next trimmer was the Mangroomer. The quality was similar to the Panasonic, but it didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well. If I went slow enough it would cut the hairs. Otherwise, the Mangroomer pulled hairs. I was never impressed by it then (after only 2-3 uses) so soon after I wrote the review on it I started looking for something else. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it was bad enough that I decided back then to write the review for the 3 trimmers I had tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on trimming, at that time, the Panasonic was the best I had used, but I was still pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer. After only +/- 18 months of use (and only using it twice a month at the very most), I expected to get more out of it.  Likewise, the Mangroomer was only used 1 more time and now sits in a toiletry bag.  I have no idea if it still works or not, and have no desire to ever try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had the Philips Norelco NT9110 for about 2 years, and recently remembered my prior reviews, I decided to update it.  This is by far the better of the 4 trimmers.  I read back then about other people having problems with water or rust, or something like that, so I always made sure to blow any access water out after cleaning it.  I also never put the cap back on.  Instead, I stored it in an open place where the blades wouldn&#x27;t get damaged, and any moisture left behind would still be able to dissipate.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed this trimmer before, but something about the design turned me away from buying it.  For whatever reason, I felt the other rotary designs would/should be superior, but they&#x27;re not.  The Philips Norelco cuts just as close as any of other trimmers, it has never pulled one hair, and its never cut me (which was a concern with this design, and I&#x27;ve jammed/pushed it into any areas as needed).  If something ever happens to it, I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> The price was right but the trimmer is very noisy.  I would pass on to another trimmer if I was looking again.</li>
    <li> I love when cost and quality align. I have purchased a couple of trimmers from other manufactures over the years and found them to be disposal. Bought this model over three years ago and still works great. Now I buy these to give to friends as gifts.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer off Amazon for like 18 bucks. When I received it I was excited to use it. It doesnt pull hair at all! Its kinda scary because you think its gonna catch the inside of your nose but it didnt at all! It was quick and the added eye brow trimmers are great! I would however go to walmart and buy it for 13 bucks.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I expected to get. Nothing more, nothing less. But I am satisfied with what i got.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get to all parts of the nose. The type with a rotating cutter works better. Cannot recommend the product</li>
    <li> This could not resist for a week. Very bad experience. After 2-3 days of use it just stopped working. I tried changing the batteries but still it did not work. DEAD forever.</li>
    <li> A powerful tool that gets the job done! Very impressed with its performance and power. This Philips has a durable construction and weight to it. will last a long time. like the eye brow attachments!</li>
    <li> works exceptionally well on men&#x27;s eyebrows.  Also real good on hair growing from the rim of the ear, as well as hair in the ears.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Good power for trimming up close around the ears brows.  Also works wonderful on those pesky nose hairs.  I am highly satisfied and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good price and quality product very happy with purchase thank you very much excellent material for easy grip and handling&lt;br /&gt;excellent product</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!  I&#x27;ve used this about 4x now and still doing the job.  Great purchase for the quality and price.</li>
    <li> Two years later, still works.</li>
    <li> Great size, cover for the blades for when in a toiletry bag when traveling, and good functionality. The battery is replaceable too.</li>
    <li> Deep trimming, easy cleaning and operation. Caps and adopters are easy to loose so find a poach to keep them together.</li>
    <li> Works great and just what I wanted.  Good price too.    Woody</li>
    <li> Well I like Phillips product for shaving and trimming but i have to say this is not the best. needs to be worked on.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this is the best trimmer on the market; not that i&#x27;ve tried them all, but it is completely painless!</li>
    <li> Not the most pleasant part of grooming.  This is the best tool I&#x27;ve found for the job.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect weapon to remove your nose hair, fast shipping and a very good nose hair remover with great price, you can&#x27;t beat that!! Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> does not cut  nostrils hair, even when placed right in nostril  on skin.  wish it works as good as it looks.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It came with a battery included, but I prefer a quality battery. It is nice that it is water resistant.     The one thing that would make this better would be if it came with a case to hold the attachments after it is opened.    All in all it is a great value.</li>
    <li> What a great trimmer!  The best of it&#x27;s kind!  But the quality of the motor is terrible.  I would gladly pay twice or three times as much for one of these trimmers if I know it would last several years instead of just ten times.  It&#x27;s so wasteful....</li>
    <li> Worked OK for 2 weeks but than stopped. It was dead as dead can be.  Very surprised because this was made by Norelco. I returned it and got my money back.</li>
    <li> This product worked well for a couple of weeks, then suddenly on about my sixth use, it would not turn on.  Defective, not damaged.  Returned the item to Amazon, and they sent a free replacement.  Same defect -- stopped running after two uses.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Great product .. works well on nose hair and with the attachments it is easy to trim my eye brows. Great product. Best I have found.</li>
    <li> i have had any number of trimmers. this is the best and is easy to use and does a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought this item online and used for one time. Afterwards when I tried to use it never gets on. It is a total waste of time ans money.</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the people here.  It&#x27;s a great trimmer.  I was SO excited the first time I used it.  Unfortunately it never worked again.  I thought it was the battery but it wasn&#x27;t.  Just stopped working.  Very unfortunate.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but does not do to well on longer nose hairs in the upper and lower parts of the nose. Round clippers seem to do a better job.</li>
    <li> For many years now my nose hair has been trying to kill me or at least frustrate me to death. Disgusting, yes. That goes without saying. I tried high end and low end rotary trimmers. They came, they went but they did not satisfactorily work. Sure I had considered the non-rotary models but the fear of cutting the inside of my nose left me sucking my thumb in the fetal position. Then I noticed this Norelco model and thought, I have been happy with there products in past so just maybe this would do the job without sending me to the emergency room. I decided to remove my thumb from my mouth and order. To my utter amazement it works perfectly as well as being safe and cost effective. Fear not Nose sissies!</li>
    <li> I got this last fall and have used it a number of times. It works great and is \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used. I tried to use it yesterday and it was dead. I started to look on Amazon for my order so I could see how to get it fixed or replaced and thought it might be cheaper to buy a new one. That got me to reading the reviews and I came across one saying they had the same problem and a 2 minute soak in water got theirs working again. Sure enough, I stuck mine in warm soapy water and it immediately turned on and works fine! So, I guess the moral is, rinse well after using.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews on this trimmer, I was concerned that it would be poor quality.  This is not the case.  It is good quality and the trimmer works great.  I would recommend it for anyone who is not happy with a rotary trimmer (I found the rotary trimmers pull at hairs - this trimmer cuts them).</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a bargain price. A must for the over 50 male. Out performs other models/brands that I have used.</li>
    <li> My eyebrow, ear and nose hair game is on point.  S*** gets outta control fast so I needed an electric razor that can keep up with my extreme growth schedule.  The \\&quot;eyebrow\\&quot; attachment is garbage.  It appears it only cuts when using it in one direction.  Total trash, makes my brows look like your 70yr old uncle Hank.  No, the other one.  I used it on my nose hair, and 30min later I was playing Frozen with my daughter, and BAM!  Pulled out about a quarter inch nose hair. Just chillin up there.  I was Sven.  I&#x27;ve used other Norelco trimmers of this fashion, but this one is hot garbage.  Smokin hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after falling for an infomercial&#x27;s false claims. A friend of mine recommended this trimmer. I have thick whiskers that my Norelco razor&#x27;s \\&quot;pop-up\\&quot; trimmer can&#x27;t handle. I have used just about every trimmer out there and this one works incredibly well! And at this pricepoint, it cannot be beaten! Thanks for creating a trimmer that actually works, Norelco!</li>
    <li> The product is poor. I have had two of them,(Phillips shipped the 2nd one with no problem). Trouble is, each of them worked only once, and I trashed the second one. It surprises me that a company of this size would produce such an unreliable \\&quot;toy\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It does not pinch or pull the hair like the rotary trimmers on the market.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST trimmer on the market!  It has more power than the drugstore variety. The trim head will NOT nip or cut your skin.  The attachments fit properly; and, in addition to nose and ear hair, this product is great for trimming moustache and eyebrow hair. I&#x27;ve tried many others, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> Have you ever noticed you have hair growing out of your nose??? Its so embarrassing. I tried&lt;br /&gt;scissors but it was dangerous. This is so easy and does such a great job. Haven&#x27;t had hair in my ears&lt;br /&gt;yet (that&#x27;s next) so can&#x27;t say anything about that...</li>
    <li> This worked the first two times I used it, then it died.  There&#x27;s no excuse for such poor product quality!!!  And yes, I checked the battery, it&#x27;s still good.  Even tried a new one.  But the trimmer just won&#x27;t even turn on.  Bummer!!!  Wish I had known it only had a 1 month return time - I&#x27;m late by ONE DAY!  Very unhappy!</li>
    <li> Trims everything with ease, battery doesn&#x27;t die after 5 uses, very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good product, excelent</li>
    <li> This is the easiest to use nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;But the instructions were not specific enough, and OMG,&lt;br /&gt; the packaging was horrendous in trying to open!</li>
    <li> Worked the way it was promised.  Be sure to clean it each time with running water. Worth the money.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> Does the job for the most part, and has operated well for several years, but the mechanism just doesn&#x27;t cut most nose hair.</li>
    <li> I only wish that I could get it to grow on the top of my head, but it will not.  I bought the trimmer to help with a problem, so far it has worked well.</li>
    <li> This is my second Norelco nose &amp; ear trimmer.  The blade on the first one started getting dull after about 2 years of use, and finally the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore.  So I gladly replaced it with the same thing.  Trims nose hairs very easily, in fact the 2nd one was better than the 1st in this regard.  I like how the trimmer is a long mechanical &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34;, as it works on ear hair equally well.</li>
    <li> I bought two at FRYS electronics a few years back and just now opening the second one because the other finally is getting dull, altho still works with numerous passes.  I do not know why others are so hard to please - the price is right - attachments work - it is waterproof and can rinse off after use and dab dry - and it gets fine and coarse hairs for me, nose, ears, and brows.  I have not abused or dropped it on a hard surface repeatedly, altho I remember a drop or two - still it worked for over a year or more with replacement batteries as needed, which was not often for a twice/three time a week use.  I am here to buy one as backup now that I finally opened the second one now.  this is exactly the same unit and packaging I have - HA, I do have to agree, the plastic is a Be-Yach without a razor handy!!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, true value for money. Best in its category...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: You just need to be careful in its handling...my earlier trimmer fell from 30&amp;#34; height and got into multiple pieces...</li>
    <li> The packaging was a challenge to open. The trimmer has a good exterior design and appeared to perform very well. Unfortunately after a couple of weeks of medium usage, it just stopped working. It runs on a battery and the battery was still new. There are no moving parts. So after repeatedly trying to turn it on, removing and replacing the battery repeatedly in the correct position, and turning the trimmer on and off, but getting nothing when it was turned on, I determined it was electronically defective. Whatever was defective was invisible. I returned it with the free return label and received credit without any problem.</li>
    <li> If product works as good as it working now....after 6 months, then I am happy....because I read reviews that says all these nose/ear trimmers regardless of the maker......will stop working after a couple of months or so&lt;br /&gt;So time will tell&lt;br /&gt;So far I am quite satisfied with the performance of the product, and I like the eye brows trimmer comb extension that comes with it</li>
    <li> This little guy does some excellent work!  I used it for the first time and it cleared out everything that my old one couldn&#x27;t get to.  Definitely buy this over some of the more expensive ones.  On the opposite coin, spend a little more and get this one because of the quality and performance.  I used a Microtouch before and it was inferior compared to this model.</li>
    <li> It broke after just a couple months, and when it did work, it did not trim well.</li>
    <li> I went through a nose trimmer once a year, until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little trickier to use than the cone type, but it&#x27;s durable.</li>
    <li> It may just be me, but this product just doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  The blades buzz, if I get it at just the right angle it will trim hairs.  But, if I&#x27;m off ever so slightly, it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.  Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Im getting  tired of buying anything electronic from amazon that doesn&#x27;t work.  This doesn&#x27;t either but im tired of sending crap back.</li>
    <li> Quit working after 9 months of very light use. I would suggest buying a different product line as this is no longer returnable.</li>
    <li> Husband isn&#x27;t too fond of it. Says it&#x27;ll do</li>
    <li> When my rotary personal trimmer stopped, I bough this pair. No matter how long I hold it in my nose it does not cut the hairs, not even the really long ones. So I got another cheap rotary type and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Nice price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> Looked at the packaging and realized it was an exercise in futility to try to open it without scissors.  However even with a small pair of scissors it was still an exercise in futility, had to make cut after cut, rip and tear just to get to the product.  Finally got it out of the clamshell but now I hate the product with a passion for having made me go through all that effort, will probably toss it in the trash unused.</li>
    <li> real answer to ergonomic battles with weird hair areas, god I hate getting old. what else can you do not to gross people out</li>
    <li> I was tired of yanking my nose hairs out with either tweezers or my fingers. I considered the NT9110 because it wasn&#x27;t too expensive for me to worry too much if it was inconvenient or uncomfortable to use. Had it for a couple months now and it works great. Trims the hair and I have yet to cause myself and discomfort with it by either snagging on a hair or catching skin with the clipper. It is a simple, affordable, convenient solution for those who want trimmed nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it in my ear and cannot comment on its effectiveness there, but would imagine it is equally effective there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a &amp;#34;useful&amp;#34; nose and ear trimmer for a number of years and up to now, all have been useless and haven&#x27;t lasted very long. I didn&#x27;t give up, though. When I saw the Philips Norelco brand, I thought, this is my final effort! I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This actually does what it is supposed to do! Being in my late 70s, I have more hair growing from my ears than on my balding head! When I was a young man, I would encounter older men with hair growing from their ears and nose. I did not want to be like that! This is easy to use, very easy to clean, and does the task perfectly. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he said it works very well. He also uses it on his eyebrows and it does a good job. This is a great quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> Picked this because of the favorable reviews it received.  Unfortunately, it does everything EXCEPT cut hair (which is its purpose.)</li>
    <li> Yes. It WORKS, It does not pinch or pull or hurt. It&#x27;s a great little machine for those pesky nose hairs. I love it. It works. The best little trimmer ever.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT CHARGE ABLE NOR DOES IT WORK  as good as my broken one which i will buy another one but its more powerful</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a nose hair trimmer. It works really well. It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull on your hair at all. It can also be used to trim around eyebrows/ears as well. It&#x27;s also easy to clean, just run it under water while it&#x27;s still turned on. Compact size doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the drawer either.</li>
    <li> This is not the first Norelco product I have bought that died a week later. I was hoping this time would be different. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I ignored the reviews that said that they worked great until they suddenly stopped.  I figured that mine might have a better shot.  I was wrong.  I&#x27;m off to buy a different one!  When it did work, it worked ok.  It wasn&#x27;t a very strong cut.  I like the shape of it for cutting, much moreso than the round cuts.  But if it doesn&#x27;t work, then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!    I purchased this model 2 years ago.  After 1 year the plastic casing around the blade cracked.  And now today, infact, it completely died! I tried several different batteries.  It&#x27;s now junk!  I paid $26 CAD,</li>
    <li> It has always served me well. When I forget to have my eyebrows trimmed when I get a haircut, I always rely on this with the attachments. They leave something to be desired but they work well when you need them. It&#x27;s also great for nose hair and it hasn&#x27;t failed me in the last two years that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that I would have it around for years if not months. I ignored the low star-ratings assuming they were overreacting. I used this trimmer ONCE, no joke. And that ONE time was probably for no longer than 1 minute. I went to use it again and got nothing. I changed the batteries numerous times, shook it, gave it a few days, nothing worked, it died. Philips should be ashamed of themselves for not solving whatever problem it is they are experiencing with this product. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> THE PHILLIPS NORELCO NT9110 IS A EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND WORKS EXACTLY AS STATED.  MY HUSBAND IS QUITE PLEASED IWTH THE PRODUCT.  QUICK DELIVER AND WILL US AMAZON AGAIN SO MUCH EASIER THAN LOOKING IN STORES.</li>
    <li> Not the best trimmer not recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great product when it works.  I loved the eyebrow trimming combs and it did a nice job with nose hair as well.  As others have noted, however, it does not work consistently. Several times I switched it on but nothing happened until I tapped it against the countertop a few times.  Other times I opened it up to find the battery compartment moist, even though I was quite careful to not immerse the entire unit.  All I can figure is that water seeps down from the blades into the motor and battery compartments.  Mine finally died for good after less than a year of light use and I will not be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> I have one of these in my home and vacation cottage. It does the job without any discomfort. I would give it five stars, but the bottom does slip off. The one at home still works after two years of use.</li>
    <li> I use the Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer for keeping my pubic area clean after shaving it with an old fashion hand razor and beard gel which I lather up.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well for large clumps of hair so be warned.  I used to use a regular barber hair Trimmer for my lower regions but my [blank] got stuck in it and it hurt badly for days after.  Probably the best way to trim your lower region is to use scissors but don&#x27;t do it in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little cheap product that won&#x27;t last, it also does not have a vaccum for Nose suction.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised...great quality and at a great price. Would definitely buy again if I needed a replacement item. This is the one that gets the job done!</li>
    <li> This is the best nose &amp; ear trimmer that there is!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mine for over 5 years - yes 5 years and it&#x27;s probably going to go on for a while yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one recently for a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other types but none work as well as this do &amp; yeah, there&#x27;s no &#x27;hair pull&#x27; either.</li>
    <li> I have been trimming nose hairs with some small scissors. It is a complicated task and is awkward to hold the scissors with your non-dominant hand. So I decided to purchase this item. For the price this trimmer does what its intended. No more nicks or hair pulling.</li>
    <li> it works well and i love it..</li>
    <li> Used it for years and still going strong.  Love this little product by Norelco.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> It works as hoped. Plenty of power and precision for the intended purpose. Trims reasonably close without nicking.  Just rinse the trimmer blades after each use, as indicated in the instructions.  The attachments are a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Works well and is made well. Better quality than similar &amp;#34;made for TV&amp;#34; products....</li>
    <li> Works best on shorter hair (use your old rotary or safety scissors to trim the long stuff first) due to its unique cutter head.  Gets very close but so far I&#x27;ve not been nicked, even though it seems like it would.  Due to the long angled cutter head it is better at getting into the \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; than my old rotary model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my complaints which cost it one star:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Because it must be rinsed thoroughly after each use, it must somehow get dry.  If you put the plastic protective cap on as is, it will NEVER dry and will corrode the works inside.  To alleviate this, I put several holes through the cap.  To do this, heat an ice pick or awl and poke away.  I suppose a Dremel-like tool could cut holes or slots as well and may be safer.  In any case, make sure there is plenty of ventilation so that the device will dry thoroughly or leave the cover off until it is COMPLETELY dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  It&#x27;s too loud to use for the hair in my ears.  Very uncomfortable at that proximity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  The ON-OFF switch is actuated by twisting the two halves of the barrel.  If you twist too far, the barrel comes apart in your hands revealing the battery.  This could have been better designed, but is more of an annoyance and certainly not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this trimmer and would probably purchase another.  If this one lasts as long as my Philips-Norelco shavers have in the past, I may never need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Close trim inside nostrils with no pinching.  Just make sure you rinse, brush with provided cleaning brush and pat dry after each use and you will keep the trimmer clean and keep the blade from getting stuck next time you use it (I.e., so it wont stop working after a few uses).  The eyebrow comb trimmer attachment is simple and works surprisingly well also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Nose/ Ear/ and Eyebrow trimmer for a very long time. Good quality and easy to clean. I use it weekly for Nose/ Ear/ Eye Brow trimming. I was using scissors prior, but this is much faster with the Philips Norelco Nose Trimmer. I do still use scissors for my mustache. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an easier way to trim the Nose/ Ear/ or Eye Brows.</li>
    <li> My husband claims it doesn&#x27;t work. It was supposed to remove those little hairs by the entrance of the nose but it fails completely.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other clipper type of devices in the past. I have found that they rarely work and I usually end up getting a pair of scissors and using them instead. I saw this item on a supermarket shelf, priced at £22.00,so looked on Amazon and found it a lot cheaper and with some good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of plastic and comes with the necessary battery and several different cutting heads. The actual head is different from the other pull and cut systems I have tried before. With no pulling, this head shaves off the hairs brilliantly, with tiny shaving type of serrated heads. It is simply brilliant. The only thing you must be careful of and it is clearly stated in the instructions, is that you clean the head with water and the small brush that is supplied. If you do this every time you use it, it does not jam and works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simply the best hair trimmer I have bought, it does its job and is relaible if looked after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought Unit as I had a Norelco razor for probably 20 years and bought a new one and thought I would try the Nose trimmer</li>
    <li> I bought this product almost 2 years ago, and it still works great. I use it about every 2 weeks, primarily for nose and ear hair. It trims away excess hair with no pain, no irritation. Very smooth to use ... I have a sensitive nose, and some trimmers cause me irritation, but with this unit, I can easily trim unwanted nose and ear hair with no problems. The battery use is very good ... I rarely have to replace a battery. After 2 years of use, I would give it 5 stars for doing everything it is supposed to do, not breaking (like so many cheap products nowadays), and being very comfortable to use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> People say you are always well groomed. And that goes for no weird hairs in my nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be letting anyone in on my secret? But it is from this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a replacement of the exact same one I purchased at Walmart years and years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> Not necessarily interested in talking about the new places you find hair as you approach your 50s, but this machine is PERFECT of attacking all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled head and thick handle make it easy to use and get to hard-to-reach places...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts well and the eyebrow attachments are awesome in helping to keep me look like some old, ex hippie college professor.</li>
    <li> Ideal for any man battling ear and nose hair.  And if that&#x27;s not you yet, it will be sooner or later.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it gets the job done.  No problems or issues at all.  The battery lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Unlike the last version of the same item I had, this one is very hard to turn on and off--the cheap, plastic, turn switch is hard to turn. Except for this, which is a pain every time it is used, the trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt or tickle. Just gets the job done. And I&#x27;ve been using it for a while on the first battery.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as advertised and works better than any nose trimmer previously used.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it to anyone who needs this product.</li>
    <li> I like the performance of this hair trimmer and it&#x27;s angle, just right to get at those unwanted stray hairs in the nose and ears, it also works great for trimming your mustache and beard if you have one.</li>
    <li> Sorry, we&#x27;ve not yet used it but got it on time and in good condition</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on anything in 50 years - This is the worst product I have ever bought in any category - It does absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> The first time I&#x27;ve ever bought and used a nose trimmer. It is good enough to buy this one. A little expensive I think.</li>
    <li> This is the best rotary shaver I have ever had the pleasure of using.  I have always wanted one of these but kept reading some of the bad reviews and hesitated.  I am very pleased with the shave I get with this shaver.  The 1050cc is well worth the money I paid for it.  No raser burn at all and very close shave.</li>
    <li> what i paid for the trimmer is a steal i have seen the same item in a retail store for more$$$$$$ than i paid. i love the trimmer it trims great with out any pulling or pain. the trimmer is also very easy to use my 5 yr old son could have had the trimmer running in about 3 minutes. would recomend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to try a nose trimmer. It works! Will recommend to my guy friends to buy this.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly as described: very precise and comfortable. This is the only trimmer that does not pull on the hair in these sensitive places as it is trimming. A true quality instrument.     Thank you, Tony.</li>
    <li> Package had been opened.  Battery missing.  Inserted new battery unit would not work.Company did not charge me.</li>
    <li> For many years now, I&#x27;ve had an embarrassing problem of fast growing extremely long nose hair. When it would get unbearably long, I would pull them out with tweezers. This process was long, painful, and inefficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the NT9110, the process is now efficient and almost painless. The NT9100 is able to trim my forest of nose hair to the point where it is almost nonexistent. Two and a half weeks later and I am nowhere close to needing another trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Whether I was not using it correctly or I just needed to be patient, it seemed to take a little while for the serious trimming to start. Several minutes in, I went from &amp;#34;Is this thing even working right?&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Wow! My nose hair is gone!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- The instructions for this thing are laughably hard to read. Fortunately, it is also fairly simple to operate, at least for the nose portion.&lt;br /&gt;- I have not used it to trim ear hairs, so I am not sure how well it works for that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is definitely worth the buy if you need a separate trimmer especially for nose hairs. It feels like a sturdy product that will hold up for a while.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Doesn&#x27;t trim well and turning it off opens it up most of the time! Poor design</li>
    <li> This trimmer stopped working even after a battery change two weeks after I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Worked OK until then but not reliable.</li>
    <li> A1 Excellent, very good buy, satisfied with all the logistics of handing a good product made with good materials A1</li>
    <li> Trimmer works effectively.  Well worth the cost.  Why do you set requirements when asking for an evaluation that the user is kindly providing to you?</li>
    <li> My dad suddenly got old man eyebrows when he hit 50 and this was a gift that I gave him whilst breaking the news; the piece that goes over the trimmer makes for the perfect length eyebrows that don&#x27;t look groomed but you won&#x27;t look like a crazy old man anymore.  This is perfect and you can use with reusable eneloop AA batteries that make it easy for travel and VERY environmentally friendly.  One word of caution: wear some safety gloves taking out of the package as it&#x27;s really sharp plastic and it takes pruning shears and also a box cutter.</li>
    <li> Works well better than the cheaper rotary types that always break&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the design with the superior cylinder type blade that is at an angle to make it easy to get access to tight spaces.</li>
    <li> this trimmer simply would not trim nasal hair without great pain. kept snagging on the hair. while attempting to trim ear hair it wouldn&#x27;t cut.</li>
    <li> easy to use and make your appearance at lot better for guys that have hairy nosies you need this product!</li>
    <li> I made the payment for a more expensive product model, and they sent me a different model cheaper. The model I ordered comes with two extra accessories brings not sent to me. I pay for the model NT9110 and NT9105 sent me the model .. Pay for something more expensive and send me something cheaper. Do not recommend!</li>
    <li> Gentle and soft, but does not work as well as my cheep bed bath and beyond as seen on TV model I had before. Does not cut well in hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> You have to hold your finger against the side of your nose while you trim.  It does not cut worth a damn.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper that worked better.</li>
    <li> Very good product, reliable, stable. I use it more than six months and had no problems. I think you will like it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different brands in the past but they all had two problems.  First, they didn&#x27;t do the job properly and failed to cut all the hairs.  Second, they stopped working within a year, and usually within a few months.  This Philips Norelco design, with its angled wand, works much better than the old snub-nosed devices.  It goes where they couldn&#x27;t safely or comfortably go, and snips off hairs in all the difficult-to-reach places.  Second, it&#x27;s reliable and doesn&#x27;t suddenly grind to a permanent halt as other designs tended to. This may be because it&#x27;s so easy to wash the the cutting parts, which are better exposed to a stream of water from your faucet than the snub-nosed designs of the past, which easily became glued up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the packaging.  We have all experienced plastic form-molded heat-wrapped packaging, typically for electronics, that is really hard to open and requires some determined application of scissors and knives.  This package goes further -- you almost need power tools to extricate the trimmer from its package.  But once it&#x27;s out, its a real gem of a product.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product. It takes care of my nose hairs perfectly. However, I would like it even more if the cutting blade was flush with the end of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy clean. Remember to clean after each use. Just brush and then run under warm/hot water.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after several uses, a total of 10 minutes use. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This was purchased to replace the older model of the same thing, but this is a poor replacement.  Philips went downhill on this newer version, I won&#x27;t purchase another one, this one barely cuts any hairs at all.  Save your money and find a new trimmer, because this one is nothing like the older ones.</li>
    <li> As the manufacturer says in the manual, wait to get used to it. In my first try it made me happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was OK.  My old cheap trimmer from walmart that I&#x27;ve been using for 4+ years on the same AA battery worked much better.  The blades on this trimmer are very small and requires many passes to trim hair.</li>
    <li> Great product can be used for old men with hairy ears as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace two circular nose hair trimmers and a small facial hair trimmer (for that peach fuzz on the cheeks). The trimmer looks great but does NOTHING. I can&#x27;t even get it to trim the peach fuzz let alone nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Read other reviews that said that the trimmer broke or became non functional shortly after use.  This is not what I found. I rinse it after use and it has been the perfect grooming accessory.  I recommend this product most highly as it trims well and is easy to manuever to get the job done quickly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you rinse it after use and take care of it, it will take care of you.&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;Here I am 2 years later still loving it.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer is an OK trimmer that feels good to handle, but that&#x27;s it. I have long nose hairs which grow fast and curl inside my nose, making it hard to get the trimmer to work well trimming close to the inside of my nose. The Panasonic model had earlier worked best: a pen style trimmer with a narrow blade.    I would look for something else in the Panasonic line; the small holes on the head along with the weird cleaning angle make it awkward to clean and use in all but the shortest nose and face hairs. I bought this as a price with an Amazon coupon about two years ago, not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> I searched and used many before happening upon this. This is the best I&#x27;ve used for nose/ears. I just purchased my second. Highly recommended...great product/great price.</li>
    <li> I have owned two different nose and ear trimmers in the past and had given up on finding one that is effective. After being told that my eyebrows would benefit from a weed-wacker, I decided to do some research and to try again. I am so glad I stumbled upon this one because it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This trimmer gets the job done with a low price tag. No complaints here.[[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> After my Revlon trimmer gave out, I switched to this one. I use it to trim the small hairs in my nostril and around my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about the design, except that the built in guard seems to obscure contact with the razors.  This means I have to make several passes and sometimes no hair is removed.  These hairs seem they would be relatively easy to trim, but not for this trimmer.</li>
    <li> It is poor quality; it does not function properly; and it broke after a few uses. I am disappointed with it.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time and it was well packaged.  My husband has been very happy with the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work at all! I tried cleaning it after using it and still doesn&#x27;t work. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I love the design and it&#x27;s feels well made and feels very powerful.  However it just doesn&#x27;t cut very well.  I have to go over the same area either in my nose or ear numerous times and even then it misses a lot.  Those cheap little Remington and other off brand trimmers with a single AAA battery cut better than this thing.  If this cut better, it would be a complete winner.</li>
    <li> This product is awful. It worked well twice, and now it&#x27;s completely broken-- what a piece of crap. I expected more from a name brand product.</li>
    <li> I have two of these trimmers and they a greet for trimming you nose and ear  the price was right</li>
    <li> This is a very weak and useless trimmer. I have had used Panasonic before, and I am back to using Panasonic. This one lasted more than 2 months maybe, but I really never used it that much to begin with. You will miss hair with this thing or else you will spend a long time doing a 1 minute job.</li>
    <li> Merchandise arrived as promised and packaging condition was great.</li>
    <li> I am use to a rotary blade for nose hairs. The one sided trimmer does not do as good of a job. I do like it for back of neck and eyebrows though.</li>
    <li> This model replaced my older Conair trimmer. Better construction, more effective trimming, and able to trim virtually all the way, deep into the nose and ear without any concern of nicking the skin. Cleanup by running water over the cutting edge ... simple and elegant design. Worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> This came free with the Philips Norelco QT4070 beard trimmer.  I have had another nose hair trimming for years but this one is much nicer to use.  Definately would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nose and ear trimming.  It is absolutely non irritating, and unlike others I&#x27;ve used, can be washed under running water after each use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other bands and bought this one based on the reviews and price. This thing is WEAK.  You have to really press hard to get it to do just a little bit of what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;These are so cheap and I replace them every couple of months so I&#x27;m not going to return it but would avoid this trimmer.</li>
    <li> The first one I purchased heated up and died within the first 5 minutes of use.  Considering the heat and after smell I figured it was defective and took it back for exchange.  The second one worked great for about 2 and a half months then while in the middle of a trim just died.  I at first assumed that it was just the battery needing to be changed but even after putting in a new one it still didn&#x27;t work.  At that point I was done and moved on to a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous trimmer I had for years with no problems and if I hadn&#x27;t accidentally forgotten to zip my bag I would still be using.  Going through 2 in such a short time to me shows a lack of quality.  I have other products from Norelco that I am extremely happy with so I have to assume the issue is just with this model.  Either way you would be better off getting something other than this.</li>
    <li> It looks like a lot of people are having similar problems as I have.  After two uses, the appliance must have shorted out as it will not turn on anymore.  Why doesn&#x27;t Norelco fix this problem when they know it exists?</li>
    <li> Execellent product with the worth of price. I love this product and I will defiantly recommend to buy this product</li>
    <li> I gave it to hubby for Christmas. He only used it a couple of times and it no longer works. We&#x27;ve replaced the battery with a couple different ones and it did not help :(</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the unit has AA battery power -- the blades do not stick after use.  It is a good idea to stick the blade assembly under a faucet and run it to wash any gunk out.  The blades are sharp and reach the hair inside my nose and under the nose.  I have used the unit about 3 times since purchase and am pleased with the trim job it does.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE WORST TRIMMER I EVER BOUGHT.  It&#x27;s not like a regular pen trimmer, it&#x27;s a different setup that doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No pulling or nicks till now.</li>
    <li> Does not always work. I have to beat it to turn on sometimes. I thought it might be corrosion on the battery or contacts, but they are both shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT what I expect from Norelco.</li>
    <li> While I have not had the trimmer long enough to rate it, I am giving it one star for the awful packaging. It came in a clam shell plastic package that is impossible to open without damaging yourself or the product. Shame on Norelco for such a hard to open and sharp package. I would think a simple envelope or a cardboard blister pack would be better.</li>
    <li> These Norelco toe nail worked  as I expected.</li>
    <li> Ended up ordering two of these; one for me and the other as a gift. Works great and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> What a waste, does not work on nose hairs !</li>
    <li> I bought one to replace an old cheap trimmer.  The Norelco doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the old trimmer, so I keep on using that one.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer one year ago and it has died. Even when it was alive it really didn&#x27;t do that great of a job trimming.&lt;br /&gt;I have never rated anything before, but felt it my obligation to let others know my experience.</li>
    <li> First one lasted one use, the second one was dead on arrival. Garbage. Can&#x27;t help but be suspicious of all Phillips Norelco products after this experience.</li>
    <li> It quit working after the first use... did not clip hair very well.  I was disappointed and will look for another product.</li>
    <li> I like it because i don&#x27;t feel when i trimm my nose</li>
    <li> Same experience as many others - this product is completely unreliable.  The first one that I owned suddenly stopped working after a month.  Ditto  for the replacement.  I wish Braun had a similar product because their  shavers at least are pretty high-quality.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool, really handy and effective... it just has one major problem.. It suddenly stops working!! And do not think as I did that this will not happen to you as it happened to other reviewers, most probable it will suddenly stop without a clear reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fixed mine by myself, it still stop working from time to time, now I know how to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a design problem, and what makes it stop working is mechanism lock (just beneath the blades. Unfortunately you will not be able to reach that mechanism without removing the small decorative plastic around the blades(you will need something sharp and fine to do so. Then you will need a needle just to give couple of strokes up and down to a small white plastic thing just beneath the blades... you may need some force to do so, do not worry. This will unlock the mechanism and make it work again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for those not technical or who will be little bit lazy to do that, I suggest hitting the unit (vertically) while it is ON against something semi-hard, this may unlock the mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this will work for you as it did for me, otherwise maybe it will be better to return it and get a different model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would rate it 4 or 5 stars if it was durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karamany</li>
    <li> This thing will get rid of all those wayward hairs deep in the crannies of your nostrils! Especially the ones that hang out of your nose and mess up a pretty face....  Buy one and look better!  Better than all the others that I have tried...</li>
    <li> Does not really work that great. Its not good at trimming nose hair. I returned it. It does not cut hair, it just bends it out of the way</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a package deal with the electric shaver &amp; beard groomer.  This does as it says, no complaints.  The eyebrow trimmer has also a comb-like thing incorporated into the design,  it worked smooth &amp; quick, same for the nose area.   Of the 2 Norelco products I got this is the better of the duo.</li>
    <li> I got it only last week, tried it once and it felt good. Hate the packaging though! Too tough to open. But anyways, product is still good and works as expected.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s  sweet  and  i  recamend  it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;100%  grade  and  i  would  buy  another  one  for some ones birth day or christmas!!!!</li>
    <li> quality of product is poor.</li>
    <li> looks great its a awesome product no complains here.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good ear hair trimmer, this is the one. I have tried several different ones and this is by far the best. The eye brow attachments also work great.</li>
    <li> The product is the best one I have purchased for the use of nose, ear and other hair removal. It is easy to use and the razor part can be washed with hot water. It is very safe to use and I am very impressed with its capability. The price of this unit was very economical.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moAZ8ZO299X85H]]Let&#x27;s be honest, reviewing a nose/ear/eyebrow hair trimmer is not the most pleasant task in the world, nor is watching a video review of same. So I will make it a bit easier by not actually demonstrating the use of it. You&#x27;ll thank me later for that :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my video I will merely describe how it works. So in that regard it&#x27;s G-rated and fun for the entire family to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used scissors, rotary trimmers, and on occasion have grabbed unruly nose hairs to remove them from unattractive places on my face. And let&#x27;s face it, any nose hair that is not actually in your nose, is in an unattractive place on your face. Fortunately I don&#x27;t have ear hair, at least not any that is significantly visible, but If I did, the same argument would apply to those pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve found with scissors is that they can be dangerous to use in such sensitive places and don&#x27;t get as close as you might want. Rotary trimmers have typically been quite a painful experience for me. They tend to grab and rip as opposed to smoothly cut, and that can result in a painful experience as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco NT9110 trimmer seems to be effective without the grabbing and ripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow attachments come in two sizes, short and long. You&#x27;re supposed to comb against the grain, that is from the direction of your ear to your nose, when trimming your eyebrows. I had no luck with that. It did not trim, cut or do anything to my eyebrows. Maybe that&#x27;s good, I&#x27;m not sure. But I suspect it&#x27;s because it works better on hair that is more on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; side rather than more coarse hair. If my theory is correct, it might work for you better than it worked on my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really buy this with any expectation of trimming my eyebrows though, or ears, only nose. And for that it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a world of experience with nose/ear/eyebrow trimmers, but compared to the two previous rotary trimmers I&#x27;ve used, this is easier to clean, not as painful to use and  seems a reasonably priced and mostly effective way to keep those nose hairs in tip-top shape. It&#x27;s also relatively comfortable to hold and the angled head make it easy to maneuver in and out of those tight places, like noses and ears. I withhold 5 stars simply because it didn&#x27;t work on my eyebrows but it may for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since a number of people have complained about this trimmer not working after just a few uses it&#x27;s important to remember to clean the trimmer after each use and sometimes even during each use. You need to run warm water over the cutting surface, alternately switching the unit on and off once or twice to dislodge any tiny hair particles. Then air dry and use the brush to finish the cleaning process. This should keep your trimmer happily buzzing along for many exciting nose trimming sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy trimming!a reasonably priced and mostly effective way to keep those nose hairs in tip-top shape.

    <li> This trimmer works very well. It does not yank out the hairs and the attachments for eyebrows really come in handy. Battery lasts a while too.</li>
    <li> Pros:  + Solid construction, feels better than old Micro Touch trimmer  + Water resistant design allows for easy cleaning  + Includes AA battery  Cons:  - When trimming up nose hair, this trimmer seems to pull hair and irritate the nostril way more than my old Micro Touch trimmer.  - Power switch design is strange. Turn the ring too far, and the bottom of the unit can detach exposing battery compartment. This means it is easy to replace the battery, but I would have preferred a more dedicated power button or switch.  Overall:  &#x3D; Good trimmer, easy to clean. A good option overall.  &#x3D; Discomfort in trimming nose hair is a considerable set back. I never had any irritation issues with my Micro Touch trimmer.  &#x3D; If I hadn&#x27;t already purchased this one, I would buy another Micro Touch instead.</li>
    <li> Any merit which this product might have is overshadowed by the inane packaging. I am a healthy male, with an ample selection of shop tools. It took me close to a quarter hour to reach the product . Foolishly, I tried simple things first, like tearing or cutting with kitchen shears. I do hope the company reads these reviews, because this is really a real turnoff for Phillips products.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. Trimmer is well made and solid but does not cut hair easily. One can have a lone hair on their ear or eye brow and cannot seem to find a position to place the cutting head that will actually cut the hair. When you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut. Trimmer will cut the short hairs shorter and not cut the longer hairs. Very frustrating.....!</li>
    <li> Trimmer does not cut hair with any ease.  Trimmers with blades on the tip of the trimmer are much more effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have had two Norelco shavers through the years and have been really pleased with the shavers. when I saw an ad. for the nose trimmer I decided to find information  about it. I&#x27;ve tried various trimmers before and they never got the job done. I decided to try Norelco and have had the trimmer for about a month and find that it is  exactly as I expected - a great product. Thanks Amazon for helping me find this neat  little machine.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo19OO6CWWGERQS]]The Philips Norelco NT9110 Nose hair trimmer is a highly effective trimming device.  The blades can be washed lightly under water and it runs on a single AA battery.  Two eyebrow trimming combs are included.  There&#x27;s not much too say, it gets the job done.  It&#x27;s very inexpensive at the current price of $13.95 on Amazon.  Nose and eyebrow hair trimmers are essential in every person&#x27;s life so make the smart choice and purchase high quality with Norelco.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Good product, does as is advertised.  Was hoping it did more than it actually does but perhaps that was my over-expectations.  The trimmer is fine and does get those pesky hairs that constantly sprout from the ears and nose without pulling or pinching.  The problem is that the head is not rotary, thus cannot adequately reach spaces with the straight head provided.  Still it is a good item to have in any man&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product at a great price.  I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for four years and have had no issues with it whatsoever.  I have noticed that the power of the blade is directly correlated to the life remaining in the battery.  It will be weaker towards the end of the battery, but a fresh AA will put it right back at full capacity.  It&#x27;s great for trimming nose hairs, eyebrows, the back of the neck, and as I&#x27;ve just found out - ear hair.  Out of no where, hair started popping up on my ears in my early 30s.  I thought I had at least another 20 years of avoiding that, but alas.  By the way, there is absolutely no benefit to having hair on your ears.  None.  I bet evolution will eventually thwart the phenomenon that is ear hair, but until then I would recommend using the Philips Norelco NT9110/60 Nose Trimmer 3300.</li>
    <li> It quit after 2 uses. I visited two WalMarts, and found they no longer carry them.  That must mean something.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer, it works as advertised and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, would recommend .</li>
    <li> The ultimate product for personal hair removal hygiene.</li>
    <li> Just turned 27 and realized i needed one of these. After searching a bunch of different ones, i found this. For the price, it&#x27;s better than i expected.Nose, ear, it gets it. Highly recommended for people in my situation, or looking to replace the one they already have.Even comes with a battery. Hell yea!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product</li>
    <li> Trims effectively unlike some other brands</li>
    <li> so far so good&lt;br /&gt;more powerful than the 1 I used it to replace.</li>
    <li> A little weak. Perfect for unsightly pub-ehhh...I mean...nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well I think.  Haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it except low batteries.  I&#x27;ve used mine for two years now with no problems or major complaints.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Shipped fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Scissors work 100% better for nose hairs than this thing. I bought it for my BF and I felt bad that it didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> lacerates, lacerates, lacerates, lacerates the inside of nose.  no thanks, no thanks, no thanks, no thanks, no thanks, no thanks.</li>
    <li> It has a cool and unique design that differs from other products that offer this particular use.......But Norelco has more features and it&#x27;s cool. The package is to hard to open but it comes with all you need to start using it right away!</li>
    <li> It broke after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and i was impressed the way the seller handled professionally and maturely when i needed him to re-route the product since the earlier used address for purchase was slightly incorrect. I have received the product and its working as specified so far. No problems encountered yet!</li>
    <li> Works better than the other style of trimmer.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have hairs made of teflon, but this just pulled my nose hairs and really didn&#x27;t work well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this thing again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many nose hair trimmers through my life and this is my most recent. Me personally I prefer the round ones versus these clipper like models. Seems to miss hairs quite easily where the round ones would fine them, but if you keep your eye on the ball and keep trying you will eventually get those stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently seemed to stop cutting, and tried cleaning, and on other models I have owned you could take apart the head and fix it but with this one I don&#x27;t see a way. So I trashed it and ordered the Groom Mate Platinum XL. The fact there are no batteries needed, the reviews, and the reviews on Badger and Blade I say just go that way.</li>
    <li> Every few weeks, those pesky nose hairs just appear yet again. It is no fun ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use tiny scissors and another trimmer (but was uncomfortable). I&#x27;ve gotten past that. Getting rid of nose hair is potentially painful and very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phillips Norelco NT9110 nose and ear trimmer certainly does what it intends to do. My nose and ear hair are tamed and groomed until the next wave of disastrous, explosive follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Interesting angle. The angled trimmer is more comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t really help trim better, but makes it an easier grip to hold while trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer is skin safe. Awesome! I push it against my skin and it doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Good grip. The rubber grip is a nice addition. Not a huge impact attribute, but worthy to point out nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Uses one AA battery. Though the battery is in the trimmer fairly tight, still be careful when washing with water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this trimmer. It has improved and made it easier to groom my face and overall appearance. Thank you Phillips. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> The goods is high quality but low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of goods purchased in USA is better than that in China even if all of them are Made in China!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In china it is triple price compared with its in USA.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with the performance of the Norelco nose and ear trimmer. It is a bit bulky and heavy - more than other similar products I have tried. Still it is very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> very good device .. definitely no plucking .. by far, best nose hair trimmer ever !! will definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> This a good trimmer for the money. I wanted to stay away from anything that I had to keep batteries in (note to Philips/Norelco: A rechargeable would be nice), but overall, I&#x27;m very pleased. It cuts without pulling or &#x27;snagging&#x27;, and cuts cleanly. Being able to rinse the head under running water is a definite plus. While it does fine with ear hair, I would only give it a B- for nose hair. I have a manual trimmer that does just as well, but the Philips/Norelco is faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only two cons I can think of...it is a little noisy. You&#x27;ll find this out when you trim around your ears. Having a buzzing cutter close to your ear is no fun, but it&#x27;s not loud enough to be uncomfortable. Secondly, the two attachments are for trimming eyebrows, but mine have never gotten long enough for either one to be of any use. If you have a long moustache or short-cropped beard, I see no reason why you couldn&#x27;t use these attachments to trim them. But for me personally, the two little snap-on trimmer guides are useless. In additon to those, you also get a plastic cover to protect the cutting head, and a cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose and ear trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s much better than the circular one I had prior to this that didn&#x27;t have much power. This works well and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Very useful product. I love the no nick blades trims very close excellent buy. Phillios/Norelco makes great shaving /trimming products.</li>
    <li> Like some others have mentioned, this is one of the worst nose trimmers I have ever bought. Amazon replaced 2 of this trimmer and they both have same issue. They just mysteriously stop working after a few weeks of use. Replacing battery does nothing.. The battery was new anyway in the first place. Please refrain from buying this product at any cost.</li>
    <li> I bought the trimmer in July 2012. It worked fine this whole time. I really liked the \\&quot;washable\\&quot; feature, since it&#x27;s indeed an item you want to keep clean. But last night it suddenly just stopped working. I changed the batteries but it didn&#x27;t help, the thing is dead. And, of course, I can&#x27;t return it now since I had only 30 days for a return. And even if I had more time for a return, all the original packaging is gone, so I&#x27;m not sure they would&#x27;ve accepted it. Anyways, very upset the thing is broken and I can&#x27;t get a substitute or a refund...</li>
    <li> Cheap product, it didn&#x27;t last me 3 months after it&#x27;s purchase on amazon. I strongly recommend another nose and ear hair trimmer than this overpriced item.</li>
    <li> Works well, for about a year now, no problems, but then I followed instructions and clean it after every use.</li>
    <li> No pulling or discomfort with use. Not silent but definitely not loud. Great product!!</li>
    <li> An excellent tool for ear and nose grooming, but I especially like the eyebrow trimming combs, a feature that I haven.t seen in other brand of trimmers.  It makes eyebrows trimming easy eve, and precise.  Thank you to Philips Norelco for this very useful tool.  A satisfied customer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the trimmer.  It does a good close trim of ear and nose hairs without pulling.  An added benefit is that it comes with eyebrow trimming accessories which I now use to the great pleasure of my wife who often complained about my wild bush eyebrows.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supose to and doesn&#x27;t pull. Comes with some attachable combs for trimming your eyebrows too.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 of these.  1 out of the 3 didnt work.  I think it is the connection on the inside of the batter compartment.  Be careful when putting in the batteries.  Otherwise it works great especially for the nose and ears.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This one broke in two weeks -- didn&#x27;t even last as long as the others that broke as well.</li>
    <li> Although the account is in my wife&#x27;s name, I am an older male.  This is not the first nose and ear trimmer I have purchased, but it by far the best.  Easy to use, highly effective and easy to clean under running hot water.  All and all, a great buy!</li>
    <li> Product shipment was prefect. Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer did not deliver. Does not work well.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco NT9110 is a nose, ear hair trimmer with eyebrow combs to keep your eyebrows at constant length and remove stray hair. There are two combs to chose from, the short is (0.12 in / 3 m) and the long is (0.2 in / 5 m). The manual also suggests trying to do your neck hair with this trimmer.    The machine is battery operated, it comes with a protective cap to keep the trimmer clean when not in use, also there is a small brush for cleaning. You can also clean it under tap water.    All I can say is that I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer, it does a clean job without iterating the skin, it&#x27;s easy to use and will finish the job in seconds.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome and if you&#x27;re on the fence about go ahead and get it. Every other trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten has never worked well and this one works just like you think it would.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know of anyone who enjoys trimming the hair in their ears and nose.  The task is made more daunting by a market full of underpowered, barely useful powered trimmers.  Over the years I have purchased many battery powered nose and ear hair trimmers, most of which end up in the garbage within a year or less.  I have tried trimmers from Remington, Conair, Wahl and Panasonic.  One had a light and one even had a vacuum, and most of them were wet/dry devices that would be rinsed out with water.  All seemed like a good purchase at the time but all of them had the same problem:  NOT ENOUGH POWER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that most of these small trimmers are powered by a single AA battery, the lack of power only makes sense.  After all, a single AA battery only provides 1.5 volts of power.  Another annoying problem is that most of these devices would not maintain a consistent blade speed.  I would find that when first turned on the units would sound fine but as soon as I started to cut the motor would start slowing way down and would begin fluctuating between faster and slower speeds.  Of course slower blade speed leads to the potential of hairs getting caught, causing the discomfort of pulling.  I can honestly tell you that having your nose hairs pulled is extremely unpleasant.  Even though it rarely made a difference, I regularly installed new batteries in hopes that the trimmers would provide more power and fast enough blade speed to prevent pulling the hairs in my nose and ears.  Eventually I just gave up and threw the device away and would buy a different model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I decided to give the Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer a try.  The patented tube shave technology promises \\&quot;no pulling and prevents nicks and cuts.\\&quot;  I also liked the looks of the angled head, which claims to give better reach and control.  The Norelco NT9110 also doubles as an eyebrow trimmer, which was also an intriguing feature to me.  The cost of this trimmer on Amazon is very low so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my order within a couple of days and eagerly tore into the packaging to retrieve my new trimmer.  Of course in was incased in one of those clamshell cases, which took me no less than 5 minutes to cut and tear open.  I HATE those clamshell cases and wish manufacturers would develop a new way of packaging their products!  Anyway, I installed the included AA battery and switched the trimmer on.  It came to life with a soft hum and I began the task of mowing the hair in my ears and nose.  The blade speed remained consistent and there was no pulling discomfort at all.  Cleaning the blade under running water is an effortless task.  I then placed one of the eyebrow combs on the blade-head and trimmed my eyebrows, which provided satisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Norelco trimmer now for a couple of weeks and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  The NT9110 gives a close cut, provides adequate power and consistent blade speed, and causes no discomfort whatsoever.  I also find that the angled tube shaped cutter head is easy to maneuver and doesn&#x27;t cause as much of a tickling sensation in the nose as the typical rotary trimmers do.  This is by far the best nose and ear hair trimmer that I have used and I hope it continues to provide great service for many months or years to come.  I am concerned because several other reviewers have stated that their Norelco NT9110 died after only a few weeks of use.  I feel that it is extremely important that the owner cleans the device after each use, as the tube shaped cutter is small, and trapped hairs in the cutter assembly could easily cause the blade system to jam.  I also recommend placing a drop of blade oil (not included with this trimmer) on the cutter assembly every now and then, to keep it properly lubricated.  I think that any moving parts, when rinsed in water, should be lubricated with a light oil to keep the parts moving freely.  However, Norelco does not require this or even suggest it in the owner&#x27;s manual.  It is just my personal suggestion.  So far I am extremely pleased with the Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer and would highly recommend it to all men looking for a powerful, battery operated trimmer.  I will provide an update to this review if my trimmer fails or begins working with less satisfying results in the future.ire this or even suggest it in the owner&#x27;s manual.

    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. But the first one didn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;m giving it a 2nd try.Hope this one last alot longer than the first.</li>
    <li> Never worked right. If I leave the battery in it drains it completely. Quit working a few months after purchase. Do not buy. Would give zero stars for a rating.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product.  I used it once and I have yet to get it to turn on since.  A complete waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> The trimmers are OK. The packaging is terrible. It took me to 10 minutes to get it open and I cut myself on the hard plastic twice.</li>
    <li> I got this razor with the vacuum for my boyfriend.  I was tired of constantly finding facial hair in my bathroom sink and having to clean it.  He loves the way it shaves and I love the way it makes my life easier.</li>
    <li> Work well aa battery lasts quite a while..</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job, people that complain about the trimmer stopping from working should read the manual. After mine stopped working after a few months I read in the manual that you have to clean the top for one minute in soapy likewarm water. I did and now it is working perfect again. it cleans very efficient a very dirty area of the human body, so it needs cleaning now and then...</li>
    <li> This device is pretty good for trimming those unwanted hairs. The ones that grow when you don&#x27;t want them to be! The negatives that I&#x27;ve seen on this device is that it has no battery indicator so you don&#x27;t know how long it has left. Along with that it feels a bit underpowered. Similar to when a device is running out of juice but it isn&#x27;t that&#x27;s just the way it is. It doesn&#x27;t stop it from trimming your hairs though. So I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with that.</li>
    <li> It is very useful, cut very well the hair in the ears and nose. I recomend it a lot. excellent</li>
    <li> The $10 to $20 trimmers I used to buy would quit working within a year every time.&lt;br /&gt;They would even kill the battery. I could put a brand new battery in it, not use it for a couple weeks, then the battery would be dead; So I had to remove the battery after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does a great job and I can leave the battery in without worrying about it dying.&lt;br /&gt;Great little trimmer for the price!</li>
    <li> The trimmer didn&#x27;t work right out of the box -- it turned on, but didn&#x27;t trim much hair at all!  I had to trim the same area 10 times before seeing some minimal results -- too bad, I like Philips products, but this one is dud.</li>
    <li> Muy bueno! es especialmente bueno para personas con muchos bellos en los lugares que este producto los quita. 100% recomendable.</li>
    <li> Two stars only because it&#x27;s well done and inexpensive but it does not work. I won&#x27;t recomend it to anybody because it does a poor job getting rid of hair anywhere.</li>
    <li> tough to remove hair from nose! defeats the purpose, started using my old trimmer&lt;br /&gt;more will come after some more days of use&lt;br /&gt;as of now working great</li>
    <li> It trims the hairs when it can find them. But there&#x27;s no provision in this design to actually draw the hairs into the cutting blades. So it mostly just pushes them around until I have to stop and sneeze.</li>
    <li> Many times better than the rotary type trimmers.</li>
    <li> The very best trimmer</li>
    <li> Terrible. Used once and never worked or turned on again.</li>
    <li> No more fear of the scissors.  Had an older model with a rotary cutter that pulled hairs and cut pitifully.  This one helps my appearance.</li>
    <li> If you let you nose hairs grow long, this may work for you. I like my nose hairs close to skin, and this does not do it, it leves about and 1/8 of inch long hair...Not for me..</li>
    <li> This is a good trimmer, works fine.  Only thing is the packaging is as difficult to get into or worse than others have reported.  It is almost a hazardous operation to get inside the plastic package. I required a band-aid on my hand after the battle.  As I noted the trimmer works very well, cuts smoothly and doesn&#x27;t tickle like some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> This item is a very safe product and will not cut you in any way. It has a lot of power and batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great, this is what I was looking for, the machine is great, really soft with the skin, probably I will buy another one</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]Having tried other similar products such as this, I was determined not to make the same mistakes by believing the manufacturer&#x27;s claims.  Took my time reading reviews and I found the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; reviewers were the ones that didn&#x27;t clean their trimmer after every use.  This is an excellent performer.</li>
    <li> Of all the trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the past, this one is great.  That&#x27;s very rare for me to say about anything that&#x27;s on the market.  Usually I find several things wrong with these little trimmers but not this one.  The last trimmer I had, (Braun) was a cheap, plastic piece of junk made in China.  When I&#x27;d tried to start it, I had to hit it up against a hard surface, like the palm of my hand or the wall to get the stupid thing to work.  I haven&#x27;t had this to happen with this one, which is a BIG step in my book.  The only minor complaint I have about this trimmer is, if you want to trimmer the small random hairs that grow under your chin and on you neck, you can forget about using this trimmer to cut them because it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of it.  Your ears, nose and eyebrows are the only places it will do a good job with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, don&#x27;t waste your money with Braun and buy this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well for the eyebrows, but no matter how hard I try it doesn&#x27;t trim nose hairs properly. I am going back to the old fashioned type trimmer.</li>
    <li> Well there are trimmers out there and then there is this little fella.  I&#x27;ve had him for about six weeks now and after trimming everything under the sun I can say this little guy is a very, very, good buy.  It very effectively shaves the bridge of your nose between your eyes, and your eyebrow edge&#x27;s.  The over the ear trim in between haircuts are easily handled (practice a little angle work by leaning the trimmer back towards your face for a nice cut), the &amp;#34;in the ear&amp;#34; and all around the ear shaving as well as any little out of place hairs you want cut down trim with ease.  On top of that it trims the nose hairs without effort as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have mentioned always rinsing with warm water (while it&#x27;s running) after your use.  I followed this recommendation and have had zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.  You also will trim more than you ever did before because it works so easily and is fun to play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 9 MONTHS LATER:  Still great.  Just rinse it out each time and apparently it won&#x27;t fail like those complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT ONE YEAR LATER: Still great. Same recommendations.  Great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2 and a half years later:  Still working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 3 YEARS LATER: It is still working like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 3 and a half years later:  Still working as new.  Great Buy.  I always give it a quick rinse in hot water when done though and it has never failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6 years later:  Working as new.  What a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for many months now and it is very efficient and gives no &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34; like my old nose hair trimmer.  It lives up to the quality brand name.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months back and it has performed at its best since the first day. i have no worries with this brand!!!</li>
    <li> I use this every week, it is very useful, and very convenient, I think every one should have one. of this</li>
    <li> Arrived on a timely basis ... as replacement for identical product which lasted 3 months. Used this replacement once ... to check it. Yes, it functioned. But, subsequent attempts to turn it on failed. Let Philips Norelco figure out the problem. Avoid this product. Select an alternative ... designed to function properly.</li>
    <li> First let me say that this is my first nose/ear/facial hair trimmer. I have had this trimmer for about two years and have never had any problems with it. Haven&#x27;t even had to replace the battery yet. I only use it though about every other week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always trims hair cleanly and it has never pulled any hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the unit is simple and easy. It&#x27;s nice that you can just wash it directly with water. I wash it after every use, which I really think is a must. And perhaps it will last longer if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is simple and effective trimmer. I bought one for my dad, and he has loved his as well.</li>
    <li> Next to the Guttenberg press this is the greatest invention of the last 6,000 years man has been fighting off Dino the Dinosaur (if you believe that sort of nonsense).</li>
    <li> Was great for about two months then one day it ran very poorly.  Seemed as though the batteries needed replaced.. Multiple sets of brand new batteries did nothing.  Out of warranty so threw it away.</li>
    <li> Works real well.  Hubby has such a crop of nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Most of these nose trimmers tend to pull hair make me not want to use them.  This one is make nicer to use.  My wife approves as well.</li>
    <li> Do not pass go do not collect 100$. Get this product for nose and ear trimming. Period. Nothing else works better</li>
    <li> service and price were great! This unit works better than any other!!</li>
    <li> Twisting the barrel to turn off is too easy to go even farther and place it in the &amp;#34;remove battery&amp;#34; position.  Not a critical failure but annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Does not pull hairs and is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;In order to remove from package I recommend: plasma cutter, crowbar, and a circular saw.</li>
    <li> Easy to use does the job!</li>
    <li> Cleans up the jungle.</li>
    <li> My husband had an old trimmer that pulled hairs when used. This one is much better in that respect, though we still have to work at cutting all the hairs. Perhaps we just need practice.  We like it well enough to do so.</li>
    <li> Good quality trimmer for hard to get places.  Adequate size.  Easy on battery life.  Another good product produced by Philips Norelco.  Would purchase product again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product. It takes a few passes to get all the hairs, still a nice product for the price though.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is not as good as advertised</li>
    <li> A gift my husband has been wanting so when he opened it up...was thrilled and so was I.  Has all the features he wanted and easy instructions.</li>
    <li> The product froze up and completely stopped working on its third use.  I strongly recommend against buying this product.  I expected much more from a product available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> i had this over a year, just wash it off after some use , it&#x27;s still working so i would recommend to others</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it a lot, but it performs well.  I chose the shape to trim around the outside of my ears by the earpiece of my glasses.  I&#x27;m satisfied with results.</li>
    <li> This came in handy for my hubby, he thinks its great. Works really good and serves its purpose. Great brand</li>
    <li> exelente producto, yo lo utilizo para las cejas y las deja muy bien, trae una beteria AA, facil de limpiar</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this products. Works equally as well as higher priced similar products. This is a great product at a fair price!</li>
    <li> This is the best nose trimmer I have ever tried, of course it does not shave as smooth as other kind of trimmers (round) but this one is much more comfortable and not painfull.</li>
    <li> I recieved my trimmer a month ago. Put the battery in, it works great. The original battery is still working without a loss of power. I used other trimmers, this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Have gone through three of these in as many years, with the most recent one lasting just under three months...now looking for alternative.  Is a good product when it works.</li>
    <li> this this is garbage, it doesnt cut anything even when you apply a good amount of pressure to the area you are trying to trim.  I dont like the awkward on/off by turning the top either. The only good thing about it is that you can rinse it under the sink. I have tried similar wall and panasonic ear and nose trimmers, and this is the worst of the three.</li>
    <li> I love this little device.  It does a great job on my nose hairs, the new hairs I find growing out of my ear-holes in recent years, and even on my eyebrows.  The little rakes that come with it to trim your eyebrows to a particular length actually work quite well.  I&#x27;m definitely going to buy one for my hairy best friend - I think his wife will appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This unit failed in less than 3 months the same as the first one I owned.  I would never ever purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have tried them all. This is the first product I can actually say works well. Very smooth, no pulling or nicking. Don&#x27;t let the inexpensive price fool you. This unit is far superior to units that cost 3 times as much. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of garbage. It is the poorest thing that Norelco ;has ever made. It just doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
    <li> I thought some thing so simple would do the job, but this is a let down. I am replacing it with something I hope will work  better.</li>
    <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give this more stars is that the product was shrink wrapped in such a way it took several knives, scissors, a punch, and about a half hour of cussing to get at the product.  So far, the product seems adequate.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised for trimming nose, ear and eye brow hair. I would recommend this trimmer for sure to anyone.</li>
    <li> After his first tentative use, husband declared &amp;#34;can&#x27;t even feel it working, but it did the job and doesn&#x27;t pull!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ll add this to my ever-growing list of \\&quot;technologies that used to work than, when &#x27;improved&#x27;, don&#x27;t work anymore.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve had nose trimmers before (the cylindrical kind) that actually cut your nose hair.  I&#x27;ve had eyebrow trimmers that, yes, cut your eyebrows.  This thing literally does not cut hair.  You can have a giant hair sticking out of your chin or nose, and it will not cut it, regardless of the angle used.  I would invite any Philips / Norelco engineer over to my house to show me how it actually cuts nose hair.  Please.  A total waste of money.  I hereby swear off anything that has the word \\&quot;Philips\\&quot; on it as this is my third product in a row with \\&quot;Philips\\&quot; on it that was utter, complete garbage.  Everybody should just stop buying anything from Philips in the hopes that they just go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addenda: I finally just threw it away today. My nose hair is looking bad.  This thing did not cut a single hair in multiple attempts.  Boycott Philips!</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever owned. I saw reviews saying it failed and requires cleaning. I have kept it cleaned and have had no problems. It effectively trims eyebrow, nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, does what it has do to and it&#x27;s easy to use. My husband and I like it.</li>
    <li> I thought this nose trimmer was really good.  It did the job well, and was virtually painless (as advertised).  I only had one problem with it, and thought everyone should know this before considering buying one for themselves.  As would happen, accidentally, the unit slipped from the bathroom sink and hit the floor.  Oops.  I picked it up, inspected it for damage and could see nothing particularly telling that this 3 ft. fall had done anything to it.  Instead, this nose trimmer refused to work ever again.  It would not turn on, even with gentle coaxing.  Replacing the battery, and checking that it was installed perfectly, did not help. When it was working I liked it, and now I&#x27;m wondering if the risk of getting another one is worth it.</li>
    <li> ...like me. I bought one. It worked a few times, then stopped working. I returned it. D*mn you, Philips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I bought another one, hoping to get lucky. It stopped after a few days too. For some reason, I decided to run the blades under the hot water for a few seconds. Guess what? It worked again. It turns out that my nose contains a liquid that jams the blades when it dries. Maybe yours does too :-)</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t trim good especially in the nose . The design is just not good compared to the older round version . Now those are a great nose hair wacker ! LoL .&lt;br /&gt;It runs fine , good assortment of attachments but just not for me .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned similar products and they&#x27;ve worked great. This one overheats immediately. In fact, it gets so hot in a matter of seconds that I really can&#x27;t use it. Not to mention that it does not work at all (if I ignore the heat it still doesn&#x27;t trim hair). Maybe I got a defective one. I would&#x27;ve returned it but I didn&#x27;t use it in time to notice. I&#x27;d go with another brand if you have the choice.</li>
    <li> Worked well when it would power on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all the suggestions from all the people who said rinse, soak, brush, etc. Never came back on. I wanted to like this product, I really did. Philips Norelco have a bad habit of putting out a product, discontinuing it, and forgetting about everyone who faithfully buy their products like with their line of Arcitec shavers. I am now considering the competition.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this to trim my nose hairs, and I have another trimmer to do those. I tried to use it for my nose hairs and found it didn&#x27;t work as well. I use this trimmer for my eyebrows, and it works very well. I previously used an [[ASIN:B00JFSPQVG Panasonic ER-GM20-K]] (Japan only) for my eyebrows and found that it didn&#x27;t work very well, but this one does. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad the Panasonic was was until I tried this one. It&#x27;s also washable, which I guess is more hygienic for something that you are supposed to stick in your nose. If you twist the switch to the left it will unlock to open the battery compartment, whereas you twist it to the right to turn it on, and sometimes it is possible to make a mistake when turning it off.  This trimmer is similar to the [[ASIN:B003ZW9LOQ MicroTouch Max]], except that the quality on the Philips is much higher, the Philips works so much better, and the MicroTouch Max isn&#x27;t washable and works on a single AAA battery (as opposed to an AA battery for the Philips.) The MicroTouch Max also has an LED light, which this one does not, which would be a useful feature for using it for nose hair trimming.</li>
    <li> My wife bought one for me and after 3 usages it quit working.  I then purchased one without realizing it was the same one and it broke down after one use.  Amazon was good about crediting back to me on the second one.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer does virtually nothing to help trim the errant hairs from nose and ears. I&#x27;m just sorry I didn&#x27;t use it right away so it could be returned in a timely fashion.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this item!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the eyebrow attachment but the &amp;#34;ideal angle&amp;#34; of the trimmer is uncomfortable to me so I find myself holding it at weird angles to trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other problems other than that and it works great!</li>
    <li> Feels powerful, looks good, and has a great battery life. So why doesn&#x27;t it actually cut my hairs. I cleaned it before I used it and it still was garbage. It took a good 5-10 swipes just to cut my arm hairs, so needless to say it struggled with my nose hairs and my eye brows. Pass it by!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great service.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done.  IMPORTANT: you need to take adequate care of it which is REALLY SIMPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After EACH USE, run it under HOT water for 10-15 seconds, dry it off, and done.  It&#x27;ll keep working for years on the same battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. DO NOT DROP IT FROM A HEIGHT OF MORE THAN 3 FEET ONTO A HARD FLOOR.  I did.  It broke.  Got another.  Didn&#x27;t drop this one.</li>
    <li> Only worked a couple of times. Not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking trimmer which might be good for a moustache or to clean up alot of excess hair, but for nose/ear maintenence, I like the ones with the 360 degree slotted heads better. They seem to be cheaper and need replaced more often due to the type of blade compared to this one, but they trim much closer and faster. With the many curves and crevices of the nose and ear, a round top works alot better.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done on ears nose, neck.  Works as it states and no other issues with it.  arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Does everything you&#x27;d want it to do.  Easy to use and easy to maintain.  I think you should buy one too.</li>
    <li> Great thing, easy to use, and does its job the best it possibly can. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this several times and have not had any problems.  It works as advertised, I would recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> Simply amazing and works like a charm. Happy I bought it! If you don&#x27;t have one, then you should get it!</li>
    <li> I use this weekly to remove nose and ear hair.  It does a great job.  Does not pull or pinch.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried a couple of the rotary style nose hair clippers but they did not do as good a job as this guy.  And this one handles ear and wild eyebrow hairs just as well.  A single AA battery lasts long enough to not complain.  Mine is at least a year old and still works like new (I do rinse it after each use).</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to post a review about my nose hair trimmer but here goes..DON&#x27;T BUY THIS BRAND!&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice and it&#x27;s done...stopped working...kaput.&lt;br /&gt;Arg. I really hate it when I buy something this inferior. It makes me feel I should have picked it up in my local bargain dollars and cents store but nope...oh... I have to say it...can&#x27;t stop myself..paid through the nose for this worthless piece of scrap metal!</li>
    <li> A very easy and simple product does the job perfectly without any yanking cutting or pulling. Quick simple and easy, great product</li>
    <li> I am a hairy guy, unfortunately. Hair is not my friend, it is itchy, it gets oily and dirty. Too much hair makes me feel uncomfortable. I try to keep it under control, otherwise I will turn into Big-foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the Norelco NT9110 Trimmer comes in. When I originally bought it the year was 2011. It still functions more or less the same way it did when I first bought it. I have not used any of the attachments the Trimmer arrived with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it only on the face. My eyebrows have been growing out of control for years. They have been trying for years to form the dreaded \\&quot;uni-brow\\&quot; that many in Western society find undesirable and un-attractive. To fight the \\&quot;uni-brow\\&quot; I use this Norelco Trimmer. It quickly cuts through the hairs that appear just above my nose every week. I also trim the sides of the eyebrows as well as the hairs just above the eye-lid. This gives a nice symmetrical look to the eyebrows one would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Trimmer has also been part of the switch(that I underwent) from Cartridge to Electric shaving, and Electric to (mostly) Double Edge Razor shaving. The Double Edge Razor gives a nice clean smooth shave on most of the my face. The areas just below the nose, below and to the sides of the lip area, and around the sideburns present a problem. This problem is solved with this Trimmer. It gets into those areas and cuts through most of the hairs that it encounters. I try to keep it clean, which means running the blade head through some faucet water after I am done using it and then leaving it out to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell the blade head is not meant to be removable, which (unfortunately) makes this a disposable product. I would prefer to be able to replace the blade head if/when necessary. Like with the battery, which surprisingly can last for many months of use(in my experience). The method of operation is very simple - just align the blades in a manner where the front(cutting edge) of the blades will befacing the hairs you intend to cut, move it across the face at a slight angle parallel to the skin. I likely will buy another one again in the future to replace this one.</li>
    <li> This was a good choice! Smooth and relatively quiet operation... Good price!&lt;br /&gt;It does the job with proper cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;No complaint!</li>
    <li> was disappointed. Mustach, nose hair, eyebrows - all not cut neatly or evenly. Use it then have to get the small scissors I have and cut the hairs that it misses. When it is turned on it sounds like it wouldn&#x27;t have enough power to cut butter. i would love to return it but the small plastic safe that but came in has long gone as has the box so that won&#x27;t happen. (Try and get in the box without using large scissors to cut the container - Impossible). So for $14 it will sit in a drawer until one day it will get tossed because it w not ted. Not up the usual standard of items sold by Amazon. Disappointing. Amazon needs a better system for returning items not in original packaging or guess it is necessary to find a place to store boxes and containers for returns .</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well but at least it does work and it doesn&#x27;t cut the inside of your ear or nose. It takes more work to trim inside my nose than I would like to spend.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose trimmer you will find.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this device.  Much better quality than similar units found in drug stores.  Stronger motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH California</li>
    <li> This trimmer works better when someone else uses it on me, but when I use it, it is harder to see what I am doing. Otherwise, would have gotten 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Gabriel</li>
    <li> Not that great for nose hair, but attachments work well on eyebrows.  Disappointed a little.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Bought another one.  It also works well with men&#x27;s hair in ears..(how disgusting) but true.  If you like to be perfectly groomed as a man.........then perfect!</li>
    <li> Great item, very happy</li>
    <li> Elegant design.  Worked very well.  Failed in 60 days.</li>
    <li> It does not cut what it is supposed to cut. If hair is a little long, it does not cut it. Not to mention taking longer time than traditional round cutter; furthermore, if it touches skin, it hurts. Very unpleasant experience.</li>
    <li> Can you imagine someone leaving a video review? lol Anywho...slightly different design and very effective.  The fact that you can rinse it under water is a great comfort to the germaphobe in me.  We have had it a couple months now and no problems yet.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch your nose either which is nice.</li>
    <li> As the title says mine still works a year later. I take care of it and have FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS right out of the box unlike a lot of the people posting negative reviews. You must clean it after every use and let it dry before putting the cap back on. I guarantee you almost all of the people who had it magically stop working after a few weeks did neither of these things. Of course some people are going to receive defective units but obviously those aren&#x27;t the reviews I&#x27;m talking about. For the other negative reviews saying it did a poor job of cutting hair or hurt, you are doing something wrong. This is so gentle I can use it to do the whole back of my neck and afterwards it won&#x27;t be red and irritated. It&#x27;s great for keeping you looking clean in between haircuts and has been super reliable for me. I&#x27;ve only had to change the (rechargeable) battery once and I&#x27;ve used this probably 20-25 times since I got it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does not work well. It misses hairs altogether. It can also pinch if used wrong. There are better trimmers out there.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco NT9110/60 NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER Does not work the way it should, This thing has a cutting edge on (one) side !! So trimming your nose hair means you have to spin the trimmer 360* over and over , I spent 30 min trying to make it work and it didnt do much if anything, I then ordered the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry It has a round head and works great !!!&lt;br /&gt;Also remember not to delay returning items, I am now stuck with the philips because I forgot to ship it back</li>
    <li> This trimmer , I bought for my son.  I have one and really love it. Trims the nose hair with NO snags. It has two attachments for the eyebrows.  One that just trims the eyebrows very lightly , so it doesn&#x27;t look like you trim them. Just the straggler hairs. The other seems like it might trim a bit too much , which I don&#x27;t use. If you rinse this trimmer with water after EVERY use , it will last forever.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These nose hair trimmers are not typically high quality so I was not expecting much. We will see. They appear to be able to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Well, not much to say here.  It&#x27;s a retail packaged nose hair trimmer and it was cheaper than similar models that I could have purchased locally.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the packaging is a pain in the a$$ especially since my need for this trimmer was a bit of an emergency.  Darn those freakishly long nose hairs!</li>
    <li> Very difficult to open the plastic package and cut my fingers.  I have used it just once since then. Suggestion to open it easily.</li>
    <li> Used it a few times already. For nose and ear hair trimming it is great. The eyebrow combs are a little harder to use.</li>
    <li> it does it job as well as any other nose and ear trimmer- The price is good- but does not better than a cheap one.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased anything as useless as this. It was impossible to open the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally succeeded in opening it, it was unuseable.</li>
    <li> First of all, the plastic packaging is one of the most difficult to open I&#x27;ve ever encountered. Basically this is the same trimmer as seen on TV&#x27; and sold in drug stores. They work great for me for nose and ear hair and I&#x27;ve accepted the fact they don&#x27;t last very long and just buy a new one when the current one dies. I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and pay a few extra bucks for this one in the hope it would buy me a longer-lasting product. This one only looks solid it&#x27;s actually plastic and the design is awkward. Those shortcomings could be forgiven if it actually did what the product name promises but the motor is so weak the only thing it trims is your patience and trust in Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> Looks surprisingly designer for the price.  It doesn&#x27;t have that look that so many of them do.... Like something you&#x27;ve been sticking up your nose.  It works great.  I have been very aggressive with it and never drawn blood.  It works great for both nose and ear hair.  I have also occasionally used it to touch up my mustache.</li>
    <li> I really liked the mechanism and how clean of a job it does. I went through 3 of them in the past year. The first one lasted only few days and stopped working. I returned it to the store for an exchange. The second one was better! it went on for few weeks and then stopped too! I decided to give it another chance, so got the third one. This one lasted longer- about a year- and then stopped! In between many times it stopped working and I had to switch it on and off many times before it decided to work again... but now it&#x27;s finally gone! I wonder if others had similar experience with this model.&lt;br /&gt;I think this time I may give the newer Norelco model a chance, it seems to have better reviews.</li>
    <li> Really have to push tip to cut - seems the teeth should be sightly larger to allow hair to enter the cutting blade</li>
    <li> I like it. Its durable and works good. I wish the blade would cut more, but if you need something for nose, neck and ect.. then this is for you.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a great job very close shave without irritating or tickling my ears.  I wash it in hot water ever time I use it and I have not had any problems that other reviewers mentioned.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well even when traveling. It won&#x27;t pinch or cut you. It works better than the last one I had that cost much more.</li>
    <li> goodGood good good Good good goooooooooooooooood good h g g g g o o o o d d d d good good go</li>
    <li> 5 months is not worth 13.95, Philips Norelco NT9110 Nose and Ear Trimmer.  When new battery was installed product did not work but in very short time devise became very hot.  Concerning!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these around 4 years ago and it finally died.  I didn&#x27;t think twice about replacing it with a new one.</li>
    <li> Angled perfectly to groom the areas I need for unsightly hair. Able to groom my mustache and beard very neatly so I look my best.</li>
    <li> Most excellent tool.  it keeps on working, no matter what.  It is washable too, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming ear hair and nose hair.  It&#x27;s also great around the balls but sometimes pinches.</li>
    <li> battery does not last,the ear hair does not trimm</li>
    <li> My nose and ears thank be weekly.  Great on eyebrows too.  It is a very good product, been using for a year.  No issues except the eyebrow clip ons are very flimsy and crack</li>
    <li> I rinse my unit&#x27;s trimmer blade under running tap water after each use. However, my unit stopped working after a few weeks. I have found that rinsing the unit head under running tap water again after not being used for a week or so, the unit works again.</li>
    <li> Otro buen producto de la linea Norelco, el producto cumple con la sespecificaciones publicadas, un vendedor muy serio entrego lo pormetido en cantidad y tiempo.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these for myself and also one for my dad. They work okay but nothing great but then again I have nothing to compare it to as this is the first such item like this that I have purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nose hairs.  I thought it would have circular blades like the one I had of another brand.  I does not, it has one  blade.  The blade is not close to the end of the unit therefore you have to put too much of it into your nose to actaully cut the hairs.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco NT 9110 is the best Nose and Ear Trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve owned several over the years. The only caveat is a user must faithfully follow the after-use cleaning instructions. The cleaning process is easy and relatively quick, but if it&#x27;s not complied with the trimmer won&#x27;t work. Before I purchased it, I read a number of customer reviews of this product and was convinced from previous user comments that it was a product worthy of trial. It&#x27;s a terrific product. Try it. But, don&#x27;t throw away the cleaning instructions that come with it. I think you&#x27;ll really like this one!</li>
    <li> This little thing works quite well. Unlike other nose trimmers that I&#x27;ve used in the past (e.g. from Sharper Image), it does not pull on the hairs and does not cause any pain whatsoever. It works quite well. It uses a AA battery, I actually prefer the fact that it&#x27;s a battery because I use Eneloop rechargeables and it works great.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer for nose and eye brows I&#x27;ve  ever used.  After a couple months still very happy with price and performance.  Comes with two attachments to neatly trim hair to a desired set length. I use attachments for eye brows  and stray long chest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I used sizzors and wish I knew about this trimmer sooner.</li>
    <li> No danger of pain. Simple and easy product. Good quality for the price. I would recommend this one from Philips.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer that I have seen.I have tried several different nose hair trimmers,with not much success,until I got this one.Use a lithium battery and I guarantee it&#x27;s the best nose hair trimmer on the market.</li>
    <li> Because how small this is, I almost did not purchase it. But after getting it in the mail and using it, I am glad I bought it,. I used it right away and it does not pull at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nose and ear hairs. I thought it would have circular blades like the one I had of another brand. I does not, it has one blade. The blade is not close to the end of the unit therefore you have to put too much of it into your nose to actaully cut the hairs.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this with the hopes that it would serve my needs and also last longer than the two others (different brands) that I had before.   I am very disappointed.  Perhaps it is my own fault, as I might not have read the description as carefully as I should have, but.... this product is totally geared for male use, and therefore I will probably have to purchase yet another trimmer.  So, gals, listen up... get this one for your husband, perhaps, but not yourself.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer for Christmas, and it worked great for the 3 or 4 times I used it. One day I turned it on and,... nothing. Dead for no reason at all. It was sitting in a drawer in the bathroom between uses. Not even sure it deserves 1 star.</li>
    <li> Buy this product with confidence. If you hate the rotary style nose &amp; ear hair trimmers, finding them ineffective--you will LOVE this trimmer. Multi-use is a key capability of this product. Ears, nose, mustache, eyebrows...anything--I even trimmed my hair with it (I wear a buzz cut).   Bottom-line: Do not buy rotary style trimmers, as they don&#x27;t work--regardless of how sharp the blades are, how much they&#x27;re angled, how many there are, etc. You will be disappointed. You will NOT be disappointed with this trimmer. It&#x27;s better than the one I had to replace. This one is awesome and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 other nose/ear trimming products from other manufacturers. They never seemed to do a good job. I always had to make a second pass with a small scissors. Having to also use a scissors means the trimmer itself is a failure at its job.    But with this Norelco, it works perfectly. No need for a scissors.    Quite a few U.S. reviewers report that the trimmer stops working after a few initial usages, dragging down the rating for this product. But over at Amazon UK, the trimmer is highly rated. They experience the same problem, but apparently have figured out a solution (quickly remove and reinsert the AA battery). [...]  The wife tested the trimmer and loves it too, so we&#x27;re buying another. And we&#x27;ve thrown away the earlier trimmers.    I highly recommend this product.    -------    UPDATE 03-21-2009:    Wow. By many of the reviews here, it&#x27;s easy to see that people just return or toss something that stops working. How about reading the instructions? This trimmer is excellent, when used properly. I rinse mine in hot water for a few seconds with each use, shake it, quickly pat it with a towel and put the cap back on. It never fails.    My wife has one as well. She rarely rinses. Soon, her trimmer fails. She&#x27;s ready to throw it away. Instead, to prove my point, I poured a half inch of kitchen vinegar into a small Dixie cup, set the dead trimmer to \\&quot;on\\&quot;, immersed it into the vinegar and swirled it around. In THREE SECONDS, the trimmer came back from the dead.    Before you say this is a design flaw, take a look at Braun&#x27;s premium face shavers for men. They now come with a replaceable fluid cleaner reservoir. After EVERY use, the shaver is returned to its pedestal, where you, the customer, are entrusted to push a button to begin the daily cleaning process. If you do, the shaver works perfectly every time.    With the Philips trimmer, you also need to do a tiny bit of maintenance to keep it running. Douse it under hot water, shake off the water, put on itscap. And make sure it doesn&#x27;t have a dead battery.    If you can&#x27;t do that, don&#x27;t blame Philips. Or Amazon. Just buy a non-electric pair of tiny scissors and enjoy.</li>
    <li> This thing wouldn&#x27;t cut a hair if you held it with two hands and beared down on it. They call it a trimmer, and it makes a noise, but that is it.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny how we adore lush, thick hair on our heads - and promptly try to shave it off when the exact same lush hair grows in our eyebrows or nose. Ah, human vanity. I do tend to grow long, thick hair on my head - and also have thick eyebrows. For the longest time I would try just to pluck out the errant ones and let the rest alone, but finally I tried to figure out how other people handled this issue. Heck - they trim them!    The Philips Norelco trimmer works quite nicely on nose and ear areas without any attachments. You just press the blade part against whatever you want to trim, and a few seconds later it&#x27;s all set. There aren&#x27;t any nicks at all, no jams or problems. Both I and my boyfriend have used it for many months without any problems.    For eyebrows, there are two different sized attachments you use - one long, one short. The plastic attachment is dual sided so that you can go forward and backwards over the eyebrows to trim them down to your desired length. There&#x27;s really no way to \\&quot;go wrong\\&quot; - the hairs will only be trimmed to the set length, and never any shorter.     We&#x27;ve used this for quite a while and have never had any issues with it at all. It works like a charm and does exactly what it should. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic which worked OK, but I couldn&#x27;t get at all the hairs in my ears, even my nose, and mine grow in a way that tickle me so they are very annoying--plus my eyebrows. I would never have thought of trimming one&#x27;s eyebrows, but this thing is great. I&#x27;ve only had it for a day and if I breaks I&#x27;ll return it for a new one. I don&#x27;t see how anything like this could be any better. It really works well. Far superior to what I was using. The trimmer&#x27;s angle is also a great design feature.</li>
    <li> this thing broke in less than 4 months of use. for something that gets used once in a while, the lifespan of this item is horrible.  do not buy this!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband primarily because other reviewers said it would not pull nose hairs like some other trimmers do.  It absolutely DOES NOT PULL the hairs and WORKS BEAUTIFULLY with no pain at all.  We have not tried the eyebrow attachment, so I cannot comment on that.</li>
    <li> Trims as advertised. No sharp edges to cause nicks. Works better than other trimmers I have tried. Great price, too. [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> I had tried several products--nose hair clippers--prior to this, but they didn&#x27;t work very well.  So, having purchased a Norelco  triple headed shaver that I was extremely satisfied with, I decided to try the Norelco Nose Hair Clipper.  I was pleasantly surprised at how safe and effective it is.  Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Judging by some of the negative reviews, this fragile item may be damaged or they have a quality control issue. Mine has worked great. It&#x27;s the best of the three I&#x27;ve owned. This one can get into places the others couldn&#x27;t without cutting my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great but takes some getting use to to keep angle right for optimum cutting and closeness of cut, but best device of this type ever found!</li>
    <li> Trimmer #4 for me, and this one isthe worst. I bought a cheap $8.99 stick at best buy that works great.</li>
    <li> Works well trimming all the hair it claims to trim (ears, nose, eyebrows).  Not more I can say.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Does the job really well.  Do wish it had a case for the parts, since I was &#x27;forced&#x27; to just use the original packaging as a way to keep the accessories with it in the drawer.  Perhaps a clever packaging person could make that easier...</li>
    <li> this one doesn&#x27;t work as well as the same one I purchased in Target a few years ago.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer. Does a nice job on eyebrows, ears, and nose. Easy to clean. You can run water through it to clean it after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know a about other trimmers, but it seems to not trim as close as maybe it could. Perhaps though it&#x27;s not as close because you are working in some sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that the unit isn&#x27;t too loud. Makes it nicer when you are trimming around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Single battery is nice also. I&#x27;m using a rechargeable NiMH AA</li>
    <li> But this does a yeoman&#x27;s job of getting rid of the unsightly hairs, particularly from the nostril, with little to no pain. The interchangeable heads make things a bit easier. Be sure to follow the cleaning directions and do so after each use. I didn&#x27;t and it seemed like it had just stopped working completely. Then I cleaned it and it was working as if new.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it did not work at all. I tried it on the fine hairs on my hand to the course hairs on my boyfriends eyebrows and it would not trim the hair. I asked for a replacement item and it did not work either!!! I returned both items with all the parts and packaging. I WAS NEVER REIMBURSED FOR MY PURCHASE EVENTHOUGH I RETURNED ALL ITEMS WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD I WAS GIVEN!!! DO NOT BUY, IT DOES NOT WORK AND YOU WILL NOT GET REFUNDED!!!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I would highly recommend for any female who needs something to use in those hard places!!!!</li>
    <li> A handy tool for the price. I also used it to clip the long hairs my razor missed. The batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> The design of this trimmer is perfect for trimming nose and ear hair.  It cuts the hair at the bottom and it is easy to get them all.  Also comes with a handy attachment to trim your eye brows.  Rinses off when done.  I have used 4 different nose hair trimmers and this is the easiest and most efficient</li>
    <li> Works great, my husband loves it. He&#x27;s always used Norelco and says the quality just keeps getting better. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well, for a while, but it recently stopped working completely. I tried changing the batteries, but the trimmer just doesn&#x27;t work anymore. It&#x27;s fairly simple to clean, but it just didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Just &#x27;OK&#x27; - not as useful as I&#x27;d hoped.  I&#x27;ve yet to find a nose hear trimmer that actually works well.  --RIch</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a defective one or what, but this thing is absolutely worthless and doesn&#x27;t trim anything whatsoever. It turns on and sounds like it&#x27;s running just fine. Just doesn&#x27;t accomplish a thing no matter how close I put it to the skin. Get the Panasonic ER-GN30, I&#x27;ve had two (dropped one) and they work flawlessly..</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s annual Christmas request - loves it but it does need to be replaced annually from wear and tear/battery life - but totally worth the cost each year.</li>
    <li> I have had the product for a month and it has worked well so far.  It seems as though it is built to last.  Previous models I have owned seem to go bad after a year, so I&#x27;m hoping this one lasts a little longer-only time will tell though.  As a nose trimmer it is effective and the eyebrow inserts are a nice addition.  I have not used it on the ears, but given the design it should do well there also.  It is also easy to clean.  Overall worthwhile for the price.</li>
    <li> have had this for two year now and it works as advertised, it&#x27;s only for small and thin hair removal (nose/ears/eye brows), if you feed a lot of hair to it, like your side burns, it will jam an then you have to stop the device and clear the clump from the blades, overall, I am pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product arrived today and I went to work and trimmed up the old nose hairs.  Prior to purchasing this I had used a rotary trimmer that attached to a pair of small electric grooming clippers for the past few years.  I purchased this based on the reviews listed on Amazon.  Based off of my initial use I am not disappointed.  The trimmer reached all of the hair in my nose, cut very close, and caused no pulling or irritation.  I went back and forth between this model and the Panasonic ER-GN-30k.  I am glad I chose this one.  Can&#x27;t comment on ear or eyebrow trimming, not at the point in my life yet where that has become a necessity. The trimmer includes 2 attachments for eyebrows, cleaning brush, cap for the trimmer, and a double A battery.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to learn how to use it. You have to position it a certain way against your skin in order for it to trim the hair.  It trims the nose hair well and it comes with extra eyebrow grooming tool, which doesn&#x27;t really work.  I tried several ways to make it work but I&#x27;m better off with a small scissor.  Overall, it&#x27;s great for the embarrassing hair and is a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> It works fairly well, but suddenly stops working in a short time.  I purchsed this item several months ago and, after one month (used it twice), it just stopped working!  I ordered another one, thinking MAYBE it was just bad luck.  The new one lasted 3 months (about 5 uses), then just stopped working.  I tried new batteries and kept re-checking but still can&#x27;t get it to work.  I just ordered a different brand yesterday.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good product, very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cut anything properly. Hurts when I try tp take out some hair!</li>
    <li> Runs well but barely trims nose hair.  I should have returned it right away, I would have if purchased at a local store,  Items like this and and Westclox Small Ben remind me I should buy locally.</li>
    <li> I use this for my nose, ears, and feet. Works great and still haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet. I like this because you can get it wet to get all the hair off. I also use this to trim my beard with the guard to keep it at just the right length.</li>
    <li> This product lasted me literally 2 months before shorting out. I am not sure if the internals got too wet from the steam that comes from showering, but all of a sudden it stopped working. I would think that this was designed with the understanding that it would be kept in the medicine cabinet/within the bathroom, but apparently that was not the case. Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> These work pretty good so far even though they are kind of weak they get the job done.  I have heard a lot of problems people have had from them but so far none for me.  I just needed these for my nose and had no need of any of its other features yet.  The blade is kind of weak but with enough effort its just fine and price wise I found this to be a good deal.  Overall if you just need a nose trimmer that will get the job done and don&#x27;t want to spend much than give this one a shot.</li>
    <li> The second time I used, it would not turn on... then it started to work again, now 3 months after the purchase it is totally dead - it is not battery problem by the way. I works well when you are able to turn it on.</li>
    <li> I had posted a very negative review, since, like others, I found that the trimmer seemed to just die very quickly. I then discovered from an Internet post that soaking the trimmer head in soapy water for two minutes solves the problem. My formerly \\&quot;dead\\&quot; trimmer now works perfectly.     This simple bit of maintenance should have been make clearer by Norelco.</li>
    <li> Barely cuts hair at all and only turns on about half the time.  Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this poor product.</li>
    <li> I never got to use it because my puppy chewed it up before I got a chance. It looked pretty cool though!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my other Norelco trimmer which I had for several years.  I recently dropped that one on a tile floor and it broke the trimming mechanism.  I was not able to fix it so I ordered a new one.  The eyebrow trimming attachments are awesome.  Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this before.  One word of caution though, is my old eyebrow attachment began to split down the middle which caused it to get loose and slip off the Norelco mid-trim.  Left a funky little shave spot in the middle of my eyebrow!  I also noticed the new version does not come with the little zipper nylon case my old one did (lucky I kept that).  It is nice for storing the cover and attachments and for travel.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but at $13 it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of sending it back for another replacement that will probably do the same. This thing is garbage, plain &amp; simple. Much better to spend more and get the Valera Beauty Trimmer. Works great and won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY WELL. THIS IS A VERY GOOD TRIMMER. THIS ITEM WAS BOUGHT TO REPLACE A TRIMMER I LOST. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I bought.  The first one died after 7 months, the second after 2 months.  I tried brand new batteries, but that didn&#x27;t help.  It&#x27;s a shame they aren&#x27;t built well because it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Worked great but stopped working after only 5th use. Cheap. You should buy from a local store so returns are easier.</li>
    <li> The machine is very simple but effective, has some very good finishes, and construction is impeccable, the only thing is that producce tickled by the vibration.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull on hairs and bring tears to your eyes you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same nose hair trimmer for probably 10 years.  It still works, so why bother getting a new one, right?  I just had a feeling the newer models out there today would work much better than what was out there in the early 2000s.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the upgrade!  This thing gets the job done much faster, never pulls, never misses hairs, is easier to clean, and is more ergonomicly shaped to fit wher eit&#x27;s supposed to go.  Bonus: it came with two plastic guards (in varying lengths) for trimming eyebrows - much safer than using scissors, I must say.  Bottom line, this this is absolutley worth the very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This unit does not cut very well.  It seems very difficult to get the hair into the cutter.  I will not buy this unit again.  Well, guess what I don&#x27;t need to worry about the cutting now.  I dropped it in the sink a distance of maybe 18 to 20 inches and the head shattered.  so I am changing my rating to one star, I would make it lower if I could.</li>
    <li> Never settle for anything less than this trimmer. This is the rolls royce of nose hair shavers. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I have very little use for this item. I guess it would perform as designed, but I prefer other methods, myself.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write an update for this as I remember reading lots of reviews stating it stopped working for people. I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a few months and make sure I rinse it in hot water when I&#x27;m finished and it is still working great! I&#x27;m still on my first battery too! I am very pleased with this and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It works like they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has the enough accesories for you.</li>
    <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW: This felt pretty sturdy when I first got it, although the blades seem not to cut as well as other clippers I had before. One always has to go over an area 3 or 4 times to get things done, when other (cheaper) clippers do it in 1 or 2 passes. I could deal with that, though, but not with the unit just stopping working altogether after 8 months. Overall disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Unit started working again 2 months after my review. I am not exactly sure why; maybe I didn&#x27;t clean it thoroughly enough???  Anyway, I rinse it with water after every use now, and it is still working nicely (as of June 2013). My review goes to 4 stars, as I have to assume that it was my fault when it stopped working. Don&#x27;t I look like a fool now :)</li>
    <li> not that bad not that great...not as crisp as i would like but decent enough for the price. For what i paid it&#x27;s cool.</li>
    <li> Works great and the attachments work pretty good, at first they looked small and flimsy but for what they are designed for they do the job.</li>
    <li> This is the third nose trimmer I&#x27;ve tried over the years and this one is no better than the others. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut well enough. I can certainly do a much faster job with a pair of small trimming scissors. The battery life seems pretty good, but that doesn&#x27;t matter all that much of the blades are no count.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works good on my ears and nose hair, its worth the money i will by again</li>
    <li> had bought a cheap neon green trimmer at walmart. it was a cheap piece of crap that never worked really well, but had become accustomed to having something to remove the unwanted hair and after the cheapie version broke a internet search found this Philips Norelco trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s much more robust, does a better job and would recommended it for removing hair where it shouldn&#x27;t be :-)</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco NT9110 from Amazon.com is the best nose hair, ear hair, eyebrow trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I also use it to trim or remove finger hair between knuckles. I bought several $10 trimmers at local department stores and pharmacies but they all stopped working after just a couple months or so. I&#x27;m almost a full year into this Philips Norelco NT9110 and it is working as new, and still using the original battery. Does a great job and cleaning is easy just by running the tap water over the blades. Would definitely buy again if it ever fails. I paid $12.77 last December 2011, I think it is under $10 now...what a great deal.</li>
    <li> Philips usually release great products but this one is not one of them. It doesn&#x27;t cut your nostril hairs...too bad the rest was good quality but a product that doesn&#x27;t deliver its core function should be register in decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most useless and inefficient item from philips so far...</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it&#x27;s design was better than the one I have that is a rotary action. Found that this just does not work very well at all. My rotary action one works MUCH better at removing ear and nose hairs. This design is more like a beard shaver and just does not want to cut long hairs.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so I can&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s reliability but the unit itself is top notch. It seems to be well designed and it works great,&lt;br /&gt;The people that complain , I suspect , do not clean it properly.</li>
    <li> OK.The eyebrow trimmer is useless. would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Maybe it&#x27;s me but the angle doesn&#x27;t feel right in the hand whatsoever. The trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t trim and the one unique thing about it, the brow attachments, don&#x27;t trim at all. This is the second Philips Norelco trimmer I&#x27;ve picked up in two weeks (the other is the 5 in 1 trimmer) and really disappointed both times. Long time Philips fan thinking twice about the brand. On par with the ones eBay has for three dollars. I feel like all of the ability to rinse these things under the faucet now is limiting their ability to actually trim hair. I&#x27;d return but it&#x27;s &amp;#34;been places&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It works all right. Now that the battery needs replacement I can&#x27;t seem to find a AA that works with it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: The metal the battery connects too must have bent down too much. Folded up some aluminum foil and shoved it in there and is working good now.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does its job as advertised without any pulling or chafing. Works as advertised.  Received on time and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> i gave it away  after 2 weeks  it really  did not do a good  job  so  my friend  wanted it  even though i said it didnt work lol</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this item and it handles well.  I recommend it for purchase without reservation.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> Regardless of price I have never had a better trimmer. I have recommended these to several people and they all agree..Excellent design!</li>
    <li> I received the trimmer a day early.  It is exactly what I was looking to get.  These are things a man neeeds at my age.  The package was damaged.</li>
    <li> This little unit works very well, quickly and effectively cleaning up my nose-hair forest :P</li>
    <li> Fine product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> perfect for ear hair trimming.  no more bugging the wife to have to help me.  can do it myself.  I know gross, but fact of life.  good for nose hair too, but the other trimmers might work better (circular style).  this flat edge great for ear lobe and canal.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like that style. I like the one that grab the noses hair from the tip of the tool.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old one.  I have had probably 3 of these type prior to this one.  I pretty much expected it to be like the past ones that were not expensive and they should it.  I was fooled. This one is very high end and yet at a very reasonable price.It has weight and you can feel the quality.  And somehow they are able to take the battery power and turn it into a substantial motor force. You can hear it and feel it.  One of the better buys I have made in recent times.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Comfortable to use. No issues with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone in the market to trim unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> I have replaced these units twice since purchased and all 5 units have failed. Good hygiene has been maintained with proper cleaning and drying yet the motors fail within a 10 to 20 uses. Astounding such a good company would produce a consistently poor product. As for functionality it also fails here with very poor trimming when it works. Most disappointed.</li>
    <li> One thing that struck me about the unit is that it was better built then most I have seen. The trimmer heads for eyebrows was helpful since it is hard to do by oneself. I work well on thick eyebrow hair or the fuzz one the back of ones neck.</li>
    <li> The dilemma with most nose hair trimmers is that the guard set too high so it is impossible to get a good trim, and this is the case with really cheap and really expensive trimmers.  This trimmer is just right and the price is awesome too!!! The build is very good, not flimsy at all, the motor sound is solid as well, and it does an awesome job of getting in really close, and have had it for almost two years now with no problems.</li>
    <li> Well it does the job and can cut those stubborn nose hairs.  I like the fact that it is waterproof and easy to clean.  The bad part is the on/off switch is also the same way you disassemble the batter compartment so you can accidently open it up or you can turn it on based on the way you turn it.  Overall, its a well built and well thought out gadget.</li>
    <li> We bought this after a friend showed us theirs.  My husbands eyebrow hairs grow quite long, and this works like a dream for that!  We love it!</li>
    <li> The trimmer attachments don&#x27;t work very well. Replaced my old trimmer (can&#x27;t remember the brand) with this one and I&#x27;m just not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> I ma happy with my purchase, I don&#x27;t know if it is the best, but I like it.</li>
    <li> great for groomer between haircuts</li>
    <li> Works great this is second one .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all of my nose hair but gets the visible stuff, had the same battery for ages, and it&#x27;s easy clean up!</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price. Simple device twists four on and off, easy to use</li>
    <li> Nice size, works well.  Perfect tool for neckline, sideburns, etc.  Doesn&#x27;t do well on large areas, so do plan accordingly.</li>
    <li> I bought this device at my local Sears as an impulse purchase. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get something like this for quite a while now. This was just $10 there at that time a couple of weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first electric trimmer for this purpose that I&#x27;ve bought. Previously I used precision scissors on my nose and ears while I&#x27;d let the barber do ears and eyebrows when I get haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with it! I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and it has done an excellent job on nose and ear hair. I haven&#x27;t really done the eyebrows because I am leery of mistakes and eyebrow mistakes really stick out. I know from personal experience when I tried to use my full sized Oster trimmer a few years ago lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to trim your beard with you really can&#x27;t do better than the [[ASIN:B004HIV7FS OSTER Classic 76 Hair Clipper Bundle - 2 items]] - I bought mine from Amazon back in 2008 over 4 years ago and that sucker is still going strong. The blades are expensive but they also last forever if you take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the Oster is too big for nose and ear trimming but with the right blade you can probably do eyebrows with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with the cap and a very tiny brush. You aren&#x27;t supposed to cap it until it is dry. That is kinda silly because it means that most of the time you won&#x27;t have the protective cap on - you set it down capless and forget about it. Why doesn&#x27;t the cap just have vent slots in it to allow for protected drying? The package tray can serve for perfectly molded storage if you open it carefully and trim the excess plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of bad reviews for defective units so it looks like a gamble to purchase it. I&#x27;m curious to see how long mine lasts so I&#x27;ll update the review if it breaks or lasts either way.</li>
    <li> sorry - had some trimmers before. this one is by far the worst i ever had.&lt;br /&gt;simply - does not do the job</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t stuck it my nose since I first opened it and the ouch should tell you all you need to know.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked for about three weeks before it broke down. When it did work it failed to trim close to the skin. A very bad product.</li>
    <li> This has worked much better for me than trying to use the edge of my electric razor. Would like it if the battery compartment locked in. If you turn the base (when powering the trimmer on) in the wrong direction, the battery compartment opens. Works real well, as long as you rinse it after each use.</li>
    <li> This is a silence and good trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use in a travel, easy to transportation and don&#x27;t consume big energy (Battery long life)</li>
    <li> Not an effective trimmer.  Barely cuts nose hair at all.  I would not recommend this to anyone, and am thinking about returning it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these trimmers. I&#x27;ve had wahl trimmers before but they did not really remove my nose hair and it was difficult to clean. These trimmers are much easier to clean and it really gets in and removes all my unwanted nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I thought the brand name would represent quality in design and workmanship, but not with this unit. It is marketed as a trimmer for ears, nose and eyebrows but failed to function well on any hair. Then the battery connector inside the unit came loose and was impossible to fix. I threw this POS in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift.  I don&#x27;t have it.  I never used it.  It did come in a nice package.  That&#x27;s all I know to say about this.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these trimmers and found it trims nose hairs reasonably well. Not great, but the job was done.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Brand names used to mean something, not in this case. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Very poor performance. Does mnot do a good job of trimming ear, or nose hair at all. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Price great and shipped quickly, Works like a champ and good quality. Would recommend this unit to anyone., Well made</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and simple to clean. And it doesn&#x27;t take up much space. Great buy, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love my norelco, it gets the closest cut of any trimmer, i have ever owned. The price is excellent in comparison, and as for the durability its very strong.</li>
    <li> Not very effective. Nicely designed but not good at cutting nose hair without going over and over it. Ok for ears and unibrow.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. But be aware you must clean it after&lt;br /&gt;every use or it will freeze up. Also, check the battery frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year now and I&#x27;m still very happy with it. easy to use, easy to clean and keep. nice angle to the head to reach where you want and still see what you are doing. it doesnt burn up batteries like some, good battery life with intermittent occasional usage. (twice a month or so)</li>
    <li> The trimmer is not working very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;blade not sharp enough&lt;br /&gt;would like to return it&lt;br /&gt;please le me know</li>
    <li> The nose and ear trimmer works OK.  I am pleased with my purchase.  It is easy to clean.  My only concern was that it was a bit difficult to figure out how to use at first.</li>
    <li> It did its job with no problems.  I love this idem because its way better than using a shaver to get them nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Just like the title says this product works very well for nose hairs, and unlike many others that get the hairs stuck this one does not, so no pain, You could use it for more then just nose hairs too, I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> As a number of other reviewers have mentioned, this trimmer just mysteriously fails to turn on one day without warning and with no apparent means of repair; battery replacement does nothing. I&#x27;ve purchased this product a number of times over the years; some I&#x27;ve had replaced under warranty, and some have lasted past the warranty period. They all die the same way ...</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Really just barely works compared to virtually any other model I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Thought I was \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; to a Norelco when I dropped my last one and broke it.  Totally fails the \\&quot;cuts nosehair\\&quot; test... which, y&#x27;know, is kind of the point.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for 2 - 3 years now and have had no problems.  Works great for its intended use...highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a month and a half. POS. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does a good job if you can hold it just right.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Safe, doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin or pull the hair, cuts everything neatly, needs very little maintenance/cleaning unless you use it in your nose and is pretty quiet.  Still wonder why I did not buy something like this years ago!  Get it- you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> You really have to push against the walls of your nose to get at the hairs.  Almost need to scrape them.</li>
    <li> Have had this for over 2 years and still going strong.</li>
    <li> Has worked fairly well so far.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, though does sometimes require a few passes to get finer hairs.</li>
    <li> Lasted for 6 months and thats it, but it worked great for 6 months</li>
    <li> It worked well for about two weeks. I wiped it off with a towel and the who top end fell apart and i could not get it back together. So it went in the trash.</li>
    <li> This works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is I wish I had paid a little more and purchased a unit with more accessories.</li>
    <li> Inoperable after a couple uses. Other products much better at nose trimming.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer u can get for money they last its my 2nd one to be honenest thete was nothing wrong with other one</li>
    <li> Have had this for about 3 months, and I use it quite frequently and am extremely happy with this as a purchase. I&#x27;d suggest this to anyone who is looking for a decently-priced nose/ear hair trimmer. It also works really well as an eye-brown trimmer w/ the attachments.</li>
    <li> very safe to use. ir works very well. make sure you wash it after use, otherwise it will stop working, until you soak the tip with warm water</li>
    <li> un producto 100% recomendado, cumple con las especificaciones dadas por el vendedor y con cumplen con los tiempos de entrega</li>
    <li> Mine would not work the second time. I sent it back for a refund. I should have believed the reviews. It is a piece of junk alright!!</li>
    <li> Great product....keeps my nose hairs in check!</li>
    <li> Egad, a nose hair trimmer review. I&#x27;m ashamed of my self.  1. You need a chain saw or equal to open the the plastic container.2.  Fired the rascal up and nothing. I have to admit I have very manly hair in my nose,but not on my head were it belongs. Drat!.  I had my wife try to trim my nose after I failed. No go. The round trimmers work much better,this one looks like a miniature hedge trimmer. Scary.  Stick that puppy where the sun don&#x27;t shine inside your nose. Fail. Look else where.</li>
    <li> Great, very good quality. packaging is good. Price is good. very useful.&lt;br /&gt;Good brand, it is not fake.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> Works ok on short hair(nose, light beard). Doesn&#x27;t do well for bigger jobs like the neck, etc. Would look at others if going to use for bigger areas</li>
    <li> does not get all the hair around and in the ears</li>
    <li> the product is good and easy to use .it is strong and perfect in use .i advice every one to buy it and enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these trimmers for over a year, both bought at Amazon.  I have used each about twice a week in two different locations.  The primary use is for mustache trimming, though I use them also for nose- and earhair-trimming.  They have both performed flawlessly.  They continue to cut quickly and evenly, after 13 months.  They are easy to control. Their relatively small size is a real advantage, and an improvement over the larger, haircutting-type trimmers that I&#x27;ve also tried.  I use them in conjunction with my wife&#x27;s wall-mounted magnifying makeup mirrors.  That&#x27;s not absolutely necessary; but I sure get a better, easier result from doing so.  I take one with me on trips, and use it in conjunction with a small, lighted, hand-held, magnifying mirror, if the hotel room doesn&#x27;t have a makeup mirror.  Most important, I rinse them with hot tap water after each use, as instructed by Norelco.  I wonder if failure to do so doesn&#x27;t account for some of the problems described by other reviewers.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this device is that it doesn&#x27;t tug or pull so there&#x27;s no hurting yourself.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get all the hairs though, no matter what angle I go at them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The motor weakened to an inconsistent, low rpm despite new batteries.  This thing did not last.</li>
    <li> Continues to work and work well after 2 years, I use it for both nose and ears, my only complaint is that my nose hair grows back too fast and I have to keep using it!  Perfectly comfortable - no pulling or pain - cuts them close - washes in water - have used intermittently for 2 years and still not had to replace batteries - no complaints!  Would recommend... for as much as guys talk about this sort of thing.</li>
    <li> So easy to use and completely trims away all nose and ear hair.  Great trim on the eyebrows as well.</li>
    <li> Simple, cheap, and easy to use. It also lends me self-confidence knowing that people aren&#x27;t worried about my nose hair trying to reach out and strangle them.</li>
    <li> Used as designed. It works OK, just takes going over ans over a few times.Had one similar that I got as a gift for buying another product, which had a light on it. Used it  about two years before ir finally gave up. The Norelco seems more substantial,  but deemd to cut slower</li>
    <li> Not worth it. Does not get close enough to shave. The design is aweful. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> What a worthless piece of junk.  After one full minute attempting to trim nose hairs, nothing.  Not a single strand gone.  I smashed it to pieces.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer will last about 3 times and then just roll over and die. I complained to Philips and they sent me a new one free that did the same thing. It is ergonomically GREAT, but not reliable.</li>
    <li> Takes several passes to trim the hair in the ears. Makes a lot of noise, but not all that effective in trimming the hair. Gets the job done - but not impressed.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Have been using one for years.  A few complaints found here can be solved by rinsing the tip WHILE IT IS RUNNING after each use.  Never had it stop once.  Gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> second one of these I have ordered for a second home ... you see these types of things all over the place with different designs, this is the only one I havent had to fight with the get it to do what I need on ears and nose.  It&#x27;s a 5 second job vs. a project.</li>
    <li> This trimmer died completely on its second use on the same day I bought it!! I used it on my nose, thought it did a great job. Later came in and trimmed the ears but it died during trimming. I changed batteries, tapped on it, everything I could think of but it was dead.&lt;br /&gt;You may be lucky and get one that&#x27;s reliable, I hope you do but mined was junk.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hair boyfriend and lets just say, I don&#x27;t see an enchanted forest anymore. He tells me that it&#x27;s easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t snag. It comes with detachments so that is also a plus.</li>
    <li> I use it every 3 weeks, the bundled Philips battery lasted 3 years!&lt;br /&gt;Once i accidentally dropped it from head height and it survived.&lt;br /&gt;I clean it under the tap after every use, as instructed, make sure you do too! The orange plastic can be easily removed from around the blade, in case it needs deeper cleaning.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this product. It works great when he shaves around his face or nose hairs. it doesn&#x27;t cut your skin or nose when you get to close to the skin. also good to use when trimming around your beard,</li>
    <li> Among a selection of pocket-sized trimmers, this one truly stands out in quality and elegant design. Similar to the other reticulated (angled backward) trimmer designs, but without the gaudy neon-glow colors. A simple twist-to-activate design eliminates any battery-or-switch confusion; just be careful not to twist too far and expose the battery when turning it off. Unlike the more compact competitors, this one uses a double-A battery, rather than a tiny triple-A battery. This means longer battery life, more consistent power and less jamming. Leave the AAA batteries for your remote. Another great thing about the Philips model is a smooth, rounded design to the tip; comfortable and gentle on sensitive areas, like the nostril and the ear. The trimmer combs are recessed from the tip, meaning you won&#x27;t get a nasty surprise while turning it inside those same sensitive areas. A bit more cost, but it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this thing nearly 5 years ago (on 6/25/2008) and it is still doing its job regularly. When I read the reviews back then, I did note a lot of people saying it would inexplicably go dead on them. However, having owned and operated my share of cheapo flashlights and other electronics over the years, I had an idea that I knew what was causing it (i.e. not the motor going dead) and how to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, after about a month, mine went dead as well. Now, if you pull it apart (like you are changing the battery) and take a good look at how the steel tabs are supposed to make contact when you twist it to turn it on, it is pretty easy to - gently - bend them a little bit with something like a small eyeglass screwdriver so they make more solid contact. A minor tweak or two and viola, mine has ran like a champ for nearly five years and still going (knock on wood). Judging by some of the recent one-star reviews, it would appear that Norelco hasn&#x27;t exactly bothered to fix the problem. So if you buy one, just expect you might have to tweak the contacts a little bit - absolutely no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it works as a nose trimmer, I have to say that it felt really weird the first few times I used it and wasn&#x27;t really sure it was going to work out, but eventually got used to it and now can&#x27;t imagine anything working better. I use it once a week. Immediately after use (and while it is still turned on), I run the blades under a stream of warm water, then turn it off and, like that other bathroom ritual, give it a couple of shakes and put it away. Can&#x27;t remember changing the battery more than twice in the last five years - but when I have changed it, it was like a whole new machine, so should probably change it a little more often. I&#x27;m guessing every year or so would be a good time to change the battery for weekly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever this one finally quits working, will definitely buy another one - and I would recommend it to anyone who is not afraid of possibly having to tweak the contact tabs a little to get it working properly at some point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caregiver for my disabled husband and use this trimmer to trim down his beard each day before I give him a shave. Yes, I also use it for his ear and nose hairs and it works great for those intended purposes! We&#x27;ve used this trimmer every day for 3 years now for WAY more than its intended purposes and it still works great!</li>
    <li> This is one of the products I knew from reviews could be a problem but ordered anyway. Not wise on my part. It looks good and other than the packaging which is very hard to get through (the heated plastic that is child and adult proof) it appears to be just what I was looking to have. HOWEVER, it will not work. Hoping there was a battery problem, I changed it and still no action. I will be returning this disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great product and I was amazed at the quality.  Works very well.. I have tried other different brands but would rate this higher</li>
    <li> I just try it, as I seen by now, it seems to works better than panasonic, I am not sure yet, but works great for the moment.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have too much hair just stick with scissors...&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that great with tiny short nose hairs.  If you have a bush in your nose may be... but if not scissors are much better in cutting them and in shorter time.  But no doubt. The thing looks great and its easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I use it for my nose and ears. It is easy to use, comfortable, easy to clean, and has plenty of power.</li>
    <li> Supper ! I can tell what they are trying to do is simply good, supper good, there are nothing words I will not like to take, I will come come back, when I need it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe two other trimmers and this one is by far the best. It cuts and doesn&#x27;t clog and you can rinse it.  Great stuff, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Sorry to admit it, but I have a furry nose and this thing is really comfortable to use. Drives me nuts when my employees come in with hair hanging out of their noses. It&#x27;s all i can focus on and if I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d end up in hR I&#x27;d buy one for the whole crew.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I had multiple MicroTouch trimmers and trimmers from other brands, and this has been the best of all of them.  Once you get used to how to hold it, it does a great job.  It&#x27;s very powerful, yet I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet.  Also, it&#x27;s great that you can clean it under water.</li>
    <li> Good machine to stick up your nose or down your ears.  It doesn&#x27;t cut, snag or otherwise annoy the hell out of you while cutting aggravating hair out of these places.  I bought it just to try it out to see....but it does work well.</li>
    <li> This easy to use trimmer does an excellent job. Well made product that is well worth its cost which makes it a great buy.</li>
    <li> It is a versatile machine that allows use of various shapes and suit the needs of each user. Thus I recommend the product for its price and quality</li>
    <li> This thing works terribly.</li>
    <li> It worked nicely at first but does not seem to cut after a year. I through it out because it just couldn&#x27;t handle the job anymore. The battery was strong but the blades may have gone dull. I cleaned but no change.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and to clean</li>
    <li> I was not thrilled with this product.  The design works well with eyebrows and ear hair but not with nose hair.  I would not recommend this product for the trimming of facial hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried others and this is the one I like best. However it stopped cutting as effectively after 18 months. I think the blades dulled or motor was wearing out (even though it sounded the same, and a new battery made no difference) and it would only cut a few hairs, not all. I&#x27;ve followed the cleaning instructions and have taken good care of it. Despite its failure, for the price and otherwise performance, I&#x27;m buying another one. Hopefully this one will last longer.</li>
    <li> alil beyond my expectations...cut&#x27;s too good if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I have had previous experience with rotary type nose trimmers -- they we all BAD.  The Phillips model is not rotary and works exceptionally well.  You must experiment a little to get used to the back and forth movement which is required, but it works well without any pinching or pulling and cuts close to the skin level.  I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t trim as well as my fiance&#x27; and I think it should have. Finally my fiance&#x27; gave up. I think with more patience and time it may have worked better.  I like that it comes with 2 guides: 1 for long and 1 for short. Packaging was a pain to open.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price.  Replaced one I had used for about ten years, and will buy another when this one expires.</li>
    <li> This trimmer will barely cut.  It is too gentle or something. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I believe it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am starting this review with a wealth of experience in purchasing ear and nose trimmer devices. I have at least 5 devices of the rotary blade type that are basically unused due to lack of effectiveness. I have also purchased two of this blade type from beauty supply stores over the years which were good but only lasted a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This unit is very sturdy, has a good feel in the hand and most of all it works!&lt;br /&gt;Those of us of an advanced age know that personal grooming is a vexing and concerning challenge but a solution has always been elusive. My wife has been able to assist me with the typical rotary device and a great deal of loving patience but I needed independence so that I could set the time and intensity of my grooming.&lt;br /&gt;This unit works with a quality feel and precision trimming of both ear and nostril areas.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to sharpen up your personal grooming you probably need this unit.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I ever used.  I have tried many others that were nowhere close to acceptable.  The design with the side facing cutter is very good.  It gets most of the hair in my nose pretty easily.  Another huge plus for this product is the two guides that come with it to allow me to trim my eyebrows.  The only thing keeping it from perfect is that it does not reach the hairs that grow deep into my nose.  I still require small scissors for those few hairs. If it had a rechargeable battery, I would have given it five stars.  I am not sure how long the double AA battery will last.  So far, it has been over two months of sporadic use and it still works fine.</li>
    <li> I have had several diffent nose and ear hair trimmers over the years and this one is superior to everything else I have used.</li>
    <li> Scratched and injured my nose, stay safe from it.</li>
    <li> I use the Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer for keeping my pubic area clean after shaving it with an old fashion hand razor and beard gel which I lather up. It doesn&#x27;t work very well for large clumps of hair so be warned. I used to use a regular barber hair Trimmer for my lower regions but my [blank] got stuck in it and it hurt badly for days after. Probably the best way to trim your lower region is to use scissors but don&#x27;t do it in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little cheap product that won&#x27;t last, it also does not have a vaccum for Nose suction.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work... I couldn&#x27;t believe it - great brand and my Wahl clipper set is much superior as it cuts thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy...</li>
    <li> WHILE ON VACATION FOR SIX WEEKS , MY TRIMMER  QUIT ON ME AND I HAD TO USE MY WIFES TRIMMER . I FOUND THAT HERS WAS A LOT QUIETER THAN MINE AND DID NOT PULL AT ALL , AS MINE DID.. I AM STUCK WITH HERS ,AND BUYING HER A NEW ONE.. I THINK I AM GETTING THE BETTER DEAL..</li>
    <li> I like its use simplicity. The drawback is that the ear superfluous hairs grow back sooner than with a blade</li>
    <li> I have had a few trimmers over the past decade and this is by far the best.  It gets right in there and does the job without any nicks or pulls.</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer almost exactly three years ago and it still works great. I just ordered a second one because I accidentally dropped and stepped on one of the eyebrow comb attachments and broke it. Due to the reasonable price of the item I decided I&#x27;d just order another, that way I have a backup. It works great as a nose hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve never had to use it as an ear trimmer because I don&#x27;t really have ear hair but I&#x27;m sure the performance is similar to it&#x27;s nose hair capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary use though is the eyebrow trimmer. I know most guys might not care about this but I&#x27;m not ashamed to say I have bushy eyebrows that need some tending every once in a while and this is the perfect tool for the job. It trims them down to two different sizes with the two included comb attachments and is also good for trimming any stray hairs around the eyebrows. I also use it to pick up any strays I might miss while shaving and any other stray hairs I find poking out. It&#x27;s a soft, vibrating blade that causes no irritation and has really exceptional battery life for something powered by a conventional battery. Cleanup is also very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this isn&#x27;t going to be the answer for everyone. The attachments are small and easy to misplace but the body of the unit itself seems very sturdy for being made of plastic. Like I said, my original one is still going strong even after three years. If you need a simple nose and ear trimmer or if you&#x27;re particular about your eyebrows like me, you can&#x27;t beat this product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is very uncomfortable to use. I used the traditional model, but I lost the money to buy this model. To use it you must enter very deeply into the nose, which reaches up to abuse, and cuts on the one hand, I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> It does all it claims to do. My biggest fear was nose hairs being pulled or yanked. I&#x27;m happy to say that I have not experienced and discomfort in using the nose and ear trimmer, and I have no problem recommending it.</li>
    <li> I have the feedback from my bf, who i sent it to as a gift,he said it is exactly what he needed, and works fine.</li>
    <li> What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? I would have wanted to know how difficult it was to separate the packaging from the product. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not for the packaging I would give it 5 stars. It is the best nose and ear trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned three of these hair trimmers. Two were Panasonics and my last purchase was this Norelco. My first Panasonic failed in a matter of weeks and the second Panasonic lasted about a year but I often had to remove its cutting head just to get the motor spinning (yes I had a fresh battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the Norelco and it clearly has a better cutting head compared to the crude rotary arrangement used on the Panasonics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I wrote this review - I was quite interested in why this product had so many one star reviews. So I read them all. What I discovered is that most (yet not all) of the complaints were from 2008 to 2010 and concerned early failures. The only logical conclusion I could come to is that Norelco had quality control issues during that era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet it is now 2013 and I can attest to the superior cutting mechanism Norelco uses. It is far more sophisticated than that used on the Panasonics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try - it comes with a 45 day money back guarantee and a 2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I saw people complaining about this item, but in my personal experience I can tell you this, it does work great, I use it for my nose, ears it does the job very well, I use it very often and every time does the job just as the first day I got it. and the best of all I did not pay much money.. I am happy with this..</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  It is comfortable and does a very good job in the ears and nose, as well as sideburns and neck.</li>
    <li> I am well satisfied with this product.  It is just what I had hoped it would be. I would recommend this product for others as well.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  He loves it and it does what it is supposed to do.  I have, in fact, used it myself.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> First up The angle makes it work so well it&#x27;s the closest shave for the nose I have ever had with such power. Second it  fits in the hand nice and has a great balance to it. Third it cleans very easy, you just run it under hot water and your done. The  power button is a twist of the base in the right direction and the battery is easy to install by twisting the base to the left and pulling down, Very easy and very secure. There are markers on the base and unit but there hard to see. Just one power setting you turn it to the right and your good to go. Cleaning just stick the tip under hot water and your done. More power then you will need. It also works great for your eyebrows and they give you two eyebrow guards as well. Haven&#x27;t used it for the ear but I am sure it would work fine there two. A great Product and i recommend to all.</li>
