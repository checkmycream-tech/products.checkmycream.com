      <li>Maybe it was old and lost it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mature but not old lady mature.</li>

    <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion with nice packaging, personal touch, and good quality. The perfume itself is a scent I love, but may have been discontinued--I can&#x27;t find it anywhere other than online. The bottle can last forever if you use only a little--the scent is strong, but not overpowering, and distinctly sharp in a pleasant way. Was a bit bemused by the fact that my bottle came with snowflakes on it, but won&#x27;t question it. Would buy from this seller again. :)</li>
    <li> This smells like Heaven in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Bath and Body Works, why you no make it!!??</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> just right delivered earlier than expected great value too</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years and love it so much. It&#x27;s a heavier fragrance, more earthy and peaceful; not in any way fruity or flowery.  It isn&#x27;t sold in the stores anymore, so getting it online is the only option.</li>
