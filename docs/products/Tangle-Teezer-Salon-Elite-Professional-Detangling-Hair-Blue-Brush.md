<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this thing. Perfect for after shower detangle. No tugs or breaking hair. Nice fit in palm. GREaT for children.</li>
    <li> Great product. I thik a little expensive, but good product</li>
    <li> We have been through approximately 12 brushes prior to this one.  Everything from detangling brushes sold at the drug store, to expensive detanglers from the beauty salon.  This one is by far the BEST we have tried.  I was so hoping it would work, because my 8 year old daughter has very thick hair, but each strand is very fine.  It tangles so so much.  She used to cry almost every morning when getting her hair brushed.  Even after she would brush her hair I would have to brush it again to help get all the tangles out.  She gets the worst tangles on the underside by the back of the neck and at the sides of her head.  We tried brushing at night and putting it up to sleep, but that didn&#x27;t work either.  After reading many reviews for this brush I went ahead and ordered it hoping it would give her some relief.  She was so excited to receive it and used it as soon as the package was opened.  She was instantly in love with the brush.  She even took it to school the next day to show it to all of her friends.  Thanks so much to the makers of this tangle teezer brush, because it is a miracle in our family.  BTW - my daughter has blonde hair that is kept shoulder length, because of how tangly it is.  [[ASIN:B003DU3HY0 Tangle Teezer Brush Original Professional Detangling Hairbrush Pearl Blue]]</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift &#x3D; Loved it.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, not so useful</li>
    <li> Just love it. Never thought that the effect is actually real. I do not feel any discomfort at all. Great</li>
    <li> I have been natural for about 3 years and just bought this a couple of months ago. I hate that I never tried it before. I use this teezer on not only my hair but my two year old. We love it!! I see less hair coming out when detangling which is awesome and my daughter does not cry or squirm when get her hair done! In a nutshell, I love it!!!</li>
    <li> this is my second one. it works really better than regular brushes, but as many review says, it&#x27;s just cheap plastic it does not worth 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;i ordered the pearl blue one, but the one i received is not the one on picture. it is all blue, not like the pic which is the bottom is pink. i am very unhappy with that.</li>
    <li> SHOCKED!  My daughter is bi-racial and I was pleasantly surprised how well this brush went through her hair.  Instead of mother having to brush tangles out of her hair to moans of &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ouch,&amp;#34; my daughter is walking around and brushing her hair on her own by herself.</li>
    <li> My youngest has very frizzy, thick curly hair. She is also Autistic, and getting her to sit through brushing her hair is kind of like torture to her. She likes to rock against the back of the sofa, which reacts knots that in some cases, have had to be cut out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ido I like this brush- in her own words, &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, mom!&amp;#34;  I was hoping it would work on her hair when it is wet. It doesn&#x27;t. I have to use her big huge de-tangling comb for that. The brush tugs and snaps her hair when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her hair is completely dry, it takes the curl out and makes a huge poofy mess, so I have found it easiest to brushit out completely before she showers, then comb it when she gets out. Otherwise, she winds up with Hermoine Granger hair (book, not movie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while it is a great brush, there are downsides to it. It seems to work better on dry hair, and if your child has curls, it will pull them all apart and leave a frizz ball in it&#x27;s place.</li>
    <li> I have tried the tangle teezer a couple of times so far.  It is alot easier to use my modified Denman brush than it is the tangle teezer.  The teezer requires smaller sections and seems to tear out my hair.  4a</li>
    <li> I purchased it for my toddler son who has very curly, very tangle-y hair. Combing his hair after baths has been a real problem. What used to take 30 minutes and tons of de-tangle spray &amp; tears tears tears, literally took 3 brush strokes with this thing. It&#x27;s funny looking &amp; he didn&#x27;t like the noise it made when it went through his hair (it&#x27;s hollow &amp; the sound of the bristles is a little funny at first) but when he realized we were already done, he decided he didn&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about the hype from other reviews, but it&#x27;s terrific.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on wet &amp; dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with a child. It did a nice job on my hair too, by the way....;)</li>
    <li> My hair is hard to comb, but use this it become more easy. A little expensive but really works, if it&#x27;s not plastic, I will be more pleased</li>
    <li> what I ordered are four blue ones,but I received four black ones,so hurt</li>
    <li> I love the Tangle Teezer!  I can&#x27;t believe that it works on kinky curly hair as well as straight hair, but it does!!!  It&#x27;s great.  I would not call it totally \\&quot;ouch-less,\\&quot;  but it definitely minimizes the pain and the time to detangle my hair.  I am \\&quot;tender-headed,\\&quot; but can use this with relative ease.  It is truly a great product!  I need to get a travel size one to take with me.</li>
    <li> It is okay. Nothing special. I expected more, but it is only my opinion.</li>
    <li> Sent it to my GF and she said it feels like the brush is massaging her long hair. Now it&#x27;s her everyday brush!</li>
    <li> My hair is too too heavy and thick. Working is not as good as other people. I think it will be perfect for normal hair.</li>
    <li> really nice and its really helpful. it makes my hair in the correct way and looks nice and handsome. love it</li>
    <li> I like how this feels in my hand, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker. I was hoping it would cause all tangles to quiver in its presence, but I still have to work at them and lose hair in the process. Is it better than my paddle brush? Possibly a little bit, but nothing to write home about. Considering I use a detangler/heat protectant spray and argan oil, I think I do all the work for it. But I do like the size, I prefer to travel with it as my normal hair brush, and I like how it fits in my hand!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about a 12$ brush, but the tears and fighting were ruining bath time and mornings! Sissy is 3 years old, has never had her hair cut, so it is about waist length and it is very fine, but wavy.  And 5 minutes after I get it into braids, it looks like she slept in them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is AMAZING!  I have already bought 2 more for back ups.  She asks me to brush her hair now and she uses it on herself...not well, but she tries.  I start at the bottom in sections and work my way up.  The parts that are always problems where she sleeps and the hair looks like a nesting ground for rodents---this brush easily teases out, mostly painlessly.  If she yipes, it was because I was getting hurried and didn&#x27;t gently let the brush do it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my 5 year old son asks me to use the &#x27;girl&#x27; brush on him sometimes, as it feels like &amp;#34;a massage&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again 100 times over...I&#x27;m going to start giving them as gifts...</li>
    <li> I have this and the knot genie and I like the knot genie better.  This brush feels sharper and I feel like it scratches my head more then the genie.</li>
    <li> Easily detangles without pulling out a lot of hair. The bristles are flexible so they won&#x27;t get stuck. Brush feels light, but has been durable. Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teen daughter...she&#x27;s always complaining about her tangled hair and how she hates trying to brush it out.  When I gave it to her, I could tell she wasn&#x27;t impressed by looking at it.  But now....she can&#x27;t stop raving about what a good job it does.  I can tell....she was surprised.  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy and very pleased and pleasantly surprised by this product.  She used to hate riding in our topless jeep, due to her tangled hair, now all is well afterwards...she brushes through the tangles like a breeze.</li>
    <li> Tangle Teezer Brush has saved my permed Hair!!! Love it and wont use other brushes anymore!! You should get it.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/b hair. The Tangle Teezer worked great at first! I had to vigilant about getting the Tangle Teezer through ALL of my hair, otherwise it would easily slide over entire sections of hair, leaving them still tangled. When I brushed it through my hair, it felt sooooOoOo good, so I believe I overdid it. My hair was certainly getting detangled, but I started losing my fine hair around the edge of my hair line. I know this happened because I was overusing it every time I detangled my hair; however, it felt so good and I didn&#x27;t realize I was damaging my hair. I had to stop using the Teezer, and went back to my wide-toothed comb, which is better, IMO, because it never misses entire sections of hair, and it doesn&#x27;t feel that great to use, thus eliminating my potential for over-combing.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this is a very gentle tool for thorough detangling of 4b-z natural hair.  For me, it doesn&#x27;t rip out extra hair like the Denman brush.  Bought the compact version for my gym bag.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair.It was always a problem to brush my hair. This brush saved the situation with brushing, it does an excellent job!!! i don&#x27;t want to use anything else anymore! quick, easy brushing without pain! thank you Tangle Teezer!</li>
    <li> I am a guy with somwhat long hair and I hate when it gets tangled.  So I bought this special brush and omg it works perfect. Not much else i can say. You have to brush with it more than a regular brush but then again with no pain it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this  for my three year old daughter&#x27;s hair. Her hair is super tangled every morning. We usually spend 5-6 minutes brushing as slow as I can and her fighting me and telling me it hurts and to stop. I do the best I can, but I can&#x27;t get it out pain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I tried this brush for the first time. It just took a few seconds to go over her hair. The tangles just seemed to fall right out of her hair as I brushed. I asked her afterwards if it hurt. She said it did a little. If it did, she didn&#x27;t complain at all during it.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but excludes the hair into the Berhh but only from the outside, but I love this product, and is excellent for dry hair either wet hair was a little Iezbk</li>
    <li> both myself &amp; my daughter have really thick curly hair...my sister showed me the link to this product &amp; i ordered one, pretty skeptical of it&#x27;s effectiveness. yet, when i tried it i was amazed! it was getting through the tangles with no crying or pain! it still takes a bit to get through our thick hair, but it gets the job done! i&#x27;ll probably need to buy a few more...lol.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. I heard many good things about it before I purchased it and I am glad that I finally purchased it! It detangles my hair without any pain like other hair brushes which just stick in my hair and do not come out again.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty straight hair and would recommend thia product to everybody!</li>
    <li> works like a charm, doesnt hurt, doesnt rip hair. Pain free!</li>
    <li> it saves my tangle hair and no pain anymore. just a little disappointed  because i ordered a blue brush but received a black one.</li>
    <li> I have medium length fine, tangly hair. This truly is waaay gentler than a regular brush/comb while being way quicker at detangling. It is gentler on the hair, less breakage, and doesn&#x27;t hurt unless you have a really thorough tangle and then it still hurts way less. The slightly flexible plastic bristles are a genius invention.</li>
    <li> This brush works for us.</li>
    <li> Everything was absolutely perfect!  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more!  :)  I was extremely pleased, as I am with all of my purchases from Amazon.</li>
    <li> the color is a little different. it&#x27;s all light blue. also, it is very large in size....not so easy to carry with me in bag. i though it would have a cover with it. but there&#x27;s no. the teeth might get dirty easily</li>
    <li> My daughter has always complained about brushing her hair. This works as well as it says, the only thing to note is that the bristles are not pink, they are blue.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long hair and brushing it was almost impossible.  When I got this hairbrush, she was a bit surprised, because it looks different.  They she realized that it does  not pull her hair and it gets the job done.  Since then, she will not let me use any other brush on her hair.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter. It is so hard to brush her hair without hurting her and this product took all that away. Works great. Only little issue is when trying to brush underneath the back of her hair its a little hard to do unlike a standard brush</li>
    <li> Bought this for my two granddaughters who are so tender headed.  It is a crying yelling event when my daughter combs out their hair..dry or wet!  Also, got one for my husband who wears his hair in a pony tail.  Works great.  Everyone is happy, happy, happy!!</li>
    <li> My hair is really dry, so I lost a lot of hair when I comb them. and it is very hurt. This hairbrush works perfect. It is easy to make my hair smooth withour painful. High Recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have never had a hair brush that works as well as the Tangle Teezer. I have thick wavy hair and I can actually brush my hair without looking like a frizzy mess!</li>
    <li> very good! I love this Brush! It is bigger than i thought! Good to use and nice color!! Love it!</li>
    <li> My daughter tells me this brush goes through her hair more easily than her traditional brush.  She likes the feel of it.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this is the ONLY product I use for detangling my hair. It actually works to get out the tangles when no other combs or brushes have done so in the past. I basically had to finger comb my hair in the past and I am so so happy that I have this now (I even purchased two more brushes). This brush has become a staple in my life and I definitely don&#x27;t know how I could live without it!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE for any beauty routine that involves knotty or coarse hair! This thing can get right through all of your troubling hair spots! And the best part is that it DOESN&#x27;T HURT! I&#x27;ve used these on photoshoots and they make the styling (of even heavily hairspray-ed) hair a breeze!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after a review I read on yahoo.  The claimed it was the best product for heavily tangled hair and that it would detangle the toughest hair. Not true. My daughter still cries when I use the brush and her hair is not that tough.  I think yahoo must have got some commission for that art I left.</li>
    <li> Great on my toddlers curly tangled hair even after she has rubbed her messy fingers in it</li>
    <li> this brush is very good for long hair, comfortable when brushing, and easy to use. Would recommand to Asian women with long hair</li>
    <li> This is great for getting out tangles on the surface as its tines are not long enough to go all the way through thicker hair to the roots. My daughters do prefer this brush to any other brush we have purchased as it does not really pull hair aggressively like other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 2013 -- After using this for a few months it has been relegated to the kids toy box, because it is more of a toy than a real brush, this can not get the tangles out of our girls hair and it is easier to use a regular brush. I would not recommend this expensive brush for kids or people with long hair, it does not work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my long-haired daughter who is in Kindergarten and far too busy to allow us to style her hair. My 15-year-old son requested one of his own!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love this brush.  It&#x27;s true, it gets the tangles out without a lot of pulling. Great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews about it and was anxious to receive mine! It&#x27;s much better than I expected, excellent for my hair!</li>
    <li> I Bought This Brush For My Daughters Tangled Hair.  She Always Has TangleS And I Thought This Brush May Help..Of Course It&#x27;s To Good To Be True. My Daughter Has Thick Straight Hair And The Brush Was Still Painful And Did Not Really&lt;br /&gt;Get Rid Of Tangles. I Tried On My Fine Straight Hair..Sounds Like It&#x27;s Breaking My Hair As I&lt;br /&gt;Brush. Seems Like A Brush For A Horse Or Pet. Not Worth The Money.</li>
    <li> The color does not look so bright as it&#x27;s shown in the picture.  I am definitely a visual animal, so I am a little disappointed. I wish I had chosen a better-looking color.</li>
    <li> My daughter hates getting her hair brushed so I got this, its wonderful. She never complains when I need to brush her long hair and it gets all the tangles out. A major plus is that it gets her hair so nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> the first Tangle Teezer followed by the recent second order. Satisfied with quality as described</li>
    <li> I love how gentle this brush is on my hair. Light weight and gentle enough to use on wet hair :)</li>
    <li> I felt like this was stripping my hair after a while because my hair was feeling dry and crunchy but it may not have been the Tangle Teezer. It glides through my thick, curly hair easily, though and makes my after-shower process short.</li>
    <li> I got the cheapest version of this product, which was the blue &amp; pink brush.  It actually is all blue.  Since I didn&#x27;t actually care about the color, that doesn&#x27;t affect my star rating, but in case you&#x27;re particular, it&#x27;s good to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dubious as to whether this product would work, even after reading glowing reviews as well as seeing articles about it on beauty sites.  Well, it&#x27;s just as magical as everyone claims.  My hair is just a smidge longer than 2 feet, so it has a tendency to tangle quite a bit, particularly after sleeping. I had been using a paddle brush or wide toothed comb to get out tangles, but would still end up tearing out clumps of knotted hair.  Since getting the Tangle Teezer, I haven&#x27;t torn out any hair; It&#x27;s awesome.  I still follow up with a more substantial brush, but this is fantastic for reducing knots.</li>
    <li> Best detangler ever! I can even use this on wet hair!</li>
    <li> This brush didn&#x27;t work well for my daughters thick straight hair. It also has very sharp pointed teeth, so when you brush the hair on the head you have to use caution not to do it too hard. I bought a two dollar hair brush from the dollar store and it gets the tangles out better then this brush. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> Stay Away from this brush!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and my kids do not have as thick of hair as me (yet) but it isn&#x27;t considered thin either.&lt;br /&gt;For all three of us this brush was utterly useless.&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of use the girls&#x27; hair was so tangled and messed up that I just went back to the old brushes that we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are too soft and too short.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t detangle anything, it just makes you think it is working because the bristles are so soft that it just bends and goes over as if it is brushing through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;never will I buy this type of brush even after this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift. She says it works wonderfully at getting out my granddaughter&#x27;s tangles without any pain!</li>
    <li> I wish it had a handle. Plus, it gets hairy so fast, you have to clean it out after literally every use. Plus the hair gets all over your hand because there is no handle. Meh. it does detangle, though...</li>
    <li> Took it to the beach to brush out the tangles after swimming!  Works great!  Compact size is just right for beach bag!</li>
    <li> Wife absolutely loves this.  Works miracles on her very long hair.  I have bought 4 of these so far so she has one in the office, purse, car and home.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm on dry or wet hair, no tearing or tugging or hurting in anyway.  Also doesn&#x27;t frizz your hair like some other brushes do when you are done brushing.  Highly recommend it, will buy more.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has hair to the middle of her back and she hated having her hair brushed! I had to fight her about it every day. But not with this brush, I can brush it for hours and she wont care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note- It says &amp;#34;pearl blue&amp;#34; in the description. It is just a basic neon blue and pink. But thats okay because I liked it better.</li>
    <li> the best brush ever it detangles it get all the knots out doesn&#x27;t hurt awesome brush</li>
    <li> My kids love it!!  It really works with their thick, tangled hair! I would highly recommend this to all the mothers who have the same problem that i had!</li>
    <li> Reasons i like this comb&lt;br /&gt;1. Good design for hand holding&lt;br /&gt;2. Truly to deal with curled hair easily&lt;br /&gt;3. Little static electricity caused by such kind of plastic comb</li>
    <li> This was probably the best thing I could have ever bought for my hair. After I cut 9 inches in length off my hair, I was determined to keep my hair healthy so that it wouldn&#x27;t break and would grow faster. After purchasing this product I was astound by the way it didn&#x27;t rip through my hair. It gently brushed through the knots to make your hair smooth. It&#x27;s helped so much with the breakage of my hair and I truly believe it&#x27;s been a factor in the growth process because I have never known my hair to grow this fast. 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> Works great to detangle my shoulder length hair!</li>
    <li> I am a pet owner and always thought the tangle teezer looked suspiciously like my furry friend&#x27;s brush, so I did a comparison!  Click the link to see my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[…]</li>
    <li> A regular hair brush pulls and tears my hair. The Tangle Teezer brush glides through it effortlessly, removing tangles as it goes. The product could be improved by the addition of a silicone grip so I can hold on to it better when using it in the shower. The product includes a guide that explains the idea behind the product and suggests various ways to use it.</li>
    <li> Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair was such an ordeal that we were about to cut it all off.  Then I read a review on Cool Tools ([...]) for this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more screaming fits and no more tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This thing really save my hair. I have very long and thick hair, and so easy to tangle. This hairbrush works great! But the problem is that it was difficult to clean, and the teeth was a little bit too soft, I have been using it for several months, and a few tooth are bending a little bit, hope it will last long.</li>
    <li> Works great for wet hair.  I use it on my daughters hair after her bath.  She does not scream in pain since the brush easily goes through her knots.  Just wish it had a handle.</li>
    <li> I would llike to recommend this detangling brush because it actually works wonders. The only thing is that I was expecting a blue handle with pink bristles like the picture but instead it was all blue. Color aside, this brush really works</li>
    <li> Worthless piece of crap so disappointed one week and its destroyed guess it wasn&#x27;t made for thick hair beyond disappointed</li>
    <li> If you have natural hair the tangle geezer brush is awesome for it.</li>
    <li> I buy this,but I get a Brush only blue,why? It isn&#x27;t the same as photo.</li>
    <li> i just ordered my 2nd of these.. the first one i gave away to a friend who has 4 girls and never heard of them.. i felt bad for her cause she has more work then i do (only one girl and 2 boys) and her oldest is really hard with getting her hair brushed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she loved it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i ordered a second one as my daughter calls it the &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34;.. it even works with wet her right out of the bath tub! thats the ultimative test for a brush and even with wet and tangled hair its just awesome... i recommend it to everyone and should buy a 3rd just in case something happens with mine... :)</li>
    <li> I have slightly wavy, thin strands, and this product works really well for my hair. The only problem that I have with it is that I have many strands, which makes my hair thicker, and the brush doesn&#x27;t reach all the way through it. My solution was to just brush on both sides, and it works. It definitely works with both wet and dry hair, but doesn&#x27;t make a straight part, so I still have to use a comb for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people with my hair type.</li>
    <li> it just makes my daughter&#x27;s hair frizzy. I guess that is better than tangled but you still have to go back through it with another brush or comb to take out the frizz.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, this brush is my go to for long, curly, and or color treated hair. Use this brush with conditioner and comb through in the shower.</li>
    <li> This hair brush is absolutely the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I thought the wooden brushes are better. But after I use this brush I find I was wrong. If you have long hair, you should have one!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! No jerking, tearing, or massive knots. It&#x27;d be especially good for little kids with long hair, since hair brushing will never have to hurt again.</li>
    <li> Pulled my girls hair out.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly on my straight or curly hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years on my daughters fine and easy to tangle hair .... and she lost it. Armageddon was approaching so we bought a regular brush at the store .... it showed my immediately why Tangle Teezer is the only one ... 5 attempts at brushing with the &#x27;normal&#x27; brush and I went to Amazon to order a replacement for the one that was lost. This is the only one that works on detangling fine girls hair without pain or crying.</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter has curly hair, and a sensitive scalp.  That translates to her screaming or crying when we try to get the knots out of her hair every day.  Granted, she&#x27;s gotten better about it, but at 8 years old, she still is unable to brush/comb through her own hair because of the knots.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a go.  It works well.  Is it worth the money they charge for them?  Probably not.  The bristles are 2 different lengths, and have more give to them than a normal brush or comb, which is why it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much to get the tangles out.  The brush is kidney-shaped, and a bit hard to hold on to.  I end up dropping it at least once every time I use it.  With my curly-headed child, she was able to brush through her hair herself...she still misses the under bit.&lt;br /&gt;My youngest daughter, with fine, slightly wavy hair, hates it.  She&#x27;s the non-sensitive scalped child, and I can pull tangles out with a normal brush without any fuss, but she fusses with this.&lt;br /&gt;Improvement needed:  Some sort of texturing on the gripping areas would be nice.  Rubber or cross-hatching of the hard plastic would help keep it in my hand and off the floor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 yr old granddaughter who really hates to get her long hair brushed, a lot of crying and whining after a bath, now her mom says she brushes her own hair all the time and loves it. She tried all the sprays and conditioners, the Tangle Teezer is the only thing that works.  :)</li>
    <li> It works like it says it does and I have long hair. Fits well in my hand. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I believe a bristle boar brush (Mason) is probably the cream of the crop when it comes to brushes. But this is way more affordable. I do recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got it for my toddler&#x27;s hair. She was complaining pain when I brushed her fair with her mommie&#x27;s brush, and I did not want to use conditioner on her hair all the time (or baby oil). So, I found this handy dandy item through an Amazon third-party retailer. I did not realize that it was designed in the UK and shipped from continental Europe. Whatever. It works. Not cheap. Glad I found a deal on a not so favorite color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a few months now and my hair has gotten noticeably thicker. of course this takes a while but this brush is so gentle on my hair that hardly any of it breaks off when I&#x27;m brushing it any more. I use it when my hair is a wet and dry.</li>
    <li> When I was buying it, the picture was shown in half pink and half blue and the price was 16 which is 3 dollars more than now;  It&#x27;s ok, because I loved the double color. However, when I received the brush, it&#x27;s WHOLE BLUE! It was really disappointing to me that I feel I got cheated 3 dollars.</li>
    <li> This has been such a blessing for my daughter who has long way hair - mornings in preparation for school have become pain free for her and mom as well.</li>
    <li> At age 5, my daughter used to cry every morning when I brushed her hair for school, which I always tried to do as gently as possible. It was a painful experience for BOTH of us!  I bought conditioners and detangling sprays, and while they helped a little, brushing still hurt. My daughter has straight thick hair, but it is prone to tangling, especially at the ends. She has sensitive skin, where every little scrape really does hurt (she&#x27;s not a drama queen). I hunted these down on Amazon, and the reviews convinced me to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad we did!!! No more tangles, and no more tears!!! We have been using these for three years now, and we own 4 of them (fantastic in the swim bag for after lessons or trip to the beach). She brushes her own hair now, and this brush has a fantastic shape for kid hands. Highly recommend it to anyone struggling with tangles and tears!</li>
    <li> It was really great until I think I got it wet too much and top came off which was easy to pit back on. I now use it was a scalp scrubbing brush.</li>
    <li> This hair brush is excellent in gently untangling knots in one&#x27;s hair. I cannot go back to the conventional hairbrush after using this one.</li>
    <li> Super brush! My daughters are happy! No pain!</li>
    <li> Wet or dry my daughters are thrilled...No more pain. They have showed their friend and they have ordered it too.</li>
    <li> This brush worked great,-- but like any brush would. I guess it had slightly more detangling ability and is useful in the shower, but it is not necessary to have.</li>
    <li> Brushing time for my young daughter has gone from traumatic to terrific. Very happy with this purchase. I recommend this to anyone with a scalp sensitive to tangles.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush for my three year old.  Her hair is very fine and tangles easily.  This has been a wonderful solution for detailing her hair.  The tangle teaser works better than all of the combs I have bought and the boar bristle brush I was using before.  I love to use it too, I have very long hair of medium thick texture.</li>
    <li> the color is beautiful and it works really well!!! totally worth the money spend! I use it more than once every day, the only bad thing is hair get trapped inside are extremely hard to get out... you have to use a toothbrush or something like that...</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine thin hair and it is always painful to comb her hair each morning.  I bought this brush and I really like it.  Finally my daughter stopped screaming each morning when I comb her hair.  My only concern is whether this will make her hair more fragile if I use it for a long time, like other reviewer said.  This is why I only give it a 4 star.</li>
    <li> I use this brush on both wet and dry hair.  I love how effortlessly the Tangle Teezer slides through my hair reducing the time it takes to get dressed.  It is amazingly easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was very upset about this purchase, the comb I received was not like the pic at all, different color and different shape, you should have put the correct picture of the comb you gonna send to your customers! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that have said it pulls out your hair, it never did that for mine, this is awesome!  If this ever breaks or I lose it I will definitely get another.  My husband also loves it.</li>
    <li> i ordered blue / pink but got one which was all blue. so it is not the same as on the picture!</li>
    <li> life saver if you have thick and long hair, but i keep using it as a scalp massage tool since i cut my hair short</li>
    <li> I use this comb on myself and my son. I have type 4c hair that is very tangly and thick, and this comb runs through it easily dry. My infant son has curly kinky hair and the comb works on his hair like a charm. No detangler needed. It of course helps when u comb the hair wet or with detangler. I will be ordering more of this.</li>
    <li> This is no miracle worker, but works like nothing else I&#x27;ve used before. My son still has his baby hair, which knots so easily, but with loads of condition and this, knots don&#x27;t stand a chance. I don&#x27;t intend to ever go without one of these!</li>
    <li> The brush  is exactly like how it shown in the picture. totally worth of waiting. I love the color :)</li>
    <li> This brush slides through tangles and knots without causing tears and pain.  I would recommend this for any small child (or adult for that matter) with long hair.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with detangling my hair now that I&#x27;ve decided to go au naturale. I love my super curly hair but the tangles! This brush worked right through my hair with NO tugging or struggling. I almost cried with joy. Instead, I danced around the bathroom like I was in the club. ;-)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  I have two daughters (9 and 8 year olds) who hate to have me brush their hair.  Then I heard about these brushes and bought them each one and no more whining or problems.  Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I used it on mine and my mother&#x27;s hair (thick curly hair) and no tangles. The brush didn&#x27;t even get caught once, plus it feels like a scalp massage when you use it. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and always tangles no matter what I try to use. It&#x27;s impossible to brush while wet without breaking multiple strands and there is always a lot of hair on the brush when it is dry. That problem was solved by this product. I can finally brush my hair without damaging it, yanking it, and it saves so many headaches. We use it on my curly haired step daughter and she says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;like fairies brushing her hair&amp;#34; since for once it doesn&#x27;t hurt. She&#x27;s not running when we say it&#x27;s time for hair brushing. I wish I had had this years ago.</li>
    <li> I have fine, dense, colored hair.  I got the Tangle Tamer which I was happy with but I wanted to compare this one with it.  I love this one much better.  I have a tough scalp &amp; I feel this is much better on my scalp which feels like a massage.  I think this is a little better for tangles on my hair but both are really good brushes.  If you have a tender scalp then I&#x27;d say get the other one, but for me this brush is ace #1!</li>
    <li> I just started using this and feel good. I think it will take more time for me to say more.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. I use it all the time and it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Go buy it now!</li>
    <li> my two year old doesn&#x27;t cry when detangling her curls with this!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to anyone with curly hair its pain free.</li>
    <li> One major drawback is that it can slip out of your hands very easily if you are detangling with conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the picture, It&#x27;s not the same product, don&#x27;t trust it, just not the same one. another one</li>
    <li> this is the best detangling brush I have ever used! no pain no struggle with hair, I love it, especially taking into account my hair that tangles so fast, this is a life savior</li>
    <li> Amazing Brush! My favorite!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but a lot of it! It tends to get very tangled. This product has been great for getting rid of the tangles without the pain and without as much damage. I don&#x27;t think I lose as much hair or have as much breakage when I use this, as opposed to a normal paddle brush. I think it&#x27;s worth the money if you get knotted hair.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that I got this brush.  It was so hard to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair every morning because she kept screaming how it hurt... but this brush is very gentle and makes our mornings so much more pleasant.  I recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Now i can brush my hair very soft! its comfy in my hand, i have a great massage of my head!</li>
    <li> My daughter has Sensory Processing and has had years of screaming &amp;#34;mommy that hurts!&amp;#34; She loves this brush and demands I only use this in her very tangly straight hair. I love this too and bought a few to keep around the house. I use this as my brush for my hair too. Feels great on the scalp too if you love to have your head scratched like a doggy. ;-)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After I shower and towel dry my hair I have a mass of tangled curls. This brush gets through the tangles in about half the time as my old brush and has greatly reduced the amount of breakage from pulling through the tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I only use this brush with wet hair because it does not help with shine.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fuller and thicker since I started using this brush and reduced the breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I also got my sister, who has extremely long straight hair, using it. She has also found a reduction in the amount of breakage and finds it easier to get through tangles.</li>
    <li> I bought this detangling hairbrush for my daughter and she is happy that the tangles in her hair are easy to brush out now.  Thanks for making a great product.</li>
    <li> My tangly hair is no match for the tangle teezer! After years of struggling with pain and frustration with my wet hair my dreams have finally come true. I can brush my hair easily, wet or dry, and with no ripping!</li>
    <li> I have a little girl with very very curly hair and this brush makes it easy and no tears.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever.  Gets all the tangles out without hair loss.  Massages the scalp.  I give them as gifts to everyone I know who has long hair.  Used at the salon I go to which is frequented by many A list Hollywood stars.</li>
    <li> It really does breeze through tangles with little to no pulling, no breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! The reason why I gave 4 stars is because of Amazon. I picked a color and they sent me a completely different one. Frustrating. But the brush is great with tangles and it&#x27;s gentle with your hair.</li>
    <li> Works a lot better then a regular brush.  My daughter&#x27;s head is very tender and she finally lets me brush her hair more but it does still pull a bit.  She doesn&#x27;t scream in pain near as much anymore. Good for the money.</li>
    <li> I like pure blue, but when I received it, I found it&#x27;s black. Apparently it&#x27;s shown &amp;#34;Pure blue&amp;#34; outside of the package, it&#x27;s strange when I found it was black when I open it.</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift, was told it worked well on dry hair, she was going to try it on wet hair and see if it still worked well.</li>
    <li> If you have ever struggled with tangles and knots, particularly in wet hair, this brush is revolutionary.  It looks a bit odd at first, but the tiny bristles break up tangles amazingly and painlessly.  I will never use another hairbrush for detangling.</li>
    <li> I have baby-fine hair that tangles easily. Combing my hair after a shower has always been painful. This has been the best product for me. No longer have to wince or use a spray-on detangler product.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old hated having her hair brushed.. She has baby thin, long hair and it knots like nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the sprays (detangler) and different methods of actually brishing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This..&lt;br /&gt;This is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves to have her hair brushed now. Seriously.. she does it herself now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is gentle when taming tangles! the rubber bristles are soft enough to untangle my strands of hair once i get out of the shower and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Looks very general，But it&#x27;s really very good to use</li>
    <li> make my hair smooth without damaging my hair. good for thick hair! But it is large, and not good for putting in the bag, so I just use it at home.</li>
    <li> Love this little hand brush. It really does an amazing job getting rid of tangles, I would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> No more tears getting her hair brushed.  A must buy for anyone with medium to long hair.  Buy it online for better prices than in stores.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff- now morning brush for my 7 yr old is never s nightdream.</li>
    <li> Eh, I have thick hair. Only works on me when my hair is bone dry. I need one for wet hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very fine hair that looks like a rats nest. This will brush the very top strands of hair, but the bristles are so short and soft that it will never get to the knots that are entangled under the surface hairs. I watched the YouTube videos on product reviews as well, but they were just brushing the surface of the hair creating the illusion that it was untangled. Once you brush try running your fingers through your hair. You won&#x27;t be able to. Real bummer. Back to the ouchies.</li>
    <li> This comb is the best I ever used comb ,Comb hair becomes a kind of enjoyment . It is very good.</li>
    <li> Brush works great on my 4 year old&#x27;s hair either wet or dry.  Only problem with the order is that the color wasn&#x27;t as shown in the picture.  The one I received was all blue, no pink as shown in the image.</li>
    <li> Not what i wanted it to be, but it does and ok job.</li>
    <li> Like most other little girls, brushing hair without the right brush is a NIGHTMARE! You feel bad that you are yanking her head back as you brush it for her and she yells OWW. Was a little sceptical about this product. It kind of looked cheap to me and it had no handle. When it arrived, I became even more sceptical. It looked like a &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; horse brush with cheap plastic bristles on it. HOWEVER, when we tried it out it worked GREAT! It went through the hair smooth with no yanks or yelps. My daughter who used to absolutely hate brushing her hair, will now sit and brush her hair sometimes as she is watching TV or just hanging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are cute colors to choose from, the product looks cheap but performs like a champ. I would highly recommend this to anyone in a similar situation as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI on child hair type- White/Mexican girl, fairly thin and straight hair that tangles easily, about mid-back in length</li>
    <li> Highly recommend it. Solve my girl&#x27;s long-term tangled hair. She likes it so much that she brushes her hair herself.</li>
    <li> This brush definitely works better than other brushes or combs I&#x27;ve used to detangle long, fine hair after showering without pulling and breaking the hair or hurting the scalp.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it tends to slip out of the hand easily.  A better gripping surface or handle would make it a 5.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I had extensions and this did wonders! I took them out recently and I love it for brushing my hair when it&#x27;s wet. I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling out when I use it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, who is six.  She loved it for the first month or so, but pretty soon the teeth on the brush started to bend and it didn&#x27;t detangle quite as well.  She is now back to whining about brushing her hair, but at least it cuts back a bit on the complaints about &amp;#34;snaggles.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you may want to get some good detangling spray and stick with a cheaper and more durable brush.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed. I don&#x27;t find this product to be any different than any other hairbrush. It does not detangle my hair as easily as I had hoped and still hurts.  I used it when my hair was wet.  It does an ok job when my hair is dry.  I find myself still using a comb when my hair is wet.</li>
    <li> i have fine straight hair. it did not work any better that my other brushes. my paul mitchell brush does a better job.</li>
    <li> It is truly useful. It decreases my hair loss. I&#x27;ll consistently use it.</li>
