      <li>But, you might have better luck with whatever brand you use.</li>
      <li>As stated, satisfied.</li>
      <li>so I only use when I want to look especially nice.</li>
      <li>My favorite of all the brands that make a smoothing product</li>
      <li>I have been using it more  than 3years.</li>
      <li>gave it to my daughter and sister and they both love it.</li>
      <li>That seemed to eradicate most of my hive problems and still allowed me to benefit from using the Clarins primer.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product to help cover wrinkles, I use it daily.</li>
      <li>Very unique texture.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied that it gives my face a smooth finish and it blocks most of the oil in my T zone for most of the day.  </li>
      <li>Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch is excellent for smoothing out my blemishes.  </li>
      <li>It make the skin look and feel radiant,soft and yes, smooth and perfect as ones skin can possibly look.</li>
      <li>i love it, and thanks for great quick service</li>
      <li>I love it but need to pay close attention putting it on smoothly.</li>
      <li>foundation goes on more easily and leaves a smooth silky finish.</li>
      <li>It diminishes the pores and any spots if you have them, but I can&#x27;t say it covers fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>It is a great product for lip lines especially!!</li>
      <li>I recommend Instant Smooth  to women of all ages, even the very young who need no make up but want to look especially beautiful at a party or dance.</li>
      <li>If I were rich and could afford to, I would bathe in it.</li>
      <li>a primer does: gives my skin a smooth palette to apply foundation, makes my pores minuscule, my wrinkle and fine lines smoother, and gives the makeup that I put on my face a powerful boost to stay on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This really makes my skin look better.</li>
      <li>Full marks for this product.</li>
      <li>(It also doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a lotion--it really does have a very unique feel to it.)      </li>
      <li>Super stuff.</li>
      <li>Overall very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect the lines to become completely invisible--or you&#x27;ll be disappointed--just expect them to look better than they did.</li>
      <li>It makes makeup look ever so much better on my 58 year old face.</li>
      <li>I finally can kind of do makeup.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with ALL I have bought from them so far over the past 5 years.</li>
      <li>I use the spatula to smooth and press a tiny amount of Clarins into the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>It makes my face silky smooth and minimizes the appearance of fine lines prior to makeup application.</li>
      <li>I also am a 56 year-old professional woman who has fine lines around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Clarins!</li>
      <li>It does make your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but this is a truly excellent primer.</li>
      <li>First time ever buying Clarins product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would have bought it if I didn&#x27;t have the sample first</li>
      <li>When I first got it from a friend I was expecting a night lotion, so when it wouldn&#x27;t rub into my skin</li>
      <li>First, I created a mini spatula by pulling the foam ends off an eyeshadow applicator.</li>
      <li>and I have tried many with lesser results.</li>
      <li>It also adds some moisture unlike other products of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
      <li>Clarins Instant smooth helps  make up look fresh all day and&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would say any good moisturizer will probably give the same or similar result.</li>
      <li>I just wish it was either a little cheaper or worked a bit better!</li>
      <li>It certainly helps camouflage the pores on my nose too</li>
      <li>the product is fine but the way it&#x27;s showed, you may think it&#x27;s bigger.</li>
      <li>It instantly smooths those fine wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Clarins Instant Smooth makes my skin matte and silky</li>
      <li>B002AMUFM4 Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch, 0.5-Ounce Box]]</li>
      <li>i am very disapointed...</li>
      <li>Clarins Instant Smooth really did instantly make my pores disappear, created a matte look to my skin, and made my skin feel smooth and soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Also comes in Instant Smooth self tanning</li>
      <li>reasonably priced and does what it says it will do for your skin.</li>
      <li>I use this daily under my foundation to smooth our those lines</li>
      <li>The name Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch speaks for itself in every sense of the word.</li>
      <li>It seemed promising:  </li>
      <li>Sure enough my hives were completely gone when I wasn&#x27;t using Clarins.  </li>
      <li>This product is very useful for after makeup to cover big pores!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich enough</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 46 years old with decent skin, but I&#x27;m still a little bit oily on the t-zone and have thin skin, very dark circles, and some wrinkles under my eyes which is exactly why I bought this product.  As another reviewer aptly stated, it is indeed a wee pot of magic.  The key is to pat it on, not rub in or smear it in and wait several minutes for it to set.  It will truly fill in the blanks of those pesky wrinkles and leave a satiny, nongreasy, nondrying perfect finish.  An absolute must have if you have dark circles and need tons of concealer as this will prevent the concealer from forming creases under your eyes.  Some people use it all over their face, but I limit it to under my eyes since it is very expensive considering you only get 0.5 ounce for the price.  If I were rich and could afford to, I would bathe in it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money. It does make your face feel smooth and soft. But, as far as any visual reduction of wrinkles,nope. I would say any good moisturizer will probably give the same or similar result. Used in combination with Botox it may create a base so your makeup lies flat and doesn&#x27;t settle into lines, but if a person makes facial expressions often, this product seems useless.</li>
    <li> Super stuff. Long lasting and effective.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this with a package from Victoris&#x27;s Secret and loved it so much I had to buy a bigger size. It does all it claims and more. I can tell a big difference in my overall look if I don&#x27;t use it - on a weekend just running errands - don&#x27;t look as \\&quot;bright\\&quot; if that makes sense..If the price seems a little high don&#x27;t worry - a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t know that I would have bought it if I didn&#x27;t have the sample first - I wouldn&#x27;t have know it existed..Overall very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re tired of being orange, walnut or just plain strange colored with face bronzers, try this delightful cream that not only control the color (lasts all day and washes off at night) but is great for your skin as well.  I will never be without it again.</li>
    <li> Clarins is an EXCELLENT and reputable company. I&#x27;ve been very happy with ALL I have bought from them so far over the past 5 years. I&#x27;ve tried TONS of anti aging products and this is one of the BEST I saw immediate results with upon first application!! Also make a terrific primer for eye makeup. Been using several years now &amp; very difficult to find ANYWHERE on sale or for a deal. [[ASIN:B002AMUFM4 Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch, 0.5-Ounce Box]] 0.5-Ounce Box regular price for this product is ~$32.00 for 0.5 oz. and they do not charge shipping if you buy DIRECTLY from them!!    A WONDERFUL lightweight \\&quot;instant smoothing\\&quot; immediate anti aging effect as soon as it&#x27;s applied. Smooths &amp; softens lines immediately and gives your face a GREAT appearance. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this product!! (Also comes in Instant Smooth self tanning but I have not tried it yet).    **GOOD LUCK!!**</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. It&#x27;s rich enough so I dont put moisturizer under. As a matter of fact I mix it with my foundation and apply it. It diminishes the pores and any spots if you have them, but I can&#x27;t say it covers fine lines or wrinkles. I wish it will.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to my daughter and sister and they both love it. So I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> For me, this is a big fat ZERO--it didn&#x27;t work at all.    It seemed promising:  I got the product to fill in pinprick-like pore holes.  The texture of the product is hard to describe--kind of like a moldable wax.  It&#x27;s heavy but malleable.  I found it disagreeably slick and greasy to the touch, although it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your fingers like baby oil.  (It also doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a lotion--it really does have a very unique feel to it.)      In the container it has a pinkish hue, as seen in the the photos someone has nicely supplied.  It seemed to go on pretty clear, though.      No discernable smell.    But it just didn&#x27;t do as promised, i.e. fill in pore holes.  Put it on fine lines, and it cracks and makes things even worse.  Wish I had returned this when I could have.</li>
    <li> Just as Clarins promises, their Perfecting Touch covers pores, tiny imperfections &amp; wrinkles. It feels wonderful on the skin, not heavy, in fact the sensation disappears. I use it to replace foundation; although, you can use it w/ foundation or make up, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Full marks for this product.</li>
    <li> This primer is pricey and not as good as the one that I am using, and I have used them all from A to Z.  I like MN primer the best.</li>
    <li> The items is the same price as in the department store, which is what it should be. Saved me a trip to the mall!</li>
    <li> I have used several different primers and this one does everything I hope a primer does: gives my skin a smooth palette to apply foundation, makes my pores minuscule, my wrinkle and fine lines smoother, and gives the makeup that I put on my face a powerful boost to stay on. My makeup looks very nice if I use this first.      The downside though is that I am sensitive to this primer.  That&#x27;s why I gave the product a four-star rating.  It would be a very high five-star rating if it does not do the following: Highly annoying hives on my face and other body areas appear.  The hives would not appear though unless I were exercising and got my body temperature up.  I got to the root of the hive problems when I tested out my fear that I was allergic to the Clarins primer: I went for several weeks (about 3 months) without using this primer and using a cheap primer like Loreal&#x27;s studio secrets magic perfecting base.  The cheaper primer did a mediocre job and made me yearn for Clarins all the while. Sure enough my hives were completely gone when I wasn&#x27;t using Clarins.  But I went back and started using Clarins again but only on wrinkle-prone areas and big pore spots.  That seemed to eradicate most of my hive problems and still allowed me to benefit from using the Clarins primer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at makeup. But finally, I found a product that I can use. This stuff is great. When I first got it from a friend I was expecting a night lotion, so when it wouldn&#x27;t rub into my skin I was disappointed. But after some time and some thought, I started blending my concealer onto my face with this stuff and suddenly my concealer actually blends. I finally can kind of do makeup. It&#x27;s great. I just dab on my concealer and then use my brush to spread it around with this product. Thanks, Clarins!</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but this is a truly excellent primer. It makes my face silky smooth and minimizes the appearance of fine lines prior to makeup application. Very good product.</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with my orders</li>
    <li> I read about this in a fashion magazine and decided to try it.  This was my 4th purchase.  I am satisfied that it gives my face a smooth finish and it blocks most of the oil in my T zone for most of the day.  I wish it grabbed my eyeshadow a little better.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all.  I wish I had saved my money and just gotten some cream from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.I have been using it more  than 3years.</li>
    <li> My favorite of all the brands that make a smoothing product</li>
    <li> surprisingly good one!</li>
    <li> This works!! It is a great product for lip lines especially!! Goes along way! I will buy it when I run low.</li>
    <li> First time ever buying Clarins product. Was afraid it would get cake and flakey like some other primers. Love it, great product. Just small jar though for the money. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> the product is fine but the way it&#x27;s showed, you may think it&#x27;s bigger. i am very disapointed... i now know.</li>
    <li> For the fine lines around my eyes, this product has been surprisingly effective. Don&#x27;t expect the lines to become completely invisible--or you&#x27;ll be disappointed--just expect them to look better than they did. When you first apply the product, at first it seems miraculous because the lines disappear, but after a short time they show up again because your facial expressions move the product around. So, I&#x27;ve found that I have to apply Clarins in a particular way for it to work. First, I created a mini spatula by pulling the foam ends off an eyeshadow applicator. I use the spatula to smooth and press a tiny amount of Clarins into the fine lines around my eyes. It&#x27;s pretty creamy when you first put it on, so let it sit for 10-15 minutes to firm up a bit (I put it on before I style my hair, so that by the time I&#x27;m done with my hair, I can continue). After 10 minutes or so, the product has moved around a bit due to my facial expressions, so I use my finger to gently pat it back into the fine lines. Since the product has hardened a bit, it stays put this time. I find this is the best way to apply it. If you simply try to pat it down into the lines with your finger on the first go around, it doesn&#x27;t apply well because the product is too creamy and doesn&#x27;t stay put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have great luck using powder over it--just got stuck in it and a bit clumpy--so I just use the product on its own. But, you might have better luck with whatever brand you use.</li>
    <li> Very unique texture.  I love it but need to pay close attention putting it on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. You can see the difference immediately. Try it yourself, one eye with/one without.  Ask your family if they can see the difference.  Mine could.</li>
    <li> Clarins Instant smooth helps  make up look fresh all day and&lt;br /&gt;All that&#x27;s needed is a small amount, I mix it with Supergoop spf&lt;br /&gt;and my make up and it goes on even and doesn&#x27;t need any&lt;br /&gt;Touch up all day. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> As stated, satisfied.</li>
    <li> Other than smoothness created by putting cream on your face....I SEE ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFRENCE IN APPEARANCE. Another gimic catering to an image insecure clientele (me). Rgenerist Olay serum has the same silk-feel quality for 1/2 the price and moisturises well. Wish I hadnt bought this product. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to help cover wrinkles, I use it daily. I highly recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this was not a miracle product for the deeper lines I have around my mouth, but it did soften them a bit.  I just wish it was either a little cheaper or worked a bit better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It instantly smooths those fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! It makes makeup look ever so much better on my 58 year old face. It also adds some moisture unlike other products of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
    <li> I am just now getting back to using Clarins. It is mainly a primer to me. I apply a thin layer on entire face. It works as a filler to some degree and foundation goes on more easily and leaves a smooth silky finish. I consider this inexpensive compared to other high end primers....and I have tried many with lesser results.</li>
    <li> This feels great on my skin. It certainly helps camouflage the pores on my nose too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my wrinkled upper lip for two years.  It works beautifully. During the summer, to blend with a little color in my face, I add a bit of foundation.  Great Seller, thanks!</li>
    <li> thank u for this great product... it makes make up go on very smooth.  i love it, and thanks for great quick service</li>
    <li> I have used this product over and over again...reasonably priced and does what it says it will do for your skin.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today and I had high expectations from the other reviews I read.  This did NOTHING.  It didn&#x27;t even hide the tiny wrinkles let alone phase the bigger ones at all.  *sigh*  It sounded too good to be true and it was.</li>
    <li> I give this a 5 Star rating because i truly love this product and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.The name Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch speaks for itself in every sense of the word.It make the skin look and feel radiant,soft and yes, smooth and perfect as ones skin can possibly look. It is second to none on today&#x27;s market. I recommend Instant Smooth  to women of all ages, even the very young who need no make up but want to look especially beautiful at a party or dance.</li>
    <li> Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch is excellent for smoothing out my blemishes.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Went on smoothly. A little goes a long way. Use on forehead every day.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I say hold on to your money. I see no change and it feels greasy . Won&#x27;t buy again. Was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I like using this product.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Clarins Instant Smooth makes my skin matte and silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do have visible pores and oily skin.  Clarins Instant Smooth really did instantly make my pores disappear, created a matte look to my skin, and made my skin feel smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this under my foundation and it gave my skin an even look.  I didn&#x27;t need to add powder, like I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really makes my skin look better.</li>
    <li> This product is very useful for after makeup to cover big pores! Benefit Poreprofessional is too liquidity aka useless! But just don&#x27;t like the jar packaging!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I have lines on my forehead and once I apply this product,  i wait about 15 minutes and apply my foundation, and the lines are gone. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 1 year.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really covers up the larger pores of an older woman.  Maybe if they made it in the US instead of France, it would be cheaper.  Rather expensive so I only use when I want to look especially nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since its introduction and I am thoroughly pleased! I also am a 56 year-old professional woman who has fine lines around my eyes. I use this daily under my foundation to smooth our those lines and I notice a difference nearly immediately. I&#x27;ll be a long-term customer.</li>
