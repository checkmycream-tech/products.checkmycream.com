<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very convenient case. Seems well-constructed, and I like being able to detach each segment. Delivery was good. Holds much more than I thought it would. I bought it as a makeup bag, but it would be fine for travel if you stick to travel-size toiletry bottles.</li>
    <li> Really love this make up bag!!!!!!  And if I need to travel I can just detach one or two to bring along with me.  Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought for me and my 3 bridesmaids 4 yrs ago. We all use it to this day and love it!! Love the removable pouches! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a bag I could store all of my manicure/pedicure items in. When I received it, I thought it was much too big, but to my surprize, it&#x27;s just the right size for my needs. I really like the convenience of taking just the pouch I need, not having to lug the whole bag around. You&#x27;ll find many uses for this item.</li>
    <li> This travel bag is perfect...it holds EVERYTHING I need!</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  From the swivelling hook for hanging over shower recesses to the roomy pouches for my hair and skincare needs.  The removable pouches made it fantastic for storing makeup. Just remove one pouch, pop it in my handbag, and its on the go for any touch ups during the day and night.  The colour was perfect, not to girlie.  I love it, I wish they were cheaper, I would buy one for all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> One of the plastic zippers already separated last night when I was stocking it.  I like the storage and the concept of the overall bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always searching for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; hanging travel-makeup-case to replace one that I&#x27;m still using even though it&#x27;s about to fall apart .  While this one does have transparent pouches plus a secure hook and fastener, the tough, stiff vinyl used for the pouches was a deal breaker.  I found the vinyl not at all suited for frequent zipping or product containment.  Who wants to struggle with their makeup bag?  Although I have not used it bc I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund, I do wonder how well it would roll up once the pouches are filled and zipped.  It does seem like a good concept and design.</li>
    <li> Always use this traveling.  Keeps liquids contained and easily accessible.</li>
    <li> Wonderful addition to my travel bag. Holds everything I needed (shower products/hair products/hair brush/toothcare/ makeup, etc.) for a 7 day cruise and hung up in the tiny bathroom perfectly.. Surprised at the volume this holds. Great quality too. This replaced 3 or 4 other small bags. Made packing much simpler.</li>
    <li> The velcro is reliable in keeping the separate bags together. Very cute design &amp; enough room to pack all the hygiene necessities.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever! Saved tons of room in my luggage!</li>
    <li> Love this rollup!  It is better than the old one.  They moved the zippers to the yop of the bags,  Great move!!!  Smart move. Thank y&amp;ograve;&amp;ugrave;!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for a while but it was out of my price range until I found it on this site. I love it everything fits and I can grab it and go quickly.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Travel Bag. I placed makeup  or jewelry in the bags and hang on my wall for quick use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these ever since I saw my Mom&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t want to pay full price from local consultant.  Great price and can&#x27;t wait to use it on my next trip in Janary!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I can fit everything I need to travel.  It stays organized and safe until I need it.  I like being able to hand it from some where then I don&#x27;t have to use counter top.&lt;br /&gt;I keep all my stuff in the roll while at home as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many travel bags in the past with some being too small or too big for travel essentials/toiletries. Not only can I fit the items I need to take on a trip, I can also carry my makeup without carrying a separate bags. The four removable pouches are clever and allow organization (I&#x27;m a neat freak) and easy packing. I don&#x27;t recommend overpacking the pouches as this will make the bag difficult to fold resulting in a awkward and bulky appearance</li>
    <li> I have always used two travel bags. I am now down to one</li>
    <li> I saw this case at a MK party.  I loved it.  It was a bit 2 expensive.  So glad you have it priced more reasonably.  It is an amazing way to organize makeup &amp; I have plenty.</li>
    <li> I recently travelled out of the country and brought this along with me.  It was SO nice!  There are four pouches with thick plastic that easily come on and off.  I was able to put my liquids in one pouch and pack separately so I could get through security check while the other items stayed in my carry on.  Easily stowes away.  Hangs nicely.</li>
    <li> Terrific for carrying and organizing large amounts of cosmetics, etc. for a long trip or for those who can&#x27;t do without all their &amp;#34;goodies&amp;#34;.  I separate the pouches into categories - first aid/meds, cosmetics, shower, skin care (sometimes including sun care products depending on where I&#x27;m off to.)  After years of traveling &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, I got an airline card that lets me check a free bag. I like taking this.  I find I like having enough to be ready for any eventuality.</li>
    <li> Still trying to return item. Zipper broke first time I tried to use it.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted!  Matched the picture and description perfectly!</li>
    <li> Perfect travel organizer, great design.</li>
    <li> I got one of these with a Mary Kay gift card when I got married. I loved it so much I bought one for my mother to use. I like how the compartments are actually useful in size. They can hold my full sized items such as face wash, toothbrush and paste, and all my makeup I use can fit into just one compartment, and not squished in there. The folded up size fits easily into all my sizes of bags and suitcases. It is not too large or bulky and rolls up nicely with ease. Also useful is the hook which can be buttoned out of the way or unbuttoned to hang. This has been my favorite, by far, &amp;#34;ditty bag&amp;#34; to use. I travel a lot and this is the only one I actually have thought of and recommend. The pouches also Velcro off, though I don&#x27;t really use that function. The quality is good and I have had no problems. I&#x27;m not easy on the bag either. If you are looking for a toiletries travel bag, get this one. It can hold virtually everything you use normally (except full sized shampoo or conditioner, but everything else full sized has fit easily for me with room to spare in the compartment for other items). Everything can be well organized and since the compartments are clear, it is easy to see the item you need and I no longer have to dig around to find an eye liner or an earring.</li>
    <li> Great case. I have taken it on several vacations. I can hang it on the bathroom door and remove the pouches whe I need them. I do not need to clutter the sink area. Also since it is see through I can easily retrieve iems.</li>
    <li> Great bag for carrying travel needs. Items are easy to locate in the many clear pouches.</li>
    <li> Works just as expected. Great product and great for travel.</li>
    <li> always love Mary Kay products.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this kit!  Bags each remove and easily velcro back and they hold a ton!  Built in hanger allows you to hang anywhere in bathroom, counter space not needed.  Takes up room in the suitcase if you fill it like I do, but, holds all toiletries and cosmetics in one easily accessible spot!  Bought one for each of my daughters as they were coveting mine, one fir my sister-in-law (she loves it!) my son&#x27;s girlfriend is next as she wants one.  Only draw back it the Mary Kay logo on front.</li>
    <li> Conveniently lies flat to pack. The compartments are very roomy, one compartment fits 10 travel size containers. Each bag is held sturdy by 2 thin strips of Velcro but detaches easy. The bag hangs and you can see everything inside easily.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this bag. It hold quite a bit and the quality is great. Very sturdy! Love being able to hang this up easily and detach the pockets too.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Item as described.</li>
    <li> Perfect works great with plenty of space to spare</li>
    <li> I traveled to Vegas for my birthday and did not want to pay to check a bag. Since I&#x27;m a female I way over pack and need all my skin care and beauty products. I was searching for a couple days until I found the Mary Kay roll up bag. I was worried about the size and if it was going to be cheaply made, but once it arrived and I was able to open it up I was super surprised by the size; a lot bigger than I thought. I love how the pockets are removable &amp; easy to clean. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you get what you pay for...an amazing travel bag!</li>
    <li> I use it to store my makeup/skin care items. It is still hanging :) I give this product a 5 because it holds my products in pretty well. The product is sturdy and made of great quality.</li>
    <li> This product is superb. it is functional and room saving for travel!!!!!! I love it !!!! I also love the color!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great toiletry bag and the pouches are removable so if you only need one you can just take it off.</li>
    <li> The item was just what I wanted just have to figure out now how to organize my make up .</li>
    <li> Very happy with this . Fits all my make up and the case is versatile while easy to clean</li>
    <li> Fits my needs perfectly. Despite other claims that it doesn&#x27;t roll up well when full, mine rolls back up fine.</li>
    <li> How can you live without one?!??! You don&#x27;t have one? Buy one now! The pockets are plastic, washable, velcro onto the backing that rolls them up into an easy travel case. Fits perfectly in a carry on. I keep all my bathroom stuff in here and have it hanging on the back of my bathroom door for easy access. For weekend trips, I pull off the section I need for basics and go! The whole thing is washable and looks fantastic. GET YOU ONE NOW!!!</li>
    <li> Great for travelling!</li>
    <li> This is great for travelling. I use it for my essential items such as my make-up, jewelry, hygiene items, and it fit my overnite case.</li>
    <li> I love this! It carries all my stuff, and I have A LOT of stuff. It hangs nicely over my door and so easy to transport. It&#x27;s really cute too!</li>
    <li> Already have 2 of these bags at home and I love this bag. Perfect for a woman with a lot!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second travel bag from Mary Kay.  My first was from a distributor.  The quality from this one to the old one is somewhat poorer.  The bags are smaller and the clear vinyl is thinner but I was just happy to find another one as mine was falling apart. There is one up graded feature, there is more Velcro to hold the bags to the hang-up holder.</li>
    <li> Love this bag! I love that the pockets are detachable, but sturdy. I use this everyday and would not hesitate to purchase another.</li>
    <li> This bag is awesome! The pouches inside are huge and can take a lot of stuff! It is made of good and sturdy material and very useful and handy. I have already recommended the bag to a couple of my friends! Truely value for money!</li>
    <li> Nice and big with lots of space for everything. Can be used for cosmetics, personal toiletries, jewelry, and medications - all in one!</li>
    <li> The bag is very well made. The bag hangs on my shower curtain freeing counter space. Individual zipper cases are removable with Velcro so that you can take with you only what you need. I really like that it cleans well, dirty makeup cases are gross. I also like that they are clear so that I can see what&#x27;s in each one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these now for different purposes.  This one I filled with all types of baby supplies as a gift.  The mom-to-be loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought one in 2007 from my Mary Kay lady, I loved it and used it religiously, daily, I was in the Navy so this went on deployment with me, more than once.  I noticed in 2011 my little baggies were ripping and looking a little dingy.  I could not find the replacable bags, so I had to buy a new one.  This one here on Amazon is cheaper than the one on the MK site, there&#x27;s is 34. plus tax and shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this bag. It&#x27;s easy to clean, portable, easy to organize.  Each pocket is removable for packing.</li>
    <li> Okay. This literally took the longest to ship ever - but I&#x27;m positive it was miscommunication of some kind, because the seller is very nice. I love this bag. Bigger than I expected. The pockets come off and you can rearrange the your hearts desire. Hangs on doors. Good for touring bands.</li>
    <li> I love how fast I received the travel bag. I love the removable compartments which makes life easier. Thanks very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this out for the first time. I like the idea of being able to hang it up and also like the four individual sections can be removed and use as needed. I won&#x27;t pack as pictured, (folded into the large square), I&#x27;ll lay it flat and tuck the sections around in the suitcase and reassemble once I get to my destination. Since I&#x27;ll be in one place for a month I think it will be convenient, if I were in and out of hotels I may be inclined to my old way of 1 bag for makeup and another for shampoo,etc.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for. The pouches are a great size for carrying makeup, even small-medium pallets fit in! I love that the pouches are removable so I can take just one away from the big collection easily. That being said, the velcro that holds the pouches on is very sturdy and hasn&#x27;t dropped a heavy unzipped yet! As a professional makeup artist, I love the big handle, and it&#x27;s ease of use, whether hanging on something or laying on the table. It has really made my kit much more manageable. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the third one I have bought. The original for myself and the other two for presents. Enough said!</li>
    <li> It hangs from my bathroom door and is so convenient. Everything has its own compartment instead of being thrown in a junk drawer!</li>
    <li> excellent product. Holds my cosmetics, jelwery, and misc items all in one place. Very convenient because it hangs anywhere and does not take up any space. Very sturdy plastic carriers and velcro. I would recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and was delivered in a timely manner. Brand new product. I love it and find it very useful. I just use it for my own wedding event.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay&#x27;s travel roll up bag costs much less this item priced here. Plus Mary Kay offers 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products! It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to talk to a consultant. They can even mail to you for free!</li>
    <li> Súper practícal and ideal for travelling</li>
    <li> I had one and my sister needed one...now we all have it.  Don&#x27;t travel without!</li>
    <li> The bag holds a lot of stuff and closes easily!  It wlon&#x27;t hold large items, but holds all of my makeup and other personal item.  Shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter to take with her to London for the Fall semester.  I have one myself and love it! I use it on all my overnight trips.  The attached hanger is very convenient to hang the travel bag in a bathroom.  I can stuff lots of things in the pouches because of its size.</li>
    <li> Solid craftsmanship. Does not feel flimsy or cheap in anyway. The back board has a silk/nylon feel that is easy to wipe down and the bags are a nice hearty plastic that feel like they&#x27;ll stand up well against wear and tear. The bags are also larger than I expected and will hold more than I anticipated for sure! They&#x27;ll even accommodate my smaller full sized items. The carry handle is good quality as is the hanging hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bags attach to the backing by two thin Velcro strips. I wish they were wider for a more secure hold but the compartments haven&#x27;t threatened to come loose yet. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how well they hold up with time.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I can just bring one compartment or more with me when I need it.  Great invention and I would recomment it</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daughter asked me to get this for her to take along on our cruise.  She packed her foundations in the first and second tier.  She has two different colors as well as powder and liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know how much makeup a teenaged girl will take with her on a trip, then you&#x27;ll have a good idea of how much this case can hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each tier is attached with Velcro so you can take it off for easier handling if you want, or you can hang the entire thing up over a towel rack which is what my daughter did.  She is thrilled with it and still uses it even though we bought it with traveling in mind.</li>
    <li> I like the removable pouches&lt;br /&gt;I make hand beaded jewelry and sell at trade shows which requires me to travel. I put entire color coordinated sets in each pouch for my days away from home. One each for the show days: Friday, Saturday, And Sunday; and the empty one for the jewelry I wear on my travel/set up day.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Every easy to use</li>
