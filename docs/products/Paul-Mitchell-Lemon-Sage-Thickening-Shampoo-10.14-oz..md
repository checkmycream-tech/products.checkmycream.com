      <li>I have fine curly hair and it does great on my type of hair.  </li>
      <li>Still, my hair looks good if I do follow with a good conditioner, but I&#x27;m still looking for the holy grail of shampoos for my fine hair.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I am really happy with it, it seems to keep my hair clean and unlike some shampoos does not make my oil hair greasy quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>But I love the lemon/sage smell, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It smells great and is very sudsy and luxurious.</li>
      <li>Love Paul Mitchell products.  </li>
      <li>a bit pricey for my range but worth every dollar!!</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I and my fine virgin (undyed, unbleached, unpermed) hair love this product.  </li>
      <li>Not only is my hair clean, my scalp feels fabulous &amp; my hair smells great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and it smells pretty good, but I do not notice much in the way of thickening, even after using for two weeks now.</li>
      <li>First, the smell is amazing.</li>
      <li>The conditioner was sealed with scotch tape and the shampoo in a cheap transparent bag as taken from a flea market..</li>
      <li>Smells nice but is very drying.</li>
      <li>It does leaves your hair clean and smelling great but be careful this stuff doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes, it stings and irritate your eyes like hell and pain doesn&#x27;t goes away right away!!</li>
      <li>It lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Clean and thicken.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend it for people with dry (non-greasy) hair, because the tea-tree oil is &amp;#34;drying,&amp;#34; but for me, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>Its been only a couple of washes and i already notice the difference in the texture of my hair,it volumizies your hair in a good way&lt;</li>
      <li>Cleans well, feels great while shampooing, no tangling, but I can&#x27;t use it every day due to how drying it is and when I use it</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>I started to use it after surgery on my forehead couldn&#x27;t use harsh soaps it worked great</li>
      <li>I discovered this after a transition to more natural products.</li>
      <li>its pricy but almost worth it,</li>
      <li>TIGI Epic Volume is better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many so called &amp;#34;thickening shampoos&amp;#34; and so far none of them including Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo thickens your hair.</li>
      <li>like the lemon and smell so fresh</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell products are all worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
      <li>Obtain thick beautiful volume with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, though honestly with my hair already being thick enough , it has too much volume now haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it did add some volume to my hair at first.</li>
      <li>It really makes your hair feel clean and shiny and not weighed down like so many others.</li>
      <li>but it is fine and lies pretty flat if I don&#x27;t put some styling product in it.</li>
      <li>verses straight.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>I love this product and can definitely tell an improvement in my baby-fine naturally curly hair when I use it.</li>
      <li>This is very sketchy product presentation for a high price.</li>
      <li>scent is just what it says -- lemon and sage -- and it takes very little to work up a nice lather.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better for less money.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The thing I love about this is it smells good and makes my thin hair feel thicker without the roughness some shampoos make you feel like you hair is stiff and cores</li>
      <li>like that it requires a light amount to actually shampoos all my hair, and as a guy, one squirt on a fingertip is enough for me.</li>
      <li>This product seems to last - love the smell - will probably keep using with my other shampoo because I like to change products once in awhile.</li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo marketed as &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; that actually seems to work for me.  </li>
      <li>CONDITIONER IS FANTASTIC AND DOES NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There is only one drawback for me: if you get it in your eyes it seems to burn significantly more than the average shampoo.</li>
      <li>A week later I noticed my hair getting very greasy</li>
      <li>My scalp would become really itchy after only a couple hours.</li>
      <li>As far as thickening goes, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair</li>
      <li>as far as adding volume to my hair i havent noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but a small amount makes a good lather.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if this actually makes your hair feel thicker, but sure like the smell.  </li>
      <li>With use of this shampoo I am able to use less styling product and less agressive styling product.</li>
      <li>Too soon to tell; only used it a few times thus far and the results after the first bottle will determin is I buy it again.</li>
      <li>it allows for a temporary feeling of full thick hair with lots of body.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair -- always have.  </li>
      <li>I received this product and the bottle was broken open and spilled all over the box.&lt;br /&gt;The item was replaced and came in fine.</li>

    <li> I took a gamble on this product as I already have thick hair, the last thing I need is thickening. But I love the lemon/sage smell, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I am really happy with it, it seems to keep my hair clean and unlike some shampoos does not make my oil hair greasy quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this shampoo.  Not only is my hair clean, my scalp feels fabulous &amp; my hair smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many so called &amp;#34;thickening shampoos&amp;#34; and so far none of them including Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Lemon Sage Thickening shampoo thickens your hair. It does leaves your hair clean and smelling great but be careful this stuff doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes, it stings and irritate your eyes like hell and pain doesn&#x27;t goes away right away!!</li>
    <li> I love the lemon-sage scent this has. I use it for days I want big hair, verses straight. If you don&#x27;t buy from a salon it isn&#x27;t guaranteed to be authentic.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Does leave my hair thicker but also dries my hair our slightly. What I do is alternate this with another shampoo.</li>
    <li> this is great shampoo and when I ordered it, it came within the alloted time frame. It was packaged well and this shampoo makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> My hair did not get any thicker.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo.  It really makes your hair feel clean and shiny and not weighed down like so many others.</li>
    <li> easy and great shampoo to make my hair look good and great&lt;br /&gt;I like the lemon and smell so fresh</li>
    <li> At first I liked this shampoo: great smell and it did add some volume to my hair at first. A week later I noticed my hair getting very greasy and I had to start washing it almost every day which is no good. I ended up switching back to the Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo after all.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but is very drying. Conditioner is a must with this shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo after trying it at my mom&#x27;s. It lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean. I have thin hair and while I have no proof I feel that it is thicker with regular use of this shampoo. Also it smells great.</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo.  I would not recommend it for people with dry (non-greasy) hair, because the tea-tree oil is &amp;#34;drying,&amp;#34; but for me, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I and my fine virgin (undyed, unbleached, unpermed) hair love this product.  (These are my six more required words. Amen)</li>
    <li> I discovered this after a transition to more natural products. First, the smell is amazing. Second, it does wonders for your hair. It is pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know until I purchased it if it would be as good as I had hoped.  It wasn&#x27;t.  I felt as if it might actually be bad for my hair.  On the other hand, I like tea tree shampoo.  Stick to what works.</li>
    <li> Love this, smells great</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner were delivered in really bad presentation:  The conditioner was sealed with scotch tape and the shampoo in a cheap transparent bag as taken from a flea market.. It looked like had been used before, and I am not sure if what is inside these bottles is the legit product as there were no security caps.  Should I use?  I am afraid and concerned about what is inside...This is very sketchy product presentation for a high price.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for fine hair. It smells great and is very sudsy and luxurious.</li>
    <li> PM lemon sage, is a thickening product.  it allows for a temporary feeling of full thick hair with lots of body.  been a big fan since its arrival on the market. love it.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works well and has a nice scent.  Somewhat less moisturizing effect than some Paul Mitchell products.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo...makes my fine hair thicker and squeeky clean.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this. It&#x27;s a nice shampoo and it smells pretty good, but I do not notice much in the way of thickening, even after using for two weeks now. The cap was broken when I opened the box. It hadn&#x27;t spilled but now I&#x27;ve got to make sure it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had better for less money. TIGI Epic Volume is better.</li>
    <li> Love Paul Mitchell products.  This was no exception.  Quick delivery.  Packaged well.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I have fine curly hair and it does great on my type of hair.  Put a little product in and blow it dry usually.  Obtain thick beautiful volume with it.  Would definitely recommend and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this actually makes your hair feel thicker, but sure like the smell.  It is thick, a little goes a long way.  Great reviews through all of the glamor magazines and hair product sites I could find online.  Even my almost bald husband likes it. Though nothing could make his hair thicker.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in decades,  love this shampoo</li>
    <li> Works as advertised - excellent product. Paul Mitchell products are all worth the money. Only hair care products we use.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but i feel like i have to use a lot to cover my hair which isn&#x27;t thick. I have dry scalp and had hope this would cure the itch but im not sure its done that. as far as adding volume to my hair i havent noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> GREAT ON COLOR TREATED HAIR.  CONDITIONER IS FANTASTIC AND DOES NOT WEIGH MY HAIR DOWN.  HAVE USED IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IT NEVER LETS ME DOWN.</li>
    <li> This product seems to last - love the smell - will probably keep using with my other shampoo because I like to change products once in awhile.</li>
    <li> Cleans well, feels great while shampooing, no tangling, but I can&#x27;t use it every day due to how drying it is and when I use it, I always follow with lots of conditioner.  Still, my hair looks good if I do follow with a good conditioner, but I&#x27;m still looking for the holy grail of shampoos for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was recommend this shampoo from my friend who is a hair dresser. I only used it a couple times before I threw it out. When shampooing my hair, I could feel my hair getting tangled with this product. Afterwards, it left my hair dried out and will a lot of build up. My scalp would become really itchy after only a couple hours. Also the chemicals in this product are very harsh for your hair.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  Smells good, feels good,  does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  Clean and thicken.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell; only used it a few times thus far and the results after the first bottle will determin is I buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but a small amount makes a good lather.  Smell good, too.  Not sure if it actually thickens.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mostly because it&#x27;s lemon sage and to me that smell is great &amp; invigorating in the morning.  As a shampoo, it lathers just as well as any other shampoo. As far as thickening goes, I don&#x27;t have thinning hair but it is fine and lies pretty flat if I don&#x27;t put some styling product in it. With use of this shampoo I am able to use less styling product and less agressive styling product. It cleans well, lathers well and for me does what it claims with a great smell &amp; experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one drawback for me: if you get it in your eyes it seems to burn significantly more than the average shampoo. So be careful! Otherwise very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo works together with the conditioner and I do not have to wash my hair as often.</li>
    <li> I started to use it after surgery on my forehead couldn&#x27;t use harsh soaps it worked great only thing is now I have to use it everyday . its pricy but almost worth it,</li>
    <li> works great.  my hair is thicker feeling &amp; i&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks!  i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received this product and the bottle was broken open and spilled all over the box.&lt;br /&gt;The item was replaced and came in fine. Now I am being pushed to return an item I can not.&lt;br /&gt;I am being threatened I will get charged for the bottle I could not return.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it makes my scalp itchy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, though honestly with my hair already being thick enough , it has too much volume now haha.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it requires a light amount to actually shampoos all my hair, and as a guy, one squirt on a fingertip is enough for me.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo marketed as &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; that actually seems to work for me.  I have fine, thin hair -- always have.  It&#x27;s even thinner after a couple of surgeries.  Did you know that even simple surgery can result in slight hair loss? I didn&#x27;t.  My hair dresser noticed it and asked what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to apply extra product to get even a little bit of body, but I don&#x27;t need to do that now.  On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being my formerly totally flat hair and 10 being oh, Sophia Loren hair, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m at 5.  (I don&#x27;t expect miracles from a shampoo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is just what it says -- lemon and sage -- and it takes very little to work up a nice lather.  It rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Its been only a couple of washes and i already notice the difference in the texture of my hair,it volumizies your hair in a good way&lt;br /&gt;i dint like the smell though!!&lt;br /&gt;and  a bit pricey for my range but worth every dollar!!</li>
    <li> The thing I love about this is it smells good and makes my thin hair feel thicker without the roughness some shampoos make you feel like you hair is stiff and cores but this make it soft but feel thick at same time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but it really doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It did not add volume or thickened my hair. It made it harder and drier. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells SO refreshing &amp; always feel more refreshed after use :) Although I&#x27;m not sure if I fully notice a thickening difference in my hair (my hair is so thin it&#x27;s hard to say) I have no complaints whatsoever! Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It works very well.  My hair comes out thicker and my scalp clears up from a fungal condition.  And the best thing about it is that it is cruelty free.  Paul Mitchell does not test on animals.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can definitely tell an improvement in my baby-fine naturally curly hair when I use it.</li>
