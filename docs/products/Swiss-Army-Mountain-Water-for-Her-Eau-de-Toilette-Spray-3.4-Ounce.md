Who knew Swiss Army had perfume? Well, when it came, the bottle was very pretty and actually reminiscent of my favorite fragrance that was discontinued. When I first sprayed it, I really liked the smell. But, within 5 minutes it was too strong...and felt like it was getting stronger, and suffocating me with the smell(this is from 1 spray to the wrist).
