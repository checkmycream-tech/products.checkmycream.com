      <li>, all of them are different flavors (except a duplicate &amp;#34;Absinth&amp;#34; flavor), and they&#x27;re all these ridiculously great flavors like Maple Syrup and Candy Cane!</li>
      <li>I like the fact that if I have a smoke burning for more than 30 seconds it goes out.</li>
      <li>but flavor is not that strong during smoking process.</li>
      <li>so much variety &amp; amazing price.</li>

      <li>Best flavored papers and only ones I use other than raw rollings papers</li>

    <li> Papers came on time and they have the greatest mixture of flavors, and most importantly they came in a box i can keep them all together in.</li>
    <li> Papers tend to be stuck together in packs. Wasted papers.</li>
    <li> One day a couple years ago I was looking for wraps on Amazon like all of the paraphernalia I have bought through them. I was looking for Zig Zags and came across Juicy Jays so, I ordered a box of 24 assorted flavored. They are so phenomenal that every couple months I purchase a new box. I&#x27;ve always received a different flavor for each pack. Except for a couple times I got a couple duplicates but, nothing to write home about. Lol! I&#x27;ve been happy with them since my first order to date and hope it continues. I like the fact that if I have a smoke burning for more than 30 seconds it goes out. This way you don&#x27;t burn up a smoke. They are all I buy now.</li>
    <li> SO GOOD! 24 packs with 32 leaves each, all of them are different flavors (except a duplicate &amp;#34;Absinth&amp;#34; flavor), and they&#x27;re all these ridiculously great flavors like Maple Syrup and Candy Cane! Will buy again, once I&#x27;ve run through these.</li>
    <li> Everything  as described</li>
    <li> Best flavored papers and only ones I use other than raw rollings papers</li>
    <li> Burn slow and even which is most important factor but flavor is not that strong during smoking process. You can taste it when you lick the gum.</li>
    <li> When package arrived I was missing 3 packs of papers.... So I&#x27;m missing 12% of my order.</li>
    <li> Just  what i wanted  wrk perfect  great  job</li>
    <li> Needs better quality gum on the papers, hard to get them to stick together, a lot of coming undone after trying to smoke</li>
    <li> so much variety &amp; amazing price. This is why I always order from Juicy Jay&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great deal!! Just as described.</li>
    <li> Great deal for a great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome variety. Only received two doubles. As a primarily paper guy this pack saved me a decent amount of cash. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I only expected to get two or three different kinds. I was pumped when i opened it and got all different kinds. I think i got two banana packs but that&#x27;s it. The only bad thing it takes forever to decide what kind you want to use.</li>
    <li> Love this. Has every flavor and all of them you can mix with others.</li>
