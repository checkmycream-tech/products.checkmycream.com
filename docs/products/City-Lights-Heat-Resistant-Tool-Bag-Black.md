    <li> It holds all of  my most used hair tools. Excellent quality. Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This was a good buy, a little high but just exactly what I needed. Bag exactly as described, love it!</li>
    <li> This bag is great for keeping all your hair products organized.  I use it when I&#x27;m shampooing, blow-drying, and styling my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It holds many combs and brushes.  I like it because I can place the hair oils and other items in the little built in pouches - and they will not spill over</li>
    <li> awesome bag for my daughters supplies for hair school</li>
    <li> I like this bag. It holds a lot  of stuff. I am able to put everything I need in this bag to do my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist I really needed something to carry all my implements for the job. Easy to carry back and from work and home. I can fit a lot and and easy pockets for storing. Makes my life so much more easier and I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Fit all of my tools. The bag was the envy of all of the girls I took cutting class with recently! Great value too!</li>
    <li> Great product and will purchase from again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Bag is truly amazing! I had my doubts that it won&#x27;t carry all my shampoos, conditioners, oils, combs, and hair gel, but everything fit perfectly. I was very impressed. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> It was much smaller than I thought - although seems to be well made it came almost a month and and a half after I ordered it for a Christmas Present. That&#x27;s why it got 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Said I got free shipping for the back-order so I guess that was ok, but I was just bummed that she couldn&#x27;t open it on Xmas day seeing as how it was the main present we got her.</li>
    <li> My husband is a hairstylist and was looking for something to carry his supplies when he was out doing hair. He had looked at this bag at a local beauty supply chain but it was much more costly. He&#x27;s super happy with his bag and we&#x27;ll probably order again.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool bag. I can&#x27;t believe how much it can hold. All my styling and cutting tools with room to spare. Looks so professional and cool. So happy to upgrade from my tote bag to this. I am a mobile stylist and this is so convenient and chic. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this bag!</li>
    <li> This was a Xmas  present for a friend, needless to say it &#x27;s now Jan and I FINALLY RECEIVED IT. I MUST SAY SHE LOVED IT,&lt;br /&gt;because her other carried was falling apart.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this bag!! It holds so much more than you&#x27;d expect. I started a new job so I had to transport a ton of stuff. I was able to fit 14 brushes full size brushes, a blow dryer, 1 inch flat iron, mini flat iron, 1 inch barrel curling iron, mini curling iron, color brushes, clips, a ton of combs and I still had some room if I had to add more! I like the padded strap for carrying, the zipper pocket on the outside for small loose items and the fact that it&#x27;s heat resistant. There&#x27;s also slots on the inside to secure your brushes and irons.</li>
    <li> LOVE this bag. I often take product and tools from the salon to my house or an on site job. It is very sturdy!! I would definitely recomend this case!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy.  Fits all of my tools and includes alot of separate pockets.  It is great for the traveling cosmetologist or cosmo student.</li>
    <li> I was going to get the Hot Tools bag but this one had a strap so I figured it would be better. And it is!! Everyone at school asks me where I got it. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Almost everything fits, which will be helpful until I get a permanent station in the salon.</li>
    <li> This bag is sturdy and holds all of my hair tools, including blow dryer, brushes and curling irons.  I also love that it is heat resistant, so I can travel with my flat iron and curling irons and not have to wait for them to completely cool.</li>
    <li> This bag is exactly like the picture.  The quality is VERY good, and you can gage the size of it by the items in the bag.  Does not have any cover though, so you can&#x27;t really travel with it abroad without everyone seeing the contents.  I think that is the only draw back.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my Sister who is a stylist and she loves it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thought it look small but surprised when everything fits in well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but couldn&#x27;t be a Bigger</li>
    <li> It was bigger than I expected and has worked out wonderfully! I definitely would recommend this bag to hair stylist.</li>
    <li> Looks small when you get it but you can fit a TON inside. Have everything i need in this bag. Great for on site jobs and lugging your stuff around while its still easily accessible. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Like it:)  Good size sturdy bag with a strap.  Holds all my hot tools and a few extra items too.</li>
    <li> As Described, Looks Small, but everything you need to do any type of styling fits perfectly, Thank you</li>
    <li> This bag is amazing! It fits 1 Marcel iron, waver, hair dryer with attachments, 2 straighteners,  duck bill clips, sheer kit, cape, 4 round brushes, all my combs and more. I&#x27;m a cosmo student and it fits in my locker. The strap is comfortable and I can place hot tools in it without worrying!  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Keeps me way organized with all my brushes and hair stuff. Sturdy and durable</li>
    <li> Smaller then expected but awesome</li>
    <li> Perfect case for all my hair tools!</li>
    <li> Does the job. This is my to go beauty salon from home to work daily when i&#x27;m running late.</li>
    <li> The bag was smaller than I expected, but my sister loved the gift and will use it in her travels as a stylist.</li>
    <li> I just got this bag 3 days ago and I love it.  If fit all my tools.  I also like the zipper pocket on the side of the bag. Very sturdy!!!!  Great tool bag for the hair industry!!!!</li>
    <li> This tool bag is the first item I have purchased through amazon..and i love it!!&lt;br /&gt;The tool bag is very spacious all my tools, shears, combs brushes fit perfectly and I still have some room for my capes.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the bag is great..it is very sturdy and very well made.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and and I recommend it to any stylist.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to carry my styling equipment for all of those family and friends house calls. I also used it all through school. Nice bag!</li>
    <li> I do not know how I can live without this bag. I totally love this bag since I do bridal hair and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I love that I don&#x27;t have to pack and unpack anymore. So no more bulky luggage. I only bring the essentials&lt;br /&gt;and it fits everything that I need. It also has specific slots for brushes which you can not see in the picture&lt;br /&gt;that they have posted. So that was a nice surprise. It is also very durable. For the price, this is totally&lt;br /&gt;worth the money! I&#x27;m telling all my hairdresser friends about this bag.</li>
    <li> SO I ordered this hoping that it was going to come between Dec 26- Jan 1.  It ended up coming towards the end of the January.  I understand backordering etc. but I wasn&#x27;t getting any updates.  I emailed a few times and finally after frustration and threatening I would write  a negative review they got back to me and asked to think about writing something negative.  The bag is great and extremely roomy.  I take this on set and throw everything that I need in it.  The negative was just the experience of ordering.</li>
    <li> I just recived my bag in the mail today, I love how much it can hold and how much support it has, but it did come to me ripped by the handle. Really disappointed as i was so excited to get it to care all my supplies from cos school! Other than the rip I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this bag as a gift but when i received it. I was to be disappointed because it just arrived in a bag. If it would have arrived in a box with full details on the product it would have made the product ALOT better. but overall pretty good</li>
    <li> Bought this bag for school and it holds all of my tools nicely. Sturdy &amp; the adjustable strap is nice.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter who is in college and also goes back and forth between home and friends house and also between different bathrooms at home.  She loves it! Holds all of her brushes, curling iron, hair dryer, straightner, and makeup bag, etc.</li>
    <li> Very strong little tool bag.  It has quite a few little holders and compartments.  Can be lightly flattened for travel and bounces back to shape.</li>
    <li> love the bag, very roomy, seems to be able to fit all i need. would highly recommend for fellow licensed cosmetologists.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny wish I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner! Fits so much more then I could imagine I have my blow dryer, Straightener, 4 curling irons, a magic wand, 5 large brushes, 10-15 combs, 10hair clips, scissors,razor, thinning sheers, shampoo cape, tint cape, styling cape, tint bowl, hair spray, mouse, 3 different styling products, hair accessories. So amazing as a cosmetology student I finally wont have to drag a luggage around! To top it off very light on your shoulder easy to carry! So happy that its heat resistant!</li>
    <li> The bag is nice looking, durable and well sized.  I&#x27;m a stylist and I&#x27;m able to carry my tools around comfortably and securely.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend the bag.</li>
    <li> Great product, functional, efficient! I&#x27;ve purchased 2, one for another stylist. She loves it as much as I do</li>
    <li> Love this bag.  It may not look it, but it REALLY does fit all you need to do hair on the go.  Great bag, keeps everything together and organized.  Only one prob, and I am going to contact the seller.  After only two weeks, there is a tear at the seam.  It seems sturdy and I haven&#x27;t overpacked it, but I am hoping the seller will replace it as I really do love it.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece and she seems to like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Pretty good bag, , but I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;m near outgrowing it.  The dimensions are about 12x12x12, excluding the handle, but this isn&#x27;t an official measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Right now I&#x27;m able to carry a full sized dryer, a marcel iron, standard and mini sized flatirons in the heat resistant side. There&#x27;s a pouch on that side of the bag for each tool, but I keep my dryer in the open section of that side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the opposite side, I&#x27;m able to accommodate a paddle brush, a big finishing brush, a Denman, and a water bottle.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll drop a cape and apron there as well. There are bands to hold the brushes in place,  but are too big to secure the brush handles, but too small to accommodate large brushes,  so I usually just stand my brushes up unsecured.  On this side there&#x27;s a zippered pocket where I store my shear case and combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perpendicular (Or is opposing more accurate?) sides consist of two decent sized pouches, I have a nearly 3 inch round brush in on pouch,  and a smaller in the pouch.  The last side has two very small slots,  where I slip a pen or marker, or a few clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As pictured, there&#x27;s a handle on top,  and an adjustable shoulder strap with light padding in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  it has been holding up very well for me, hardly any signs of wear on the exterior.  It&#x27;s comfortable to carry both by hand or on my shoulder.  My only gripe is that I need space for a few more brushes. If this came in a larger size,  I&#x27;d snap it right up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love its perfect!</li>
    <li> bigger than I thought  Holds everything you need!</li>
    <li> The wife loves it, high quality for a good price</li>
    <li> My Mom loves this bag, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Upon opening this I was concerned that all of my equipmet would not fit in one small bag.  I was wrong, it is perfect!  I have a blowdryer, 2 curling irons, a flat iron, a curling wand, scissor case (holds 8 scissors), numerous brushes &amp; combs all in this bag with plenty of room to spare.  The fact that it is heat resistant is one of my favorite parts.  I finish up at work &amp; put my hot irons straight in the bag!!!  I have always transported my equipment back &amp; forth from the salon but in a much larger rolling suitcase.  This is smaller, less bulky, lighter &amp; very organized.  After being a hairdresser for 20 years I can honestly say this is the best bag I have ever come across!!!!</li>
