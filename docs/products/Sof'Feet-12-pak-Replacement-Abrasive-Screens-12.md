      <li>what a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>However, I was wondering if a power sander would be more efficient?</li>
      <li>Would be better to buy one at Home Depot and cut it yourself.</li>

      <li>The scraper does a great job of scraping off dead skin from your feet, leaving them soft and pretty.  </li>
      <li>Certainly that is something you would have to decide for yourself.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the many reasons my heels are so rough.</li>

      <li>It could be that this product is much too convenient for the callus-conscious individual and paying around $1 per sheet makes sense versus paying three (3) cents per sheet using the D.I.Y method.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Having used the Sof&#x27;feet abrasive screens for a number of years, I can honestly say that they are worth every penny. Used regularly with a good moisturizer my feet look and feel great!!!!!</li>
    <li> The scraper does a great job of scraping off dead skin from your feet, leaving them soft and pretty.  It really helped when I had a huge blister from new hiking shoes.  Scraping the dead, hardened skin allowed the blistered area to heal much faster.  The replacement screens are easy to install.  A great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best calus re mover to ever hit the market.  These refills are priced way below the market price.  Awesome product great ror men and women,  no harsh cutting just continued sanding like you walked the beach for weeks</li>
    <li> Takes care of much of calloused feet.</li>
    <li> Great product, the only thing that actually works on my feet. lol.</li>
    <li> ...because it fits the marvelous Sof’Feet Callous Remover, which I would give 10 stars to if I could! :)! Keep them on hand!</li>
    <li> I love the Sof&#x27;Feet Abrasive tool!  Makes your feet so soft.  I have plaque psoriasis on my feet. My husband also uses this on his rough heels. Much more budget friendly than other tools I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Item as expected. Replacement screens for the best foot softener and callous remover out there!</li>
    <li> I tried to be cheap and read a review that said to buy dry wall one hundred something grit instead of these. I bought it on amazon for a few dollars but it wasn&#x27;t the same. It was a sanding paper so now I wasted $3 and end up buying this. Each screen might last longer than 4-5 uses depending on how bad your feet are.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over 10 years and have replaced the screens periodically. This works better than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever had and if you use it regularly you won&#x27;t have to get a pedicure!</li>
    <li> This is a very useful item to keep your feet from dry rough bottom and sides in check.&lt;br /&gt;Been used a lot in dry weather.</li>
    <li> I have VERY ticklish feet, so pedicures are more torture than relaxing for me. I love that in less than 5 mins I can have baby soft feet from the comfort of my own home. No soaking or special creams needed. I usually do the scrubbing before a shower. Seriously the best pedicure system I have ever used. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the job as advertised.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my husband&#x27;s feet.  Better than those found in local stores on his callous&#x27;s.  Will order replacements again.</li>
    <li> The Sof&#x27;Feet scrubbing tool is an awesome tool to keep your feet smooth. Keep a pack of replacement screens on hand so you don&#x27;t run out. I also switch out the screen to share the tool with another family member.</li>
    <li> this will get the roughness off your feet!  It works good on mine, better than anything else I have tried.  Give it a TRY YOU WILL LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for keeping my summer feet nice and soft!  use on dry feet all summer.  good to have refills.</li>
    <li> what a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Great little tool!  gets rid of callouses easily and effectively and you can order replacement screens...wow!</li>
    <li> Great replacement screens for the Sof&#x27;Feet handle!</li>
    <li> Great product for people who absolutely hate to wear socks or slippers inside the house. This is for the hardworking man or woman who can&#x27;t stop and look for shoes when we can just walk on the gravel or sand to chase the neighbor&#x27;s dogs away or get a package from the UPS man. My UPS man honks his horn and expects me to be right there when he opens the door. This is one of the many reasons my heels are so rough. Definitely not a product for the tender-foot.</li>
    <li> Have had my sof&#x27;feet foot for years and love it.  The screens were a replacement as I cannot find this product locally.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever reviewed.  It is softens and clean away dry, dead skin in minutes.  I LOVE IT!  I would recommend it to everyone with feet.</li>
    <li> These mesh refill screens are great for the money. -Meech</li>
    <li> So very pleased to have found this product. Nothing works better on calloused feet.</li>
    <li> This has been my savior to dry feet, it works like a miracle getting that nasty skin off n my feet feel so soft an wonderful afterwards, I have re ordered this so many times I can&#x27;t keep count, I hope they never stop making this I don&#x27;t know what I will do  ;(....arrives quickly also I was surprised really how fast I got it...</li>
    <li> These are replacement screens for the soft feet callus reducer. It extremely easy to removed the spent screen and replace it with the new one. I use to use a razor blade to removed the dried rough skin from my heels. I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon because I prefer to use this because I no longer have to fear cutting myself and it keeps my heels very soft.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> These are the best things since sliced bread. My feet are always in tip top shape because of these screens. No pain and an easy after bath scruff and I don&#x27;t worry about my feet at any time of the year.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Softfeet Callus Reducer and they are easy to replace.</li>
    <li> The Sof&#x27;Feet screens work VERY well! I have tried several products but prefer this over all the rest. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this but figured what the heck.  They turned out to be just perfect and easy to use and replace.  Quite a bargain for the price and they really work.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I &#x27;ve worked on my feet for over 43 years . this is the only thing that has worked for my calluses!!!</li>
    <li> What more can I say! However, I was wondering if a power sander would be more efficient? Well the manual method works O.K. and is probably more safe. Oh don&#x27;t use this with wet feet and don&#x27;t use a power sander in the tub.</li>
    <li> So, I have the sof&#x27; feet thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needed replacement screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bam! My feet are softer.</li>
    <li> If you use a callus remover that uses these kinds of screens, save some cash. Take one of your small screens over to Home Depot or somesuch, go to the rental tool department, and compare it with the large square or circular sheets of sanding screen sold for floor sanders. It&#x27;s the same stuff! Find the same grit, buy one sheet, use an old pair of scissors to cut a heap &#x27;o replacement screens. Way cheap. It&#x27;ll probably ruin the scissors (I favor the $1 ones from Harbor Freight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my Sof&#x27;Feet from FootSmart. That retailer gets two stars. They screwed up the order pretty badly, but did give me a credit without much fuss.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER used a product that works as well as this one is advertised.  My heels have never been so smooth and it takes less than a minute of mine time to get them that way!  If you have calluses this product works.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Keeps my feet smooth!!</li>
    <li> Money well spent!  Just apply a little elbow grease with it and your feet will be baby soft.  These are refills so make sure you purchase the handle to go with it.</li>
    <li> If your willing to keep up a routine of using this, then it will work. If you wait too long between uses then the callous will just start to build right back up again. If you are patient enough, you will start to see results.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these. It&#x27;s the best thing ever to remove calluses (they are refills for the actual handle you buy separately). What a relief. Please don&#x27;t ever go out of business Sof&#x27;Feet!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the screens, but if you&#x27;re worried about saving your pennies as I am, another poster mentioned buying sandpaper of the same grit from Home Depot. It&#x27;s much cheaper. :)</li>
    <li> These were purchased for my husband&#x27;s dry feet.  We have tried a lot of different products for his dry feet and nothing has worked quite like this.  These work great and have helped make my husbands feet smooth.  Just don&#x27;t use it on wet feet.....it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> They are nothing more than drywall sandpaper cut up. Would be better to buy one at Home Depot and cut it yourself. Too abrasive and I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Screens work fine on calluses. I have used these screens before and they do a good job. basically I am satisfied</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I have used them for four years now and have also purchased several for gifts.  I won&#x27;t go back to using any other product.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. These screens work without tearing up your feet. Gets rid of all the dead skin leaving my feet very smooth like I just stepped out of the pedicure salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this a long time ago and instill have a lot of them...very worth to buy...my mother tried this and she asked me to buy her one of this too...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet..but I bought so I&#x27;d have when needed for my Sof&#x27;feet Callus Reducer Kit.  The callus reducer is amazing.  My mom bought one after seeing and hearing me rave about mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is well worth the cost.  Great product -- no bull!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no question, I have not found a better solution for \\&quot;safely and effectively\\&quot; sanding away calluses than the Sof Feet Callus Reducer. These replacement screens are also VERY CONVENIENT.  A little tip:  when using the screens, don&#x27;t forget to turn them over - they actually have grit on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, purchasing 12 of these screens for the current price of just under $11 couldn&#x27;t be more convenient. However, you may want to ask yourself if they are cost effective.  Certainly that is something you would have to decide for yourself.  (BTW, keep in mind that despite the description, these sheets are actually 1.5\\&quot; x 4\\&quot; in size.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just so happens that an experienced drywall installer would NOT be able to distinguish between the material these replacement sheets are made of and your run-of-the-mill 100 grit silicone carbide drywall sanding screen readily available at any home improvement store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An experienced drywall installer would say to themselves, \\&quot;Gee, you can purchase the Gator Pack of 50 sheets (sized 4.25\\&quot; x 11.25\\&quot;) of 100 grit silicone carbide drywall sanding screen at the local home improvement store and use a pair of dollar store kitchen shears to cut each sheet into seven (7) sheets of this size, thus yielding three hundred fifty (350) sheets at a total cost of less than $10\\&quot;  (Experienced drywall installers can be clever!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, you have to keep in mind that convenience is the key here as you compare these 12 sheets for just under $11 versus 350 sheets of the what would appear to be the identical material for under $10.  It could be that this product is much too convenient for the callus-conscious individual and paying around $1 per sheet makes sense versus paying three (3) cents per sheet using the D.I.Y method.  Besides, who has time to sit around and cut-out 350 pieces of drywall sanding screen?</li>
