      <li>I use this product  love the way  it smells, feels so soft and has that smooth feeling that last love it.</li>
      <li>, I had to wash it out right after I put it on.</li>
      <li>it dint make my hair grow,and i did finish the jar,i switched to using castor oil which made a difference,this was not worth the money at all,if it was even moisturizing my hair or smelt good</li>
      <li>Green Magic truly delivers fast healthy hair growth.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it after that first time</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really say if it works for hair growth.</li>
      <li>THANKS VERY</li>
      <li>VERY</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s Ma king my hair grow.</li>
      <li>However, it has a murky avocado-and-spinach sort of smell, and its very greasy.</li>

      <li>Really works...</li>
      <li>And it also makes the hair freely really greasy.</li>

      <li>,good ingredients but the formulation does not work,i have thick hair and if your hair is fine,it will be like adding vaseline mixed with putty,i dont recommend at all.</li>
      <li>However, it DOES make my hair very soft and keeps my scalp moisturized.</li>
      <li>, the customer service isn&#x27;t professional at all!</li>
      <li>Look for other cheaper and better smelling hair thickeners - they&#x27;re definitely out there.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my natural hair greasy.</li>
      <li>was surprised..</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and mananageable.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and quite manageable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not notice much of a growth to my hair. And it also makes the hair freely really greasy.</li>
    <li> Lovely product in that it softened my hair and surprisingly did not irritate my scalp. I can&#x27;t speak to the new growth but I remember shedding a lot.</li>
    <li> This product DID NOT work for me at all. I used it for a little bit over a month and saw no improvement in my growth. I used it every day and sometimes if my hair got too greasy I switched to every other day. The smell is also really bad if you are straightening your hair. It had my hair smelling like rubber once I straightened it. It got so bad I had to just wash it out. Now it just sits in my cabinet. It was a big waste of money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice product but w all honesty I didn&#x27;t see yet the big difference .. But what I can say my hair very soft and they have very healthy look..I love the smell... But If u take some pills like biotin do not use ! What I didn&#x27;t like  Very difficult to wash the hair after the mask.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little of a week, or so but the one thing that I love and notice about this product is that it has a lot of product comes in this jar, too the smell is clean and not over powering and it doesn&#x27;t make my natural hair greasy. I will reorder this product again just to see if its promotes hair growth.</li>
    <li> Really works...this is a coming from a middle aged man who had a serious bald spot..was surprised..but it&#x27;s really worth it..</li>
    <li> It stinks so bad also turn any Silva jewelry black</li>
    <li> This product is a little too greasy,but it does smell good,and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how my scalp feels, I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair fell out last year and I needed some help getting it to grow back stronger. The smell isn&#x27;t too overbearing and it did wonders for my hair. My hair already looks shinier and healthier. I did take out a star because I haven&#x27;t quite noticed any hair growth yet, but my hair definitely looks healthier.</li>
    <li> 8/6/15  I love it I saw some new growth in the front of the my face.  this is a great product. LOVE IT !!!!</li>
    <li> I did not see any significant hair growth with this product.</li>
    <li> THANKS VERY THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL NICE AND SOFT AND HELPS TO DETANGLE IT. I ONLY USE IT TWICE A WEEK BUT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PROGRESS OF HOW IT MAKES MY HAIR FEELS AND FOR ME  IT IS NOT VERY OILY. THANKS FOR A NICE PRODUCT. WITH SUCH LITTLE USE THIS JAR WILL PROBABLY LAST FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> I ordered this around July 2, 2013 to use on my bald spots (temples) and it has delivered.  My formerly bald spots have grown in hair and both sides long enough to plait.  I don&#x27;t ususally write reviews but if a product is really good, I will chime in with my opinion.  Also, the smell is noticeable but not bad.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to grow their hair longer.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a week ago so I can&#x27;t really say if it works for hair growth. However, it DOES make my hair very soft and keeps my scalp moisturized. And I LOVE the smell. After a month I will edit my review and give my opinion on the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Made hair thinner. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> My hair is natural so I&#x27;m always looking for products to keep it healthy.  Green Magic smells so good and make my hair feel so soft, I&#x27;m loving it...I&#x27;ve only used it a week but so far so good!!</li>
    <li> I tink pretty good hair growth included 2</li>
    <li> This one I believe gave me faster growth than the oil. I haven&#x27;t been using the oil for too long, so I can&#x27;t say, but I noticed my hair grew a bit faster with the cream. It also has a foul smell. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger if you refrigerate it.</li>
    <li> I have to try it again to see expected improvement.</li>
    <li> this I alternate with the liguid gold oil and it seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> Great product, however, if you are allergic to suffer, be careful!  But this product is great and it works fast.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair greasy with only a little bit. Wont purchase again</li>
    <li> Not worth your money.</li>
    <li> After three weeks of usage this product made the hair around my temples thinner. The good reviews must be fake. It is thick and nasty with oil separating from it. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!, The smell was mild and I didn&#x27;t find it greasy at all.  It really made my hair soft.  Not sure about the growth aspects yet but I am hopeful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Made my hair grow thicker and much faster. However, it has a murky avocado-and-spinach sort of smell, and its very greasy. Look for other cheaper and better smelling hair thickeners - they&#x27;re definitely out there.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with how it worked! My daughter who went natural has taken over using it, might need to make another order!!</li>
    <li> very smooth, nice scent. I have seen new growth coming in since I bought this item. Definitely recommend it to others</li>
    <li> Heavy sulfer scent..alot comes in the jar. Been using for a yr and have not noticed faster growth but im going to keep using. I stopped because i wasnt following the directions.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all didn&#x27;t notice any hair growth.</li>
    <li> This was sticky and hard to use,like a paste not a cream,i just found it unpleasant to use and it dint make my hair grow,and i did finish the jar,i switched to using castor oil which made a difference,this was not worth the money at all,if it was even moisturizing my hair or smelt good i would have added a few more stars at least for that,good ingredients but the formulation does not work,i have thick hair and if your hair is fine,it will be like adding vaseline mixed with putty,i dont recommend at all.</li>
    <li> The smell was so potent it made me nauseous and gave me a headache, I had to wash it out right after I put it on. The consistency was like clay and made my hair feel dry and heavy, it also made my scalp itch.I haven&#x27;t used it after that first time and I won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good product for those wanting to help with hair growth.  Works best for those with natural hair that has not been processed.  Otherwise, there is a two week before and after chemical service wait.</li>
    <li> loved this item I need a refill</li>
    <li> I use this product  love the way  it smells, feels so soft and has that smooth feeling that last love it.</li>
    <li> Wish container was bigger but use wisely this cream is thick and only a palm full is needed. But works well!</li>
    <li> I like the performance it gives my hair. It&#x27;s very lite not heavy and greasy and want leave you hair feeling dry.</li>
    <li> Green Magic truly delivers fast healthy hair growth. I saw noticeable results in two weeks. Also, it does a good job keeping my scalp and hair healthy. I have made this my main hair growth product in my hair regimen. In the past, I&#x27;ve used Komaza Hair Care \\&quot;Stinky Stuff\\&quot; hair growth serum version 1 and 2 and Hair Trigger Growth Elixir and Gro-Aut hair growth oil all of which produced false advertised results; that is to say, no additional hair growth than normal. Green Magic Hair Growth cream is a definite a must have. A little goes a long way. Caution: Contains sulfur! If you are allergic to sulfur, do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> It really is greasy even with a very light hand. Nice fragrance. Not too strong. It is heavy on the strands but makes a nice twist or braid out. Ive been using it two weeks so can&#x27;t speak on the growth benefits.    EDIT: After using for six weeks there&#x27;s no noticeable difference in growth. However, its great in helping dentangle dry hair and it increased density.    Use it sparingly to minimize readiness. Consistency is like paste. Soft fragrance with slight sulfur undertones.</li>
    <li> The product is greasy. I straighten my hair often and I don&#x27;t want have it weighed down by grease. As for the smell, it seems like they are trying to mask the sulfur with something which creates this extremely potent smell. The horrid smell sticks to EVERYTHING. I had to wash my pillow cases every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the customer service isn&#x27;t professional at all! They&#x27;re liars!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t generate any hair growth and my scalp feels dry shortly after I use it.</li>
    <li> This product might work for others but it did nothing for my hair at all. Used it for a month with no results!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s Ma king my hair grow. It doesn&#x27;t smell to good either,  but that would not matter if it worked.</li>
    <li> Terrible. The produce had zero effect on my hair besides making it smell bad. The produce smells Terrible.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but I have only been using it for three weeks and In three weeks I received an inch of growth! I was so excited..I will keep using it until I reach my hair goal...things to know though...it smells really good but it may cause shedding..but I would definitely recomend it.</li>
    <li> Love this growth cream but its not as good as the oil.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know if it works though..</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this hair product to anyone. I dont see any change in my hair growth. Someone is making this hair product out of ther kitchen, which you can do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This product has been great to my natural hair. Noticeable growth and texture improvement.</li>
    <li> I just began using this product so I don&#x27;t know how it works yet but the aroma of it is great.  It makes my hair so soft and mananageable.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soft and quite manageable. the smell is quite pleasant also and it does as it advertise my hair has grown tremendously because of this wonderful product.</li>
