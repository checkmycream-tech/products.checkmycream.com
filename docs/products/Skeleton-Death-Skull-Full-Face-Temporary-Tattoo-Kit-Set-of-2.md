      <li>This facial tattoo is excellent.</li>

      <li>got many complements on the final product!</li>
      <li>He received many compliments on it, as when properly appied it looks like it is painted.  </li>
      <li>Tattoo was not dark enough to use alone, good if you want to use as an outline to paint darker lines and shading, I am a girl so the tattoo was to large for my face and had to cut out, not use some parts.</li>
      <li>The good news is that it arrived early enough that I was able to find out that it was too much trouble to do again.</li>
      <li>and I really appreciate it.</li>
      <li>I cut around the different areas of the tattoo to make it fit well on my face.</li>
      <li>Would have bee better to be broken up for better placement.</li>
      <li>*** out of the littles and the older students</li>
      <li>Then it made my whole face red after I removed it with the baby oil and water</li>
      <li>After application, I drew in between the tattoo sections with a white face crayon and over the actual tattoo with a black face crayon to really make it stand out.</li>

    <li> This facial tattoo is excellent. I cut around the different areas of the tattoo to make it fit well on my face. I dabbed white makeup in the inbetween areas. Takes about 30 minutes to apply and remove with adhesive remover and soap. Patience is a must when applying this. I would definitely recommend this if you are going for a skeleton costume.</li>
    <li> Awesome...  Looked really good. Got a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not come out perfect and had to use black eyeliner to perfect a few areas...</li>
    <li> This turned out great for my teenage boys - they loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teacher. Dressed for middle school halloween party. I scared the s*** out of the littles and the older students thought I looked awesome. Win win. Hard to apply. I had to cut the skeleton face into sections to put on. Thank goodness they give you two face tattoos incase you mess up, and you will. After application, I drew in between the tattoo sections with a white face crayon and over the actual tattoo with a black face crayon to really make it stand out. Oh I stood out. Fun and scary. Came off with rubbing alcohol and make-up remover.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it.  Instructions are almost non-existent.</li>
    <li> it was awesome and i loved it i will buy more in the future because its a great product as well</li>
    <li> I was accidentally sent the wrong product but the seller made it right and I really appreciate it. The tattoos, which I will use for our All Souls Procession, look amazingly real and the instructions are good and easy to understand.</li>

    <li> Got this for my daughter for halloween......it worked out perfectly. So easy and awesome looking. Would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tattoo was not dark enough to use alone, good if you want to use as an outline to paint darker lines and shading, I am a girl so the tattoo was to large for my face and had to cut out, not use some parts.</li>
    <li> Frustrating application process. You&#x27;ll never look as good as the guy on the package - with the tattoo that is.</li>
    <li> Did not look like the picture ! Then it made my whole face red after I removed it with the baby oil and water</li>
    <li> This worked awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and within 3 days I had it. It was packaged well and not bent at all. I look forward to using it. I will post pictures</li>
    <li> One piece tattoo that had to be placed over entire face. Would have bee better to be broken up for better placement.</li>
    <li> Great detail, but you will need to cut it into sections to get it on perfectly. Also, have some black and white eyeliner to fill in some areas. Very hard to take off--but stays on perfect the whole day at least!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good detail&lt;br /&gt;-Great price&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to take off/apply&lt;br /&gt;-Need black and white application makeup/paint to tune it up</li>
    <li> My husband wore this tattoo for a day of the dead look.  When applied it looks FANTASTIC!!  He received many compliments on it, as when properly appied it looks like it is painted.  Plan on an hour to apply, and use baby oil to remove.</li>
    <li> Wow! looked awesome for an adventure run I did.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it for Halloween.  Little hard to take off, but I&#x27;m sure I will find better ways after a few uses.  Totally will buy again.  Way better than my efforts to make skull face.  The best part is nothing plastic needs to be glued to my face.</li>
    <li> This looked so simple but it wasn&#x27;t. You still had to do a lot of shading and try to soften the lines. Not for the novice makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Excellent received in Good condition</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Hard to get off but if it wasn&#x27;t then it would have wiped off.</li>
