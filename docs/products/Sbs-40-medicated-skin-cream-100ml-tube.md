      <li>Glad to find it again.</li>

      <li>I was so glad to find such a wonderful, useful product.</li>
      <li>If your skin is sensitive oil based products, this is great.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh smell.</li>
      <li>On a ski trip a friend introduced us to this fine product.</li>
      <li>I was using it to be frugal and to multi-task (it was provided free in a dispenser on the wall</li>

      <li>The smell is no worse than some of the perfumed skin creams that most women use, IMHO</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I live in the midwest, and we use this (or a variant of it, SBS-41) at work to repel the gnats that are everywhere in the spring. They HATE the smell - my theory is that it is the isopropyl palmitate in it (we use a complete different oil that works as well, and the only common ingredient is that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also quite good as a lotion :)</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  I used to have it at work, so I knew it was a good item.  A bit expensive, but, as they say--you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for years, works great and no scent to make me wheeze.  In winter I use it to shave my legs.  Great for an asthma sufferer, allergic to fragrance.  Product was shipped quickly and packed well.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> SBS 40 was provided by my employer when I was working and, since I&#x27;ve retired, I was happy to find it available for purchase through Amazon.com. Works well on working man&#x27;s (or in this case... retired man&#x27;s) hands and face!</li>
    <li> I first used this over 30 years ago when it was owned by Jergens.  I worked in a chemical factory and my hands were in weak acid all day.  This stuff worked better than anything I have used before or since.  I hear women say that it smells bad.  Most men I have talked to don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> For anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it, SBS 40 Medicated hand cream is a great non-greasy skin product for chapped or rough skin. It also helps rosacea, dermatitis and other skin problems. You won&#x27;t find anything like this on the drug store shelf.</li>
    <li> My son has TERRIBLE eczema and I&#x27;ve tried it all, including prescription steroids to keep it under control.  This is miracle cream in a tube.  It&#x27;s the only lotion that seems to protect and heal the skin at the same time control the itchiness (how do you convince a 3 year old not to scratch?).  I agree with another review - this product is very underrated.</li>
    <li> I used this while undergoing radiation treatments. I didn&#x27;t start it until halfway through my 36 treatments but my skin was healed before my treatments were complete.  My doctors were amazed and I was happy!  It&#x27;s a miracle lotion!</li>
    <li> I am an AK amputee and use SBS 40 every day on my residual limb.  SBS 40 has kept my stump in great shape and I highly reccomend it. I use it everyday before puting on my prosthetic and again at the end of the day after taking it off. I have never had an infection and the healing/rejuvination properties of SBS 40 are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I sent this product back after one use.  I couldn&#x27;t get the smell off my hands and no matter what the good properties of it were, there was no way I&#x27;d ever be able to stand the smell of it on me.  Blech.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, I love it.  And buy regularly.</li>
    <li> I work outside and in Indiana in the winter time it gets relly cold. Your hands take a beating and dry up. I use this to prevent my hands from bleeding. I love this product and would recommmend to anyone.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this stuff. It was available when I worked in a paper mill, where your hands get wet and chapped easily. Since leaving there, I wanted some for my personal use at home, especially in the winter. Great stuff and does not leave your hands feeling greasy and/or perfumed.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective product.  I rely on it to keep my hands in god working order as I use them a lot.</li>
    <li> this product is very good ... not only does it do as promised but my skin is softer and the effects last the entire day , have tried others and this cream not only relieves guickly but the effects last ...</li>
    <li> My wife and I raise Alpacas and we work with our hands a lot in all kinds of weather. This the best stuff we have found to stop all the skin cracking that happens in all kinds of weather.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0006GDATQ SBS 40 MEDICATED SKIN CREAM 5 OZ TUBE]]  I&#x27;ve worked in the Water and Wastewater field for almost 40 years and have always had problems keeping my hands from cracking, splitting in the knuckle area and the constant roughness. I&#x27;ve tried countless brands of creams and lotions and then discoverd the SBS 40.  This cream has worked miracles!  I purchased enough for all my employees and they feel the same way.  Many of them work with harsh chemicals that, in spite of gloves, still have adversely affected their hands.  They love it too!  Number one in our opinion!</li>
    <li> One of the best hand creams I have every used.  Have recommended to many others.  Leaves no grease residue and is absorbed into the skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Best skin cream that I have found to clean up after wrenching on the Harley or under the hood of the car! The grime wipes off without water and leaves your hands feeling soft. Seems to help prevent infections in all the nicks and cuts that you normally get from wrenching.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best hand lotion I/ we&#x27;ve (my wife and I) have ever used. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it absorbs quickly. My work supplied it for me because of my job dries out my hands so I wanted to find it to use at home. I could only find it online. I will keep using this until they quit making it.</li>
    <li> I needed a lotion that would work on both the cracks in my feet and my hands. I work in a deli and my hands see a lot of dish water with extremely harsh soaps. Needless to say that my hands would crack and turn very red. The SBS 40 Medicated lotion healed up my hands better that any other lotion that I tried, so, I decided to try it on my feet and it worked equally as well. Good stuff and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the same problem with red, cracked and swollen skin.</li>
    <li> Although I initially gave this product only 3 stars because I was charged postage on what was supposed to be free shipping, I received a contact from the company immediately. They refunded the postage amount.....it doesn&#x27;t appear that they know why I was charged either. I would order from them again. And I still love the product....it worked better than prescription cremes for a severe allergic reaction to a prescription drug. By the way, I see several posts about it smelling bad....I really don&#x27;t think it has much smell and when you find something that works as well as this does, a slight odor is pretty darned minor.</li>
    <li> My dad used to get this when he worked at GE, I have never used a lotion that worked as well.  It does have a unique smell that I have grown to like but it is unpleasant at first.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Nothing works better to heal cuts and scratches on my diabetic skin.</li>
    <li> I worked In maintenance at GE for thirty Years and washed my hands sometimes 15 times a day with harsh cleansers that would cut heavy grease and oils. It would reek havoc on my skin. I had a locker full of hand creams but nothing was helping. General Electric kept this in the rest rooms by the wash basins after another maintenance guy saw my hands he told me to start using the SB40 in no time my hands were softer than my stay at home wife&#x27;s! I have retired and am getting ready to reorder. After over thirty years of using this I can assure you there is nothing better than SB40!  P.S. I never objected or noticed the smell!</li>
    <li> My husband was bringing this hand cream home from his work for years for me. I became very spoiled because the cream is non-greasy and soaks right in to my very dry skin. He had to stop bringing the cream home and I tried other creams. Most are sooo.. greasy and have some fruity, perfumy,nasty smell. This cream has very little, if any odor. My nose is very sensitive to smell. I am so glad I was able to order this lotion on Amazon. Thank You</li>
    <li> SBS40 is an excellent hand cream for rough hands and has kept the dry Arizona air from cracking my hands quite well.</li>
    <li> Every winter here in the rust belt, my hands turn into dried out, chapped, cracked and painful monster claws. And every winter, I search high and lo for that hand cream that will restore them back to humanity.  This cream is the absolute BEST I have ever used.  It has a decent smell, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and, with every day use, has superbly shielded my skin from these arctic blasts that has swept thru my area.  I highly recommend that you give it a whirl .... your hands will love you!</li>
    <li> this product is the best.i use this product all winter.i am a truck driver and the salt and winter conditions dry out my hands big time  i recommend this stuff to everyone i know.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  The only product we have found that is helping my husbands chapped and rough hands.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this skin cream and hates to use anything else. For him it&#x27;s about the way it absorbs without having that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> SBS 40 works great on atheletes foot rash and jock itch. I have found it to work better than products actually made for these problems.</li>
    <li> I used to work out in the cold, and between working with chemicals and washing my hands frequently, my hands would dry and chap really bad. I&#x27;m talking about sandpaper skin and split, bleeding knuckles that burn and sting at the bend of a finger. I tried every lotion and skin cream I could get my hands on, and they really didn&#x27;t do anything. They were just greasy and wouldn&#x27;t even absorb into the skin much, but rather after rubbing it in forever, you would lose most of it the very next time you wash your hands. A friends father who is a machinist gave me a tube of SBS-40 to try, and with one application my skin was hydrated and flexible, and I could make fists without any pain or further tearing of the skin. It absorbs into the skin quickly, and remains effective even after washing your hands once or twice. With continued use it even seemed to speed up the healing process. This year, at the first sign of dry skin, I ordered SBS-40 from Amazon, and with one, maybe two applications a day (depending on conditions), I completely avoided dry hands through the rest of winter. Anyone who complains about the smell of it is basically complaining that it&#x27;s not fragrant. The smell is not so bad at all. Many women probably would hate the smell, but most men wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery; Recommend this product to other chemists and technicians who wash their hands frequently.  The product soaks right into dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have been using it for years. I had a friend share her secret about hand care lotion with me and I have been using it ever since. I wash my hands a lot and needed something that works but didn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> It worked out really well. I purchased it for a friend on contract in Afghanistan. He complained about the water causing his hand to become really dry and cracked; making them hurt from the blisters that soon formed as a result. He started using this product and it really works for him.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re having a beautiful summer in northern Illinois - but the gnats are driving us, well, buggy.  We spent last weekend at Apple River Canyon State Park near Galena for our first camp-out of the summer.  On arrival we were greeted by the usual swarm of gnats - in our ears, up our noses, in our eyes - if you live where there are gnats you know what I mean.  I immediately broke out the Deep Woods Off and sprayed my wife and myself.  Nothing - the gnats were just as terrible as before.  We have those little battery operated fan Off devices that you clip onto your clothing, so we each got one out and fired it up.  The gnats didn&#x27;t seem to mind at all.  Then my wife told me that our son-in-law had given her some of this Deb lotion and everyone where he works says it makes a great bug repellant.  I was highly skeptical - my experience has always been that this sort of word-of-mouth advice never really pans out.  But by now the gnats were ready to drive us out of the park, so we each squeezed out a dab of this stuff, squished it in our hands and rubbed it lightly onto our faces and necks and brushed our hands through our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gnats were gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really couldn&#x27;t believe it - it&#x27;s not like this stuff just helped a bit - as long as we had it on those gnats didn&#x27;t come anywhere near us!  I was jaw-dropping amazed.  Over the weekend we found that we&#x27;d have to re-apply about every eight hours or so, but this stuff literally saved our weekend vacation.  It&#x27;s supposed to have the same effect against mosquitoes and all sorts of noseeums, but gnats were the only annoyance this time out, so that&#x27;s all I can attest to at this time.  I have no idea how good it is as a lotion, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter - this stuff is going with us on every camping trip, hiking adventure or other outdoor activity from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it several times over the weekend.  When it wore off I&#x27;d try the Off products occasionally to see if it was just a fluke, but no - the Off stuff (which is Deet) simply would not keep the gnats away.  But pat a little Deb on and you wouldn&#x27;t see, hear or feel another gnat for hours.  If word of this ever gets around it could put the makers of Off out of business.  I&#x27;m hoping like anything it will have the same effect against mosquitoes.- the Off stuff (which is Deet) simply would not keep the gnats away.  But pat a little Deb on and you wouldn&#x27;t see, hear or feel another gnat for hours.  If word of this ever gets around it could put the makers of Off out of business.

    <li> Best hand cream ever dries quickly and is not greasy</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry cracked hands. It has made a huge difference in the look of my dry cracked hands.</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this to me and I tried it but for me Vaseline works just as well and doesn&#x27;t cost half as much.</li>
    <li> It is the product I expected and received in a timely fashion.  It is very good.  My husband has very dry hands from his job as a letter carrier and this product has helped them a lot.</li>
    <li> I love This cream.  I used this year&#x27;s ago. This works great for sunburn and dry skin.</li>
    <li> It was just like the old SBS40 medicated creme I had used before. It heals very well.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because the healing isn&#x27;t over night but takes awhile. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> The cream is amazing. What caught my attention was the testimony to helping eczema. I bought several prescription creams including steroids and nothing would completely clear it. Since I&#x27;ve been using SBS 40, I have not had any breakouts, the itching has stopped, and I don&#x27;t have open cuts. My husband uses it at work and has to sanitize his hands constantly and swears by SBS40. I am a believer. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it is not an overpowering smell that is real noticeable.</li>
    <li> This cream  works for dry skin. I first learned of it from work. Later heard about it by word of mouth.Why? Because it really works.</li>
    <li> My father has used this cream for over 30+ years.  He used to get it at work.  It takes the heat right out of any sunburn, no matter how bad.  It is better than the aloe lotion they sell, or the solarcane spray.  I always use after any sunburn and I have never peeled either.  If you use it every day after you burn, then your skin should heal and not peel.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great for new tattoos.</li>
    <li> On a ski trip a friend introduced us to this fine product. After returning home I ordered some more for us. It has a nice fresh smell. No foo-foo fragrance. It leaves your skin nice &amp; smooth. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this skin cream for 5+ years. I work with my hands alot, i am a metal fab specialist with my employer, after several days of my hands being exposed to harsh materials, they begin to crack/split and then bleed. After several applications of this hand cream my hands start to heal rather quickly, and smooth to the touch, it does not leave any kind of greasy film on your hands or whatever area you use this on. The smell is no worse than some of the perfumed skin creams that most women use, IMHO i think this skin cream works better than some of those high dollar items. I would defintely recommend this item to anyone looking for relief with skin issues.[[ASIN:B0006GDATQ SBS 40 MEDICATED SKIN CREAM 5 OZ TUBE]]</li>
    <li> works great for gnats!</li>
    <li> This is excellent - non-greasy lotion to use daily.  It heals up your skin, is wonderful on hands.  Yes, I would purchase again.  Only negative, I think the price is a bit too high.</li>
    <li> Works great. Also works as a bug repellant!</li>
    <li> It turned out to be just a lotion, like any other lotion..nothing special. We are very disappointed with this lotion.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well. You still have to apply it frequently like other lotions. It did soothe and soften the cracked and chaffed areas.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Deb SBS-40 for dry skin condition during colder weather. I&#x27;ve tried other products that say they can relieve itching dry skin, but this product is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that actually works. I&#x27;ve used an Olay product, Quench, but this is superior and the price makes it a good value. Been there, done that; for itching dry skin or irritated skin, in my opinion this is the best over-the-counter product in its class.</li>
    <li> I gave sbs 40 three stars due to the chemical/ hospital smell. I have used the version with no aloe and it was so much better. Look for the one with the blue on the package not green. I wasent sure wich one I would receive when ordering because the seller has a picture of both green and blue on amazon. I would not order this one again.</li>
    <li> Although this is marketed as a hand cream, I have yet to find anything that works as well as this as a facial moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t seem logical that a product I buy through the Snap-On Tools man should out perform the big names at the cosmetics counter like Biore and Neutrogena, but it absolutely does. I can&#x27;t help but think that if DEB SBS ever chose to re-bottle this into some frilly, 1 oz tube and gave it a catchy name, they&#x27;d make a fortune off it.</li>
    <li> This product has only one flaw...the odor.  It is a light, non-greasy medicated lotion, that absorbs quickly, but it has a strong, unpleasant odor.  I ordered this product for my husband whose hands are dry and cracked from working outside in the cold weather.  I always know when he has used the lotion because of the unpleasant odor.  Otherwise, it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works fine! Much better than the other skin creams i have tried.  I will order more before i run out!</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have used for cracked skin. It has been wonderful. I was in the printing business for many years and had to constantly wash ink off my hands. They were always cracking and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked as well as this SBS 40 skin cream.</li>
    <li> Best skin cream available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to any one suffering from cracked or chapped hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered the product for my wife and daughters for 20 years</li>
    <li> Could not live with out this  in the winter. It doesnt wash away when you wash your hands, and absorbs quickly into skin.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of the 3 types of psoriasis and it has cleared it everywhere!!! I cried when I saw my skin I was so happy!! I recommend this product to anyone I see with psoriasis!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that soothes and repairs my dry, cracked working hands in winter.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. i bought several tubes for gifts. price is right and it&#x27;s a great product for treating dry scaly skin. non greasy and long lasting</li>
    <li> used this product for years - works great</li>
    <li> this was not a good product. It was very greasy and did not help me at all. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I first found SBS 40 at the local Y in the locker room.  I was using it to be frugal and to multi-task (it was provided free in a dispenser on the wall and it was right by the hair dryers and I could dry my hair and put on lotion at the same time!)  I used to have very very itchy skin on my legs - I would scratch and scratch until I had bruises and/or my husband would yell at me to stop!  After just a few days I noticed a huge difference.  I told another woman at the Y about it when she complained about dry skin - she tried it and found relief, also.  I also gave this to my daughter-in-law who was complaining of her eczema  - she asked for another tube because it helps so much.  Gave another tube to my next door neighbor who complained of terrible itching on her ankles - she told me within 2 days the itching was much, much better.  I do not seem to notice a scent at all - it does not seem to have a medicated smell to it.</li>
    <li> The safety dept used to get SBS40 in for the shop personnel. I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and a little bit goes a long way. I use it all of the time, now.</li>
    <li> This is a good light-weight medicated skin cream that works well for me. I highly recommend this product. It has a very clean scent.</li>
    <li> As a mechanic my hands are constantly exposed to harsh hand cleaners, this lotion is great for very dry skin and industrial exposure.</li>
    <li> I learned about this from a woman whose husband worked on the alaskan pipeline.  All the guys used it because of the cold and dry weather.</li>
    <li> A friend had given me a tube of this years ago. I loved it then and finally found it on amazon. I love this stuff! I hate to use lotion because of the greasy feel, but this stuff is different. It absorbs quickly and is really moisturizing. I use it all over. I even use it as a facial moisturizer for my acne prone oily skin. The best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boss, who has major problems with dry skin ... the kind where nothing else seems to work. This product is really working for her. I&#x27;m so happy. She loves it and you can really see a difference.</li>
    <li> Texture is fine, but very strong scent.</li>
    <li> Great product and it arrived on schedule.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff when working with caustic chemicals and very hot dry environment. Glad to find it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He uses alot of lotion is is very picky about it. This one he keeps running out of and he uses it so much it doesn&#x27;t last long. I surprised him last time with 6 tubes, next time it may have to be more.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Large airline I work for at biggest maintenance base in the world issues it due to severe problems we encounter from many chemicals used and frequent hand washing damage. Got this for wife who has very dry skin and does not like oily products. She really likes it better than many others she has tried over couple of decades like udder cream, corn huskers lotion, vasolene products. I liked the origional pale yellow vasoline but it is not easy to find anymore.</li>
    <li> Been using SBS 40 for years. No smell, not greasy after applied. Keeps hands from cracking and and splitting and no more hand nails</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for any skin irritation. My husband &amp; I both use it for minor rashes, excess dryness, itchiness--- works on everything. No burning. No staining on clothes. No smell.</li>
    <li> This cream was a blessing to my mom who had cancer. Radiation treatments left her with a horrific rash and this cream was the only thing that kept her itching under control. I was so glad to find such a wonderful, useful product.</li>
    <li> Medicated is the key word here. Used to get this at work. For decades. If one uses hand cleaner, it removes the oil from your palms and makes gripping tools a slippery situation. While working aloft, that means one may drop a hammer onto someone below on the ground. This solves that &amp;#34;tool slipping&amp;#34; fear and is also the best for dry chapped cracked working hands. It really works like a bit of a miracle. Anyone who uses it loves the very light fragrance that quickly dissipates and it&#x27;s incredible healing powers. The best, by far.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best! I use it in the winter time as my hands get very dry. I also introduced it to my mother-in-law as her fingers get really dry and crack and this is the only cream on the market that has helped her tremendously.</li>
    <li> If your skin is sensitive oil based products, this is great.  I break out from even things like Vasiline intensive care, because it is a petroleum based product.  This just helps heal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this hand cream worked as well as I thought it would have, to make it worth making an on-line purchase. I think I could found something similar in my local drug store.</li>
    <li> This works better then anything I have ever used. I think if you have cracked or dry skin from the long winter then this is worth a try</li>
    <li> Just what I had been looking for.  Works very well, and is reasonably priced</li>
    <li> This cream is great.  I work for a utilities company and they provide us with SBS 40 Medicated Skin Cream to keep hands from cracking in cold dry weather.  There is a bit of a fragrance to the cream but I&#x27;ll take that any day over cracked fingers.  It goes on and absorbs in without leaving my hands feeling greasy.  After a couple hand washings I do re-apply to ensure I have enough to keep them from cracking.  My wife asked, what&#x27;s that smell, I told her but she didn&#x27;t object to it, and the odor does go away.  I&#x27;d recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> Used this for years and it just great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using it for years. Not greasy. It absorbes into the skin and lasts for hours.No split fingers.</li>
