      <li>and you should be good</li>
      <li>It truely brightens the skin and makes it look flawless.</li>
      <li>nothing really exceptional.  </li>
      <li>but you get used to it quickly (but it just got to be wayyy better than chemical acid on your skin!!!)</li>
      <li>Was expecting it to work great, but it irritated my skin and seemed to make me more oily.</li>
      <li>but, more importantly, IT WORKED GREAT!!</li>
      <li>I suggest using acidic water and it will be even better!</li>
      <li>This is gonna be a staple that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>I think I like clay masks better.</li>

      <li>After 20 minutes I rinse it off and my skin is softer and more radiant.</li>
      <li>I love this product...give it a chance.</li>
      <li>But it works for making my face a smoother surface with a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind mixing up my own products every now and again, but this powder required quite a bit of effort to create a smooth paste.</li>
      <li>so it was better for my skin than most products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&#x3D;) Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because this stuff is great!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love mixing it with yogurt as one of the directions vs juice or water.</li>
      <li>It has drawn out so many of the impurities, and literally shrunk my pores.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a peel, it&#x27;s more of a mask imo since you mix it with water, yogurt, or lemon juice</li>
      <li>THere must be a better way.</li>
      <li>I love this peel.</li>
      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>more for $4.</li>
      <li>Feels more spa like.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, but exfoliates great, leaving skin smooth with no visible pores.</li>
      <li>This mask makes my skin feel very clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling wonderful, smooth &amp; actually temporarily tightens my sagging jawline.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Easy to use; just add water.  </li>
      <li>but it was neither strong nor offensive.  </li>
      <li>A strong odor of powder vitamin C.  </li>
      <li>The product didn&#x27;t burn at all, I could feel a slight tingle - and the results were wonderful!</li>
      <li>Order this product from 100 Percent Pure&#x27;s own website -- you get a 2.9 oz.</li>
      <li>My skin looked way better just from the first application!</li>
      <li>I used the 100% pure brightening toner, as well as the pomegranate facial moisturizer afterward and my skin feels and looks the best it has looked in a while.</li>
      <li>Great facial peel.</li>
      <li>I use it once a week because I notice that my skin starts to feel like I need a good exfoliation by then and afterwards, my skin feel so soft and even.</li>
      <li>I mixed it with lemon juice and the results was remarkable.  </li>
      <li>First, I love this brand -</li>
      <li>Was drawn to this because I&#x27;m trying to go a bit more natural and love their mascara.</li>
      <li>but I just clean it off sooner.</li>
      <li>Some react better to certain things than others do.</li>
      <li>I love 100% pure products.</li>
      <li>I thought about getting a facial peel but to me this is just as good.</li>
      <li>this jar is full of powder)</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t good to put directly around the soft tissue of your eyes though, but I was really glad when it arrived.  </li>
      <li>have used this in conjunction with 2 of their other products, and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>I will try it a couple more times too see if discolorations on my face subside, my main reason for the purchase.</li>
      <li>This product has reduced the size of my pores tremendously.</li>
      <li>I have tried many high dollar products on the market, and none of them have worked.</li>
      <li>n feel a difference after the first use,awesome price n value!</li>
      <li>Enzymes are an amazing thing..internally and topically.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>After reading the e-book Skintervention I have set out to incorporate more natural products in my beauty arsenal.  </li>
      <li>i mix it with fresh lemon juice.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
      <li>want to end this with a big thumbs up to the manufacturers - they developed a great product</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and wonderful right after without being dried out.</li>
      <li>I still have some right now though.</li>
      <li>Right now, there is a coupon code for 10% off --</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this product, I mixed 1 tsp water with 1 tsp fresh lemon juice...not a good combination for my VERY sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Works great it helps brighten your face and does decrease small wrinkles</li>
      <li>I have reordered this product several times and I will continue to do so in the future very effective exfoliate..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so sticky and tacky after you mix it leaves residue and does absolutely nothing!</li>
      <li>It makes an okay face mask, but it&#x27;s definitely not a peel!</li>
      <li>, that happens to be EXACTLY what it</li>
      <li>I realize that first time use sometimes doesn&#x27;t go so well, so I continued to use it.</li>
      <li>I used it at night for my first try.</li>
      <li>I have had many problems with facial masks which burn my skin when the package says it will tingle.  </li>
      <li>Things would have gone a lot easier if I had seen the instructions of 1 tbsp and 1 tsp, haha!</li>
      <li>It takes quite a bit to get a good enough consistantcy to cover your entire face.</li>
      <li>There seem to be some positive results so maybe my skin just didn&#x27;t react as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this a few times and left it on for close to an hour, and no burn. Didn&#x27;t see much result, but my face felt cleaner. The smell is terrible though. I will be looking for a different product.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this product, I mixed 1 tsp water with 1 tsp fresh lemon juice...not a good combination for my VERY sensitive skin! I broke out in really itchy red hives that lasted for about 3 hours! Needless to say, I was a little leary to try it a second time ;D I decided to try it with just WATER (no lemon juice, since it already had citric acid in it anyway) and mix only 1/2 tsp of each (1 tsp of each was too much and I ended up wasting half of it). I applied it to my face and neck and waited 5-10 min. This time, I experienced some hives/itching but not nearly as bad but, more importantly, IT WORKED GREAT!! My husband asked me why my skin was glowing when he got home from work and he said I looked beautiful! By the third time I tried it (with water every time now), I hardly had any itchy reaction at all!! I am now trying it on my arms and legs as well, since I have much sun damage there too. My skin is firmer (mask gets very tight, like if you would put egg whites on your face), it is much clearer with less break-outs and has a healthy glow to it, and the fine lines that were starting to show up are starting to completely disappear!! I love this product...give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I have normal T-zone skin and this product is great! Other products just never felt like it did its job. This mask makes my skin feel very clean afterwards. I use it once a week because I notice that my skin starts to feel like I need a good exfoliation by then and afterwards, my skin feel so soft and even. It can get a bit drying at times before the recommended time is over (10 mins) but I just clean it off sooner. I would definitely get this mask again.</li>
    <li> I like this mask because is 100% natural. Very gentle, but exfoliates great, leaving skin smooth with no visible pores. It&#x27;s a bit runny when mixed with water and dries quickly on face so I mix with honey (antibacterial) or natural yoghurt for thicker consistency so I can leave on the skin for a longer time. I love 100% pure products.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every facial product ever invented. Some are awesome, some are supposed to be awesome but... somebody must of lied to the manufacturers. So,one day I happen to pick this up at a very overpriced health food store (of course) in NYC - I am limited now to only organic products for my skin due to a unfortunate skin condition that I have developed. The very first night I used the mask, I mixed it with lemon juice. The results were amazing,to say the least. Enzymes are an amazing thing..internally and topically. Subsequently, I have become addicted to this mask and as a result I have embellished on the original preparation by adding a mixture of crushed Papaya seed/juice from the fruit...to give it a little kick.&lt;br /&gt;I want to end this with a big thumbs up to the manufacturers - they developed a great product, that happens to be EXACTLY what it is.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Most peels are too harsh for dry, sensitive skin like mine, and this one is no exception, even though it is natural. I used this at a half dose of powder mixed into yogurt--both things done to make it less harsh--but it still caused me to get red, inflamed skin which broke out for a week or so after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works I&#x27;d assume for other types of skin, but not very dry, sensitive skin. I&#x27;m going to use the rest of this on my elbows and knees to help exfoliation, but not again on my poor face.</li>
    <li> I agree with other users who commented that the powder is hard to mix and smells awful! I used it at night for my first try. It required a lot of powder to a small part water and needed a lot of mixing otherwise would get clumpy. Too, it simply dries like a clay mask without any peel effects-such as slight stinging- to let you know that it is even removing dead skin cells. Since water is being used, the mask takes longer tha 5 mins to dry, which is the recommended time. Lastly I could smell it the next morning when my pores opened during my face wash. I will try it a couple more times too see if discolorations on my face subside, my main reason for the purchase. Else it is going back to the seller.</li>
    <li> My friends saw a difference in my face. The only problem is that it really smelled bad! However, worked good.</li>
    <li> Great facial peel. Feels great. Easy to use; just add water.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a harsh smell of pineapple which is what I was most worried about.  Worth the money. I feel great after using this product.</li>
    <li> I normally really like 100% Pure products, but this has a terrible smell, almost like a barnyard!!!  I cannot stand to use it, so a wast of money.  Plus the lid was cracked.</li>
    <li> I have had many problems with facial masks which burn my skin when the package says it will tingle.  This product did NOT burn.  I could feel it drying and tightening but there was no burn.  It left my face feeling clean and refreshed.  The scent was not particularly pleasant but it was neither strong nor offensive.  I would recommend this to someone who had sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I mixed it with lemon juice and the results was remarkable.  I am licensed medical esthetician and the ingredients are just what I was looking for. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My skin feels and look younger and healthier.  The smell is a little strong but not unbearable.  I use half the recommended ingredients and leave it on for approximately 30 minutes.  I like the results!  I thought about getting a facial peel but to me this is just as good.</li>
    <li> First, I love this brand - I feel great about using products that are made from pure ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a canvas: my skin is mildly sensitive, leans toward the oily side, my pores (unfortunately) aren&#x27;t microscopic, I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m used to mild peels (no higher than a monthly 20% salicylic peel at home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product use: I have mixed the product with water, manuka honey, orange juice, avocado (different applications), and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender pure Castille Oil soap. I apply the mask with a fan brush. The product didn&#x27;t burn at all, I could feel a slight tingle - and the results were wonderful! It&#x27;s gentle enough to use once or twice a week and if you mix a little in your hand when washing your face in the shower, it acts as a very gentle exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing tip!! Use a $2.50 hand-held milk-frother from Ikea ([...] - it mixes the mask into a sensuously silky essence (works best with thinner liquids / yoghurt). Mix this mask with warmed honey and yoghurt for a delectably soothing and healing mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this mask a 5 if not for the only drawback for me to this product: I say this knowing that my sense of smell is very sensitive... I can hardly bear the scent. That said, mixing it with Lavender scented Dr. Bronner&#x27;s helps tone it down (as does \\&quot;diluting\\&quot; it with another pure kaolin or bentonite clay mask).</li>
    <li> Before reading this, please realize that different people have different skin types. Some react better to certain things than others do. With that being said, I did have a bit of burning when I used this product. It left my skin hypersensitive for a few days after the use. I realize that first time use sometimes doesn&#x27;t go so well, so I continued to use it. I still had the same reactions with no improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the positives: It smells of citrus and pineapple which is super pleasant. It is completely natural so it was better for my skin than most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally the things I didn&#x27;t love or hate: It made my skin feel tighter. I don&#x27;t know if that is great. It wasn&#x27;t horrible. It wasn&#x27;t too messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it just wasn&#x27;t worth it to me. But it isn&#x27;t so bad that it deserves a 1. Which leaves me at two starts. Try it for yourself. There seem to be some positive results so maybe my skin just didn&#x27;t react as well.</li>
    <li> This was the worst product I have ever used.  This mask is the kind that you have you add water to, which is fine.  I&#x27;ve used similar products so I didn&#x27;t mind.  But it took forever to mix with the water.  When it finally started to blend it was chunky and very sticky.  It also smelled like candy.  I couldn&#x27;t wash it off either. It took 3 times the amount of face wash to get it off.  I threw it away and will never buy again.  Also it took almost 2 months for the package to arrive.</li>
    <li> Ineffective!  They should not sell this as a peel. It&#x27;s nowhere near as strong enough to be a peel. It makes an okay face mask, but it&#x27;s definitely not a peel!</li>
    <li> I tried this until half the container was gone. It did nothing at all for me. There are far better peels out there in the same price range. But still....you get what you pay for. Active ingredients cost.</li>
    <li> I did not get the results I expected. I have used other products from this brand I like very much, so I thought this would give the results of a lighter acid/fruit peel. but it was more trouble to make it than it was worth. which, by the way says equal parts, but that is not true, had to add more product than water.</li>
    <li> especially if you have mixed or oily skin, this helps because after the face treatment the pores are reduced in size so there are reduced oil secretions.&lt;br /&gt;Also it evens skin .... I have mixed skin  ( my T zone is oily but the rest pretty dry ) so I use it to even the skin ( the T zone is visibly healthier and less oily or almost oil free... for a couple of days).&lt;br /&gt;I also have an acne prone skin and this product really helps.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it when I had a breakout and there were wounds.... It says that it is not recommended that you use it in such circumstances BUT it works and honestly makes the wounds heal at least twice as fast (in 2 days or so).&lt;br /&gt;I use it with lemon juice.</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;easy to use though I would recommend buying a bowl and brush to mix and and apply&lt;br /&gt;great product though</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this brand here on Amazon and decided to try a few of their products. I have had health issues for the last few years, which have caused hormonal imbalances with my skin and its overall appearance. I have tried many high dollar products on the market, and none of them have worked. I saw that this was a vegan product, (I myself am a happy carnivore), and thought I&#x27;d give it a whirl. I&#x27;m so glad I did because this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this in conjunction with 2 of their other products, and my skin looks great. It has drawn out so many of the impurities, and literally shrunk my pores. I can honestly say this is the best stuff I have ever used for skin care, and I will not be using anything else. I truly recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> Was drawn to this because I&#x27;m trying to go a bit more natural and love their mascara. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a peel, it&#x27;s more of a mask imo since you mix it with water, yogurt, or lemon juice and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like a peel at all. I love it because it&#x27;s non irritating (I use retin A intermittently so my skin can be sensitive sometimes) and it can be moisturizing if mixed with yogurt or pore shrinking with lemon juice &amp; water. My skin is at the crossroads of having fine lines/wrinkles &amp; occasional hormonal breakouts so it&#x27;s difficult to find products that cooperate with my skin but this product does and I have used it twice a week since I purchased it 4 weeks ago &amp; my jar is roughly half empty. I don&#x27;t plan to be without it unless it&#x27;s discontinued (all good things seem to be eventually!).</li>
    <li> This product has reduced the size of my pores tremendously. In my t-zone area my pores are the largest and using this twice a week consistently has really helped. I use lemon juice and mix it until it resembles Elmer&#x27;s glue. It may look a bit runny but it stays when you apply it. It does not dry has hard as other mask but it stays put. After 20 minutes I rinse it off and my skin is softer and more radiant. Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because 100 % natural ,  I followed instruction and put on my face my face start to itchy and  show up red  bump all over, I think pineapple enzyme allergic to some people, I never had any allergy  condition until I used this products. But I like theirs  other products.</li>
    <li> Weird smell, not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
    <li> This is the best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used,I could see n feel a difference after the first use,awesome price n value!</li>
    <li> Pure facial peel will peel your skin off your face. Leaving you face red for hours, So don&#x27;t buy this item if you like your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m prefer natural products, which can be difficult to find, and this is a wonderful peel.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving is 4/5 stars is that it comes in a powder and requires you to mix it with water (adding another step prior to me using it).  It also has a great smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Truly a natural product&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You need to mix it with water before application (ie. this jar is full of powder)</li>
    <li> ... not only could you become toxic through your skin, but you can also be left with chemical burns which may require profession treatment to correct.  This however actually works and there is absolutely no down time, what you will notice is that your skin delicately chafes (or delicately peels) within about a week (i use it twice a week 3 days apart) and yes it does have a slight stingy tingle but you get used to it quickly (but it just got to be wayyy better than chemical acid on your skin!!!) just follow it up with some 100% Aloe Vera Gel mixed with some 100% Vitamin E Oil and you should be good (that&#x27;s what works for me) and you notice the chafing after you wash your face and allow it to dry within about a week. i mix it with fresh lemon juice.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! I was a little concerned at first because I thought it would irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s very mild but it gets the job done. My skin looked way better just from the first application!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find it stinky, or harsh, have yet to decide whether it does noticeable things for my face... but I&#x27;m glad to have it, I like that it is powder that will wait for me to mix it.</li>
    <li> Works great it helps brighten your face and does decrease small wrinkles</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing after just 1 use.  I only used it with water, next time I will try with a juice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 and had never done a facial peel before recently purchasing this affordable product.  I don&#x27;t care for the odor (think it smells sour like stomach bile).  It stings a little bit when first applied but doesn&#x27;t sting/burn for duration.  Not too harsh and works well.  My face is noticeably smoother and brighter looking afterwards.  May switch to a different peel after this one is finished though simply because the smell is so unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this peel. It is like generic toilette cleaner. But it works for making my face a smoother surface with a healthy glow. I was hoping to minimize the orange peel appearance of my skin and so far I see no change. I love mixing it with yogurt as one of the directions vs juice or water. Feels more spa like.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this product several times and I will continue to do so in the future very effective exfoliate..</li>
    <li> It works okay, nothing really exceptional.  It smells artificial and not at all natural.  A strong odor of powder vitamin C.  I add whole milk yogurt to this peel to make a mask.  It still smells of artificial powder extract.  I&#x27;ll not reorder again.</li>
    <li> this stuff works!! follow directions and it works just and water to a small cup or something that can hold two tsp of it and one tsp of water then mix. when you apply it on it,s real sticky so it like a mask that stays on for 5 to 8 mins then rinse.a two day app you want believe, how your skin will look!!</li>
    <li> It works well.  The scent is like a fruit past it&#x27;s prime by a day or two it is not offensive or intolerable.</li>
    <li> I ♥ this.  I use a lot of different skin care products, but this one is not only natural &amp; Eco-friendly (non-poisonous), but is is refreshing as well.... It may seem expensive, but it is not... it is a powder that you mix w/ water...  I suggest using acidic water and it will be even better!</li>
    <li> This is gonna be a staple that&#x27;s for sure! I love it! It truely brightens the skin and makes it look flawless. I used the 100% pure brightening toner, as well as the pomegranate facial moisturizer afterward and my skin feels and looks the best it has looked in a while. I&#x27;m getting so spoiled by this company! My only complaint is mixing the the product. The product itself doesn&#x27;t have instructions on how much to mix. Therefore, the first time I tried I used too much yogurt and the second time I tried I used too much water. Things would have gone a lot easier if I had seen the instructions of 1 tbsp and 1 tsp, haha! Regardless, it still worked like a charm that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t give anything less than 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Pineapple enzyme is really good for your skin. There are very few products out there that contain it. I have used one whole jar of this &amp; like other reviewers say, it is not a peel. It is a wash off mask. Leaves my skin feeling wonderful, smooth &amp; actually temporarily tightens my sagging jawline. I do not agree at all with the reviews about bad smell &amp; problems with mixing. Order this product from 100 Percent Pure&#x27;s own website -- you get a 2.9 oz. jar for $19, which is almost 1 oz. more for $4. Right now, there is a coupon code for 10% off -- ALLYOU10. I usually go with Amazon, but this is a better deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once and noticed a HUGE difference in my skin tone. &#x3D;) Love it. Will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this zero stars it&#x27;s so sticky and tacky after you mix it leaves residue and does absolutely nothing! Not a fan at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it&#x27;s still more than half full, because i never go to the trouble to use it. It&#x27;s annoying to have to find something to mix it in, and when it dries it HURTS to try to get off. I never noticed any difference in my skin when I did use it. going back to the ALBA botanicals papaya enzyme mask - i used to use that all the time and could feel it burning, which, for a peel. i think that means it works.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial peel that is natural based. There are so many options out there that are ready to apply with little hassle. I don&#x27;t mind mixing up my own products every now and again, but this powder required quite a bit of effort to create a smooth paste. After a while, I was tired of mixing a small amount for each facial. THere must be a better way. I now use masks that are premixed in liquid form Less hassle, less mess and saves me time!</li>
    <li> was to hard to mix and put on</li>
    <li> After reading the e-book Skintervention I have set out to incorporate more natural products in my beauty arsenal.  The pineapple enzyme does not disappoint!  I use it weekly in my facial routine and my skin feels amazingly soft after this!</li>
    <li> The mask is runny and has an unpleasant scent. It takes quite a bit to get a good enough consistantcy to cover your entire face. It does however leave my face feeling very smooth and it has noticeably helped lighten some acne scars. Still, for the price I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this peel. My skin feels soft and wonderful right after without being dried out. The &amp;#34;next day&amp;#34; effect is brighter skin.</li>
    <li> Like this, am using it, but not sure I would buy it again. It comes in powder form and you need to mix with water. The proportions the directions give could be cut in half, you&#x27;ll end up with alot more mask than face. I think I like clay masks better.</li>
    <li> Was expecting it to work great, but it irritated my skin and seemed to make me more oily. Won&#x27;t use again. Using a clay mask works best so far, as I have found.</li>
    <li> I think this is a wonderful product. It arrived pretty fast in the mail. Pineapple enzymes are supposed to be very wonderful for your skin. It isn&#x27;t good to put directly around the soft tissue of your eyes though, but I was really glad when it arrived.  If the opportunity presents itself I would order it again. I still have some right now though.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but very hard to make it the right consistency, I tried both with water and yogurt as recommended.</li>
