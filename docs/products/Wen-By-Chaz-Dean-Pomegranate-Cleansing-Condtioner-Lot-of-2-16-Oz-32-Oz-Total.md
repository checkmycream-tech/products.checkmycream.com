<li> Considering the fact that it is both a shampoo and conditioner in one it actually saves money in the long run.</li>
<li> It did take some time to get used to the fact that Wen does not get all sudsy which is why my hair was so dry.  </li>
<li> Hard to go back to regular shampoo.</li>
<li> Dark label with tiny dark lettering.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that all of the Wen cleansing conditioners have a menthol smell.  </li>
<li> I have medium length hair, which accoridng to the bottle means I should use at least ten pumps.  </li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve never used a cleansing conditioner, I highly reccomend you start with the Herbel Essences version on because it&#x27;s a lot less expensive.  </li>
<li> I put off buying Wen for a long time, as it is expensive, and it takes several minutes to cleanse and rinse twice.</li>
<li> I will say though, this product leaves little to no smell in your hair whereas the Herbel Essences leaves an earthy mint leaf smell.  </li>
<li> Well worth the expense, if it eliminates painful detangling.</li>
<li> Moisturizing but not too heavy.</li>
<li> It also grows at least a quarter of an inch in a couple of months.  </li>
<li> I rated both products the same because I am somewhat unpleased with the earthy smell of the Herbel Essences when my hair drys, and I was somewhat unhappy with the menthol smell of this product.  </li>
<li> But the pump sucks.</li>
<li> Pump was broken</li>
<li> Difficult to see which product you are using, ei, shampoo, styling cream, etc.  </li>
<li> My hair is all dried out and looks awful.</li>
<li> Also packaging is awful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Makes nice hair.  3 things I don&#x27;t like about this product.  No suds...hard to get used to,  instructions say rinse under cool water, instructions say rinse for two minutes.  Also packaging is awful.  Dark label with tiny dark lettering.  Same label and lettering for all products.  Difficult to see which product you are using, ei, shampoo, styling cream, etc.  But hair does feel fuller and softer.  I use the product because of  the pluses.  Worth putting up with the minuses.</li>
    <li> Am really enjoying this shampoo</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for 3 years.  I will not go back to regular shampoo again.  My hair looks and feels so much better now than ever.  It also grows at least a quarter of an inch in a couple of months.  This is the best product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Pomegranate is my favorite!  Leaves my hair soft, yet full of body. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey.  I alternate with my favorite shampoo and conditioner. So, I do not use it exclusively. But I love it! Always a welcomed gift from hubby for birthday, Christmas, etc.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! Can&#x27;t imagine my hair without WEN. I have been using the product faithfully for two years now and my hair has never looked better!</li>
    <li> Great price on WEN.  Pomegranate smells nice too!  Moisturizing but not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful results in my two little girls afro hair. Well worth the expense, if it eliminates painful detangling. Will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is the best!  My hair is softer, shinier, stays clean longer, and it does not wash out the color of my hair.  I have waist-length hair now - it seems to be growing better and faster.  ZERO split ends!  Just love it!</li>
    <li> Conditioners were great. Hard to go back to regular shampoo. But the pump sucks. it stops working when the bottle is still 1/4 full. And I am talking about all of them. Been using WEN for about two years.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair feel new and with life. Should really try it out if you care about your own hair. If this review has helped you in any way, please click the YES button. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Luv it.  Works well on my damaged hair.</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s good stuff.  However, I question its exorbitant price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real Wen. My hair is all dried out and looks awful. I have used Wen before with way better results.</li>
    <li> My hair does seem more smooth.</li>
    <li> AS ALWAYS, IT IS LIKE I HAVE NEW HAIR!</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels. Very light scent to where you can almost not smell it. Wish it had more of a scent. Pump was broken so I had to use the second pump provided. Trying this cleansing conditioner out to see if it&#x27;s worth the price or if I should just stick to my $5 herbal essence cleansing conditioner which smells amazing and works great. If you are on a price budget then try that one out. I plan on going back and forth between both of them so the wen will last me longer. I also only needed to use 8 pumps of the wen and 4 of the herbal essence.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Worked really well on my dry course hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using it for 2 years and would never use regular shampoo or conditioner again.  It did take some time to get used to the fact that Wen does not get all sudsy which is why my hair was so dry.  Now it is soft and managable.  Considering the fact that it is both a shampoo and conditioner in one it actually saves money in the long run.</li>
    <li> The shampoo/ conditioner smells good. It makes my head all tingley and it does make my hair smooth.. However it does not keep it healthy looking and it does not keep it strong.  It does not make it healthier. I thought it was supposed to make it healthier.</li>
    <li> I being used  this products for the last 6 months and I noticed the change to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;As soon you rub your hair with this you know the difference from others products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold. I put off buying Wen for a long time, as it is expensive, and it takes several minutes to cleanse and rinse twice. However, the results justify spending both time and money. Wen delivers everything it promises. To try it for the first time, I used it exactly as directed. Subsequently, I can use about 20% less product successfully. Pomegranate is gluten-free, which is important to many, and crucial to some. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the Herbel Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner at around the same time.  This has a very very light palmagranet scent when you smell the product in the bottle.  However, when applied to your hair it smells very strongly of menthol.  I&#x27;ve read in other reviews that all of the Wen cleansing conditioners have a menthol smell.  I personally, don&#x27;t really like the menthol smell and that&#x27;s why I gave htis product four stars.  I did not use nearly as much product as the bottle says to use.  I have medium length hair, which accoridng to the bottle means I should use at least ten pumps.  I actually used four.  If you&#x27;ve never used a cleansing conditioner, I highly reccomend you start with the Herbel Essences version on because it&#x27;s a lot less expensive.  Also, changing to a cleansing conditioner takes a bit of getting used to.  You need to make sure your hair is really good and wet before applying the product.  You also need to make sure that when you apply the product you get it well incoprerated into your scap and make sure you massage it in.  You also need to massage while rinsing to ensure your hair is throurouly rinsed.  If you do not rinse properly, your hair will be greasy.  All and all, I find that I prefer the scent of the Herbel Essences.  I rated both products the same because I am somewhat unpleased with the earthy smell of the Herbel Essences when my hair drys, and I was somewhat unhappy with the menthol smell of this product.  I will say though, this product leaves little to no smell in your hair whereas the Herbel Essences leaves an earthy mint leaf smell.  All in all, I think the products are the same.  I will say that I can pronoounce all of the ingrediants in the Wen which is not the case in the Herbel Essences.  However, the prodcuts work the same.  I will probably will not buy this product again only because of the expense, but I do think it&#x27;s a great product.  Use either this or the HE version and you&#x27;ll find your hair has much more shine, is much easier to manage, and feels great.</li>
    <li> I love Wen and this is my favorite &#x27;go to&#x27; fragrance.</li>
