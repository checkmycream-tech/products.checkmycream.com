      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great product, seems to add some texture to thinning hair.</li>
      <li>but I loved that.</li>
      <li>A great alternative to hairspray for more relaxed curls ... or spray and then add spray for all day hold.</li>
      <li>This product is so amazing, my boyfriend even uses it.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell to it too.</li>
      <li>This product does give my hair nice waves.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
      <li>Bought it because my hair dresser uses it on me whenever I get my hair done - love the texture it gives it.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
      <li>Love this spray.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed this product, but now the cost has gone up significantly.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, my hair stylist used this by accident.</li>
      <li>But in my opinion, the price is worth it!</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair looking great all day long.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;d be weary in trusting that the liquid in the bottle is the true evo product.</li>
      <li>Having curly hair has always been a challenge to find the right product.</li>
      <li>The best thing ever for fine short hair that has no body of its own,  I just spray a little on my hair when dry, scrunch it up with my  fingers, and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
      <li>Love this spray, it makes your hair sort of gritty</li>
      <li>I recently moved and haven&#x27;t been able to find a salon in my area that carries it</li>
      <li>This spray accomplished exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I find it hard to justify paying 30 bucks for this, but it was good while it lasted.  </li>
      <li>Spray and go straight out of the shower.</li>
      <li>My old hair stylist is shipping me bottles from her salon now-</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>So back to straight hair for me.</li>
      <li>I have thick, fine hair, and using this product does not give me beachy waves.</li>

<li> I love how it gives me those well desired beachy waves in my hair without making it feel dirty.  </li>
<li> And I use it on dry hair to help give it some body.</li>
<li> You will use a lot during one use, only down fall.</li>
<li> Spray on wet hair and dry, gives a textured volume look.</li>
<li> I use it in my hair wet and it helps with tangles.</li>
<li> It left my hair frizzy and limp.</li>
<li> Only complaint is it has to be shipped via Australia.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t even give me a slight crimp or wave to my hair.</li>
<li> Turns ordinary hair into flowing beachy waves.  </li>
<li> The only drawback is how expensive it is.  </li>
<li> But seriously, buy this stuff now.</li>
<li> I am absolutely obsessed with this product.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic to wheat</li>
<li> I was very disappointed</li>

    <li> Great product, seems to add some texture to thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Having curly hair has always been a challenge to find the right product. Fortunately, my hair stylist used this by accident. I swear by it.</li>
    <li> Makes fixing my hair super quick and easy. Spray and go straight out of the shower. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> This product came to me in a padded envelope and leaked all over!! I sent them a email and they never addressed this at all. I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine hair, and using this product does not give me beachy waves. It doesn&#x27;t even give me a slight crimp or wave to my hair. It left my hair frizzy and limp. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but always purchased from a salon. I recently moved and haven&#x27;t been able to find a salon in my area that carries it so I hesitantly ordered it from Amazon. The product I receive smells different and definitely doesn&#x27;t do to my hair what it has been for years. My old hair stylist is shipping me bottles from her salon now- I&#x27;d be weary in trusting that the liquid in the bottle is the true evo product.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this product. I love how it gives me those well desired beachy waves in my hair without making it feel dirty.  This product is so amazing, my boyfriend even uses it.  The only drawback is how expensive it is.  But in my opinion, the price is worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this spray, it makes your hair sort of gritty but I loved that. Unfortunately I&#x27;m allergic to wheat so I can&#x27;t use it anymore....BOO. But seriously, buy this stuff now. I loved it!!</li>
    <li> Great product!  You can use it with or without blow dryer.  Keeps my hair looking great all day long.  Only complaint is it has to be shipped via Australia.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for the beach wave look!  Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair crispy!</li>
    <li> The best thing ever for fine short hair that has no body of its own,  I just spray a little on my hair when dry, scrunch it up with my  fingers, and I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
    <li> Solid product. Punctual delivery.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Bought it because my hair dresser uses it on me whenever I get my hair done - love the texture it gives it.</li>
    <li> Excellent hairstyling product, works perfect!</li>
    <li> This product does give my hair nice waves.  However I had to use a ton of it.  I went through the bottle in a month.  And when my husband kissed me, with his hands in my hair, he&#x27;d complain about the tackiness.  So back to straight hair for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it in my hair wet and it helps with tangles. And I use it on dry hair to help give it some body.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product, but now the cost has gone up significantly.  I find it hard to justify paying 30 bucks for this, but it was good while it lasted.  It has a nice smell to it too.</li>
    <li> This spray accomplished exactly what I was looking for. Spray on wet hair and dry, gives a textured volume look. If your roots need a boost, this will work! I have a shorter stacked cut in the back and when I use this spray it gives the lift it needs.</li>
    <li> Love this spray. Turns ordinary hair into flowing beachy waves.  You will use a lot during one use, only down fall.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!! A great alternative to hairspray for more relaxed curls ... or spray and then add spray for all day hold.</li>
