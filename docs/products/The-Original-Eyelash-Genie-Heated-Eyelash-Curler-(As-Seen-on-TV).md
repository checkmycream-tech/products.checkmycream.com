### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think that this would be a great travel item.</li>
      <li>great product</li>
      <li>I went by the reviews and felt it would be a good purchase</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came very quickly and was in good condition.</li>
      <li>All in all, I would say that this product does the job adequately and is an exceptionally good value.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
      <li>Love the concept and the way it is set up.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the best eyelash curler ever made, but it worked better than I had hoped for, given the low price.</li>
      <li>This worked fine for a while</li>
      <li>the light didn&#x27;t come on and it does not heat.</li>
      <li>light does not stay on-</li>
      <li>,is cheap and MUCH better that other eyelashes that cost more money!</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t work from very first day.</li>
      <li>It really work,is cheap and MUCH better that other eyelashes that cost more</li>
      <li>but after about a month the light would come off and on even though I put new batteries in each</li>
      <li>Good value for less than $5.</li>
      <li>I do have coarse hair, I must say that the heated eyelash curler did no curling--a very, very slight bend at best.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t heat up very much so it took way longer to curl</li>
      <li>Batteries were out after first use.  </li>
      <li>It changed color like the instructions stated it would when heated but it never got hot to curl my lashes.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even get hot enough to curl and it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
      <li>One thing I like is that the curler gets hot enough for a good curl, but not so hot that your eyelashes burn, like some other heated curlers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>So far,this product has worked very well for me</li>
      <li>really work</li>
      <li>Did not notice the heat and cannot get light to turn on for curling, hopefully can work soon enough,</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t even grasp the full upper lashes.</li>
      <li>I bought a similar product at a discount store about a year ago for 3 bucks and it worked great until I pressed on it too hard and the rubber piece was dislodged and wouldn&#x27;t stay put.  </li>
      <li>This does not get hot enough to curl, plus does not clamp eyelashes very well.</li>
      <li>Does not get hot enough!</li>
      <li>I put battery and light turns green and</li>
      <li>Put in new and didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>

<li> Put in new and didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> I am not sure if the other comments are for real because I bought this and not only does it not heat up</li>
<li> This one did not heat up at all, and I think it actually curled my lashes less than my regular curler that doesn&#x27;t heat.</li>
<li> I think it would have been less money and hassle to use a regular (non-heatable) eyelash curler.</li>
<li> Such a waste of money.</li>
<li> so I guess the heating element does not stay on either unless you mess with it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too narrow</li>
<li> Would suggest this item if you are looking to save a few bucks.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> again I off it after that it never turn green.</li>
<li> Not only did it not work but it would go thru batteries like crazy.</li>
<li> Total waste of money :(</li>
<li> This came broken</li>
<li> Disappointed that I have not found a heated eyelash curler than works.</li>
<li> Was a stupid buy, will not this again...</li>
<li> This thing is horrible.</li>
<li> terrible, it did not heat up.</li>
<li> and it was terrible.</li>

    <li> I bought a similar product at a discount store about a year ago for 3 bucks and it worked great until I pressed on it too hard and the rubber piece was dislodged and wouldn&#x27;t stay put.  I bought this one thinking it was the same product and it only lasted through several uses.  I thought it was the batteries and replaced them, but it would still not heat up.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work from very first day. I put battery and light turns green and again I off it after that it never turn green. Initially i thought its because of battery but its not. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waiste your money! Does not work at all!</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough! Love the concept and the way it is set up.</li>
    <li> This worked fine for a while but after about a month the light would come off and on even though I put new batteries in each time.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly and was in good condition.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get hot enough to curl and it&#x27;s cheaply made. It&#x27;s too narrow can&#x27;t even grasp the full upper lashes.</li>
    <li> It really work,is cheap and MUCH better that other eyelashes that cost more money!&lt;br /&gt;It really work,is cheap and MUCH better that other eyelashes that cost more money!</li>
    <li> These things work well but are not made to last.</li>
    <li> This does not get hot enough to curl, plus does not clamp eyelashes very well. Disappointed that I have not found a heated eyelash curler than works.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, falls apart. Battery won&#x27;t stay in, cover keeps coming off. Was a stupid buy, will not this again...</li>
    <li> I used to heat up a curler with a blow drier and then I got this. It didn&#x27;t heat up very much so it took way longer to curl but it stilll does the job it was made for. It ran out of batteries because i left it on by accident and i haven&#x27;t bothered to replace them. I think that this would be a great travel item.</li>
    <li> Batteries kept going out. Did not notice the heat and cannot get light to turn on for curling, hopefully can work soon enough,</li>
    <li> This came broken the light didn&#x27;t come on and it does not heat. I ordered 2 different one and neither work</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitantt o buy this product after reading some of the reviews, but I figured why not since the price was so low. So far,this product has worked very well for me and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase. One thing I like is that the curler gets hot enough for a good curl, but not so hot that your eyelashes burn, like some other heated curlers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Batteries were out after first use.  Put in new and didn&#x27;t last long.  great product if it would have worked longer.  Only about 3 uses isn&#x27;t enough by my standars.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if the other comments are for real because I bought this and not only does it not heat up it didnt work at all.  Total waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Albiet I do have coarse hair, I must say that the heated eyelash curler did no curling--a very, very slight bend at best.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> All in all, I would say that this product does the job adequately and is an exceptionally good value. I&#x27;ve definitely had more expensive heated curlers that didn&#x27;t work as well so I would siggest giving this one a shot. Good value for less than $5.</li>
    <li> This thing doesnt work well at all it just mashes your lashes and the heating element light does not stay on- so I guess the heating element does not stay on either unless you mess with it</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible. Not only did it not work but it would go thru batteries like crazy. I tossed it.</li>
    <li> I think it would have been less money and hassle to use a regular (non-heatable) eyelash curler. This one did not heat up at all, and I think it actually curled my lashes less than my regular curler that doesn&#x27;t heat.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the best eyelash curler ever made, but it worked better than I had hoped for, given the low price. Would suggest this item if you are looking to save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> terrible, it did not heat up. I went by the reviews and felt it would be a good purchase and it was terrible. It changed color like the instructions stated it would when heated but it never got hot to curl my lashes.</li>
