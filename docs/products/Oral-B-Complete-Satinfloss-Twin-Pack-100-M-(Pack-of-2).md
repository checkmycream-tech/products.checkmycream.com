      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>That is one mistake you can easily make at the store that you can avoid here!</li>
      <li>Because of my teeth being so close together Ive never been able to floss my teeth without getting the floss either stuck or shredding between my teeth.</li>
      <li>The tape does a better job.</li>
      <li>im FINALLY able to start flossing.</li>
      <li>The tape covers more of the tooth surface, so it does a better job.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite floss.  </li>
      <li>The dentist will tell you that you should perchance use an unwaxed floss, or a woven one, because those are better at removing detritus from your teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>For floss this is pretty good though.</li>
      <li>It does slip between my teeth easily.  </li>
      <li>It also breaks apart easily and becomes stringy.   </li>
      <li>Cleans easily and isn&#x27;t too waxy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break easily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an overly strong mint smell/taste, &amp; the floss itself does not stick.</li>
      <li>The shape and size of it is fine - it slips easily between even tightly-spaced teeth, and doesn&#x27;t often tear or shred (in my experience).</li>
      <li>I like this type of floss because it gets in between the teeth with less pressure, but crest glide seems to be the best at that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth aren&#x27;t barbed wire, but I may be mistaken.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different dental flosses and this one is clearly the best:  1.</li>
      <li>It does everything this one does, but in addition to leaving your teeth clean, it leaves your hands clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yes, this product does clean between your teeth.</li>
      <li>These flosses leave the mouth with a fresh feeling, and I really enjoy using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only caution is to make sure you&#x27;re buying the right kind - there is \\&quot;satin floss\\&quot; and \\&quot;satin tape\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>It tears and shreds pretty easy.  </li>
      <li>The satin floss moves smoothly, but isn&#x27;t very durable.  </li>
      <li>So much easier!</li>
      <li>recommend avoiding this one, and checking out the Crest Glide Floss (linked below), even if it does cost a tiny bit more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But even just touching the floss, you can feel the tacky texture, and it definitely comes off on your fingers and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in trying anything else.  </li>
      <li>understand that floss is often coated in wax or some kind of substance to allow it to slip between your teeth more easily, but I have never experienced a floss that left my hands tacky and sticky...</li>
      <li>Looking back at the Satin floss, it seems while it was easy to use, it was also not doing the job.  </li>
      <li>It certainly was not what I wanted.</li>

      <li>teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I really hope they never stop making this product.</li>
      <li>Makes flossing so much easier and faster to do.</li>
      <li>My teeth are really close</li>
      <li>I really prefer Glide dental tape</li>
      <li>easily slips between my teeth and helps to clean even those hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>(My teeth are so tight together that dentists have to shave those wedge spacers to be able to use them.)  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I like the minty taste it leaves behind and most of all I like the feeling of having clean</li>
      <li>I will be very careful to look at all the fine print when ordering items on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I would simply be cautious when purchasing from online, maybe these were sitting in a hot warehouse or something.</li>
      <li>There is more than enough floss on each roll to last a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been flossing more regularly after the dentist told me I should if I wanted to go to him less often.  </li>
      <li>But this is, by far, my favouritest of all the flosses I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>Most dental floss is too much like thread which seems a bit thin after you are used to thicker floss or dental tape.</li>
      <li>I love it because I have tight gaps between my teeth and this flat ribbon floss</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s becoming hard to find where I live.</li>
      <li>A Lot.&lt;br /&gt;The solid flat strip is just right for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s minty and it gets between my super tight teeth.  </li>
      <li>I think the wax melted off or something, the floss is clumpy and difficult to get in between me teeth unlike the kind I buy from the store.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had gotten this brand as a sample from my dentist.  Once I tried it I was hooked!  This satin floss is awesome.  It doe not break or get stuck like the other type I used before. The only negative is the price. When you break it down, its very costly but by using less can lower the cost.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B satin floss before and it&#x27;s wonderful, but the floss I received from this shipment was terrible. Initially, I thought the floss might have been fake, but decided against that theory. I think the wax melted off or something, the floss is clumpy and difficult to get in between me teeth unlike the kind I buy from the store. It also breaks apart easily and becomes stringy.   I would simply be cautious when purchasing from online, maybe these were sitting in a hot warehouse or something.</li>
    <li> I like this type of floss because it gets in between the teeth with less pressure, but crest glide seems to be the best at that.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss! Since it is satin it is very thin and practically effortless to get between your teeth. Makes flossing so much easier and faster to do. Plus it has a nice minty taste.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this floss again, as I usually need to use a second piece to remove remnants of the first from between my teeth.</li>
    <li> You can never be too thin or too rich said Diana Vreeland of Vogue magazine about women, but she could be talking about floss as well.  My dental hygienist and my dentist (unrelated) both recommend Oral-B floss as thin as you can go for regular twice daily flossing for your teeth.  They both have said that you only get the tape if you have lots of gaps in your teeth, otherwise thin is in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also use [[ASIN:B001KRS3AQ The Doctor&#x27;s BrushPicks Toothpicks: 250 Pack]] if you don&#x27;t like the floss scene.  In both cases you must \\&quot;saw\\&quot; vertically  through the borders of the teeth until you reach the gum line and then saw horizontally between them for optimal results.  The Brushpicks are easier to carry about but I have seen women in the powder room pull out the floss and use it ad hoc as well.  It all depends what you like and what is easiest for you.  Either way you go, they are great choices./TKL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss since it came out - once I tried it I wasn&#x27;t interested in trying anything else.  My teeth are really close together so I have trouble using a lot of other types of floss and there is no way I could ever use the rounded type or the unwaxed stuff.  The price here is similar to what you can find it on sale for at your local store but I always forget to buy it when I&#x27;m out so this four pack is convenient.  My only caution is to make sure you&#x27;re buying the right kind - there is \\&quot;satin floss\\&quot; and \\&quot;satin tape\\&quot;... the packages look almost identical but I do not like the \\&quot;satin tape\\&quot; at all.  That is one mistake you can easily make at the store that you can avoid here!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss.  The mint taste is the best among all brands.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different dental flosses and this one is clearly the best:  1. It&#x27;s not too expensive.  2. It doesn&#x27;t break easily.  3. It does slip between my teeth easily.  4. It doesn&#x27;t slip off my fingers.</li>
    <li> I will be very careful to look at all the fine print when ordering items on Amazon. I received this product but really not sure it is what I ordered. It certainly was not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> You might think it is a bit odd to have a favourite floss. But this is, by far, my favouritest of all the flosses I have ever tried. It is the floss that got me to floss regularly. It slides between my teeth with ease, and leaves my mouth feeling minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you should know: This is an excellent starter floss. The dentist will tell you that you should perchance use an unwaxed floss, or a woven one, because those are better at removing detritus from your teeth and gums. BUT the honest dentist will also follow it up with \\&quot;But if this is what works for you and keeps you flossing, stick with it.\\&quot; Basically this is like floss with training wheels. A floss to get you into the habit, to make things a leetle easier for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this floss and at my last dentist appointment, I was praised for my hygiene and my pink pink gums. Yay for the Oral-B satin tape!</li>
    <li> My dentist gives this to every patient she sees because she believes in this product. I love it because I have tight gaps between my teeth and this flat ribbon floss easily slips between my teeth and helps to clean even those hard to reach places. I like the minty taste it leaves behind and most of all I like the feeling of having clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good product and I recommend it to you.</li>
    <li> I picked up this 2-pack of Oral-B floss on my last trip to the store because it was a bit cheaper than what I had been using, and it looked like virtually the same product. Unfortunately, what &#x27;they&#x27; say is often true: you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that floss is often coated in wax or some kind of substance to allow it to slip between your teeth more easily, but I have never experienced a floss that left my hands tacky and sticky... until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this product does clean between your teeth. The shape and size of it is fine - it slips easily between even tightly-spaced teeth, and doesn&#x27;t often tear or shred (in my experience). Nor does it require a ton of pressure to get it between teeth, like round-shaped floss often does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even just touching the floss, you can feel the tacky texture, and it definitely comes off on your fingers and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend avoiding this one, and checking out the Crest Glide Floss (linked below), even if it does cost a tiny bit more. It does everything this one does, but in addition to leaving your teeth clean, it leaves your hands clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004CSPSQC Crest Glide Floss, Whitening Plus Scope, 38.3 yd (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s not an overly strong mint smell/taste, &amp; the floss itself does not stick. The dual pack lasts you about 2months. Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re teeth are scrunched together then this floss is for you.  Very easy to use and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this a simple review. Because of my teeth being so close together Ive never been able to floss my teeth without getting the floss either stuck or shredding between my teeth. I have no problem at all using this stuff. So, suffice it to say that finally after 41 years on this planet im FINALLY able to start flossing. I really hope they never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> What can I say? These flosses leave the mouth with a fresh feeling, and I really enjoy using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Flossing while watching TV/internet shows is a great way to chill out and develop a good oral hygiene habit while at it :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s minty and it gets between my super tight teeth.  (My teeth are so tight together that dentists have to shave those wedge spacers to be able to use them.)  I used to hate flossing with a passion, but with this floss and a floss holder (it&#x27;s this fork-looking thing with 2 prongs that you can wind floss around), my dentist is actually proud of my flossing. Woohoo!</li>
    <li> Cleans easily and isn&#x27;t too waxy. Works well. There is more than enough floss on each roll to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I used stain floss for years and was very happy with it as it fits easily between the teeth and makes flossing a breeze.  However, every time I went to the dentist I&#x27;d find that my teeth had a ton of plaque build up.  My dentist finally asked me what floss I was using and suggested that I switch to a \\&quot;woven\\&quot; floss.  So I tried this one: [[ASIN:B001E96QJK Reach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss, Fluoride, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a difference!  I can now tell that I&#x27;m actually getting junk off my teeth.  Looking back at the Satin floss, it seems while it was easy to use, it was also not doing the job.  It&#x27;s too thin and flimsy.</li>
    <li> I like to floss. A Lot.&lt;br /&gt;The solid flat strip is just right for me. I can get in between my close together teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;This floss almost never frays, either.</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s a bit thicker than other floss I&#x27;ve tried. I really prefer Glide dental tape but it&#x27;s becoming hard to find where I live. I floss a couple of times a day and go through a lot of floss. The tape does a better job. Most dental floss is too much like thread which seems a bit thin after you are used to thicker floss or dental tape. The tape covers more of the tooth surface, so it does a better job. For floss this is pretty good though. It&#x27;s waxed and flavorless, which I prefer. The best thing about this is the attractive frosted blue package.</li>
    <li> well we all know how is the best tnx oral b. . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been flossing more regularly after the dentist told me I should if I wanted to go to him less often.  The satin floss moves smoothly, but isn&#x27;t very durable.  It tears and shreds pretty easy.  I&#x27;m pretty sure my teeth aren&#x27;t barbed wire, but I may be mistaken.</li>
    <li> I love this floss - it&#x27;s very thin so it doesn&#x27;t hurt when it goes in between your teeth.  Also, it&#x27;s somehow stiff enough for me to thread it in my teeth and between my permanent retainer without one of those plastic needles.  So much easier!</li>
