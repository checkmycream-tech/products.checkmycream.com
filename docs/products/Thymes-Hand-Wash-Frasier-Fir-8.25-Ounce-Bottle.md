    <li> Thymes, you did it again!  :) This cleaner smells just like fresh mountain pine.  It acts as a room deodorizer as you clean, (which does a great job)....beyond satisfied!! I ordered another one by the way, lol</li>
    <li> I purchased this two Christmases ago locally and enjoyed it so much I have continued to use it year round. I am very picky about scents, but this is so fresh and clean smelling. I love it. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the price...but it is not inflated here on Amazon. I am able to buy it here for the same price as elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I went to a friends house, and he had this soap. I liked it so much, I bought two for Christmas. Gave one of them to my cousin, and kept the other.    This soap is great because:    1) It smells awesome. Very natural, not overpowering scent.    2) It leaves my hands feeling perfectly clean after one wash even if they started out  greasy like if I had just eaten ribs or chicken with my hands.    3) Leaves no heavy scent on my hands. With some soaps, the scent they leave is so overpowering that I&#x27;m not sure I even want to wash my hands. This soap leaves a very light natural scent if any at all... and even if it is there, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.    This is a very high quality product, smells 100% like what it says. Try it. You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Christmas every day!</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of pine you will absolutely love this hand wash!! If you haven&#x27;t already..... the Thymes Frasier Fir candle as well as the diffusers are fannnntastic!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect, the price is steep.  I love their reed diffuser liquid and the scent is a perfect match.</li>
    <li> Frasier Fir fragrance is awesome!! I feel like I am in the mountains of Montana everytime I wash my hands!</li>
    <li> This is just about my all-time favorite soap (still love the original Yardley English Lavender). It smells natural and lovely. I use it year &#x27;round and everyone comments on how nice it is. Smells like a walk in the forest--perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using thymes Frasier hand wash  for some  time now I really love its  wonderful pine scent!</li>
    <li> Nice, nice subtle smell, good soapy, delicate, ....  I had used this before and liked it....ordered again.</li>
    <li> I discovered how great this product is when I used it during a visit with my mother. She buys it from Ace&#x27;s Hardware and bought me a bottle and shipped it. I love it so much- makes me think of real christmas tree smell!&lt;br /&gt;Using it just- well- it just makes me happy. I guess this is my \\&quot;crack\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like chemical smells and prefer to use things that are more natural. The smell of this is earthy and well-it&#x27;s an instant Christmas frame of mind for me. I want to bath with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is green yes, but I don&#x27;t mind that. Green is a calming color. I can always use more calm in my life!</li>
    <li> This is my family&#x27;s go-to Christmas fragrance.  I always use the room spray, but have never bought the soap.  Love this scent.  The scent lingers on your hands and is perfect for setting the Christmas mood.</li>
    <li> I love this and have to have it at Christmas!</li>
    <li> Love all Frasier Fir products and use this soap daily in the guest bathroom.  Great product, great seller, perfect transaction!</li>
    <li> This hand soap has a wonderful piney scent. It smells much closer to pine than Mrs. Meyers Iowa Pine. The price is high for such a small bottle, but if you want to treat yourself or get this for a gift it is worth it. I want to try the dish liquid next., which is a much larger size bottle. Hmm, maybe I could use the dish soap for hand soap?</li>
    <li> What a treat to wash your hands in Christmas trees.  I just found these Thymes Frasier Fir products this year at a store, and Amazon had a better price.  You MUST get the diffuser!  It is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it in our guest bath.  My mother-in-law used it and loved it so I&#x27;ve bought more for her.</li>
    <li> my husband is from Minnesota and we live in TEXAS, he loves the way it smells, makes him think of home!</li>
    <li> I chose the 5 star rating, because &amp;#34;Thymes Frasier Fir Hand Lotion&amp;#34; is rich and moisturizing. I have bought it for the past two years and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great smell....I would like a bigger size next time.  Why do I need 8 more words.  ok</li>
    <li> Love all of these products!</li>
    <li> This is a great hand soap.  Not sticky or messy at the sink.  I originally bought it as a set with the hand lotion during the holidays.  I keep it replenished now and it goes well with an earthy theme in the guest bath.</li>
    <li> Fragrant Frasier fir is a treat any time of the year, but especially now.  So glad I took the chance, since I was concerned ab. the scent smelling chemical, as so many do.  This smells like the real thing, however they did that.</li>
    <li> Not overpowering or cloying scent, just nice soft and clean smell. One pump does thorough cleaning of hands. Going to be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; holiday season soap.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase again - scent is way too strong.</li>
    <li> This soap is a fine holiday hand soap. Smells of pine that don&#x27;t remind you of house cleaner, but of the forest.</li>
    <li> great smell along with cleaning power. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering like others.  It is the same soap that I have bought for a lot more money els ware</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product and was excited to gift them to family for the holidays.
