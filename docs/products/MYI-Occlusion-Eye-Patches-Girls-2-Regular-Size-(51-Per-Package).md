      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this brand for my 4 year old son and they fit him perfectly.</li>
      <li>I ordered these for my daughter as I thought the material would be more like fabric and</li>
      <li>These are adorable designs.  </li>
      <li>they seem to hold up better.</li>
      <li>These patches are cute and give my daughter options for each day.</li>
      <li>These were for a five year old girl and fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>When we need to purchase more, we will buy these again.</li>
      <li>her favorite was the ballet slippers</li>
      <li>I love the fact that the child can choose what type of patch they want to wear.  </li>
      <li>Not buying more.</li>
      <li>She loved the print, and they were very gentle when they were removed from her skin</li>
      <li>They have very good adhesive especially on days your at the pool.</li>
      <li>these are our preferred eye patches...good on sensitive skin, and a variety of patterns and colors, which are important to make sure we have one to match the outfit of the day!!</li>
      <li>These made one little girl very happy</li>
      <li>My daughter has to wear an eye patch every morning - these cute patches make the whole process a lot easier!!</li>
      <li>but my daughter did enjoy the designs.</li>
      <li>We have tried other brands, and the options for designs, as well as the cost is very good.</li>
      <li>She thinks they&#x27;re pretty. :)</li>
      <li>Kids think this is a fun tool!</li>
      <li>Maybe these would be suitable for older children.</li>
      <li>They stick nicely and are soft on her skin.  </li>
      <li>They haven&#x27;t left a rash, they are easy for her to pull off, and each day she can pick her own themed patch.</li>
      <li>She loves the designs and makes patch wearing a whole lot more fun.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t imagine them fitting an older kid</li>
      <li>Fun designs but</li>
      <li>They fit pretty well and have pretty designs.</li>
      <li>She took to the idea pretty quickly because she now feels like she has choices to decorate herself.</li>
      <li>If she sweats at all they come off right away.</li>
      <li>The selection is great but the size runs smaller than competetive brands such as Ortopad.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, they do not perform like our go to patches, swing and miss, will not buy another bag even with the pretty designs and cheaper price.</li>
      <li>Even the one who doesn&#x27;t need it, likes to use it ;-)</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>My daughter is 6 years old and they barely fit her while the ortopad patches in the same size fit her quite well.</li>
      <li>so I really wanted these to work out.</li>
      <li>She was very upset at having to wear patches at all, however she has gone the &amp;#34;eye</li>
      <li>My daughter takes the patches off after 4 hours and has so much moisture built up in the patch that it pools in the bottom of the patch and pours out when removing the patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but there isn&#x27;t much room after that.</li>
      <li>if off you really can&#x27;t use it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a deal breaker or a real issue.</li>
      <li>I guess the upside is that they stay on really well, but so do the orthopad brand.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The original idea was that there would be enough patches to make it close to the 2 month mark, but we are using 2-3 patches a day to make it the 4 hours.....</li>
      <li>The adhesive is a little strong, but if you place on your (clean) palm before placing on child&#x27;s face it takes enough &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; off.</li>
      <li>I bought these for my 5 year old and they work very well.</li>
      <li>And this is not a child who is normally allergic to anything.  </li>
      <li>These fit just right for my child&#x27;s small head</li>
      <li>My daughter likes them much better than the plain ones.</li>
      <li>primary reason I rated these 3 stars was due to their inability to breath under the patch.</li>
      <li>Pretty similar to the ortopads...</li>
      <li>So says  the 5 year old!</li>
      <li>My daughter only has to wear these for 90 minutes so they hold up pretty well.  </li>
      <li>very cute, they are blacked out inside for extra protection, and finally it is less of a struggle to get my 6 year old to &amp;#34;patch&amp;#34; daily.</li>
      <li>They are a little thinner and smaller than the ortopad version, I like those better since they are a bit thicker</li>
      <li>The only problem is they do not stick very well.</li>
      <li>I ordered these patches for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>I have been using Ortopad patches for my daughter since she was 7 months old...</li>
      <li>so she doesn&#x27;t really understand why she has to do it and was initially fighting us on wearing them.</li>
      <li>four our 4 year old daughter</li>
      <li>my three year old wont wear a sticky patch.</li>
      <li>She is four years old</li>
      <li>just what i expected, and was delivered 2 day sooner than expected :)</li>
      <li>Such cute designs - but too small for my 4 year old.</li>
      <li>The first time, we thought it was maybe due to the way she removed it.  </li>
      <li>I found that to be true, however they were not large enough to cover her eye properly though the size is listed as medium.  </li>
      <li>Our little girl has fun picking out a pattern.  </li>
      <li>These patches are very cute but the size is a little smaller than the regular size from Orthopad and they tend to be a little to sticky when removing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Kids think this is a fun tool! Even the one who doesn&#x27;t need it, likes to use it ;-)</li>
    <li> Amazon sold them for about half the price I paid going directly to the site. I thought I would receive the same thing with the same quality but I didn&#x27;t. The pictures are fine and my daughter loves them but the quality is poor. They are a little smaller than I expected and they do not stick as well. She is four years old so I couldn&#x27;t imagine them fitting an older kid well. We sometimes have to replace them twice in a day. She has to wear one 4 hours a day everyday.</li>
    <li> These patches are great. My daughter likes them much better than the plain ones. They fit pretty well and have pretty designs.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t as resin-free sticking adhesives as the name brand patches, however I do like the bright colors and the blackening part of the patches. I think those are good benefits.</li>
    <li> very cute, they are blacked out inside for extra protection, and finally it is less of a struggle to get my 6 year old to &amp;#34;patch&amp;#34; daily.</li>
    <li> The designs are nicer than other options out there, however they&#x27;re way too sticky and left a red mark around my daughter&#x27;s eye that irritated her for days... make a better product and you&#x27;ll have my business... until then my suggestion is don&#x27;t waste your money, we used 2 patches and threw the rest away.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving two stars because they&#x27;re really cute, and I like the blackout aspect of them, but my daughter has worn them twice now and both times they left an irritated, painful red mark on her cheek. The other patches she&#x27;s been wearing (Ortopads) have never done that, and she doesn&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Pretty disappointed. Such a waste of money. :(</li>
    <li> Very cute designs. Arrived timely. We have tried other brands, and the options for designs, as well as the cost is very good. However, I think the adhesive is a bit too sticky on these. My daughter never had a problem taking the other brand off, but with these she says each time how it hurts. We only patch for 1 hour each day, so the patch isn&#x27;t on for a long time. When we need to purchase more, we will buy these again. (I have learned to go slower when removing the patch-or I allow my daughter to do it herself)</li>
    <li> These patches are very cute but the size is a little smaller than the regular size from Orthopad and they tend to be a little to sticky when removing. So i will never purchase again but my daughter did enjoy the designs.</li>
    <li> My daughter hates having her eye patched, but having &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; patches makes it easier.</li>
    <li> My daughter needs to wear a patch to strengthen her eye. She&#x27;s only 5 so she doesn&#x27;t really understand why she has to do it and was initially fighting us on wearing them. My wife searched for something to appeal to her inner (and outer!) princess and found these. She took to the idea pretty quickly because she now feels like she has choices to decorate herself. The cute designs are worth it for her and make all of us happy when she&#x27;s happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is the amount of stickiness these have. It&#x27;s not a deal breaker or a real issue. We learned to rub them on our hands 3-4 times and then apply them to her eye (I believe we read it in previous reviews on Amazon). Takes an extra 20 seconds and it keeps my daughter from the discomfort of pulling it off.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on, collects moisture.</li>
    <li> My doughter like it.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Great produce,cute designs</li>
    <li> My daughter has the beginning of a lazy eye and we are trying to opt of of surgery so our doctor recommended these. I bought the cheaper pharmacy brands but the &amp;#34;bandage&amp;#34; type plastic, make her so uncomfortable she won&#x27;t wear them, she loves the patterns and often asks to wear her patch and keeps them on longer than the four hours we were recommended to keep it on each day. She can rub her eye and it doesn&#x27;t come off, she&#x27;s even cried with it on and we&#x27;ve had no issues! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Out of all the patches we have tried this is the best! Our daughter started patching at age 6 months and is now two. She does great with this brand .</li>
    <li> I ordered these patches for my 4 year old daughter. She has to wear them for 4 hours a day for the next 2 months. She was very upset at having to wear patches at all, however she has gone the &amp;#34;eye drop route&amp;#34; and did not like that at all. So after only finding plain old band-aid color patches at the store, we took to Amazon. She was very happy with these designs  her favorite was the ballet slippers so we ordered them. They arrived very quickly! Thank you Amazon Prime. The designs are just as cute as promised, the size is great. She loves the way they look. The only problem is they do not stick very well. After about an hour they start to come off. If she sweats at all they come off right away. She is a very active 4 year old even while wearing a patch. The original idea was that there would be enough patches to make it close to the 2 month mark, but we are using 2-3 patches a day to make it the 4 hours.....</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughter as I thought the material would be more like fabric and less irritating  to her skin.  I found that to be true, however they were not large enough to cover her eye properly though the size is listed as medium.  I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> The patches are a perfect design for my three year old.  They stick nicely and are soft on her skin.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter only has to wear these for 90 minutes so they hold up pretty well.  They are a little thinner and smaller than the ortopad version, I like those better since they are a bit thicker they seem to hold up better.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the patterns.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves them. Fits her nicely.</li>
    <li> As described. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> We have been patching over 3 months now.  These patches have been great four our 4 year old daughter - she loves the designs and the size is perfect.  The adhesive is a little strong, but if you place on your (clean) palm before placing on child&#x27;s face it takes enough &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; off.</li>
    <li> I bought these eye patches for my little girl to strengthen her lazy eye. She is required to wear it for at least 3 hours a day, so after 3 hours we have to peel it off. Well this eye patch does not come off, even after soaking it in soapy water for a bit it is still very hard to peel off. It has left a mark on my daughter and she cries every time it has to come off. I recommend this for long wear, but not for the brief times we need.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 5 year old and they work very well. I usually stick them to my jeans twice right before I put one on her so it isn&#x27;t too sticky. I also use milk of magnesium around the area where the patch is placed to help ease the skin. She loves the designs and makes patch wearing a whole lot more fun. She has also received a lot of compliments. Just wish they also offered the &amp;#34;color your own&amp;#34; ones too! On a side note I&#x27;m not sure how well these would fit on someone who had a larger head. These fit just right for my child&#x27;s small head but there isn&#x27;t much room after that.</li>
    <li> I bought these patches for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter who needs to have her eye patched for fours hours a day, everyday.  We had perviously purchased the orthopad brand and we were trying these because she wanted different patterns this time around.  These patches were incredibly harsh on her face -peeling off and leaving a mark almost like a bandaid would where the orthopad brand left no visible marking on her face at all after four hours of wear.  These were painful for her to get off as well.  I can&#x27;t believe they are marketed for children! I guess the upside is that they stay on really well, but so do the orthopad brand.  I returned the pack after we only used one of these patches and reordered the orthpads.  Truly, I was shocked at the marking it left on my daughter&#x27;s face.  Maybe these would be suitable for older children.</li>
    <li> The colorful patterns make my toddler  much more happy to wear her occlusion patches. And they have a very strong adhesive, so they are hard to just pop off unnoticed.</li>
    <li> These were for a five year old girl and fit perfectly. They are very cute and are comfortable for her to wear. They also stuck well which some of the brands don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Our little girl has fun picking out a pattern.  They stick well.</li>
    <li> These work great for my daughters refractive amblyopia!</li>
    <li> I have been using Ortopad patches for my daughter since she was 7 months old... She is now 3... I decided to give this brand a shot because my daughter liked the designs.... Pretty similar to the ortopads... But a little bit thinner... But I don&#x27;t see how that affects anything. My daughter now will ask to put on her  patch, because she got to pick the designe out. She would fight me with the otherones... All in all great price and product.</li>
    <li> The Eye patches are really cute and my daughter loves putting her patch on now since they are girly! I got her the eye patch book to so she can read it when she wears her patch.</li>
    <li> My daughter has to wear an eye patch every morning - these cute patches make the whole process a lot easier!!</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter instead of going with our typical Nexcare opticlude patches (with a sticker added) for my daughter&#x27;s desire to have it look pretty. However, these have failed to meet the same standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They state that they are hypo allergenic so we went with them due to my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. The patches do result in skin irritation to my daughter&#x27;s face, however, due to the fact that she has extremely sensitive skin I only dock it a half point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary reason I rated these 3 stars was due to their inability to breath under the patch. My daughter takes the patches off after 4 hours and has so much moisture built up in the patch that it pools in the bottom of the patch and pours out when removing the patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is in the winter in Michigan, I hate to see them in summer. To mitigate the sweat we have to put a half sheet of kleenex in the patch to sop up the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I assume the additional adhesive intended to &#x27;let kids be kids&#x27; is the reason they are difficult for my daughter to get off without pain in any instances where she wears them for less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they do not perform like our go to patches, swing and miss, will not buy another bag even with the pretty designs and cheaper price.</li>
    <li> These made one little girl very happy</li>
    <li> Smaller than other patches and the adhesive does not stick very well.</li>
    <li> just what i expected, and was delivered 2 day sooner than expected :)</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my daughter and they were Smaller than I expected even for a 5 year old girl.</li>
    <li> Cute designs and perfect size for a two year old!&lt;br /&gt;We call my daughter&#x27;s patches her &amp;#34;patty cake patches&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m not sure why...) and she actually comes to me and says, &amp;#34;Patty on!&amp;#34;.  She thinks they&#x27;re pretty. :)</li>
    <li> These patches are cute and give my daughter options for each day. Thank you for shipping on time and having the product be a quality product!</li>
    <li> Even though these were supposed to be hypoallergenic, my daughter broke out in hives after wearing them.  The first time, we thought it was maybe due to the way she removed it.  But the second time, the reaction was much worse.  And this is not a child who is normally allergic to anything.  Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> Fun designs but my three year old wont wear a sticky patch. They stick to eyelids as skin and she hated them. Not buying more.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter. They are a perfect fit. It does only work once, so there is not taking on and off. Once it&#x27;s on that&#x27;s it, don&#x27;t take it of or it won&#x27;t stick well.</li>
    <li> My daughter prefers these patches to the eye glasses sleeves.</li>
    <li> They look nice and do the trick. However, the glue is stronger than necessary and getting them back off is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> too small for my 3 year olds eye</li>
    <li> My daughter loved them!  She loved the print, and they were very gentle when they were removed from her skin</li>
    <li> These patches are perfect for my 5 year old daughter. She has been patched since 15 months. We have tried many and these have been the best. They haven&#x27;t left a rash, they are easy for her to pull off, and each day she can pick her own themed patch. ;-)</li>
    <li> Have used these patches for years for patching my daughter&#x27;s eye.  They are adhesive, so they can irritate the skin.  One way that I have avoided this is to put a very thin layer of Aquaphor or even Vaseline around the area where the patch will sit (so thin you really can&#x27;t see it and can barely feel it on the skin-more than that and the adhesive won&#x27;t stick) and that helps a ton when removing it from the skin.</li>
    <li> These are adorable designs.  &amp;#34;Girly&amp;#34;. They have very good adhesive especially on days your at the pool. Other brand just come off with sweat. When I removed these I use a cotton ball with baby oil and allow that to absorb before removing. That way it doesn&#x27;t hurt or leave skin sore or red. My daughter where&#x27;s one everyday for a few months so the area can become red or sensitive.  Baby oil helps alot.</li>
    <li> The slightest moisture and they do not stick, but work well enough</li>
    <li> Such cute designs - but too small for my 4 year old. They would stick to her eyebrow which is never nice when they need to be removed. But for a younger child I would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> unlike the previous brand we had...these were hard to get off.  the skin around her eye was red and sore for a couple days and we haven&#x27;t put them back on her.</li>
    <li> The product is well-made and the designs are very nice so I really wanted these to work out. Unfortunately, the adhesive seems to cause my daughter&#x27;s skin to get very red and irritated.  That&#x27;s something that never happened with The Ortopad patches we&#x27;ve been using for the last 2 years.  I guess we will stick with them even though there are less designs for her to choose from.</li>
    <li> My only complaint about this brand of patches is that they are a little small. My daughter is 6 years old and they barely fit her while the ortopad patches in the same size fit her quite well. I&#x27;ve purchased this brand for my 4 year old son and they fit him perfectly. If your child is over the age of 6 you might want a different brand.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the child can choose what type of patch they want to wear.  The only down fall is once you take if off you really can&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> The selection is great but the size runs smaller than competetive brands such as Ortopad.</li>
    <li> these are our preferred eye patches...good on sensitive skin, and a variety of patterns and colors, which are important to make sure we have one to match the outfit of the day!! So says  the 5 year old!</li>
    <li> Returned, left a rash on my granddaughter&#x27;s face.</li>
