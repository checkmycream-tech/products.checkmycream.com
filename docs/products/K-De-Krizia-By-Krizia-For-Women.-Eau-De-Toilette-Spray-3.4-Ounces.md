      <li>Brought it as a gift for a friend, and she love&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and get so many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also her favorite.</li>
      <li>Not the one I was looking for, there are many Krizia&#x27;s</li>
      <li>so I am okay with it.</li>
      <li>Too many options for one product</li>
      <li>(I prefer the eau de toilette as it&#x27;s a bit lighter, making it a better choice for both daytime and evening use.</li>
      <li>This is my most favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>but a spray is more convenient.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance: has been one of my favorites since ever...</li>
      <li>I was glad to find this fragrance</li>
      <li>Part of a sexy sensual women is the way she smells.</li>
      <li>I just love the scent of Krizia.</li>
      <li>Wonderful price for a long time favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>Not so easy to find my favorite perfume, but no problem on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I gave myself a wee test spritz of the eau de parfum, just to see if it&#x27;s the real deal, and the good news is that the Fragrance Factory seems to be selling the true K de Krizia fragrance.</li>
      <li>And Krizia is fabulous.</li>
      <li>It had such great memories for me.</li>
      <li>I love this scent is transport you to Italy right away</li>
      <li>She liked a lot Brit but fell in love with Krizia as the fragance is totally different from what you find in today&#x27;s market.</li>
      <li>The irony here is that I seem to have found a source for the true K de Krizia fragrance, but dealing with The Fragrance Factory is a bit dicey.</li>
      <li>Anyway, if you dare to order from them, this company appears to have the real fragrance, but if ordering online, be sure to check the item quantities in the shopping cart, and just pray that you receive the item(s)</li>
      <li>We had used this years ago and thought it would be cool to get it again.</li>
      <li>I loved this scent back in the 80&#x27;s!!</li>
      <li>Recently, however, I decided that I wanted to have this wonderful fragrance back in my collection.  </li>
      <li>Any time its available at a reasonable price.....</li>
      <li>Not to loud -not too soft -more powdery fragrance -I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for many years -would</li>
      <li>It was priced just right, arrived fast, packaged in its original box and freshly scented.  </li>
      <li>...it doesn&#x27;t last more than 24 hours.</li>
      <li>For me, the only reputable source from which to purchase it had been an official Krizia boutique.</li>
      <li>I first smelled this scent on a friend of mine.  </li>
      <li>is light sweet and have a delicate aroma that it will make you day dreaming love it so very much.</li>
      <li>The eau de parfum starts up warm and gets much warmer, which can be a bit too heavy for day</li>
      <li>Received this item before the specified date and it was packaged very well, as always with Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The scent has nothing to do with the real K de Krizia.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need much for a pleasing aroma.  </li>
      <li>So very grateful</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.....</li>
      <li>She told me it was K de Krizia and was surprised that I was able to still smell it since she had applied it early that morning and it was now early evening.  </li>
      <li>This seems to be a different scent than the original K de Krizia.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant but not the same.</li>
      <li>I was highly dissappointed in this product.</li>
      <li>highly recommend -I luv</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s a deeper golden yellow, or almost orange (like the fragrances I received from FragranceX.com), you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s oxidized and will smell vile.</li>
      <li>Everything fine other than the amount not being as advertised (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).</li>
      <li>and I thought I would have to find a new perfume.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Krizia uomo for more than 30 years (besides other fragances) and this time i wanted to share and equal fragance with my wife</li>
      <li>And oddly, though the outer packaging is new and original, the label on the bottle looks as if it had been peeled off and reapplied, and is torn, scratched and frayed.</li>
      <li>This one has a medicinal smell to start with and settles down to a sweeter scent than the original.</li>
      <li>but this new batch in particular doesn&#x27;t last on me, like they used to.</li>
      <li>This was very generous of them, though had I been informed ahead of time, I would have postponed my order until the eau de toilette was back in stock.</li>
      <li>Really was not the same as remembered.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if this is an original product, I used to wear this fragrance 25 years ago, and what I got this time  smells very alike, but not the same.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try this reviewed Amazon source for the eau de toilette since the cost is reasonable, just to see if it&#x27;s possible to get the real Krizia fragrance at such a low price, but if you&#x27;re a true fan of this fragrance and can&#x27;t be bothered with the hit-and-miss routine, I&#x27;d suggest trying the Krizia boutique in New York, if you can find a current telephone number for them...</li>
      <li>If you read JG&#x27;s other reviews, you can see that this person has many recommending the Fragrance Factory, and appear to be a blatant promotion of a non-Amazon source, though they do promise only authentic fragrances, and their prices reflect the promised quality.</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;ve moved from their old Madison Avenue location and are now in the Meatpacking District, though I can&#x27;t find a current phone number for them through any directory or online search -- the old number no longer works, and there&#x27;s no forwarding number.</li>
      <li>I recall it being fresh, a little woodsy and feminine.  </li>
      <li>but because of the many confusing adds I received the toilet.</li>
      <li>I finally received the fragrance today, though it was the large eau de parfum priced at $135 instead of the smaller $65 eau de toilette that I actually ordered.</li>
      <li>I ordered one of the small eau de toilette sizes, hoping it would be the real thing, and got a confirmation for two items, at twice the cost, of course, and twice therather high shipping cost.</li>
      <li>sent me the larger eau de parfum at the same price as the small eau de toilette (my credit card postings confirm that I was only charged for the original item ordered).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is not how I remember it smelling. I think it has gone bad.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this scent on a friend of mine.  It was circa 1985, she had just come back after a long run and was still out of breath when I caught a faint whiff of her perfume.  It was warm, light and very pleasant.  She told me it was K de Krizia and was surprised that I was able to still smell it since she had applied it early that morning and it was now early evening.  I decided to try it for myself.  I was in love!  I wore it for many, many years as my own signature scent.  Time passed and I moved on to other fragrances.  Recently, however, I decided that I wanted to have this wonderful fragrance back in my collection.  I spent time hunting it down on the &#x27;net, doing some comparison shopping and buying it from this Amazon seller.  It was priced just right, arrived fast, packaged in its original box and freshly scented.  The compliments from my husband and a couple of strangers reminded me of why I loved this fragrance.  I am so happy to have found it again and wear it when I want to smell ultra feminine.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon.....you&#x27;re the best!!!!!!!! This fragrance best describes &amp; defines me. I feel like I have a pulse again. I wish every women would feel the way I do when embraced by Krizia..... sexy &amp; captivating!   What a REUNION!!!</li>
    <li> Not the one I was looking for, there are many Krizia&#x27;s so do your research!!</li>
    <li> Not so easy to find my favorite perfume, but no problem on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using K De Krizia for almost 30 years and still love it.  It was almost impossible to find 2 years ago and I thought I would have to find a new perfume.  Thankfully it&#x27;s back.  Great fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t announce it&#x27;s presence before you do - nor does it leave an &amp;#34;after odor&amp;#34; telling the world where I&#x27;ve been,</li>
    <li> Excellent! it was a good investment because in my country it is too spensive&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yolanda Da Silva D</li>
    <li> Fans of this fragrance (either in eau de toilette or eau de parfum versions) will know that it&#x27;s been very difficult to find for the past decade. For me, the only reputable source from which to purchase it had been an official Krizia boutique. I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance exclusively since it&#x27;s debut in 1981 until it was no longer distributed in the US. I usually ordered it directly from the Krizia boutique in New York until even they no longer stocked it. When I called them in the fall of 2012, I was told they would begin carrying it again in the spring of 2013, so I tried to call to place an order. But they&#x27;ve moved from their old Madison Avenue location and are now in the Meatpacking District, though I can&#x27;t find a current phone number for them through any directory or online search -- the old number no longer works, and there&#x27;s no forwarding number. So during those times when I couldn&#x27;t get it elsewhere, I&#x27;d ordered the eau de toilette a few times from FragranceX.com. Each time, the fragrance I received was oxidized and smelled like a very unpleasant attempt to copy the original fragrance. I will say that in each case FragranceX.com refunded my money without even asking me to return the product, which was very fair of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to find a new source, I decided to see if I could find it through Amazon. In reading the reviews for this fragrance, I saw that they were rather mixed as regards quality, and then came across the one from \\&quot;JG\\&quot; recommending the Fragrance Factory. If you read JG&#x27;s other reviews, you can see that this person has many recommending the Fragrance Factory, and appear to be a blatant promotion of a non-Amazon source, though they do promise only authentic fragrances, and their prices reflect the promised quality. So I placed an order through the Fragrance Factory site. I ordered one of the small eau de toilette sizes, hoping it would be the real thing, and got a confirmation for two items, at twice the cost, of course, and twice therather high shipping cost. When I called the company to ask them to correct the order to one item, I received a return call saying my order would be \\&quot;fixed,\\&quot; but never received the written confirmation I requested for the correct order quantity/cost. I finally received the fragrance today, though it was the large eau de parfum priced at $135 instead of the smaller $65 eau de toilette that I actually ordered. (I prefer the eau de toilette as it&#x27;s a bit lighter, making it a better choice for both daytime and evening use. This fragrance \\&quot;warms up\\&quot; quite a bit during the course of the day, and by evening, it&#x27;s plenty deep enough for nighttime wear. The eau de parfum starts up warm and gets much warmer, which can be a bit too heavy for day wear).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling The Fragrance Factory once again to let them know I received the wrong item, I got a return call saying that they had run out of the eau de toilette, and sent me the larger eau de parfum at the same price as the small eau de toilette (my credit card postings confirm that I was only charged for the original item ordered). This was very generous of them, though had I been informed ahead of time, I would have postponed my order until the eau de toilette was back in stock. I gave myself a wee test spritz of the eau de parfum, just to see if it&#x27;s the real deal, and the good news is that the Fragrance Factory seems to be selling the true K de Krizia fragrance. The irony here is that I seem to have found a source for the true K de Krizia fragrance, but dealing with The Fragrance Factory is a bit dicey. When you select one item on their website, it automatically doubles the quantity in the shopping cart. I tested it again today and the same thing happened (at least it does on my Mac, using Firefox as the browser). Also, their shipping costs are a bit steep ($12 to send what was supposed to be one 1.7 ounce item between Washington State and Northern California, and that same shipping cost applies to each additional item. So if you order, say, three 1.7 ounce bottles of eau de toilette, you&#x27;ve racked up a hefty $36 in shipping fees, but maybe you could get them to adjust the fee if you call them instead). And oddly, though the outer packaging is new and original, the label on the bottle looks as if it had been peeled off and reapplied, and is torn, scratched and frayed. Strange... Anyway, if you dare to order from them, this company appears to have the real fragrance, but if ordering online, be sure to check the item quantities in the shopping cart, and just pray that you receive the item(s) you actually ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for other sources, be wary of those companies offering K de Krizia on the cheap. If you&#x27;ve ever used or smelled the original, you&#x27;ll likely be disappointed, to say the least, and at worst, you&#x27;ll want to take a shower immediately after applying these stale/oxidized/erstatz versions. The liquid should be a pale straw color. If it&#x27;s a deeper golden yellow, or almost orange (like the fragrances I received from FragranceX.com), you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s oxidized and will smell vile. But at least FragranceX handles orders professionally, which is a bit like that old joke about a restaurant that serves bad food, though the portions are generous! I&#x27;m going to try this reviewed Amazon source for the eau de toilette since the cost is reasonable, just to see if it&#x27;s possible to get the real Krizia fragrance at such a low price, but if you&#x27;re a true fan of this fragrance and can&#x27;t be bothered with the hit-and-miss routine, I&#x27;d suggest trying the Krizia boutique in New York, if you can find a current telephone number for them... If so, please share the number in the comments section!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/27/13 UPDATE: Sorry to make this long review even longer, but after using this fragrance (purchased from The Fragrance Factory) a second time, it became obvious that the scent is noticeably \\&quot;off\\&quot; and smells horrid. Had to take a second shower to wash it off just so I could go tothe market without offending other shoppers. Sigh... another $65 (+ 12 shipping) wasted. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this fragrance only if/when it&#x27;s in stock at an official Krizia boutique.</li>
    <li> Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite perfume.  It is semi-sweet but not over-powering.  A very elegant scent.  Unfortunately, i had not been able to find it in quite some time.  So, I am delighted to have found it on Amazon and will be sure to order more of it!.</li>
    <li> Not to loud -not too soft -more powdery fragrance -I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for many years -would highly recommend -I luv it</li>
    <li> We had used this years ago and thought it would be cool to get it again. Really was not the same as remembered. Seller was responsive and offered to refund. We accepted.</li>
    <li> I started wearing this perfume in 1981 and bought its from Neiman Marcus at $. 80.00 a bottle. The fragrance I got from you was nice but it didn&#x27;t hold up. The scent did not last liketgone I had been used too. I had hoped for the same fragrance and bought the spray and then the perfume also. I was highly dissappointed in this product. It had such great memories for me. I am moving on to something wear and more and hopeful Bette quality. It broke my eart. However, I am fndng fragrances n or Ike at a god pie and sme  ve great hoe for. Thank you or providing me.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  Love the smell and get so many compliments on it.  Can not find in the stores.  So very grateful it&#x27;s on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The scent has nothing to do with the real K de Krizia. This is a terrible imitation of the original!</li>
    <li> ...it doesn&#x27;t last more than 24 hours. I love the fragrance: has been one of my favorites since ever...but this new batch in particular doesn&#x27;t last on me, like they used to. Are they putting less alcohol in the new ones? what is the difference? I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells awesome, like always, but it doesn&#x27;t last like before. Are these fragrances originals? Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance since the mid-nineties. It is my go-to fragrance to which any other fragrances I purchase &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; measure up! Any time its available at a reasonable price.....I buy!</li>
    <li> Not over powering fragrance.  Don&#x27;t need much for a pleasing aroma.  Will stay with you all day long. Received this item before the specified date and it was packaged very well, as always with Amazon.  I love shopping on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I just love the scent of Krizia. It makes me feel good when I put it on. And completes my look. Part of a sexy sensual women is the way she smells. And Krizia is fabulous.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price for a long time favorite of mine.</li>
    <li> I loved this scent back in the 80&#x27;s!! I recall it being fresh, a little woodsy and feminine.  What I received is awful. It smells like it has been it the bottle past it&#x27;s expiration.  It was probably in my mailbox too long cooking in the 100 degree heat of Texas. Unfortunately this scent was either spoiled from the heat or it has been in a warehouse for too long.</li>
    <li> Too many options for one product I wanted the perfume but because of the many confusing adds I received the toilet. but i like K de Krizia anyway so I am okay with it. If you shop for it be careful you could also end up with the wrong product.I wish they would make the body cream agaIN</li>
    <li> I love this scent is transport you to Italy right away is light sweet and have a delicate aroma that it will make you day dreaming love it so very much.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a different scent than the original K de Krizia. This one has a medicinal smell to start with and settles down to a sweeter scent than the original. Not unpleasant but not the same. I probably will not be re-purchasing,.</li>
    <li> Everything fine other than the amount not being as advertised (reason for 4 instead of 5 stars). Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Krizia uomo for more than 30 years (besides other fragances) and this time i wanted to share and equal fragance with my wife so I choose to give her two perfumes this christmas, Burberry&#x27;s Brit and Krizia. She liked a lot Brit but fell in love with Krizia as the fragance is totally different from what you find in today&#x27;s market. This one has a kind of vintage feeling, classic, like i said she loved!</li>
    <li> I was glad to find this fragrance and I did get my order in a timely fashion.  However, I was under the impression I was getting a spray bottle. I received a splash-on. The packing slip also said it was a spray, it was not. I still like the scent but a spray is more convenient.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a bottle of krizia in 1986 and I have been hooked ever since,I was searching and searching and could not find it,something told me to try amazon and I would like to say thank you I will never be without it again,I even gave my sister one for her birthday it&#x27;s also her favorite.</li>
    <li> Brought it as a gift for a friend, and she love&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is an original product, I used to wear this fragrance 25 years ago, and what I got this time  smells very alike, but not the same. Still smells good.</li>
