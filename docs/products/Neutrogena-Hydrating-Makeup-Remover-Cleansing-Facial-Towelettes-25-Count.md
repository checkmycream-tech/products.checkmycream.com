      <li>Good I need to order more</li>
      <li>Found my best new makeup wipes.</li>
      <li>Took off my makeup, including eye makeup very easy.  </li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my opinion that most makeup towelettes are not getting all the makeup off, not just this brand.</li>
      <li>Love these cleansing towels...</li>
      <li>Love these</li>
      <li>Love this....</li>
      <li>MK stopped carrying my favorite toner.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing which is great.</li>
      <li>a lot more leftover makeup comes off.</li>
      <li>Love the absorbency of these wipes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more :)</li>
      <li>I love these makeup cleansing towlettes.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to use, takes all gooey makeup off very easily.  </li>
      <li>Soft, moisturizing, effective at removing makeup, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>this is the ideal travel companion and the brand has always been terrific for my skin.</li>
      <li>I can use them to remove my eye make up easily</li>
      <li>but I find these are the most gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I use these at night and the scent was so strong I couldn&#x27;t sleep and had to rinse it off.  </li>
      <li>They have a strong smell and my face feels sticky and slimy after using.</li>
      <li>They work fabulously.</li>
      <li>i like the original ones a lot.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I need to use two if I have on a lot of makeup, but I still thought my face was getting clean.</li>
      <li>But these ones dont leave me feeling clean.</li>
      <li>You just feel clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the regular type of these cleansing cloths - but this Hydrating version has a very strong perfumy, aftershavy smell that is really overwhelming and lasts and lasts for hours.  </li>
      <li>They are soft, gentle, and have a pleasant clean fragrance, not perfumey, or clinical.  </li>
      <li>It has a pretty strong smell, I still use moisturizer after using.</li>
      <li>These ar e fantastic wash clothes when you don&#x27;t have time for you whole routine I have been using these for more years than I am willing to emit to  Ha ha.</li>
      <li>Rinsing after may be okay for many people, but for me, once you add enough steps to the process, you may as well just wash your face the old-fashioned way.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and they leave my face so soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I am very senstive to strong chemicals, this one has it, I broke out all over my face.</li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve used mineral oil to remove stubborn eye makeup, but it irritated my eyes and was very greasy, and oil free removers either irritated my eyes or did not remove all the make up.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant-smelling; fresh, not perfumey.</li>
      <li>The only time I have any problem with them removing any kind of makeup is when I wear waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>Fresh.</li>
      <li>I have dry sensitive skin, so these wipes are perfect for cleansing my face without stripping away my natural oils.</li>
      <li>They clean well, don&#x27;t irritate my skin and remove eye makeup very well.</li>
      <li>They are gentle on my skin and do not leave it feeling oily but really clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And since they stopped selling my beloved Nivea Visage Eye Remover cream, this is the best I&#x27;ve found for removing every little trace of the tough stuff.</li>
      <li>In the past, I always thought that makeup remover towelettes worked great.</li>
      <li>my headline says: it gets the first layer off, but I have found that you need to do additional cleansing to really get your face clean.</li>
      <li>I have used many different brands</li>
      <li>Would prefer more of them and slightly smaller.....</li>
      <li>I like the smell of the regular ones better than this one.  </li>
      <li>These makeup remover cloths work really well!  </li>
      <li>mild fragrance, soft touch, mild cleansing action.</li>
      <li>Very perfume-y smell works well though</li>
      <li>Very happy...will continue to purchase ...</li>
      <li>if I use two of these wipes, there is *still* makeup on my face; this is evidenced by how much makeup I find in the Clarisonic brush after cleaning my face.</li>
      <li>work very well for removing makeup,gentle on the skin,good for cleansing face before using moistureizer</li>
      <li>I really like this brand and how well it cleanses my face.</li>
      <li>these are more than I expected...</li>
      <li>However I do need to use one to remove make up then another one to really get everything off.</li>
      <li>Normally I only use natural products, but I love these.</li>
      <li>After trying other Neutrogena wipes, Costco brand ones, and Ponds ones, these are my favorite.</li>
      <li>It cleans much better than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I alternate between this product and Fresh Soy Cleanser.</li>
      <li>These are my new favorites.</li>
      <li>you are not wearing makeup, and just want to do a quick face cleaning before going to bed after a very long tiring</li>
      <li>I run the dry ones under water really quickly just to rehydrate them</li>
      <li>These aren&#x27;t any more hydrating than the regular wipes - other than being wetter when using them.  </li>
      <li>So, I use Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara, which means no ordinary makeup remover will do.</li>
      <li>They work really well at removing makeup and leaving my skin hydrated and soft not dry.</li>
      <li>It dries my eyes completely and makes my nose run.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
      <li>they make your skin so soft afterwards.  </li>
      <li>61 years old with allergeries  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>No other product comes close.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am in love with these things! They work great even on mascara and they do not smell bad as some previous reviews stated. Obviously they do have a sent but unless you are extremely sensitive to even the slightest of smells you should be find.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get mascara off as well as it claims but nevertheless I still do like the wipes I probably just won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Leaves Oily Feel after use. Great to get makeup off though</li>
    <li> These are great for getting makeup off and smell nice too.</li>
    <li> Does as it says: removes makeup, removes eye makeup.  It has a pretty strong smell, I still use moisturizer after using. Handy product.</li>
    <li> I always remove my makeup with the Neutrogena Cleansing Cloths before washing my face.  Also, I use these cloths to wipe my hands after applying my makeup.  I have tried other brands, but always go back to the Neutrogena brand.  Great product that never irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> Normally I only use natural products, but I love these. Soft, and skin doesnt feel dry after. Only complaint is that they are so big! Would prefer more of them and slightly smaller..... Or I guess I could just cut them in half...</li>
    <li> After trying other Neutrogena wipes, Costco brand ones, and Ponds ones, these are my favorite. I can use them to remove my eye make up easily and they do not leave any residue. I use these every day and buy them  in bulk via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the regular type of these cleansing cloths - but this Hydrating version has a very strong perfumy, aftershavy smell that is really overwhelming and lasts and lasts for hours.  I use these at night and the scent was so strong I couldn&#x27;t sleep and had to rinse it off.  Rinsing after may be okay for many people, but for me, once you add enough steps to the process, you may as well just wash your face the old-fashioned way.  The regular type is much less fragrant.</li>
    <li> Used up 4 packs still love it!! It cleans much better than other brands that I&#x27;ve tried! It does all it claims.</li>
    <li> Great!!  Comfortable to use, takes all gooey makeup off very easily.  Pleasant-smelling; fresh, not perfumey.</li>
    <li> I use these towelettes a couple of times a day.  Not only do they remove your facial make-up but they also work great for mascara, waterproof too!  They are soft, gentle, and have a pleasant clean fragrance, not perfumey, or clinical.  I always have a couple in a ziplock baggie in my purse.  When I travel, which I do often, they always come with me.  They make my skin feel great too!</li>
    <li> Very perfume-y smell works well though</li>
    <li> Removes eye makeup great.</li>
    <li> I wear a LOT of eye makeup, really hardcore waterproof stuff, and these wipes get it all off every time, aren&#x27;t harsh, and don&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> So, I use Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara, which means no ordinary makeup remover will do. And since they stopped selling my beloved Nivea Visage Eye Remover cream, this is the best I&#x27;ve found for removing every little trace of the tough stuff. My only gripe is the cloth has a bit of abrasiveness to it (I don&#x27;t mean to overstate that, it&#x27;s not rough by any means), which means every time I use it I think about how I&#x27;m tugging at my  &amp;#34;delicate under eye area&amp;#34;. But it&#x27;s minimal. Until my Nivea comes back (sniff), I&#x27;ve got this on Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> I wont use any other makeup remover! This removes waterproof eyeliner and mascara with ease and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue afterwards. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I have used many different brands but I find these are the most gentle and effective. Very moisturizing which is great.</li>
    <li> It feels good on the skin. I feel as if it is hydrating the skin and it is not striping of its naturals oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love the absorbency of these wipes. It works well at removing your makeup and  hydrating your face. However, if you have allergies, these scented wipes are not for you. I have severe allergies and the smell of these wipes has me going through flu season all over again. It dries my eyes completely and makes my nose run.</li>
    <li> Good I need to order more</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I have used in my 30 years of wearing makeup, bar none!  For years I&#x27;ve used mineral oil to remove stubborn eye makeup, but it irritated my eyes and was very greasy, and oil free removers either irritated my eyes or did not remove all the make up.  This takes it all off beautifully and leaves the skin moisturized but without any greasiness.</li>
    <li> No other product comes close. Takes off waterproof mascara with minimal rubbing.</li>
    <li> Because it is a Neutrogena product, it is good. However, I don&#x27;t like the scent. I bought this Neutrogena product in a store and the sent was a lot nicer.</li>
    <li> Love these but it&#x27;s a mixed bag as to whether the ones that you get are going to be fully moist or partially if not completely dried out. I run the dry ones under water really quickly just to rehydrate them so I can use them but kind of annoying to have to do that.</li>
    <li> this is the ideal travel companion and the brand has always been terrific for my skin. Using automatic shipments so I am never without</li>
    <li> I love these! I&#x27;ve used other wipes that aren&#x27;t quite wet enough and end up being too rough on the face, almost like wiping it with sandpaper. These have the perfect amount of moisture and remove makeup so easily. I&#x27;ll be buying more :)</li>
    <li> These makeup remover cloths work really well!  The only time I have any problem with them removing any kind of makeup is when I wear waterproof mascara.  Other than that, they work as well, if not better, than any makeup cloths I have tried.  They are gentle on my skin and do not leave it feeling oily but really clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I save money by only using 1/2 a cloth at a time.  I really only need them for eye makeup, so 1/2 of a cloth is all I need.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am very senstive to strong chemicals, this one has it, I broke out all over my face. I like the smell and the texture, but not the results! I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> In the past, I always thought that makeup remover towelettes worked great. Sometimes I need to use two if I have on a lot of makeup, but I still thought my face was getting clean. Then I got a Clarisonic Aria for facial cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I use two of these wipes, there is *still* makeup on my face; this is evidenced by how much makeup I find in the Clarisonic brush after cleaning my face. Usually I use the makeup wipes then cleanse with the Clarisonic. When I first got the Aria, I was shocked how much makeup was left on my skin even though it looked clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my headline says: it gets the first layer off, but I have found that you need to do additional cleansing to really get your face clean. However, it does leave your skin feeling moisturized and not dried out, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found these are good for days you are not wearing makeup, and just want to do a quick face cleaning before going to bed after a very long tiring day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my opinion that most makeup towelettes are not getting all the makeup off, not just this brand. Just don&#x27;t depend on makeup towelettes to do all the work!</li>
    <li> Gets all of my makeup off and refreshes my face every night.  I really like this brand and how well it cleanses my face.</li>
    <li> Was totally dried out</li>
    <li> An excellent product. It does not dry out your skin and works well</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t any more hydrating than the regular wipes - other than being wetter when using them.  I like the smell of the regular ones better than this one.  They do the job though - just personal preference.  They clean well, don&#x27;t irritate my skin and remove eye makeup very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for myself and daughters for stocking stuffers. Come to find out these are more than I expected... mild fragrance, soft touch, mild cleansing action. They leave my eyes feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> Very effective... and leaves the face feeling moist. I have tried other brands that do not work as well as this one. Be sure and purchase the Hydrating Neutrogena Towlettes, they are the best.</li>
    <li> disappointed in the scent. too allergic for me to use. won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> These feel nice. However I do need to use one to remove make up then another one to really get everything off. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and I&#x27;m sensitive.</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin, so these wipes are perfect for cleansing my face without stripping away my natural oils. I alternate between this product and Fresh Soy Cleanser.</li>
    <li> Removes make-up well, but leaves my face a little oily.</li>
    <li> Love this....cloth is good size and it does good job to remove face and eye makeup</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
    <li> Took off my makeup, including eye makeup very easy.  I have sensitive eyes and there was no irritation at all.  Puts moisture back into the skin, so you don&#x27;t feel a dry out after using them.  Found my best new makeup wipes.</li>
    <li> Love these cleansing towels...they make your skin so soft afterwards.  They actually will get 99% of the makeup off your face.</li>
    <li> work very well for removing makeup,gentle on the skin,good for cleansing face before using moistureizer</li>
    <li> Soft, moisturizing, effective at removing makeup, pleasant smell. These are legit.</li>
    <li> I like these towelettes. They do as promised, they remove all my makeup and leave my skin feeling hydrated. I will continue to use these rather than the originals.</li>
    <li> I like these, but not for every night!  They will do the trick and I like the ease of using them when I am tired!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and they leave my face so soft and clean. Fresh.</li>
    <li> i like the original ones a lot. But these ones dont leave me feeling clean. They have a strong smell and my face feels sticky and slimy after using.</li>
    <li> You are paying for convenience but not a great makeup remover. After using it if I go over my face with a toner a lot more leftover makeup comes off. It does have a softening effect and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry but I would say for effectiveness save your money and buy baby wipes.</li>
    <li> I ordered the hydrating wipes. They work really well at removing makeup and leaving my skin hydrated and soft not dry. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the smell. The plus side is it doesn&#x27;t stay on your face so you just have to put up with it while using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the regular wipes for years. These are my new favorites. The cucumber smell is heavenly.</li>
    <li> I love these makeup cleansing towlettes. They remove the makeup with no after feel. You just feel clean. Great!!!! These are my third order.</li>
    <li> These ar e fantastic wash clothes when you don&#x27;t have time for you whole routine I have been using these for more years than I am willing to emit to  Ha ha. And I lwas always told until recently (!61 years old with allergeries  that show up on my face ) that I had peaches and cr am completion This page product doesn&#x27;t sting your face</li>
    <li> I really love these wipes! I travel every week for a living and they are handy.  I actually use them in conjuction with my Mary Kay regimen.  MK stopped carrying my favorite toner. I use the  MK eye makeup remover, followed by the  foaming make up remover. Then I use the wipes as my &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34;. They remove all the excess makeup and dirt. They work fabulously. Perfect moistness and moisturizing. And the scent it yummy! Very happy...will continue to purchase ... I can highly recommend.</li>
