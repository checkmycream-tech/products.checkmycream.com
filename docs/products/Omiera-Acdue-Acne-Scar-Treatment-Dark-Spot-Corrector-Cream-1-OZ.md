      <li>I love this product it works so well</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>Omiera Labs always has such wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it a try, but don&#x27;t use after microdermabrasion! :)</li>
      <li>I have tried many products on my blemishes and nothing works.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;*I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>ALL the acne is already gone :)</li>
      <li>so she has not been able to find an acne treatment that works.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it more than 2 months, without any result with the acne scars.</li>
      <li>I hope you discover Acdue like I did!! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>In order to make sure all reminents of the kit were removed from my face before applying the Acdue, I used an electronic spinning face wash brush.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find this product, I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many products, soaps, retina A etc.</li>
      <li>after that I decided to buy another bottle I thought this would be a good idea for continuing the treatment and that it needs more time, but it really doesn&#x27;t do any change.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m super excited to continue my use of this miracle serum!!</li>
      <li>my acne has cleared up completely, my scars are fading and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and comparable to name brand treatments.</li>
      <li>This is a really strong treatment and burns a bit when you put it on</li>
      <li>I used it twice a day and saw a huge difference in just two weeks.  </li>
      <li>Have tried light and laser treatments nothing.</li>
      <li>It does burn for several seconds after first applied, but feels very good and moisturizing after the burning ceases... which is why I had no idea my face was being tortured in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We just ordered another bottle to see if he can be more consistent with his hygiene and if it will continue to improve his complexion.</li>
      <li>My skin was bright red and screaming for moisture.</li>
      <li>Thanks Omiera Labs :)</li>
      <li>I tend to not expect much from products like these, so that is why I took it to the level I did, but now I know better.</li>
      <li>This cream is remarkable and really gave hope that this process will continue and give life back to damaged tissue!</li>
      <li>They are still there, but the results were significant and I will keep using this product (but never again in the way I first applied it).</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t waste my time reviewing products, because most have not made much of an impact in my life, but Acdue by Omiera Labs has done beautiful wonders for my super sensitive skin!!</li>
      <li>Overall I was very pleased with the results and interested to see what happens long-term!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was SO excited because I have been through many products and this is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
      <li>I have one acne scar on my face that has bothered me for years, right on my cheek.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing, I wish I would have found it a long time ago.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure applying it in the morning would work for me because I&#x27;m not going out like that lol.</li>
      <li>the seller had very fast shipping</li>
      <li>When I did a google search for it, there really aren&#x27;t very many reviews outside of the main website that manufacturers/distributes it which made me a bit suspicious.</li>
      <li>Please do not make my mistake unless you are willing to risk hurting yourself.</li>
      <li>In the first week I saw a difference.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for reading my review!</li>
      <li>With continued use the scars continue to fade, and the surrounding tissue appears tighter, smoother, and just overall healthy in appearance.  </li>
      <li>and overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>She has now been using this product for 3 full weeks, and WOW!  </li>
      <li>In two months of using this, I have only had 1 small breakout and it healed very quickly, which is remarkable for my skin.</li>
      <li>I am surprised this isn&#x27;t called out more clearly on the website or in the product description.</li>
      <li>I will definitely keep using this product to keep my skin looking so youthful and clean!</li>
      <li>After I started storing it upside down it came nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>the skin underneath looks fresh and new.</li>
      <li>As an added bonus, it has softened the look of some fine lines I was starting to get on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I ordered this Acne Scar Treatment for a good friend of mine who has a hard time with acne and acne scars.</li>
      <li>and none helped as much as acdue.  </li>
      <li>I waited until I finished the whole bottle before reviewing.  </li>
      <li>But then again, maybe I&#x27;m just putting on too much at a time.</li>
      <li>and I was spending way too much money on this reordering</li>
      <li>Omiera Labs was kind enough to send this product as well as the eye serum as a free gift, and it arrived within a few days of receiving the email.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me, but it might for you.  </li>
      <li>As with any new product, I was very weary about this.  </li>
      <li>However, I was ready to try something new</li>
      <li>The only way I was able to minimize the pain was to cover my entire face in vaseline.</li>
      <li>in all, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>(it didn&#x27;t burn like the other face lotions I tried and was easy to apply liquid makeup over without it looking funky).</li>
      <li>Then that night I went to apply it again (since the directions suggest applying day and night for best results), but I immediately noticed that it would be a BAD idea to do that again.</li>
      <li>I think with longer term use this product could really help those who desire unblemished skin.</li>
      <li>The only problem I saw with it was the price, but the results were well worth it.</li>
      <li>It sounds strange, but storing the bottle right side up caused the treatment to come out in chunks, no matter how much I shook it.</li>
      <li>The new skin is smoother and lighter.  </li>
      <li>As a bonus, it&#x27;s keeping me from having new pimples</li>
      <li>Scars are lighter, pores are tighter and my skin is sooooo soft!</li>
      <li>I took this product to the next level, so my experience is probably a bit more extreme than what was intended.</li>
      <li>As far as the active acne on my face at the time I used the product, I could see it foam up over it (kind of like peroxide would), and it appeared to be sucked dry</li>
      <li>Acdue has completely changed the look and feel of my complexion!</li>
      <li>new face soft and clear!</li>
      <li>I had tried a number of acne reduction creams before, with limited success.</li>
      <li>Shes had moderate acne pretty much since puberty and has expressed her distress numerous times.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d just do certain spots, but my entire face is covered in acne scars.</li>
      <li>I was searching for an acne product that would clear my skin.</li>
      <li>But I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my scars, which were kind of faint to begin with.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I can see the difference after 2 weeks of using it. I started off with using it once a day then increased it to twice a day.</li>
    <li> Amazing ! I absolutely love this product. The results were very impressive &amp; I started noticing differences in my skins appearances right away. It helped fade touble acne spots. The only problem I saw with it was the price, but the results were well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have such pale skin that every little spot or imperfection just shows up starkly. My goal is to have glowing, clear, ethereal skin. I feel like this treatment is helping me achieve that plan! I like that while it&#x27;s helping to take care of acne issues, it&#x27;s also not so harsh that it dries out my skin the way some products do. The exfoliating and healing properties left my skin feeling and looking refreshed after just a few uses. I think with longer term use this product could really help those who desire unblemished skin. I have some dark spots on my arms left over from childhood that I also plan to try it on. Overall I was very pleased with the results and interested to see what happens long-term!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Acne Scar Treatment for a good friend of mine who has a hard time with acne and acne scars. She is also allergic to benzoyl peroxide so she has not been able to find an acne treatment that works. She has not been using this for very long, so her acne has not completely cleared up, but she is definitely already seeing results. Her skin looks a lot clearer and feels a lot smoother in general. I am so very impressed with this product. Omiera Labs always has such wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I order for my sister who has bad acne and most dry out her fave this one did not and cleared her face also did not leave her skin oily like some washes or creams do.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!  In the first week I saw a difference.  My dark marks are clearing and the acne is going away.  I plan to keep using it everyday and I just ordered another bottle.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t waste my time reviewing products, because most have not made much of an impact in my life, but Acdue by Omiera Labs has done beautiful wonders for my super sensitive skin!! I&#x27;m 30 years old and have suffered from adult acne since about 24 years old. I spent $8k at the LDI in Beverly Hills only to have horrible acne resurface after the initial year...I&#x27;ve taken doxycycline, every kind of herbal supplement, chaste/vitex berry, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, vitamin A, zinc tabs, ClearPoint by LeRossett &amp; I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter product from Neutrogena to ProActive to Oxy10...basically, all of my efforts were useless &amp; every month I&#x27;d have flare ups, really horrible chin acne...I even tried using Idealist and visionaire to help reduce my discoloration due to acne scarring and uneven tone...to say the least, I was disappointed by all of these products &amp; after being completely hopeless, I did my research, read the reviews &amp; decided to try Acdue since the consumer reviews seemed generally exceptional, so I purchased the 0.3 fl oz size as an experiment &amp; honestly I saw a difference in my skin after 3 days!! My skin is sensitive so there was a slight tingling and a little dryness initially, but the red discoloration seemed a bit lifted and my skin felt softer and a little tighter, after about a week and a half, my chin acne seemed to ease up &amp; the brightness of all my spots significantly reduced!! I was skeptical &amp; thought maybe this is a placebo effect, but when I went to visit with friends, they told me that my skin looked noticeably clearer!! Woo hoo!! This is now my 4th week and I just reordered the larger size, 1.0 fl oz &amp; I&#x27;m super excited to continue my use of this miracle serum!! If you are frustrated like I&#x27;ve been (don&#x27;t get me wrong, this won&#x27;t make all your acne disappear magically-i still have a few little bumps that pop up-but nothing like how i had just a month ago)-I totally recommend trying the small size first to see how your skin takes to it!! It&#x27;s a good investment &amp; worth every dollar!!! Thanks for reading my review! I hope you discover Acdue like I did!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This Acne Scar Treatment was delivered in protective packaging and in excellent condition, exactly as descried on product page.  We purchased the treatment lotion in a promotion for testing and review.  I have one acne scar on my face that has bothered me for years, right on my cheek.  I have been applying the scar treatment to this area only, for several weeks now, and have seen a noticeable change and reduction in the appearance of the scar.  I have read that the lotion works on other problems such as age spots and even wrinkles, so will try on these next.  I will report back with any additional results.</li>
    <li> Gunky and sticky.  Useless and expensive.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me, but it might for you.  All skin is different, you know.  It&#x27;s a very nicely packaged item that should be effective if the conditions are right.</li>
    <li> My son has oily skin and from time to time has bad acne breakouts. We tried using other products on him in the past, but they never seemed to clear up his acne all the way.  When I saw Acdue, I thought it couldn’t hurt to try. Soon enough, not only did his acne clear up, but the oily appearance went away too. I can tell he’s happy about it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to try. Shes had moderate acne pretty much since puberty and has expressed her distress numerous times. Drugstore products didnt seem to be giving her the result she was after, so I went online and tried Acdue. According to her, her acne has definitely cleared up and has even faded a lot of her scars. Shell keep using this.</li>
    <li> after a few days of using this, I have noticed that my skin is peeling right around the area that it was applied on. the skin underneath looks fresh and new. the seller had very fast shipping and overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I waited until I finished the whole bottle before reviewing.  It seemed to help with breakouts a little.  But I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my scars, which were kind of faint to begin with.  When taking in account the cost, I will not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I always have such a problem with my skin. I have tried many products on my blemishes and nothing works.  From my acne, also come scars that leave a shadow on my face. I have even tried over the counter products recommended by my doctor. I used this product each night after washing my face and noticed a change after about two weeks. My scars were already lightening up and my overall blemishes were reducing. I will definitely keep using this product to keep my skin looking so youthful and clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for acne scar medication, and I&#x27;ve finally found one that works! I have a lot of acne scars from when I was a teenager. I was compulsively picking at my skin, so it left me with these nasty dark spots on my face along with horrible acne scars. I bought this because I had an Amazon gift card, and it turns out that I made an awesome purchase. My acne scars and my dark spots have faded dramatically and I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month. At about two and a half weeks in to using this product (every night before bed), I noticed that my scars were fading. I was SO excited because I have been through many products and this is the only one that has worked for me. I am currently waiting on another container to come in the mail. The one that I currently have still hasn&#x27;t ran out! I absolutely love this. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It  didn&#x27;t  heal my acne scares or remove my blemishes at all, it does help reduce oil on skin but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to remove dark spots ontop of my lips.  Before purchasing this cream, I was using the Invicible Scars cream.  The icible Scars cream does work for my spots, but not fast enough. I bought the Acdue cream to expedite the process.  One week into using the Acdue, the spots are significally lighter already.  I am very pleased with this cream.</li>
    <li> As with any new product, I was very weary about this.  My wife has some acne scars, and has been very worried lately about dark spots so we were searching out there for a cream or treatment that might work and actually correct the damaged tissue.  She has now been using this product for 3 full weeks, and WOW!  It just the first week, the scars and damaged tissue lightened in color, and were much less noticeable.  With continued use the scars continue to fade, and the surrounding tissue appears tighter, smoother, and just overall healthy in appearance.  This cream is remarkable and really gave hope that this process will continue and give life back to damaged tissue!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my son who suffered from terrible acne and was left with much skin pitting and scarring.  I did buy it at a reduced price to review and give my opinion.  It definately does exfoliate the skin and after about two plus weeks you can see an actual difference.  The new skin is smoother and lighter.  Overall the skin looks so much better and a little bit goes a long way.  I would recommend this for anyone who suffers from acne.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Gave me a really bad break out. Waste of money, don&#x27;t bother trying this product.</li>
    <li> Omiera Labs was kind enough to send this product as well as the eye serum as a free gift, and it arrived within a few days of receiving the email. I love this product it works so well and you can see the difference in your skin only after a few days, the only downside that is resulting in the 4 stars instead of 5 is the high price</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this product when I first came across it. When I did a google search for it, there really aren&#x27;t very many reviews outside of the main website that manufacturers/distributes it which made me a bit suspicious. However, I was ready to try something new and it seemed like the amazon reviews were good so I placed my order. I am really happy I did! I had been using a harsh BP lotion daily, which I am completely off now! Acdue has completely changed the look and feel of my complexion! Scars are lighter, pores are tighter and my skin is sooooo soft! As an added bonus, it has softened the look of some fine lines I was starting to get on my forehead. In two months of using this, I have only had 1 small breakout and it healed very quickly, which is remarkable for my skin. A couple of things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Store the bottle upside down. It sounds strange, but storing the bottle right side up caused the treatment to come out in chunks, no matter how much I shook it. After I started storing it upside down it came nice and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2. DO NOT USE THIS WITH BENZOYL PEROXIDE. I am surprised this isn&#x27;t called out more clearly on the website or in the product description. I made this mistake the first day and had a nasty reaction (bright red and burning skin).&lt;br /&gt;3. This product alone will not get rid of old acne scars completely. I used this product on its own for about a month. I was still not satisfied with the reduction in appearance of my scars, so I added a dark spot lightener (dark spot corrector by proactive). I&#x27;ve had great results since then. The products work well together with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;4. A little goes a long way! One pump day and night is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;5. WEAR SUNSCREEN. nuff said.</li>
    <li> I took this product to the next level, so my experience is probably a bit more extreme than what was intended. Before applying, I used Olay&#x27;s over the counter microdermabrasion kit. In order to make sure all reminents of the kit were removed from my face before applying the Acdue, I used an electronic spinning face wash brush. I towel dryed my face and then applied the Acdue. It burned, but only for a few seconds. I left it on overnight, woke up in the morning and applied it again. This time the burning lasted a little longer but it wasn&#x27;t painful so I let it. Then that night I went to apply it again (since the directions suggest applying day and night for best results), but I immediately noticed that it would be a BAD idea to do that again. My skin was bright red and screaming for moisture. It immediately began peeling and hurt like all heck. The only way I was able to minimize the pain was to cover my entire face in vaseline. Everything else burned. My skin peeled a lot for 3 days, and is still peeling now but is not as noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I could have left the house. It was bad. I discovered a lotion called Vanicream (can be found on Amazon as well) and it worked well for moisure after I got to a point where I didn&#x27;t need the vaseline anymore (it didn&#x27;t burn like the other face lotions I tried and was easy to apply liquid makeup over without it looking funky). My end result? I think I got the results I wanted in less than a week versus several months, but I would never do that again and do not recommend it if this process is something you have considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going forward, I&#x27;m going to apply the Acdue only once a week at night for a while before I attempt to apply it daily or twice daily. I&#x27;d just do certain spots, but my entire face is covered in acne scars. They are still there, but the results were significant and I will keep using this product (but never again in the way I first applied it). The substance is almost like a watered downhair gel... so I&#x27;m not sure applying it in the morning would work for me because I&#x27;m not going out like that lol. But then again, maybe I&#x27;m just putting on too much at a time. It does burn for several seconds after first applied, but feels very good and moisturizing after the burning ceases... which is why I had no idea my face was being tortured in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this product. I tend to not expect much from products like these, so that is why I took it to the level I did, but now I know better. It will work as intended if used properly. Please do not make my mistake unless you are willing to risk hurting yourself. If I hadn&#x27;t stopped when I did I think I could have caused permanent damage to my skin. As far as the active acne on my face at the time I used the product, I could see it foam up over it (kind of like peroxide would), and it appeared to be sucked dry lol. ALL the acne is already gone :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, but don&#x27;t use after microdermabrasion! :)</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> I was searching for an acne product that would clear my skin. I had tried a number of acne reduction creams before, with limited success. There was a substantial reduction in breakouts within a week. I have been using it for a month now and my face keeps improving. I would recommend this for anyone with moderate to severe acne.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement after trying for a month, the dark spot, acne scars are still there : &amp;#60;</li>
    <li> It actually works did notice difference on my skin.  Makes your skin a little dry but just reduced use to once daily and still noticed difference.  I&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne for over 10 years the cystic kind which is horrible and worst with scarring but this has reduced that effect faster I&#x27;m very happy with results.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried everything there is on the market for acne and nothing has worked. Been through the best dermatologist and nothing. Have tried light and laser treatments nothing. This is the only product that has done wonders for my face. I am in love! I recommend everyone who has acne to buy it within two weeks I had a brand new face soft and clear! Can&#x27;t fail with this product!</li>
    <li> I am one to pop pimples on my face every time I get them and cannot leave my face alone. Due to the irritation, I have lots of scars from where I have popped pimples.  I have had these scars for roughly a year or two, and nothing seems to have them fade.  I figured I would try this product and it has already started to fade the scars away! As a bonus, it&#x27;s keeping me from having new pimples so I don&#x27;t have to worry about popping them and scarring in the future!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and comparable to name brand treatments. I highly recommend from personal experience.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend any one to put money for this product. I&#x27;ve been using it more than 2 months, without any result with the acne scars. after that I decided to buy another bottle I thought this would be a good idea for continuing the treatment and that it needs more time, but it really doesn&#x27;t do any change.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend&lt;br /&gt;wasting money :(</li>
    <li> I was very excited to find this product, I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many products, soaps, retina A etc. and none helped as much as acdue.  I used it twice a day and saw a huge difference in just two weeks.  This is a really strong treatment and burns a bit when you put it on but it calm down in less than a minute and was well worth the burn.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this alot. It works well. This will probably be my last order because it is rather expensive. I&#x27;m going to go back to my other cream that works well but just not as fast as Acdue</li>
    <li> We bought one bottle for our son, and he and I both felt like it was helping to fade his dark acne scars. We felt that with just washing with a medicated cleanser and using this product, he was still having some breakouts. So we have skipped the morning application and started using medicated pads after washing. Just using this in the evening after washing seems to be working. We just ordered another bottle to see if he can be more consistent with his hygiene and if it will continue to improve his complexion. Overall, it seems to have made the biggest difference in the scarring that has occurred, so I plan to continue using this product</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing and I would recommend it to people but I feel like its way too expensive. It doesn&#x27;t last long and I was spending way too much money on this reordering had to stop. I would buy again when the price goes down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my hole life. At 34, I had acne and several scars from it as well as age spots from the sun. I was using  two very expensive prescription medications for my adult acne, it only helped a little bit. Since I start using Acdue  my acne has cleared up completely, my scars are fading and my skin looks and feels great. This product is amazing, I wish I would have found it a long time ago. No more prescription lotions for me. Thanks Omiera Labs :)</li>
