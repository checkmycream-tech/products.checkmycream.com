### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They are awesome!!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>I experienced no burning redness or irritation on my acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>My skin feels great after using.  </li>
      <li>and it felt great.</li>
      <li>I actually loved all three.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of ingredients they put in it, but I was horrified.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Makes my skin feel cool, smooth, and fresh!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Squeeze some of it on the inside of your wrist and let it sit for a while to see if you will be able to use this or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t do more than 5.</li>
      <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t get better.</li>
      <li>I removed after ten or fifteen mins and my skin feels awesome!</li>
      <li>I wish I had read these reviews before because like many people on here</li>
      <li>If there&#x27;s no specification, just wait 10 minutes to be safe.  </li>
      <li>I have used many freeman facemasks and NONE have done this.  </li>
      <li>and I have to say I love them.  </li>
      <li>Regardless it applied easily, had a good amount of serum (not oily at all) and didn&#x27;t move around much on the face once applied.</li>
      <li>Their other masks are great though!</li>
      <li>and it was fine.  </li>
      <li>It is cooling and quite comfortable.  </li>
      <li>You put it on and at first it&#x27;s nice, it feels cool.</li>
      <li>idea of it is good- a complete face mask treatment</li>
      <li>I LOVE anything Freeman beauty, I have practically tried all of their products since they are so cheap and fun.</li>
      <li>I would have to agree with all of the other reviews this mask seems really awesome at first but when after wearing it for a while it starts to burn your skin.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Add me to the list who ended up with a bright red, burned face after using this.</li>
      <li>It did help calm the redness a great deal but not completely.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t fool proof since some parts of your face can react different from others, but patch testing is always a good idea.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
      <li>The mask felt moisturizing and cool</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t not notice anything except a mild tingling feeling.</li>
      <li>my face turned bright red right after.</li>
      <li>I had no problems with acne or rashes, my skin type is combination, I clean my face first with face wash, wait about 15 mins, then apply the mask.</li>
      <li>I used all the other masks before this paper mask thinking I should save the best for last because it seemed cool.</li>
      <li>I put this mask on, went to relax in a hot bath and not even a full minute after putting it on, my face began burning.</li>
      <li>I tried this one and the rose one, and my face got so red and irritated</li>
      <li>I wash my face GENTLY, even if you&#x27;re a fan of scrubbing and exfoliating your face, those things essentially mildly irritate your skin.</li>
      <li>This is very important for skin treatments unless the product specifies differently.</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; feels more like an acid being left on your skin.</li>
      <li>First I bought this at Walmart.</li>
      <li>It started to burn pretty soon after I got it on, I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>, sure hope this doesn&#x27;t last</li>
      <li>It really does BURN your face!</li>
      <li>and you have to unfold it, the serum gets all over your hands but absorbs fast, and the eye holes do not line up right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand before and it usually works great, but this particular mask burned my face after having it on for the recommended 10 mins.</li>
      <li>My entire face, with the exception of my eyes, turned bright red.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s portable, disposable, quick, and clean (hence why I bought it), but I would suggest that instead of buying it online and paying extra, just run to walmart and get one for like 67 cents, and DO A PATCH TEST.</li>
      <li>I found the mask fairly easy to apply, but I cut the eye holes bigger because they are way too close together.</li>
      <li>Just like most others, left my skin horribly red and hot!</li>
      <li>Great for sneaking in the bathroom mirror behind your roommate and making them scream.</li>
      <li>I wait 10 minutes after I wash my face no matter how gentle I think the cleanser is</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
      <li>Other than that, LOVE</li>
      <li>I sure hope the burning and redness goes down soon...</li>
      <li>I bought the pink rose mask at this same time as this but figure</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Same exact experience as everyone else!</li>
      <li>Now my face is red and warm to the touch and, like previous reviews, my skin feels dryer than it was before.</li>
      <li>Secondly, I am sitting in my room with a bright red face that burns like hell and have to go to work in a little while.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried this out now instead of waiting for my vacation to do it :-/</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the previous reviewer has extremely sensitive skin, but I experienced no burning or redness during or after use.  </li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m excited to try other products in this line!</li>
      <li>I recommend buying them directly from their website though....</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have fairly sensitive skin too.  </li>
      <li>Only complaint is when you peel it off the paper, it kind of sticks together</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to follow these guidelines before trying anything new or for face treatments in general.  </li>
      <li>I love the small packs of Freeman face products, lets me try them before buying larger versions.</li>
      <li>It is of course still always possible for a particular product to not work for you no matter what you do.)</li>
      <li>A few minutes after I&#x27;ve taken it off and rubbed the stuff in my face still feels cool to the touch.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all, but this has left my face looking</li>
      <li>Gets really cold on your face, good summertime treat.</li>
      <li>Then after a few minutes of it on my face it started burning and now my face is super red</li>
      <li>Not sure what is up with all the people burning, I left mine on til it dried out most of the way</li>
      <li>It stayed that way for at least a whole hour or so afterwards and felt very sensitive to the touch.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just providing the information so that anyone still interested in trying this mask will be able to do so  in the safest, least skin irritatingly way possible.  </li>
      <li>A little seeped into one eye and it got watery but that was really user error not the masks fault.</li>

<li> Especially the pink colored one, you look like you are wearing someone else&#x27;s skin on your face.  </li>
<li> but, From someone with dry skin, Im warning you, Do not do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have dry patches</li>
<li> Secondly, it must have been made for people with tiny, perfectly round eyes, because it was resting halfway on both of my eyelids.</li>
<li> guess!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also really great because of how terrifying the mask looks when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
<li> Always heals my rough spots and helps exzema.</li>

<li> And there is a slight improvement to the dry flaky patches I had before I used</li>
<li> I had no problem using the masks other than the fact the eye holes do not line up with my face.  </li>
<li> I will not be using the pink one at all!</li>
<li> I got this and two other of the Freeman Paper Masks in my Ipsy bag this month.</li>
<li> First off, it&#x27;s ridiculously difficult to remove from the liner and get lined up on your face.</li>
<li> From the first try I knew that the eye holes are weird, I just cut three slits (I will add a customer photo Edit: for some reason I can&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Like almost everyone else this product made my face feel tight, dry and it burns!</li>
<li> I tried covering the redness up with a little foundation but the powder brush felt so rough on my now overly-sensitive skin.</li>
<li> it is not worth it.</li>
<li> but once I have it placed, I just lay down and close my eyes for the 3-5 minutes and relax.  </li>
<li> Definitely less parched and if it were cheaper I would repurchase for winter skin.</li>
<li> half the price....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First I bought this at Walmart. Secondly, I am sitting in my room with a bright red face that burns like hell and have to go to work in a little while. I had this on my face for maybe 3 minutes and my face was burning so bad that I had to take it off. My face is so red that it almost looks like I had a chemical peel</li>
    <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m not sure why I reacted so badly to this product. I tried this one and the rose one, and my face got so red and irritated, I looked like I had a sunburn everywhere except the skin around my eyes and mouth where the mask didn&#x27;t touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of it is good- a complete face mask treatment that&#x27;s portable, disposable, quick, and clean (hence why I bought it), but I would suggest that instead of buying it online and paying extra, just run to walmart and get one for like 67 cents, and DO A PATCH TEST. Squeeze some of it on the inside of your wrist and let it sit for a while to see if you will be able to use this or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wasn&#x27;t a fan and will continue using their Lemon and Mint clay mask (and if you haven&#x27;t tried it, get it while you&#x27;re looking at this one, seriously. It&#x27;s amazing.)</li>
    <li> I have only used this mask once, I received it as an ipsy glam bag item. Lately my skin has been freaking out due to lack of humidity in this nj weather. I found the mask fairly easy to apply, but I cut the eye holes bigger because they are way too close together. Regardless it applied easily, had a good amount of serum (not oily at all) and didn&#x27;t move around much on the face once applied. A little seeped into one eye and it got watery but that was really user error not the masks fault. While it was on it felt cooling but smelled slightly weird. I removed after ten or fifteen mins and my skin feels awesome! Definitely less parched and if it were cheaper I would repurchase for winter skin. I experienced no burning redness or irritation on my acne prone skin. If it makes me break out i will find out tomorrow and update.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions precisely and my face is now burnt horribly. I had to wash off the serum bucause my face was on fire. Do not use this product! The pic is within 5 minutes or removal.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 different trial size masks from freeman. I used all the other masks before this paper mask thinking I should save the best for last because it seemed cool. Totally wrong about this product!!! After I left it on my face for 5 min I took it off and my face began burning like crazyyy!! I rinsed it with cold water but it only got worse! This s*** product gave me red blotches on my face and worst part was feeling like someone lit my face on fire!! I seriously thought I had to go to the ER. I iced my face for about 15 min and put on some Aloe Vera. Now I&#x27;m sitting here writing this review while flames are coming off my face... My sunburn in cabo wasn&#x27;t even this bad! Neverrr using this thing again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone either.</li>
    <li> I put this product in my face, the eye holes were too small and it got into my eyes so I cut bigger holes. Then after a few minutes of it on my face it started burning and now my face is super red and I look like I got sun burnt.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using my husbands account to warn anyone looking at this to not buy it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I put this mask on, went to relax in a hot bath and not even a full minute after putting it on, my face began burning. Like a literal burning!! I felt like my face was in a fire. My entire face, with the exception of my eyes, turned bright red. I had to sit and fan my face for over an hour, and put multiple layers of a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some people do not have an issue with this product. but, From someone with dry skin, Im warning you, Do not do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to wash my face in an all natural soap with cold water just to help get the stuff off. The paper mask is off big time with the placement of eye holes and etc. the &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; feels more like an acid being left on your skin. it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> It left my cheeks burning and red within five minutes!!! My forehead and nose is still white, but the rest of me is burning so bad you can feel the heat radiating from it just by holding your hand near it. It looks like I spent the day in the sun!!! I keep washing with cold water and it just doesn&#x27;t get better. Terrible product!</li>
    <li> This product was terrible! I didn&#x27;t even have it on my face for 5 minutes (which is the lowest recommended time to keep it on) and i had to take it off. It says not to rinse your face afterwards, but it was burning my skin so much that I had no choice but to rinse it with cold water. Now my face is red and warm to the touch and, like previous reviews, my skin feels dryer than it was before. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I got this and two other of the Freeman Paper Masks in my Ipsy bag this month. This is probably one of the WORST products I&#x27;ve ever used. First off, it&#x27;s ridiculously difficult to remove from the liner and get lined up on your face. Secondly, it must have been made for people with tiny, perfectly round eyes, because it was resting halfway on both of my eyelids. Then there&#x27;s the horrible BURNING. My face is feeling dryer than when I put this dumb mask on, my face is extremely red and burning like I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for a few hours with no sunscreen. Terrible product I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this in a monthly beauty box and I have to say I love them.  Not sure what is up with all the people burning, I left mine on til it dried out most of the way and it was fine.  I have fairly sensitive skin too.  Try a patch test I guess!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also really great because of how terrifying the mask looks when it&#x27;s on.  Especially the pink colored one, you look like you are wearing someone else&#x27;s skin on your face.  Great for sneaking in the bathroom mirror behind your roommate and making them scream.</li>
    <li> Just like most others, left my skin horribly red and hot! I&#x27;ve used plenty of face masks before, and never had a reaction to one.</li>
    <li> I love the small packs of Freeman face products, lets me try them before buying larger versions. THIS IS A NIGHTlMARE though! Four minutes after putting into my face (followed directions to the T) it started burning. Like ... Literally burning my face. After pulling the mask off you can see where I didn&#x27;t put it as close to my skin, that part is white. The rest is red like a horrible sunburn!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And done leg my 1 star fool you THIS OZ ZERO STARS. Actually this needs to be pulled off the marker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a paper facial mask before and got this one in a monthly beauty box.  I&#x27;m not sure if the previous reviewer has extremely sensitive skin, but I experienced no burning or redness during or after use.  The mask felt moisturizing and cool while on though afterwards my skin did feel a bit sticky.  Now, I&#x27;m excited to try other products in this line!</li>
    <li> I LOVE anything Freeman beauty, I have practically tried all of their products since they are so cheap and fun. I recommend buying them directly from their website though....half the price....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the paper mask by them. They are awesome!! Only complaint is when you peel it off the paper, it kind of sticks together and you have to unfold it, the serum gets all over your hands but absorbs fast, and the eye holes do not line up right. Other than that, LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel cool, smooth, and fresh!!!!!! And I got them from Freeman Beauty for $2 each, I buy them in bulk and use them every few days!! I had no problems with acne or rashes, my skin type is combination, I clean my face first with face wash, wait about 15 mins, then apply the mask. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I also received three of these masks in an ipsy bag.  I actually loved all three.  I had no problem using the masks other than the fact the eye holes do not line up with my face.  As a previous reviewer said, it overlaps on my eyes eyelids.  This is why I took one star away.  It does take a bit of patience to put the mask on but once I have it placed, I just lay down and close my eyes for the 3-5 minutes and relax.  It is cooling and quite comfortable.  My skin feels great after using.  All skin products will react differently on different people.  This one works for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Smells like HEAVEN!! Gets really cold on your face, good summertime treat. Always heals my rough spots and helps exzema. Buy at walmart though it&#x27;s $1 there.</li>
    <li> Terrible! It really does BURN your face! You put it on and at first it&#x27;s nice, it feels cool. But give it like, 2 minutes and your face slowly starts to get hotter.. after 5 minutes your face will be on fire. I couldn&#x27;t do more than 5. I pulled it off, and my face was burning so bad. It was very red. It&#x27;s been 20 minutes and my face is still badly burned and red.     This is my face 30 minutes after  using this product. You can see the difference in color between my face and my neck: http://oi60.tinypic.com/14ajwqu.jpg        Trust me, save your money and avoid the pain.</li>
    <li> I received this mask, and two others from an Ipsy trade. This is the second mask I tried.  From the first try I knew that the eye holes are weird, I just cut three slits (I will add a customer photo Edit: for some reason I can&#x27;t. Suffice it to say that you just have to snip a couple half inch slits near the outer corner and the eye hole issue is resolved) at the outer corner so that I had bits to fold away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t not notice anything except a mild tingling feeling. A few minutes after I&#x27;ve taken it off and rubbed the stuff in my face still feels cool to the touch. And there is a slight improvement to the dry flaky patches I had before I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do tend to follow these guidelines before trying anything new or for face treatments in general.  1) if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never used before I do a patch test.  So I rubbed some of the serum on a small patch to the side of my face to see if there was any bad reaction. This isn&#x27;t fool proof since some parts of your face can react different from others, but patch testing is always a good idea. 2) I wait 10 minutes after I wash my face no matter how gentle I think the cleanser is, one has no ideas how the ingredients in one thing will interact with ingredients from another.  This is very important for skin treatments unless the product specifies differently. If there&#x27;s no specification, just wait 10 minutes to be safe.  3) I wash my face GENTLY, even if you&#x27;re a fan of scrubbing and exfoliating your face, those things essentially mildly irritate your skin. Products like this should not be used on irritated skin unless you patch test and know it&#x27;s not going to further irritate it.  (please note: I&#x27;m not saying that just because someone else had a bad reaction, that it must be because they didn&#x27;t do these things, or that if you do these things it&#x27;s impossible to get a bad reaction.  I&#x27;m just providing the information so that anyone still interested in trying this mask will be able to do so  in the safest, least skin irritatingly way possible.  It is of course still always possible for a particular product to not work for you no matter what you do.)</li>
    <li> Wow. Should have read the reviews on this product before I put it on my face. Same exact experience as everyone else! It started to burn pretty soon after I got it on, I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on for 5 minutes. My face is all puffy and red, feels like I&#x27;ve been out on the sun for hours. I sure hope the burning and redness goes down soon...I would hate to go into work looking like this tomorrow.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE this product!! I do not have sensitive skin at all, but this has left my face looking like I just got a really bad sunburn. My face is burning and it&#x27;s really red. Hope it clears up soon</li>
    <li> Seriously people, read the reviews before you buy, I wish I did that before I put this stuff on my face... I have never ever had any sensitivity issues with any products, but this mask almost burned your face! I had it on for about 5 minutes and as soon as I took it off I was terrified! My face was patchy red, looked like I got a chemical burn or something. I don&#x27;t know what kind of ingredients they put in it, but I was horrified. Thankfully, the redness went away within 2 hours, but I had to use Hydrocortisone and took anti-allergy pill as well. Stay away, this thing is seriously dangerous.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews before because like many people on here my face turned bright red right after. It stayed that way for at least a whole hour or so afterwards and felt very sensitive to the touch. I tried covering the redness up with a little foundation but the powder brush felt so rough on my now overly-sensitive skin. I would not recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to always patch test guys (unlike me)! Their other masks are great though!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how I feel about this product! I bought this and the pink one at walmart. Literally went and got it. I have tried this blue one with my friend before and it worked for us both and it felt great. But i decided to buy it again and when I put it on, not even 5 minutes , my face started to burn. So I took it off and my face was red! It looked like I had been in the sun for quite some time! I don&#x27;t know what happened but this obviously is not just from buying online guys! This product I say is not recommended for anyone. It was a hit and miss for me it seems. I will not be using the pink one at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and it usually works great, but this particular mask burned my face after having it on for the recommended 10 mins.</li>
    <li> Wow I am so disappointed in this face mask. I have used many freeman facemasks and NONE have done this.  I bought this because it said it was to going to MOISTURIZE my face. WELL IT DIDNT. I left it on for 10 minutes and when i took it off my fave looked like a tomato. Thank god i had the avocado and oatmeal face mask It made the redness and burning go away. NEVER USE!</li>
    <li> Like almost everyone else this product made my face feel tight, dry and it burns! Wth?!? I put some lotion on but it has not helped, sure hope this doesn&#x27;t last and I&#x27;m glad I tried this out now instead of waiting for my vacation to do it :-/</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice.  I have sensitive skin.  This product was soothing and moisturizing.  I left it on for 20 minutes while I watched tv.  It did not burn my face like some others mentioned.  Took away the dryness I kept getting around my mouth.  1.29 at walmart</li>
    <li> I would have to agree with all of the other reviews this mask seems really awesome at first but when after wearing it for a while it starts to burn your skin. I literally look and feel like I was out in the sun for several hours! This product is horrible!</li>
    <li> Add me to the list who ended up with a bright red, burned face after using this. Had it on for about 5 minutes when I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer. Removed mask to discover what looked like a bad sunburn. Immediately washed off all of the liquid, rinsing for several minutes, then applied cortisone cream liberally. It did help calm the redness a great deal but not completely. I bought the pink rose mask at this same time as this but figure eventually I&#x27;ll just throw it out. Never again.</li>
    <li> Literally just took this mask off and left it on for 10 minutes, did not burn my face at all. I have dry patches so I was going to see if this mask would work for that. it did leave my face sticky-ish from the left over serum from taking the mask off. I would just use this to travel with not a every day routine. Overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
