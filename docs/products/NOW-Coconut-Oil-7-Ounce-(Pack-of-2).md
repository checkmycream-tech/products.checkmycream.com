<ol>
      <li>and it works great!</li>
      <li>Very Good .</li>
      <li>This was a great coconut oil for my lotion and whipped up beautifully.</li>
      <li>Great product to use on hair.</li>
      <li>If your hair is course, this product works great for growing your hair out and reducing splitting.  </li>
      <li>I still used this coconut oil for my lotions and lip balm and they turned out great.  </li>
      <li>DOES NOT smell like coconut (was my expectation, lol).</li>
      <li>Still love this product...was that greasy!!</li>
      <li>The shipping was also good.</li>
      <li>All of my friends loved it.</li>
      <li>Okay bought this oil and it work great on my skin, it absorbs well.</li>
      <li>The oil is very smooth can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up through the winter months on our hands and FEET!</li>
      <li>Nature has the answer to healthy skin!</li>
      <li>I liked the coconut oil, there was no scent however</li>
      <li>I  make my own hair care products.  </li>
      <li>but it melts quite nicely.</li>
      <li>I make my own lotion, hair treatments, and clay masks.</li>
      <li>It makes your skin very soft and it is excellent for the hair.</li>
      <li>my scalp drinks this oil up like there is no tomorrow.its very lightweight and lasts a very good amount of time.</li>
      <li>So far, the coconut oil has been wonderful.</li>
      <li>Perfect for natural hair.  </li>
      <li>far the best skin product I have ever encountered!  </li>
      <li>about 15 seconds until warm and put in hair from bottom to top.</li>
      <li>Great product fast service!</li>
      <li>I noticed after each time I use it, the ends of my hair look better.</li>
      <li>Still love this product...</li>
      <li>I tried lots of oils, petreleum jelly, but this coconut oil is my &#x27;magic potion&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I think it has evened out my skin tone and gives me a more refreshed look, which is something Oil of Olay just didn&#x27;t do.</li>
      <li>I ordered this in hopes that this would be some miracle in a jar like most of us ladies want.</li>
      <li>I mix it with jojoba, grapeseed, honey, and conditioner for a pre-poo and my hair gets an instant detangling and is superbly moisturized.</li>
      <li>But for my hair not so well, I found I had to oil my hair more than twice a week.</li>
      <li>I use shea butter or vitamin e oil for desired results, as for hair its ok, but then again I&#x27;ve started using shea butter for that too, it seems to keep my hair well oiled and coated in sheen.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, although this is not a miracle wrinkle remover, my skin has never looked better and my split ends are going away.</li>
      <li>You will love it like the rest of us do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also makes a great hair pomade, and is much healthier for your hair than most hair products.  </li>
      <li>This is the best for the skin, especially if you have imperfections like scars.  </li>
      <li>I still apply lotion after I use this oil on my body, but it&#x27;s more for the fragrance than for dryness.  </li>
      <li>I use this product more on my body after bathing than on my hair though.  </li>
      <li>Good for many uses hair, body including ruff feet and heels :) Being all natural it is non-toxic which is also a plus for children.</li>
      <li>Now the good news: When I went to wash my hair again after the mishap, I decided not to put in my normal conditioner, I just shampood.</li>
      <li>Now the good news: When I went to wash my hair again after the mishap, I decided not to put in my normal conditioner, I just shampood.</li>
      <li>It is light, does not clog my pores, does not make me look oily, and works well under make-up.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for any skin type</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper and more versatile than most beauty products.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would&#x27;ve loved is if it would smell more like a coconut.</li>
      <li>I originally thought that it was going to have a softer consistency.</li>
      <li>Clean and non-scented.</li>
      <li>Works great on dry, winter skin.  </li>
      <li>and of course the laugh lines are starting to show more and more every day.</li>
      <li>I read in an article that pure coconut oil is great for really dry hair</li>
      <li>First time trying coconut oil!</li>
      <li>Very light, all natural oil, without the the yucky build-up.</li>
      <li>Very light natural scent, not perfumy.</li>
      <li>Love this natural moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I like the way that it is instantly absorbed into my skin.  </li>
      <li>This oil keeps my hair naturally shiny, my scalp healthy and my hair hydrated.</li>
      <li>I applied it to my hair and it seemed to absorb right away.  </li>
      <li>this is not the right product for you.</li>
      <li>I put it right on my face about 30 minutes before bed.</li>
      <li>Apparently this brand had used a process that removed the scent from the oil, it still was useful for my hair however, but I would have enjoyed the smell as well.</li>
      <li>I made the mistake of putting it on right before bed the first night and when I put my face on my pillow, the pillowcase absorbed it because it didn&#x27;t have time to absorb into my skin.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought coconut oil</li>
      <li>I applied it to my hair and left it in for about 20 minutes and when I washed it out my hair was silky smooth!</li>
      <li>this was my first time buying coconut oil</li>
      <li>It does leave a oily print used on skin and touching glass or similar.</li>
      <li>It helps you to grow your hair long and healthy.</li>
      <li>I did some research and discovered coconut oil has been used in so many cultures for so long for skin and hair care.</li>
      <li>, pure coconut oil will soften your heels, elbows--i even use it on my face.  </li>
      <li>Said Pure, etc etc but deodorized takes out the scent and goes through a process to do it.  </li>
      <li>I really notice an improvement on my thighs, calves, arms, chest &amp; face.  </li>
      <li>Works very well with my hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing but the real deal.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight</li>
      <li>I like this very well.  </li>
      <li>I am an african american female and this oil works great on my hair.</li>
      <li>REALLY well on zits.</li>
      <li>I apply it on my hands and it doesnt seem to make my hands feel very moisturized, it absorbs very quickly, and my hands kinda feel dry again soon after.</li>
      <li>which I found odd since coconut oil has such a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>If you just want a decent natural moisturizer this is fine, but is you are looking for extra virgin cocnut oil</li>
      <li>and I rinsed it like I would normally do with a conditioner.</li>
      <li>So, I used my normal shampoo and conditioner as normal</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for natural hair.</li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like that the product came in solid form</li>
      <li>My hair is very dry and super curly.</li>
      <li>It is processed and not raw.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all clearly stated in the product information.</li>
      <li>I add this to my mixture of  cream to help soften my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I apply this throughout my hair and it leaves it so soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>and wow was it soft.</li>
      <li>When I opened the jar I was surprised by the solidity of the oil.  </li>
      <li>I have been trying to use 100% natural products.</li>
      <li>is so soft and looks brighter than ever.</li>
      <li>It makes it extremely soft</li>
      <li>and wow was it soft.</li>
      <li>I have not tried to use it all over my hair just yet only because my hair tends to get greasy if I put any product near the scalp.</li>
      <li>This is not the same as extra virgin coconut oil that you can buy in the grocery or natural foods store and use as a body product in addition to cooking.</li>
      <li>This is not coconut oil, and to everyone saying it is thick maybe they got something else, because the one i got is liquid, does not have to slightest coconut smell or look,has a light yellow color.</li>
      <li>It has made a big improvement in my general appearance.  </li>

    <li> This is my second order &amp; my skin has been revived with some suppleness.  I&#x27;m in my middle 60&#x27;s &amp; wanted something to help put &#x27;life&#x27; into my skin.  I really notice an improvement on my thighs, calves, arms, chest &amp; face.  I use this product several times a day.  I always use all over after a shower.  It has made a big improvement in my general appearance.  I spend a lot of time in a swimming pool &amp; my skin was dry &amp; wrinkled.  I tried lots of oils, petreleum jelly, but this coconut oil is my &#x27;magic potion&#x27;.  [...]  Connie, Sun Prairie, WI</li>
    <li> this was my first time buying coconut oil so Im not sure how its supposed to be. I apply it on my hands and it doesnt seem to make my hands feel very moisturized, it absorbs very quickly, and my hands kinda feel dry again soon after. I use shea butter or vitamin e oil for desired results, as for hair its ok, but then again I&#x27;ve started using shea butter for that too, it seems to keep my hair well oiled and coated in sheen. My boyfriend loves this product though, I bought a jar for him and a jar for me and his is almost gone.</li>
    <li> I read in an article that pure coconut oil is great for really dry hair so I purchased this. To get the perfact results, put 3 tablespoons in a small dish, heat in microwave about 15 seconds until warm and put in hair from bottom to top. Leave in overnight and shower as usual in the morning (shampoo and condition). If you dont shampoo it will be greesy, dont worry you wont wash it out!</li>
    <li> The oil is very smooth can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up through the winter months on our hands and FEET!</li>
    <li> Love this natural moisturizer.  Works great on dry, winter skin.  I&#x27;ve used it on my dry legs, hands and feet and it works great!</li>
    <li> I am an african american female and this oil works great on my hair. It makes it extremely soft but i definitely have to use it constantly my scalp drinks this oil up like there is no tomorrow.its very lightweight and lasts a very good amount of time.The shipping was also good.</li>
    <li> Ohmygosh.&lt;br /&gt;By far the best skin product I have ever encountered!  It works REALLY well on zits. Apply over night -it won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;You hafta try it!</li>
    <li> I make my own lotion, hair treatments, and clay masks. This was a great coconut oil for my lotion and whipped up beautifully. All of my friends loved it.</li>
    <li> First time trying coconut oil! Very light, all natural oil, without the the yucky build-up. Very light natural scent, not perfumy. DOES NOT smell like coconut (was my expectation, lol). Would def buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product fast service!</li>
    <li> So far, the coconut oil has been wonderful. It is very lightweight so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I mix it with jojoba, grapeseed, honey, and conditioner for a pre-poo and my hair gets an instant detangling and is superbly moisturized. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that after closing the jar, it seems to not want to open again.</li>
    <li> This is not coconut oil, and to everyone saying it is thick maybe they got something else, because the one i got is liquid, does not have to slightest coconut smell or look,has a light yellow color. Am disappointed because this is just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is solid in its container, but when you scoop some out, it starts to melt into your thirsty skin!  Fantastic for any skin type, pure coconut oil will soften your heels, elbows--i even use it on my face.  Since it is liquid at skin temperature, it will not clog your pores. It also makes a great hair pomade, and is much healthier for your hair than most hair products.  If your hair is course, this product works great for growing your hair out and reducing splitting.  As a cuticle cream, nothing beats it.  It&#x27;s much cheaper and more versatile than most beauty products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that I would try it on my dry hair.  When I opened the jar I was surprised by the solidity of the oil.  I originally thought that it was going to have a softer consistency. Anyway....after scraping some of it into the palm of my hand, I noticed that it began to melt.  I applied it to my hair and it seemed to absorb right away.  My hair did not have a greasy feel to it at all and I noticed my hair was shinier.  I use this product more on my body after bathing than on my hair though.  I like the way that it is instantly absorbed into my skin.  I still apply lotion after I use this oil on my body, but it&#x27;s more for the fragrance than for dryness.  Overall, I would probably buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I liked the coconut oil, there was no scent however which I found odd since coconut oil has such a pleasant scent. Apparently this brand had used a process that removed the scent from the oil, it still was useful for my hair however, but I would have enjoyed the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect for natural hair.  I apply this throughout my hair and it leaves it so soft and manageable.  Highly recommended for natural hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best for the skin, especially if you have imperfections like scars.  It makes your skin very soft and it is excellent for the hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in hopes that this would be some miracle in a jar like most of us ladies want. I am 34 and I started to notice a few faint lines on my forehead and of course the laugh lines are starting to show more and more every day. I have been using this oil for over a week and although my lines are not gone my face is so soft and looks brighter than ever. My under eyes no longer have that tired look. They actually glow. I am amazed. I also used this on the ends of my hair since my hair is really long. I noticed after each time I use it, the ends of my hair look better. I have not tried to use it all over my hair just yet only because my hair tends to get greasy if I put any product near the scalp. I might try this weekend and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, although this is not a miracle wrinkle remover, my skin has never looked better and my split ends are going away. I love this stuff. I will be purchasing this again once my two jars are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and like other reviewers, the oil is rather hard in the jar, but I just scrape it with my nail or use a spoon to get it out and once it is in my hands, it melts into an oil. I put it right on my face about 30 minutes before bed. I made the mistake of putting it on right before bed the first night and when I put my face on my pillow, the pillowcase absorbed it because it didn&#x27;t have time to absorb into my skin. So, put it on your face about 30 minutes before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and get this. You will love it like the rest of us do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************** UPDATE 12/6/2011************&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I used this as a conditioner in my hiar. Ladies, proceed with caution if you do this. Learn from my mistake. So, I used my normal shampoo and conditioner as normal then I put in this oil after heating it up in my hands (took a while) and I rinsed it like I would normally do with a conditioner. An hour later after letting my hair air dry a bit I started to blow it dry. As I was looking in the mirror it still looked wet yet to the touch it was dry. It was that greasy!! I think when I saw this on the show, \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot;, I didn&#x27;t hear how Kathy Ireland washed it out. So, I had to wash my hair again to get it out. Next time I plan to put this in at night then wash my hair in the morning. Now the good news: When I went to wash my hair again after the mishap, I decided not to put in my normal conditioner, I just shampood. I was blow drying it and wow was it soft. So, at least it does work.... just know that you will need to shampoo afterwards. Still love this product...was that greasy!!

Next time I plan to put this in at night then wash my hair in the morning.

So, at least it does work.... just know that you will need to shampoo afterwards. Still love this product...</li>
    <li> I was looking for coconut oil in a smaller container than the the typical 16 oz size and this meets that need. However, I think I was a little misled by the \\&quot;food grade\\&quot; description. This is not the same as extra virgin coconut oil that you can buy in the grocery or natural foods store and use as a body product in addition to cooking. This oil is refined and has the coconut scent removed. Refined coconut oil isn&#x27;t thought to have all of the same benefits as the extra-virgin. And I like the coconut smell so was disappointed this had the fragrance removed. If you just want a decent natural moisturizer this is fine, but is you are looking for extra virgin cocnut oil this is not the right product for you.</li>
    <li> Clean and non-scented. Good for many uses hair, body including ruff feet and heels :) Being all natural it is non-toxic which is also a plus for children. In warmer climates it will become a liquid and in cooler or winter climates it is semi-solid but rubbed between the hands and back to a liquid almost instantly. It does leave a oily print used on skin and touching glass or similar.</li>
    <li> I did not know I was getting deodorized coconut oil.  Said Pure, etc etc but deodorized takes out the scent and goes through a process to do it.  I still used this coconut oil for my lotions and lip balm and they turned out great.  I just wish I had known because I probably would have ordered a different brand to get raw, pure coconut oil.  I have been trying to use 100% natural products.</li>
    <li> Nothing but the real deal. I use this on my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Great product to use on hair. Apply to dry hair and let sit for 30 minutes or 15 minutes using a blow dryer. Wash hair regularly. It helps you to grow your hair long and healthy.</li>
    <li> Works very well with my hair. My hair is very dry and super curly. This oil keeps my hair naturally shiny, my scalp healthy and my hair hydrated. The only thing I would&#x27;ve loved is if it would smell more like a coconut.</li>
    <li> I  make my own hair care products.  I add this to my mixture of  cream to help soften my natural hair. Very Good .</li>
    <li> Okay bought this oil and it work great on my skin, it absorbs well. But for my hair not so well, I found I had to oil my hair more than twice a week. So, I think I may need a heavier oil for my hair, also I was dissappointed that it did not have a smell. I will not order this brand again.</li>
    <li> I like this very well.  It is processed and not raw.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought coconut oil so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it against but I think I will buy some raw oil from a different vendor and compare the two.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I realize that everything out there is not good for everybody. I decided to use something that would work for me, like carrot oil.</li>
    <li> After years of acne, oily skin, and overuse/misuse of chemically formulated moisturizers and creams that actually served to make my skin worse, I decided to throw in the towel. I did some research and discovered coconut oil has been used in so many cultures for so long for skin and hair care. I have not tried this product in my hair yet, but I have been using it on my face and body for 5 days and the difference is already noticeable. It is light, does not clog my pores, does not make me look oily, and works well under make-up. I think it has evened out my skin tone and gives me a more refreshed look, which is something Oil of Olay just didn&#x27;t do. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to putting chemicals on my skin. It&#x27;s not worth it! Stop wasting your money in the skincare aisle. Nature has the answer to healthy skin! Also, to those negative sounding reviews, if you read the poduct description before you add to your cart, you will receive an item that is exactly as described and will not be disappointed! This is not a food product, it is deodorized (so you will not smell of coconut while in the office or on public transit), and it changes consistency based on temperature. That&#x27;s all clearly stated in the product information.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like that the product came in solid form but it melts quite nicely. I applied it to my hair and left it in for about 20 minutes and when I washed it out my hair was silky smooth!</li>
