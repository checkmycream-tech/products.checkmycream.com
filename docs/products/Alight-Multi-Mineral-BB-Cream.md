<ol>
      <li>Pacifica comes through with the perfect balance of moisture with just a tint that is perfect for my skin.</li>
      <li>Pacifica products are the best!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>The cream matches your skin tone perfectly and gives it a beautiful glow.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has great staying power, and does not transfer.  </li>
      <li>So if you are really fair complected, don&#x27;t like shimmer or have oily skin; I would not recommend this product to you.</li>
      <li>a good look.</li>
      <li>It is very light, the smell is very nice.</li>
      <li>Although the glitter blends out and looks okay on the skin, it is not a stand alone product unless you have really great skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s packed with good ingredients which is important to me and it looks great on.</li>
      <li>and I can say without hesitation that it is all top notch!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally in love!</li>
      <li>and it is amazing for light/med - tan tones)</li>
      <li>It also smells sunscreen-y; it reminds me of Neutrogena face sunscreens, kind of a floral scent.  </li>
      <li>but this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice healthy glow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and feels so silky on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice shimmer to it and is easy to spread.  </li>
      <li>Love this range of body products but this is too shimmery for me.</li>
      <li>Love this BB cream by pacifica.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many tinted moisturizers and BB creams</li>
      <li>My favorite BB Cream.</li>
      <li>I felt like more of it was sticking to my fingers than to my face.</li>
      <li>It is nice and light but adds a too sparkly shine all over the face that appears oily in my opinion.</li>
      <li>One more thing to note my skin is light-medium and medium in the summer.  </li>
      <li>Love it, don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d so without this makeup.</li>
      <li>I also make sure to keep application lighter at the corners of my eyes and sides of my mouth; I have not noticed any creasing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I surely hope that the newer batches don&#x27;t have it, as that would prevent me from purchasing in</li>
      <li>yet this one remain my favorite of all times.</li>
      <li>It is a light/medium coverage, weighing more towards the medium side.  </li>
      <li>This is oily and makes me more oily.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I notice them more on my fingers after applying product than I do on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>The cream is a tad dark right now, still looks good, but it would be perfect for the summer months ahead.  </li>
      <li>Pros:  Color, texture, feel, finish, easy to layer, no creasing&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>I have found it removes just fine using the oil cleansing method with coconut oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Where I have scarring, I tap another light layer over just those areas.  </li>
      <li>It has reasonable coverage, the tint always matches to my skin, and it gives you a nice glow.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it is great for minimal coverage, cant even tell you have makeup on and it blends well.</li>
      <li>I have olive skin with mild blemishes on my forehead and darkish circles under my eyes that I was hoping to conceal lightly..</li>
      <li>I try to use only natural skincare and this stuff is great!</li>
      <li>Makes makeup fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Most products are too heavy for my taste, or too greasy (or have way too many chemicals!)</li>
      <li>The only I&#x27;ve tried and liked.</li>
      <li>It made my skin look greasy rather than dewy and it just felt kind of gross on my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first, it looks like it is several shades too dark for me, but quickly blends in to the perfect match.  </li>
      <li>Love the brand and they are local.  </li>
      <li>Coverage is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Just enough for a really \\&quot;natural\\&quot; healthy skin glow.</li>
      <li>I apply pure argan oil first, letting it soak in for about 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>It does not contain an SPF like most other creams, but I like that because I had a whole jar of lotion containing SPF that I recently bought that is not hydrating enough, so combined with this cream over that I am happy.  </li>
      <li>health looking skin thanks to such an amazing and natural product.</li>
      <li>I am quite sensitive to fragrance, with mild acne scars and a couple of blemishes to cover.  </li>
      <li>It did not provide any kind of coverage for my blemishes; actually it made them worse because this stuff is so sparkly, they stood out even more!</li>
      <li>but it is color matching but disappears and really has no coverage.  </li>
      <li>Colour doesn&#x27;t do much either and leaves a bit of a shine.</li>
      <li>Though I am sensitive to frangrances, it was not so strong that it irritated me in any way and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There are tiny \\&quot;light reflective particles\\&quot; in this, gold in tone, but are not alarming.  </li>
      <li>It really does nothing as far as covering blemishes and looked like magma gold glitter whenever it comes out of the tube.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything in Pacifica&#x27;s new line of makeup</li>
      <li>but this is a very light alternative to heavy foundation!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like a 16 year old heading out to the club.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin with a bit of redness and this product offered zero coverage.</li>
      <li>I use another all natural BB cream that offers coverage.</li>

      <li>texture feels like a sunscreen, but quickly absorbs and DOES NOT feel heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any major breakouts..</li>
      <li>:  I got this for about 5 dollars less than the manufacturer&#x27;s website at a local grocer, but I WOULD PAY FULL PRICE if it changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t such a waste because I really support the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I consider myself to be barely on the dry side of normal now that it is fall.  </li>
      <li>First of all, the consistency of this product is really odd.</li>
      <li>It has a tiny bit of \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; to it (shimmer), but not as much as some other products (like Revlon or Oil of Olay).</li>
      <li>so.&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with my Everyday Minerals powder concealer as needed, then lightly dust on the EM finishing powder or foundation powder to set it and tone down the \\&quot;dew\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received this as part of my ipsy bag and boy is it awful. This is oily and makes me more oily. It doesn&#x27;t cover anything even when it&#x27;s layered. It doesn&#x27;t color adjust and it&#x27;s very dark, and orange. Also it has mega shimmer in it. I tried to color adjust by using mineral powder over it but my face was still way darker than my neck, not a good look. I didn&#x27;t notice any major breakouts.. But I only wore it once and that was more than enough to know it is terrible and I&#x27;m giving it away to my cousin. I would only attempt this bb cream if you have clear, even, dry and tanned skin, and you don&#x27;t mind fragrance.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1AASXW4N8WNV]]I have tried several BB creams:Garnier, L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al, Almay etc yet this one remain my favorite of all times. It&#x27;s very light and feels so silky on the skin.  I stopped using liquid foundation. I just use this cream then set it with powder and voila : health looking skin thanks to such an amazing and natural product. I wish amazon offered prime for it because shipping is almost half the price of the product... The cream matches your skin tone perfectly and gives it a beautiful glow. I&#x27;m totally in love!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is great for minimal coverage, cant even tell you have makeup on and it blends well.</li>
    <li> It is very light, the smell is very nice. I hate wearing make up or any kind of foundation but this is a very light alternative to heavy foundation!</li>
    <li> My favorite BB Cream. LOVE IT!!! The only I&#x27;ve tried and liked. It gives a nice healthy glow. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Just my opinion but it is color matching but disappears and really has no coverage.  Helps skin tone but does nothing for flaws.  Love the brand and they are local.  The jury is still out.  Will probably use in the summer.</li>
    <li> I just got my BB cream today. I love it! Pacifica products are the best! If you like a sheer glowy coverage THIS IS THE PRODUCT TO GET! I have tried so many tinted moisturizers and BB creams but this one is by far the best. It&#x27;s packed with good ingredients which is important to me and it looks great on. I will be recommending this product to my friends and my skin care clients too!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it is vegan. It really does nothing as far as covering blemishes and looked like magma gold glitter whenever it comes out of the tube. Although the glitter blends out and looks okay on the skin, it is not a stand alone product unless you have really great skin OR if you maybe want to use this as a bronzer/to add glow to your face.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Color, texture, feel, finish, easy to layer, no creasing&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  smell, moisturization&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:  I got this for about 5 dollars less than the manufacturer&#x27;s website at a local grocer, but I WOULD PAY FULL PRICE if it changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: my product does not have dimethicone listed as an ingredient, whereas the manufacturer&#x27;s website does.  From the texture, I do not believe that it is in there, so not a mislabeling issue.  I surely hope that the newer batches don&#x27;t have it, as that would prevent me from purchasing in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at my local grocery store (found in the health food area).&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this every day for the last week.  I am quite sensitive to fragrance, with mild acne scars and a couple of blemishes to cover.  I was glad to finally find a BB cream product without any creepy ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this by placing dots all over my face and along the under side of my jaw, then blend in with my fingertips as I would with any other face cream.  At first, it looks like it is several shades too dark for me, but quickly blends in to the perfect match.  Where I have scarring, I tap another light layer over just those areas.  I also make sure to keep application lighter at the corners of my eyes and sides of my mouth; I have not noticed any creasing.&lt;br /&gt;The texture feels like a sunscreen, but quickly absorbs and DOES NOT feel heavy at all.  It also smells sunscreen-y; it reminds me of Neutrogena face sunscreens, kind of a floral scent.  Though I am sensitive to frangrances, it was not so strong that it irritated me in any way and dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There are tiny \\&quot;light reflective particles\\&quot; in this, gold in tone, but are not alarming.  I notice them more on my fingers after applying product than I do on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The finish is definitely dewey, but does mellow out gradually, so you don&#x27;t look as shiny after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with my Everyday Minerals powder concealer as needed, then lightly dust on the EM finishing powder or foundation powder to set it and tone down the \\&quot;dew\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I would count on this to replace moisturizer.  I apply pure argan oil first, letting it soak in for about 5 minutes.  It does not moisturize enough to replace my other products, but if you aren&#x27;t on the dry side, you will probably have luck.  I consider myself to be barely on the dry side of normal now that it is fall.  In the summer this may well be enough moisture for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has great staying power, and does not transfer.  I blew my nose about 10 minutes after applying and there was no makeup smudge on the tissue.  I have found it removes just fine using the oil cleansing method with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I also have [[ASIN:B005MXC5N0 Pacifica Color Quench Natural Moisture Lip Tint Blood Orange 1]] and it is amazing for light/med - tan tones)</li>
    <li> Love this range of body products but this is too shimmery for me. Colour doesn&#x27;t do much either and leaves a bit of a shine.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin with a bit of redness and this product offered zero coverage. It was basically a dewy mosisturizer. I use another all natural BB cream that offers coverage. Unfortunately it&#x27;s double the&lt;br /&gt;price that&#x27;s why I chose to try this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in Pacifica&#x27;s new line of makeup and I can say without hesitation that it is all top notch! My 40 year old skin can be really difficult to work with. Most products are too heavy for my taste, or too greasy (or have way too many chemicals!) Pacifica comes through with the perfect balance of moisture with just a tint that is perfect for my skin. It has a tiny bit of \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; to it (shimmer), but not as much as some other products (like Revlon or Oil of Olay). It doesn&#x27;t make me feel like a 16 year old heading out to the club. Just enough for a really \\&quot;natural\\&quot; healthy skin glow. Wonderful product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Love it, don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d so without this makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible! I have olive skin with mild blemishes on my forehead and darkish circles under my eyes that I was hoping to conceal lightly.. First of all, the consistency of this product is really odd. I felt like more of it was sticking to my fingers than to my face. I tried using a sponge but even then it was very difficult getting it to apply evenly. It did not provide any kind of coverage for my blemishes; actually it made them worse because this stuff is so sparkly, they stood out even more! It made my skin look greasy rather than dewy and it just felt kind of gross on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro&#x27;s are that it did make my under-eye circles less noticeable and it&#x27;s also vegan.. I really wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t such a waste because I really support the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I would not recommend buying this unless you are really ONLY looking for a really subtle tint and maybe a little moisture, because that is all you&#x27;re going to get. This is not a true BB cream in the sense of Asian brands such as Missha. So, it looks like I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Korean BB cream for now!</li>
    <li> Love this BB cream by pacifica. I try to use only natural skincare and this stuff is great! It has reasonable coverage, the tint always matches to my skin, and it gives you a nice glow. I set it with translucent powder and put some blush on with it. Makes makeup fast and easy. As long as I don&#x27;t sweat a bunch it stays on all day. Will be using this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Been using it for over a year, and will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of using a product that claims to be a BB cream, but has only synthetic ingredients.  There are some extra plant derived goodies in this cream.  It has a nice shimmer to it and is easy to spread.  I have combination skin and it is hydrating without feeling oily.  Coverage is exactly what I wanted.  It is a light/medium coverage, weighing more towards the medium side.  It does not contain an SPF like most other creams, but I like that because I had a whole jar of lotion containing SPF that I recently bought that is not hydrating enough, so combined with this cream over that I am happy.  I have very sensitive skin and there was no initial irritation.  One more thing to note my skin is light-medium and medium in the summer.  The cream is a tad dark right now, still looks good, but it would be perfect for the summer months ahead.  So if you are really fair complected, don&#x27;t like shimmer or have oily skin; I would not recommend this product to you.</li>
    <li> It is nice and light but adds a too sparkly shine all over the face that appears oily in my opinion.</li>
</ol>
