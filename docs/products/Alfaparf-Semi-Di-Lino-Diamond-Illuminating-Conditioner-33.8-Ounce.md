      <li>my hair its so soft, shinny and smell amazing</li>
      <li>Hair felt fine after washing though, so if you don&#x27;t mind the funny smelling conditioner, you could buy both.</li>
      <li>To be honest it felt like something else was added to them maybe mixed in (this is what I thought)  </li>
      <li>My hair has never looked shinier , leaves no frizz  and is easy to style, I highly recommend Alfaparf products.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered this twice and the first time I received them-</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The shampoo smells good but the conditioner had an odd smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
      <li>I have oily hair and the old product would remove the oil for a more natural softness.</li>

      <li>who has a lot of positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Super soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Still very fragrant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very ultra</li>
      <li>and it gives my hair much sheen, softness and shine.</li>
      <li>It conditions the hair fine, but I cannot stand the strange smell.  </li>
      <li>Product was advertised as new and it was!  </li>
      <li>Only wish they sold it here in Ohio, have not been able to find it locally.</li>

      <li>You can&#x27;t beat a high end product for the price.</li>
      <li>I imagine there is also a slight difference in quality control between Italy (where the original was made) and Mexico (where the new product is made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product a little expensive but worth it.</li>
      <li>It is much stronger and both the Shampoo and the conditioner have the same scent.</li>
      <li>However, the shampoo has exactly the same wonderful smell as the mousse, but the conditioner smells awful.  </li>
      <li>The only negative thing I could say would be is the last time I ordered the shampoo/conditioner combo on Amazon, I paid for the shampoo and received the conditioner for free, this time I had to paid for both!  </li>
      <li>It gives a full thick feel to your hair.</li>
      <li>The high rating is due to the prior version.</li>
      <li>I would recommend for people with fine, thin hair.</li>

<li> These shampoo and hair conditioner will elave your hair so shinny that the gap between you previous hair and your current one using it, is palpable.</li>
<li> ,I have dry air,  but this shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t work for me, my hair became drier after I started using it.</li>
<li> let me just say that this product will not weigh your hair down.</li>
<li> A previous stylist introduced me to this product but then stopped selling it to her customers.  </li>
<li> they smelled a little off, like they had been tampered with-</li>
<li> However, the product itself has me wondering a little.</li>
<li> I had trouble with the delivery through USPS.</li>
<li> but I disliked the aroma.</li>
<li> so you need just little amount or mix with water !</li>
<li> only disappointment is that 1.5 inches of product was missing from the shampoo and 1.25 inches missing from the conditioner.</li>
<li> I am not sure if this is because it was produced in the Mexico plant and if their formulas and presentation vary.</li>
<li> Expensive initially, but value product when time is factored in.</li>
<li> but this particular product is horrible.</li>
<li> Is the worse shampoo I ever tried, I had to stop using it after two washes, my hair was course and entangled,  i&#x27;m sorry I ever tried.</li>
<li> Smells heavily of mens cologne.. unless this is mens shampoo and conditioner and I mistakenly bought it for myself, I was very unhappy with this purchase</li>
<li> I have very thin and brittle hair</li>
<li> /&gt;Highly disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this product years ago, I used the Semi Di Lino oil for your hair. I just found the  shampoo and conditioner online. I love the smell and the shine it leaves your hair.  Great product a little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> the best product ever!!! my hair its so soft, shinny and smell amazing</li>
    <li> Feels light and leaves my hair silky shinny and smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> I loved this product-prior to the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; sulfate-free version. While the product smells similar, my hair feels nothing like before. I have oily hair and the old product would remove the oil for a more natural softness. This now leaves my hair feeling oily and somewhat flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll know that it&#x27;s different when it arrives-the bottle is redesigned and doesn&#x27;t look like the picture listed for this product. I imagine there is also a slight difference in quality control between Italy (where the original was made) and Mexico (where the new product is made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly disappointed. For what it costs, this does not perform well at all. I will return tomorrow after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALFAPARF-PLEASE GIVE US THE OPTION TO PURCHASE THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT! The high rating is due to the prior version. You&#x27;ll want to confirm with any seller what you&#x27;re going to be getting in advance.</li>
    <li> I love Alphaparf but this particular product is horrible. My hair is so course and tangled after using. I don&#x27;t know how to return, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> I like it and the product arrived in my home at time</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells good but the conditioner had an odd smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for. Hair felt fine after washing though, so if you don&#x27;t mind the funny smelling conditioner, you could buy both.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are awesome. I have very thin and brittle hair and I also suffer from Female Pattern Baldness after using these products for just two times l, my hair looks fuller, feel thicker and had an incredible shine!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these products</li>
    <li> Alfaparf Semi Di Lino Illuminating Shampoo and Conditioner Set 1000ml&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start , I placed my order on the 18th and recieved this order on the 22nd... great turnaround for mailI think!&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the product my hairdresser got me hooked with a bunch of samples and I fell in love with this stuff. I hav fine thin hair and for all of you out there with the same let me just say that this product will not weigh your hair down. It will make it feel like silk and also give a a nice bounce of body.&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that 1.5 inches of product was missing from the shampoo and 1.25 inches missing from the conditioner. Maybe this was to prevent the product from exploding I am not sure.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I cant wait to use this product , it makes hair beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for over 5 years. The smell is amazing, it makes my hair really shiny and keeps my color longer. I have highlighted hair and every stylist I go to comments on how healthy my hair is. You can&#x27;t beat a high end product for the price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this line of alfaparf! My hair smells so god after I wash it with this. Will recommend</li>
    <li> Love it ! Smell great,hair looks ,feel great ! It&#x27;s very ultra so you need just little amount or mix with water !</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this stuff- it smells so good and makes my hair so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to beaware of is who you ar ordering from.  I have ordered this twice and the first time I received them- they smelled a little off, like they had been tampered with- or soon to expire.... To be honest it felt like something else was added to them maybe mixed in (this is what I thought)  I should have returned them, but didn&#x27;t end up doing it.  The 2nd time I ordered- they came in and were perfect- great smell and was exactly what I was looking for- so make sure you order them from someone trustworthy- like who has a lot of positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this set of Semi di Lino Illuminating shampoo and conditioner and I have mixed feelings. I had trouble with the delivery through USPS. Amazon was very quick and efficient in allowing me to get a replacement so amazon gets 5 stars for that. However, the product itself has me wondering a little. The bottles are the correct size and they smell great! My hair does look a lot better. It is softer and shinier. BUT, the bottle says the product is made in Mexico! I searched the Alfaparf website and they do in fact have a plant in Mexico. The sent of the product does not match the scent of the sample I received at the salon. It is much stronger and both the Shampoo and the conditioner have the same scent. The sample had a different scent for the conditioner. The logo and writing on the bottle also do not match the salon Sample I received. I am not sure if this is because it was produced in the Mexico plant and if their formulas and presentation vary. Eventhough it does not match the sample completely, it is good product.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell, but leaves my hair ok. It has a very good size and it woks for my hair.</li>
    <li> Came in 1 day of ordering! Been using this product for 5 yrs now. Love it!!!!  Will order again in future!</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Love it. I have very dry fine hair and it gives my hair much sheen, softness and shine. Very good product. So glad hairdresser in Florida turned me on to this product. Only wish they sold it here in Ohio, have not been able to find it locally. A giant bott of shampoo and conditioner lasts a year. Expensive initially, but value product when time is factored in. Will continue to buy it, as long as I can find it. This was first time I got free shipping, great deal from Amazon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery -  great product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the product!</li>
    <li> I like Alfaparf products ,I have dry air,  but this shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t work for me, my hair became drier after I started using it.</li>
    <li> Smells heavily of mens cologne.. unless this is mens shampoo and conditioner and I mistakenly bought it for myself, I was very unhappy with this purchase but I was able to return it.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked shinier , leaves no frizz  and is easy to style, I highly recommend Alfaparf products.  It is in my opinion, the best hair product on the market.</li>
    <li> I would recommend for people with fine, thin hair. It gives a full thick feel to your hair. Makes hair feel smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I found the product very good. I recommend. My hair was wonderful. Super soft and shiny. Still very fragrant. Nominate.</li>
    <li> A previous stylist introduced me to this product but then stopped selling it to her customers.  I was very excited to discover that I could get it through Amazon.  I have thick, coarse hair and this product is perfect for my hair.  I love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I searched for this shampoo and conditioner as I had purchased the mousse.  The smell of the mousse was absolutely wonderful and therefore I wanted my hair to smell the same from shampoo to conditioner to mousse.  However, the shampoo has exactly the same wonderful smell as the mousse, but the conditioner smells awful.  It conditions the hair fine, but I cannot stand the strange smell.  I will purchase the shampoo again, but not the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Shampoo works well, conditioner does not</li>
