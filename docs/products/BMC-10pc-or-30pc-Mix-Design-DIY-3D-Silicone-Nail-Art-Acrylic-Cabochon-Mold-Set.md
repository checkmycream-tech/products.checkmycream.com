<li> I wasnt expensive, it was deliver fast and overall</li>
<li> Will order other items from them again.</li>

<li> besides that a waste of money..</li>
<li> but they are a tad bit too small.</li>
<li> The forms were way too small to do anything with.</li>
<li> Ill buy different designs in future,again from this company !</li>
<li> its like the molds are too small.</li>
<li> I found that some were to thin to use.</li>
