      <li>I love this product and was almost.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found I like the PM products (no sun screen) better than the AM products (Sunscreen added).</li>
      <li>So glad to see it at Amazon since it is no longer sold in stores in the U.S.</li>
      <li>I love the Co-Q10 and sun block.</li>

      <li>More fragrant than I remember t being when it was still sold in the US- but is working like a charm</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok night cream but has a rather pungent smell.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for many years.</li>
      <li>using Nivea for many year..</li>
      <li>and I tell them, it&#x27;s Nivea :-)</li>
      <li>so it must be good, right?).  </li>
      <li>My skin felt very smooth and the fine lines around my eyes had vanished.</li>
      <li>I am 80 and it keeps my skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
      <li>and I like it and one of the important things</li>
      <li>and this is important to me.</li>
      <li>, I knew I can trust to get the product fast and for the best price possible.</li>
      <li>am very satisfied with my purchase and plan to order several more</li>
      <li>I have already re-ordered this again, and since my first purchase have shared with my friends, who also love it,</li>
      <li>I just like this cosmetic not expensive but effective and real convenient,,,not</li>
      <li>It is not greasy, which I especially like, and it seems to do a good job.  </li>
      <li>and I feel sure Nivea Q10 is really doing its job.  </li>
      <li>This cream is effective in keeping your skin strong, moisturized, and protected from outside pollutants.  </li>
      <li>This company did a great job of filling my order and it arrived well before the expected delivery date!</li>
      <li>better then any high end creams I used..</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
      <li>so yes I love it and  recommend it to everybody with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The results, over time, are worth the price.  </li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and I have virtually no crows feet, where many of my friends are now starting to show.  </li>
      <li>It is an old cream and as such it is simple and the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll pay the higher price for this</li>
      <li>but now exactly like the formula I used to buy.</li>
      <li>works very well  </li>
      <li>I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to go to Canada now to buy it, and that they still produced the equivalent Nivea Q10 lotion with SPF 15 which used to be so readily available.</li>
      <li>the face cream arrived, I checked and it&#x27;s the real stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and it absolutely does wonders...</li>
      <li>only negative is that it took quite a while to arrive as it was shipped from Great Britain</li>
      <li>I have been looking to purchase this face cream for a while after running out of my supply earlier this year.&lt;br /&gt;After reading so many reviews by different sellers and</li>
      <li>Why because i had one issue with the shipment, i contacted the seller and the seller resolved it right in second mail.</li>
      <li>Now that I live in America, I recommended Nivea to all my friends.</li>
      <li>I wish they would have made it exactly the same.</li>
      <li>My first order from the supplier (not necessarily this one) was shipped from Europe.</li>
      <li>After many experiments from other brands and creams, this set of creams from Nivea are the only ones my Mom would use.</li>
      <li>skin is soft  like a new born baby .  </li>
      <li>My mother used to say that a little bit of that cream padded on the face at night, would make a woman&#x27;s face as smooth in the morning as a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>I hope that the makers of Nivea cream will never change the old recipe and never discontinue making the cream and selling it to America.</li>
      <li>for over 13 years.people always ask how I&#x27;m 35 and look so young</li>
      <li>I am a 35yr old man</li>
      <li>I remember, as a young girl in my native Poland, reading ads in a fancy magazine for society ladies, that Nivea cream was the chosen cream for Hollywood beauties.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this cream never clogs my pores.</li>
      <li>In combination with the Nivea Q10 night cream, my Mom finally is receiving the hydration her super dry skin requires.</li>
      <li>I keep trying alternates as it is hard to find in the US but keep coming back to this since it works so much better.</li>
      <li>Listen, I am a 37 year old man and the last thing I want is wrinkly eyes to make me look old.  </li>
      <li>I am almost 60 years old and I have been using Nivea cream since my teenage years.</li>
      <li>It arrived sooner than expected and was packaged very well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look ten years younger, but the skin around my eyes, and neck , very soft.  </li>
      <li>So, when my jar of Visage ran out I got a jar of a drugstore brand and it worked just as well for about half as much.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Good moisturizer.  Why pay more.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that actually works, or at least the only one I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m unhappy that I now have to find it in other countries.</li>
    <li> the ONLY cream I can use for my face so yes I love it and  recommend it to everybody with sensitive skin</li>
    <li> excellent product I will never be without it. I bought one for my mom..she loves it.  better then any high end creams I used..and you see results within three days of using. it leaves you skin hydrated all day. the price is great....hats off to nivea it is truly the best.</li>
    <li> I am almost 60 years old and I have been using Nivea cream since my teenage years. It is an old cream and as such it is simple and the best. I remember, as a young girl in my native Poland, reading ads in a fancy magazine for society ladies, that Nivea cream was the chosen cream for Hollywood beauties. That was in 1936 \\&quot;AS\\&quot; magazine! My mother used to say that a little bit of that cream padded on the face at night, would make a woman&#x27;s face as smooth in the morning as a baby&#x27;s skin. Now that I live in America, I recommended Nivea to all my friends. I like the lighter version of the cream for daytime and heavier one for nighttime. Regular Nivea, the one in a dark blue jar is fairly easy to find in any supermarket, but Nivea Visage Q10 Plus Anti Wrinkle Day Cream is nearly impossible to find anymore. I had to buy this one on Amazon and pay a premium price. I am still glad I was able to find it. I have only one face and I intend to keep it wrinkle-free. My skin, like my mother&#x27;s skin, is practically wrinkle-free. I do not smoke and this helps enormously. Every day I drink some water, eat raw vegetables and fruits, try to nap a bit, and pad some Nivea cream on my face. I look much better than most of my friends. I hope that the makers of Nivea cream will never change the old recipe and never discontinue making the cream and selling it to America. I also hope that they will not ruin the company the way Max Factor&#x27;s descendants did. I am counting on Nivea cream to my end.</li>
    <li> Skin feels softer and less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I just like this cosmetic not expensive but effective and real convenient,,,not to spend an hundred of dollar just to reduce the wrinkle..</li>
    <li> it gives me the moisture I like with out feeling greasy , I use it daily ,  I have grown up with Nevea products</li>
    <li> I saw this cream in a magazine on a flight back from Europe. I removed the sample from the magazine and used it a couple of days later. My skin felt wonderful and the cream is light and not greasy. My skin felt very smooth and the fine lines around my eyes had vanished. Needless to say I was sold. I went on Amazon.com and ordered it that Morning. Amazon had the best price and it is a site I ordered from many times before, I knew I can trust to get the product fast and for the best price possible.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years. I have very few wrinkles around my eyes. I tried to use another cream for awhile because this one was hard to find, and I could tell the difference within a month of using the new cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years. I am 80 and it keeps my skin smooth and well hydrated. I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to go to Canada now to buy it, and that they still produced the equivalent Nivea Q10 lotion with SPF 15 which used to be so readily available. BT</li>
    <li> Love this cream!! Does not feel heavy on your skin. So glad to see it at Amazon since it is no longer sold in stores in the U.S. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I got the shipment in time. I did not use it initially but i thought to give it a try. I have just started using it and as of now the results are excellent. If it remain same after a longer use, i will definitely buy the product and from SacMan. Why because i had one issue with the shipment, i contacted the seller and the seller resolved it right in second mail. I must appreciate the seller.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT LOVE IT , CANNOT GET THIS IN THE UNITED STATES , WILL PURCHASE AGAIN WITH NO PROBLEM. VERY GOOD SERVICE.</li>
    <li> Listen, I am a 37 year old man and the last thing I want is wrinkly eyes to make me look old.  I found this product about 10 years ago and have been using it religiously everyday.  My skin is smooth and I have virtually no crows feet, where many of my friends are now starting to show.  They discontinued this stuff in the US about 3 years ago so I have been stock-piling everytime I go to Europe.  You will not be sorry with this stuff it is like a miracle in a little round container.</li>
    <li> I recommend this face cream to everyone! I have been using NiveaQ10 for over 13 years.people always ask how I&#x27;m 35 and look so young and I tell them, it&#x27;s Nivea :-)</li>
    <li> Very good. The  packaging was in Albanian , but that wont bother me. Very good and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My first order from the supplier (not necessarily this one) was shipped from Europe. The second one came today from Thailand. Same (sort of) fragrance, but still have to try it on my face. Pot came sealed (different lid color), but ingredients are in Thai so can&#x27;t do a comparison with the one produced in Germany. I think, this being the case, Amazon.us should not sell it. On this point, I&#x27;d like to see Amz state the country of manufacture on all products so buyer knows whether getting something made in the US or China, or wherever. Giving 3 stars for lack of information. 5 for the German product.</li>
    <li> Some creams are too heavy or contain too much fragrance.  This cream is effective in keeping your skin strong, moisturized, and protected from outside pollutants.  I have sensitive skin and this cream never clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference. It&#x27;s an ok night cream but has a rather pungent smell. It goes away after awhile but it&#x27;s does nothing for the skin that any other cream doesn&#x27;t do. One star because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does!</li>
    <li> I have already re-ordered this again, and since my first purchase have shared with my friends, who also love it,</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this product here in the US but, now, it comes from Europe.  I have found things much less expensive here in the US that work fine on my skin.</li>
    <li> This cream moisturizes and is good under makeup. I also like that it has SPF 15 now that science says it will keep you looking younger. The cream is a little thin but still moisturizes well. I use the Nivea cleanser and night cream (at night!) too.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that works on my Mom&#x27;s 74 yr aging dry skin. In combination with the Nivea Q10 night cream, my Mom finally is receiving the hydration her super dry skin requires. After many experiments from other brands and creams, this set of creams from Nivea are the only ones my Mom would use. I&#x27;ve reordered 4 times already.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Have tried others, but none work as well.  The results, over time, are worth the price.  Only a small application is required daily, so a jar usually lasts six months or more.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea Visage SPF 15 Anti Ageing Q10  Day and Night Cream and find it to be the very best.  I am 75 years old and have few wrinkles for my age and I feel sure Nivea Q10 is really doing its job.  Thank you Nivea. Extremely difficult to find in stores in recent years so I now order them on line.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected so gave it away since it was so greasy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel very nice when I got a spot in my eye, either.&lt;br /&gt;A fan of Nivea</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff. I keep trying alternates as it is hard to find in the US but keep coming back to this since it works so much better.</li>
    <li> It is not real, March 30, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream before, and this one I think it is fake, because feeling and smelling is different., why no more Nivea in store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I was in my 20s and I&#x27;m happy I can get it here. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have used Nivea Q10 in the past, but they stopped selling in U.S.  I saw that it was available through Amazon and the U.K., so was happy to order it.  I&#x27;m hoping that Nivea will start selling this product in the U.S. again soon.  It is not greasy, which I especially like, and it seems to do a good job.  I take  CoQ10 internally every day, so figured that topically would be an added bonus.  It arrived sooner than expected and was packaged very well.  I will definitely re-order when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This is great. I love the Co-Q10 and sun block. I did not like the heaviness but it makes my skin feel protected.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best I&#x27;ve come across.  I am a 35yr old man and I usually get mistaken for 28 or younger.  I initially purchased this product when I started seeing some wrinkles around my eyes.  After using this product daily, the wrinkles are 99% gone.  I actually have to try to create wrinkles for them to appear.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on a couple of suggestions/reviews on the internet.  People were raving about how great it works so I decided to give it a try (it&#x27;s European so it must be good, right?).  Unfortunately, it works like any other face cream.  When I looked in the mirror I didn&#x27;t appear to look 10 years younger or have less wrinkles.  But, then again, I didn&#x27;t look any worse.  So, when my jar of Visage ran out I got a jar of a drugstore brand and it worked just as well for about half as much.</li>
    <li> works very well  I look like iam 18 again.  skin is soft  like a new born baby .  its the best cream on the market.</li>
    <li> Can not rate this as it was purchased as a gift .  Beleive it to be good though .  Lee</li>
    <li> This is a great product I have been using for years. I have been looking to purchase this face cream for a while after running out of my supply earlier this year.&lt;br /&gt;After reading so many reviews by different sellers and some of the reviewers complained that the products they received are not genuine Nivea. I was worried.&lt;br /&gt;When the face cream arrived, I checked and it&#x27;s the real stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with my purchase and plan to order several more soon.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it took quite a while to arrive as it was shipped from Great Britain</li>
    <li> This cream did not look like and/or smell like the Nivea Visage creams I have used in the past. I don&#x27;t understand why Nivea face products are not available in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> This has everything you want in a day cream,  plus the SPF15.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a tad glossy looking on my skin, but that goes away after a while ( and it may not be that way on someone elses skin ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that there&#x27;s some peer-reviewed science behind the Nivea line of products, in this case CoQ10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that the USA Nivea creams are mixed in Mexico - and that there is a difference in consistency to the German made, but I have only used the imported German Nivea products - so can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 2 creams in one (moisturizer and sun screen) and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m after for summer, so I&#x27;ll pay the higher price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/19/13  Addendum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m outdoors a lot in summer, and have to apply additional sunscreen through the day so, after using this for a year, I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;d rather not&lt;br /&gt;have my moisturizer mixed with a sun screen.  I&#x27;ve found I like the PM products (no sun screen) better than the AM products (Sunscreen added).</li>
    <li> need to speakwith customerservice**********</li>
    <li> Not greasy. Only need a little on your skin. I use in on my face. I also use the non-SPF. I like that one a little better, but it&#x27;s not good for sun protection.</li>
    <li> I have Been using the product for two weeks and it seems to be working. I apply after shaving instead of aftershave</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a long time and I like it and one of the important things is that protects the skin from the sun&lt;br /&gt;SPF15 and this is important to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and was almost. This company did a great job of filling my order and it arrived well before the expected delivery date!</li>
    <li> Excellent. .been using Nivea for many year.. and it absolutely does wonders...very happy customer</li>
    <li> Definitely worth a try</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t look ten years younger, but the skin around my eyes, and neck , very soft.  Would buy again</li>
    <li> I was using this product in Europe and still bring it back from travelling. But I ran out and so I tried this one.I cannot put my finger on it why, but it is not the same as in Europe. I may try it again .</li>
    <li> Excellent staff, arrived at the scheduled time</li>
    <li> Product shipped from Thailand.  Info on item is not in English.  Texture of product is different from any of the same product I have purchased in the past.  It&#x27;s usable, but will not purchase it again.  I will find a similar product made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Great! More fragrant than I remember t being when it was still sold in the US- but is working like a charm</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. It has always worked well for me.</li>
    <li> Good but now exactly like the formula I used to buy. I wish they would have made it exactly the same. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and is a little thicker</li>
    <li> Was lead to believe it made in US but manufactured in Germany. The last one I ordered was from Thailand and I had to go to the back of the Post Office to sign a customs form for the delivery of foreign goods!! Need to show more product details.</li>
