      <li>Love that!</li>
      <li>Smooth texture, great color payoff.</li>
      <li>This is a darker rose gold.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a rose gold eyeliner to use on my lower waterline.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a hint of rose gold on my light/medium olive skin</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply; it glides on well and has a creamy texture.</li>
      <li>Good quality comes out smooth and pigmanted</li>
      <li>I love this rose gold pencil.</li>
      <li>Love love love this eyeliners uses this on my water line and it has really good pigment</li>

      <li>Instead, I use this Jane Rose Gold liner on my eyes (with Laura Mercier&#x27;s Eye Basics in Flax) and it opens them right up.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like a warm champagne beige; thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t have too much pink/red in it (because that can make you look like an albino bunny with pinkeye).</li>
      <li>Can easily break if extended too much.</li>
      <li>A nice rust color that enhances color (blue) of my eyes.</li>

      <li>cough* getting older, I have noticed that the &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Color is nice but have to press hard to get any of it on your eye.</li>
      <li>Great for a natural look or a dramatic look!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and really brings out blue eyes.</li>
      <li>Being pale with blue undertones, this is by far the most flattering &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; for me.</li>
      <li>Used it a couple of times on the lower lash line and I love the subtle look it give.</li>
      <li>Love the color, it is subtle.</li>
      <li>It has a slight shimmer, and so far I have found that it lasts the whole day and the water-resistant claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes, and this is a liner that I have absolutely no problems with.</li>

    <li> I have very sensitive eyes, and this is a liner that I have absolutely no problems with. (although I do have problems with Jane&#x27;s Kelly Green)&lt;br /&gt;As I am *cough* getting older, I have noticed that the &amp;#34;smokey eye&amp;#34; look ages me greatly, so I have stopped doing it. Instead, I use this Jane Rose Gold liner on my eyes (with Laura Mercier&#x27;s Eye Basics in Flax) and it opens them right up. Rolls back the clock! It is not overly sparkly or glittery- it has just enough shimmer to add dimension, but not enough so that it tacks on years. Also, the rose gold is a beautiful color- it&#x27;s like a warm champagne beige; thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t have too much pink/red in it (because that can make you look like an albino bunny with pinkeye). It is perfect, and I love it. I need zillions more of them. I got carded the other day! Love that!</li>
    <li> Ok. Could be a little darker for my taste</li>
    <li> Love the color, it is subtle. Product flakes as it is used</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my waterline to make my eyes pop and seem more awake. I wish that the color was more &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; but it did work well.</li>
    <li> I put this on before I put the brown on--I highlight first. It works for me.</li>
    <li> Used it a couple of times on the lower lash line and I love the subtle look it give. Price point is great but it broke on me the first time I used it. If it had not broke I wiould have gave it all 5 stars</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a rose gold eyeliner to use on my lower waterline. It is very easy to apply; it glides on well and has a creamy texture. It has a slight shimmer, and so far I have found that it lasts the whole day and the water-resistant claim is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would relate it to the Rimmel Exaggerate Waterproof Eye Definer range - which is my all-time favourite drugstore eyeliner. It has a retractable crayon design, and I love eyeliners that I don&#x27;t need to sharpen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner is everything I hoped it would be. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Love this beautiful color.</li>
    <li> The color transfers really well. It&#x27;s just a hint of rose gold on my light/medium olive skin but it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love love love this eyeliners uses this on my water line and it has really good pigment and it lasts long</li>
    <li> Good quality comes out smooth and pigmanted</li>
    <li> Chunks is what I got not a smooth line! Loved the color though! Disappointed! I will not order this brand again!</li>
    <li> I love this rose gold pencil. I use it for my waterline,  lower lashes, eye corner, brow highlight, even a lip liner. Being pale with blue undertones, this is by far the most flattering &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot; for me.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend!!! Very hard eyeliner. Color is nice but have to press hard to get any of it on your eye.</li>
    <li> Smooth texture, great color payoff. The only thing that could be improved is the density of the liner. Can easily break if extended too much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect, smooth compliment to the waterline of your eye.</li>
    <li> A nice rust color that enhances color (blue) of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and really brings out blue eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a darker rose gold. Not water proof, stays on for a good 4-5 hours. Very pretty color and beautiful pigmentation! Great for a natural look or a dramatic look!</li>
