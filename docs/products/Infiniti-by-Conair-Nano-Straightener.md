      <li>Loving it!</li>
      <li>Most incredible ever!</li>
      <li>This straightener is great but whats better is that I comes with a Heat resistant mat to lay it on and a pouch to store it in!</li>
      <li>I filled in the gap and now it works almost perfectly with little-to-no hair-grabbing!</li>
      <li>and I loved it.</li>

      <li>Conair makes a lot of great products, this was my first hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought, a great price</li>
      <li>and this one holds up to the reviews and is amazing for the price.</li>
      <li>I might have liked it had</li>

      <li>so I bought her her own for on Christmas</li>

      <li>I am sure there are better units but for the money this cannot be beat!</li>
      <li>I love it, I love it!</li>
      <li>It seems to be very cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t look as nice in person as one would expect.  </li>
      <li>For the modest price it is a great deal!</li>
      <li>amazing product - easy to use, nice handling, don&#x27;t think I could do without.</li>
      <li>This is a great flat iron at a great price.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think a straightener that gets VERY hot is a good idea</li>
      <li>It still works good, not as good as it did when it was new</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to pass it in a strand more than maybe 2 to 3 times.</li>
      <li>, i hope you all enjoy and hoped that this helped you on deciding what to get!</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t melt your counter top or leave burn marks.</li>
      <li>I thought all straighteners would be able to do that</li>
      <li>immediately I was in love.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just be saving up for something more high-end.</li>
      <li>Love it and gave up my&lt;br /&gt;curling iron for it..</li>
      <li>love the heat resistant pouch.</li>
      <li>Get it, you will love it.</li>

      <li>you will need it :)</li>
      <li>and she just love it.</li>
      <li>but this one has become my top favorite part because of the fact that it comes with a heat resistent sleeve.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and easy to take with you.  </li>
      <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed the packaging -- I loved this at first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than the cheap Remington model I have as well.  </li>
      <li>Just spend the money on a good one like a Croc - you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
      <li>Loved it so much I bought it again.</li>
      <li>I hope mine doesn&#x27;t arrive damaged or something because my friend&#x27;s has been going strong for almost 3 years</li>

      <li>It was awesome straightened my hair with the first swipe left my hair silky smooth</li>
      <li>I hope this new iron is as awesome as my old one(RIP) was😄</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t perfect, I maybe had to go over a few pieces</li>
      <li>The CHI nano I had had glossy plates that allowed smooth sliding.  </li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t completely smooth.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product at much lower price then similar straighteners costing $80 to $150  </li>
      <li>It is very popular with the teenage girls.</li>
      <li>Great flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Love this, very classy and cute.</li>
      <li>it was in its original packaging unopened and unused.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it from Amazon because they ship it so fast!</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and does a fabulous job on my wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>The only drawback of this iron is that it is not so good for curling your hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this straightener granted I haven&#x27;t owned too many of them, maybe 3 in my life</li>
      <li>I LOVE this straight iron.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;fabulous, heats up very fast and so easy to use</li>
      <li>I originally had the 1\\&quot; but just bought the 1.75\\&quot; and they are both fabulous and at sub $40, you can&#x27;t find a better flat iron deal.</li>
      <li>Works really well, heats up fast, nice and hot.</li>
      <li>so I am probably a little biased towards thinking this product is a great deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is very thick and this straightner does a great job!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look smooth, and my hair stays straight all day (</li>
      <li>It is light weight and it heats up so fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. Just spend the money on a good one like a Croc - you&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
    <li> My mother bought me a 2 inch iron just like this one a couple of years ago in a garage sale for $1 and I loved it. I had it for about 2 years but my sister would drop it and it eventually got broken. When I saw this one, I didn&#x27;t think it twice on buying it. I knew what I was going to get so I didn&#x27;t mind the price. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that some of the paint is coming off, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter because the iron is still doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> After only 2 weeks of use it started peeling and flaking.  It is no longer white.  Funny thing is I think the coating or paint or whatever it is melted into my hair since I never saw any flakes laying around.  Not only that but it does not work well at all.  I am very disappointed since I usually base my decisions on the Amazon reviews which were good for this product...not sure what is up with that.  DO NOT PURCHASE, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener gets nice and hot which I really need for my coarse thick hair.  It&#x27;s nice and light and easy to take with you.  Comes with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> I might have liked it had I got a chance to use it! First time it kept shutting off, short or something, so I never really got to try the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for about seven months now and it still works perfectly, better than any straightener I have ever purchased. You can even feel the difference as you flat iron compared to others because of the silkiness of the plates on your hair aren&#x27;t pulling but actually doing the job right.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  I bought this after my other flat iron gave out. It has longer plates so that you can reduce the amount of time you spend on your hair.  It does not dry out my hair and it leaves it shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought one of theses 5 years ago when the expensive one broke and it still works!!! so good I bought another one.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron at a great price. It does a nice job of straightening my hair. What I like about this iron is the thin plates allow me to get closer to my scalp than bulkier irons. Also, the longer plates on this iron speed up styling time. I can do wider sections of hair at a time. The only drawback of this iron is that it is not so good for curling your hair. The bulkier flat irons do a better job for curling.</li>
    <li> I really like this straightener granted I haven&#x27;t owned too many of them, maybe 3 in my life but this one beats the other two that were more expensive. My hair is usually hard to straighten or curl and even harder for it to hold but this straightener worked very well. It wasn&#x27;t perfect, I maybe had to go over a few pieces but that&#x27;s it and you have to do that with any straightener anyways. I used the highest settings and neither burned my hair once or my scalp. It does get hot enough but not too hot and I don&#x27;t think a straightener that gets VERY hot is a good idea anyways it will do more damage over time. It also comes with a mat you can set the straightener on that is heat protectant so it doesn&#x27;t melt your counter top or leave burn marks. Also-I really like this idea that you can actually set the straightener down without the sides touching the counter-you can set it on the plastic part if you know what I mean so the mat isn&#x27;t really needed even. Most flat irons you have to set them on their sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thick hair, frizzy, half is dyed half is natural (growing it out lol), greyish/brown/blonde colored. I would recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome flat iron, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Most incredible ever! It really makes ur hair soft and silky! I would totally buy another if i had too! This straighter takes up no time! Because it heats up super fast that you wont even have to waste a minute on it! Its super handing if youre in a rush to go out or anywhere because it heat up super fast that i cant tell you how fast it is![...]Well, i hope you all enjoy and hoped that this helped you on deciding what to get!</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best flat iron I have ever used. For years, I have purchased expensive flat irons costing in excess of $100 - sometimes almost $200. I went to Vegas a month ago and this iron was in the hotel I stayed in - immediately I was in love. I can&#x27;t believe how straight OR curly this iron gets your hair without having to be over 400 degrees to do it. It&#x27;s healthy heat and the bounce is gorgeous. What is even more unbelievable is the price - WHAT A STEAL LADIES!!! Get it, you will love it. I originally had the 1\\&quot; but just bought the 1.75\\&quot; and they are both fabulous and at sub $40, you can&#x27;t find a better flat iron deal. All my expensive irons are in a drawer (lol).</li>
    <li> I tried this because I have very wavy hair, and when set to around three quarters of the way up, it really worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to repaet after the first time, and you get a really straightened look !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value for money price</li>
    <li> i have always used conair but this one has become my top favorite part because of the fact that it comes with a heat resistent sleeve. heats up really quick and long  enough to cover more area</li>
    <li> I received this flat iron from my mom as a birthday present. Works really well, heats up fast, nice and hot. The only problem i had was that the plates started to loosen and their was rust building up. Other than that it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Hair stays straight, even when I try to curl it after. Extremely excellent quality flat iron and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it from Amazon because they ship it so fast!</li>
    <li> Over all, the straighteners worked very well. I like them alot. My only gripe is that they don&#x27;t grip the hair that is further away from the end of the plate as well. Sometimes they can be jerky when straightening. I think that was because they are so light (a good thing) and the other ones I had weighed twice as much.</li>
    <li> I received this straightener as a birthday present around 7 years ago (I cannot exactly remember when I got it, its been so long!)  I fell in love, I hate using anyone else&#x27;s straightener this is the only one I would use on my hair! used it everyday for 3 or 4 years and at least 2 times a week for the other years and it finally stopped working this morning.  This straightener has been through a lot, I have a tiny bathroom and it has fallen off the counter countless times (and a fall is the reason it stopped working this morning) maybe if i would had not let it fall so much it would last me another 7 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story Short: Great straightener, Heats up in less than 2 mins!!</li>
    <li> I just received my straightener today it was in its original packaging unopened and unused.  I had to try it out.  First of all, today was a rainy day my and I have natural wavy and most of the time frizzy hair so, I felt it was a perfect day to see what it was made of.  It was awesome straightened my hair with the first swipe left my hair silky smooth you could not tale that a few minutes prior my hair was all wavy and frizzy from the rain.  I highly recommend this hair straightener, you will not regret your purchase.  Always remember when you are straightening your hair, for a good job section it off!</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for.  I wanted one like I had and was a little concerned i wasn&#x27;t going to be able to find one just like it. but i did!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I discovered it, because it was in the bathroom of my room at the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas. I had never seen a flat iron in a hotel room before, and I&#x27;m so glad that they had this because it works great! I had another Conair flat iron before, but this works 10 times better. The straightness holds and leaves my hair soft. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have had alot of straightners, chi, other less expensive and this one holds up to the reviews and is amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! I must say this is a great product. Not only does it straighten my hair but it makes it very shiny with lots of body. I recently purchased the another flat iron by conair and it works good but this one is awesome. When I straighten my hair it looks like I came from the hair shop. I love it, I love it!</li>
    <li> Great! My hair is very thick and this straightner does a great job! My friend paid nearly $80.00 for the exact same one!</li>
    <li> was sent a different straightener. looks the same but a different model. it doesnt heat up to the temperature that it says in the picture. ive only used a few times and now the straightener keeps shutting off randomly</li>
    <li> Excellent product at much lower price then similar straighteners costing $80 to $150  I have purchased two of them for my teenage kids.</li>
    <li> Love it! So glad I could find one exactly like my old one I had for 5-6 years. I do love the smaller plates though. Mine had about one and a half or 2 inches and this one is 1 inch. Loving it!</li>
    <li> I do like the longer plates but this hair straightener isn&#x27;t my favorite.  It works well enough for my thick hair.  I like that you can adjust the heat settings a lot.  My only complaint is something I can&#x27;t describe.  It&#x27;s like it just doesn&#x27;t work as well for me as my CHI nano did.  I replaced my CHI nano with this because I dropped it in the toilet.  I am satisfied with this straightener for now, but in the future I&#x27;ll probably go back and pay a bit more for my straighteners.  One big thing about the CHI nano is that it made my hair softer and smoother.  I thought all straighteners would be able to do that but this does not.  The texture of the plates also kind of feel weird on my hair.  It&#x27;s matte-like so it isn&#x27;t completely smooth.  The CHI nano I had had glossy plates that allowed smooth sliding.  I think that is my preference.  And like someone else said, the little screws on the tip pull my hair sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great straightener.  It&#x27;s much better than the cheap Remington model I have as well.  For the budgeter, this is a great option.  I&#x27;ll just be saving up for something more high-end.</li>
    <li> my sister loves it and uses it every day. It has worked perfectly fine for over 6 months now.</li>
    <li> This works decent. The white paint has begun chipping off along the edges closest to where the plates are. Unfortunately these flakes get into my hair and then I have to pick them out. Pretty annoying.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old Granddaughter and she just love it. Uses it all the time. Works well. It is very popular with the teenage girls.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is great! Heats up quick, light and easy to hold, long cord!! I love Conair products -- so I always order from them when I need a new curling iron or straightener. my only complaint with this particular product is that there&#x27;s a small gap between the shell and the heating strip and my hair gets caught in it. I filled in the gap and now it works almost perfectly with little-to-no hair-grabbing!</li>
    <li> Love this, very classy and cute. It get&#x27;s hot fast!.... I love that is comes with a heat bag. you will need it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I happy with it everything</li>
    <li> I had one of these for SOOOOO long(seriously, probably 6-7 YEARS) and it worked great for both my daughter and I....we totally beat it up!....it was getting old and used and scarred, but the plates stayed perfect and it always did a great job of either straightening OR curling. Finally, it blew a fuse just last week and we MISS it...so, when I found it here on Amazon.com at such a great price...replacing with the same GEM of a Flatiron is a no brainier for me!!! I just ordered it....I hope this new iron is as awesome as my old one(RIP) was😄</li>
    <li> Ive had this straightener for about 5 years...and it is the best straightener ive ever come across. My mom and friends spend 100&#x27;s on straighteners that arent anywhere NEAR as good as mine and its more than half of the price. It gets hot as soon as you turn it on and it is so smooth and just amazing. Like I said,ive had mine about 5 years and I am going to get another one soon just IN CASE something happens since ive had it so long...but I doubt it! Id cry if they stopped making these and I refuse to use anything else.</li>
    <li> I used it once, didn&#x27;t even finish using it when it shut off and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. It worked the next day, then would never work again.. Still waiting on my refund..</li>
    <li> This Conair Straightener is just the right size and works great.&lt;br /&gt;My first one lasted 5 years with almost daily use and I was&lt;br /&gt;glad I was able to replace it with exactly the same one.</li>
    <li> She has had straighteners that were $300+ and she states this one actually does not fry her hair. I am sure there are better units but for the money this cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> I like it but I thought it had a digital temperature read out on the side but it still works well but I still like my old one better.</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with this flat iron. It seems to be very cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t look as nice in person as one would expect.  In fact, mine looks used. There is a nick on the side of one plate. Several places had gunk on the outside of the iron and a few nicks in the white paint. Secondly, the plates are not super slick smooth, it didn&#x27;t slide through my hair easily, but drug. I was much happier with the blue conair I ordered at the same time. Ironically, this was the higher priced iron. I will not be bothering to return because the price was so low and I will keep the mat/pouch for my other iron. This iron is not recommended by me! Go for the Conair Infiniti Pro 1/2 inch slim iron instead. I can&#x27;t imagine that this iron EVER sold for near $80.00</li>
    <li> It snatches your hair, and gets too hot to hold with both hands. Other than that, it&#x27;s an ok straightener, especially for the price ($22). And it comes with a great purse. My previous straightener was a Babyliss ipro 230 ionic that cost me 60 € and was fantastic compared to this one.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straight iron.  It heats up quickly and does a fabulous job on my wavy hair.  For the modest price it is a great deal!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is not bad, however it pulls my hair and tears it  at the top where the plate is. Maybe they can redesign so that it doesn&#x27;t do that and it would be great.</li>
    <li> great price. makes my hair feel great. love the heat resistant pouch. great settings and great color. gibdlvedl fjvdkj jvkbdfhkjvb</li>
    <li> I had the wider, heavier model and I liked that better, but otherwise this straightener does a good job especially on thick hair.</li>
    <li> My friend owns this flat iron and it did wonders for my hair. By the time I had really long hair. My hair is thin, but really curly and this iron heats fast, dries hair even faster. I don&#x27;t need to pass it in a strand more than maybe 2 to 3 times. I hope mine doesn&#x27;t arrive damaged or something because my friend&#x27;s has been going strong for almost 3 years and she pay 50. Im paying 36 so, what a deal.</li>
    <li> Conair makes a lot of great products, this was my first hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought, a great price and it works&lt;br /&gt;fabulous, heats up very fast and so easy to use and it gets the job done in a few minutes, Love it and gave up my&lt;br /&gt;curling iron for it..</li>
    <li> I purchased my iron from Costco about 2 years ago.  It still works good, not as good as it did when it was new BUT everyone in the house use it so it was well worth the $$$&#x27;s.  I saw one cheaper and one more expensive but I am sticking with what I know works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my hair is all natural, it is thick and coarse and it straightens my hair as if I went to the shop or pressed with a pressing iron.  People always ask me &#x27;do you have a perm?&#x27;  I tell them NO but I don&#x27;t think they believe me.  They also think I go to a Beauty Shop.  Why go to a Shop and spend $50 every two weeks when I can do it myself, I am saving $1200.00 a year!!!</li>
    <li> amazing product - easy to use, nice handling, don&#x27;t think I could do without.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It is light weight and it heats up so fast. I can straighten or curl with it!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this for my wife after returning a much more costly  Chi Turbo that my wife hated out of the box. Save money and my wife is much happier .</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product off of Groupon... so I am probably a little biased towards thinking this product is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for 2 years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet! It makes my hair look smooth, and my hair stays straight all day (and the next day if it&#x27;s not too greasy and I can get away without washing it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the cord swivels at the base of the straightener... it means the cord gets tangled less than other straighteners (and thus I get tangled less with this straightener than with others!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: the straightener is NOT a wide product at all. I like the narrow width because it allows me to get close to my scalp and get rid of that gross little wave so many girls miss at the back of their part... but for some friends its narrow-ness has been a point of contention... especially if their hair is really curly.</li>
    <li> you have to straighten your hair in sections with this or else it will pull out your hair but it is a great product besides that!</li>
    <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed the packaging -- I loved this at first but after the third use, I started noticing little white flecks in my hair! It seems that the plastic coating is flaking off along the edges, perhaps due to a combination of high heat and my styling products? Anyway, now I can only hope that the rest will come off relatively quickly, that I&#x27;ll still be able to use it (I do love the weight, heat, and length of this iron and the price is fantastic), and that those little white flecks are harmless! But if you use any sort of pomade or leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;d recommend a different model...</li>
    <li> ive had mine for 8 years the best flat iron ive ever used. the one i had just broke after 8 years and this is the more upgraded one and its even better ... ladies why spend 30 40$ on a wash and set get one of these and your set!!!!</li>
    <li> NOT PLEASED WITH FLAT IRON, VERY CHEAPLY MADE, DOES NOT GET REAL HOT, DOES NOT STRAIGHTEN HAIR WELL ,  VERY TIME CONSUMING TO STRAIGHTEN HAIR  DUE TO IT NOT WORKING WELL OR DOING THE PURPOSE . WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite straightener. Loved it so much I bought it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife,we couldn&#x27;t find it in stores,she loves it.It arrived in a timely fashion.I have no complaints</li>
    <li> Does a great job! My daughter kept using mine so I bought her her own for on Christmas and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This straightener is great but whats better is that I comes with a Heat resistant mat to lay it on and a pouch to store it in!</li>
    <li> I bought this not to only straighten my hair but to also curl my hair!  Yes, it&#x27;s the new in thing and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on another straightening iron just so i could curl my hair...Plus I&#x27;m still learning this new trick.  But it&#x27;s definitely worth the price!  I love that you can also adjust the heat digitally.</li>
