      <li>Just make sure you soak the wraps well before putting them on.</li>
      <li>I love it must better than foil wrappers.</li>
      <li>The directions were easy and simple to follow and after saturating them with a couple of drops of acetone, and leaving it on my nails for 10 min, the shellac polish came off perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Love these, makes easy work of getting gel off.</li>
      <li>I wish they would figure out a design that is more user friendly to apply.</li>
      <li>These wraps make removing the shellac polish easy.  </li>
      <li>The gel polish I had on (Harmony Gelish brand) lifted right up, off of the nail very easily.  </li>
      <li>Easy clean up and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find them after a nail technician used them in a salon.</li>
      <li>but for the price and time I would just stick to the original cotton and remover.</li>
      <li>Very useful to remove Shellac polish, but make sure to use it very damp.</li>
      <li>It is hard to do by yourself,  but practice makes perfect!!!</li>
      <li>These really help remove the top part of the shellac at the tip of the nail.</li>
      <li>They were easy to put on the first time I tried them.</li>
      <li>Other than that, they are great to remove the gel.</li>
      <li>I watched online videos on how to use these and it looked straight forward and easy.  </li>
      <li>The concept of these are great, however they are a little tricky to put on myself.</li>
      <li>This is a great price but also a waste.</li>
      <li>Rarely will I buy from a supplier that tacks on additional charges.</li>
      <li>Buying this set was DEFINITELY worth my money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest a different wrap, the ones that wrap tightly like bandages work the best.</li>
      <li>But its such a great deal then buying it from sephora for only 30wraps</li>
      <li>I also left them on for a little longer than 10 minutes just to be sure it worked good.  </li>
      <li>I used one on each finger, but the polish didn&#x27;t stick to the pad, so I&#x27;m sure you can reuse them for your second hand.</li>
      <li>You do need to be sure you&#x27;ve put enough acetone on the pad.</li>
      <li>I use them mostly for removing the sticky goo that is left on my nails after curing.</li>
      <li>I did my first removal without these and searched for something to make it easier.</li>
      <li>These wraps actually work better than soaking your fingers in a bowl of acetone.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use and I always give a little twist as I remove them to wipe off more polish.</li>
      <li>I found that I was able to wrap these around my own fingers with relative ease and they allowed me to do other things while waiting.</li>
      <li>I pretty much have tried all of them.</li>
      <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as shown in pictures or videos.</li>
      <li>These are great does not dry the cuticle as bad as soaking.&lt;br /&gt;They are well worth spending the extra dollars to make your client happy.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure you get it tight enough to have the cotton part touching your finger nail.  </li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>These are very cumbersome to use.  </li>
      <li>I had tried the cotton ball and foil routine also, too much of a hassle.  </li>
      <li>These get the job done and really do work well for at home use.</li>
      <li>These work really well for gel nails.</li>
      <li>I received this 250 pack of shellac remover wraps in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  </li>
      <li>Works fast no soaking saves time.</li>
      <li>These wraps work much better than all the other things I&#x27;ve tried and won&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>they penetrate the nail better than other removers and they trap the heat</li>
      <li>I was not able to use it on my own nails.  </li>
      <li>I was able to use less solution and it seemed like it worked faster and came off easier.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I had same saved from the 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little challenging to get all 10 fingers wrapped when you need your fingers to help you wrap.</li>
      <li>A little tricky to use but works better than cotton and foil.</li>
      <li>These sounded good in theory but are pretty difficult to put on yourself.</li>
      <li>The pads on these are nice, thick, and absorbent and help to prevent the acetone from getting all over your fingers.</li>
      <li>but if you live alone it&#x27;s easier to stick with foil and cotton balls to remove gel or acrylics.</li>
      <li>I read before in a shellac forum that people were saying they&#x27;d rather use a small cotton pad with tin foil over them and a heating pad on top to fully get the shellac off.  </li>
      <li>I reuse the first five on my 2nd hand.</li>

    <li> No more silver foil needed. These help the polish lift off your nails. Easy clean up and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are awesome.  I use them to remove  gel manicures.  I was so excited to find them after a nail technician used them in a salon.</li>
    <li> These sounded good in theory but are pretty difficult to put on yourself. If you have someone that can help you put them on than they are a good buy but if you live alone it&#x27;s easier to stick with foil and cotton balls to remove gel or acrylics.</li>
    <li> SUCH A GREAT BARGIN!!! Excellent quality and price!  They work great and are so easy to use.</li>
    <li> These use to be made with a fabric type material. The foil just falls off. Very hard to keep in place.</li>
    <li> My recommendation for these wraps would be to put the acetone on the pad, wrap them, and they stick them on your fingers.  I had a pretty tough time putting these on and getting them to stay in place. I read before in a shellac forum that people were saying they&#x27;d rather use a small cotton pad with tin foil over them and a heating pad on top to fully get the shellac off.  After attempting these wraps, I&#x27;d almost want to try the other method to see if it is a little less frustrating.</li>
    <li> These are my top two best gel removal wraps. I pretty much have tried all of them. I have reused them a second time, since nothing &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to them. I leave them open and they dry. The sticker part remains sticky too.</li>
    <li> Works best when doing 1 hand at a time but effective and I will order again.</li>
    <li> A little tricky to use but works better than cotton and foil. Would be easier if you have someone to help you, but after a couple times using them you can figure it out on your own.</li>
    <li> I used to use cotton balls and foil to remove my shellac polish. I bought these looking for an easier way to remove the polish. They work great. It&#x27;s a little challenging to get all 10 fingers wrapped when you need your fingers to help you wrap. I have found it easiest to wrap each finger and then slide it off and put it aside. Once I have done that 10 times then I slide them all back on. I will definitely buy these again once I run out.</li>
    <li> I am a BIG fan of gel nail polish, but dread the removal process. I used to use the aluminum foil and cotton ball method until I bought these wraps. The pads on these are nice, thick, and absorbent and help to prevent the acetone from getting all over your fingers. I found that I was able to wrap these around my own fingers with relative ease and they allowed me to do other things while waiting. I used one on each finger, but the polish didn&#x27;t stick to the pad, so I&#x27;m sure you can reuse them for your second hand. It took me longer than 10 minutes to really break down the gel, but it definitely beats using foil. Buying this set was DEFINITELY worth my money.</li>
    <li> I love it must better than foil wrappers. I can actually do other things while they are on my nails.</li>
    <li> hard to apply without help...uses alot of acetone.  It&#x27;s easier to use cotton balls and aluminum foil, to not waste the acetone</li>
    <li> These are easier to use if you have help putting them on. I do think they are nicer to use than soaking your nails.</li>
    <li> Works fast no soaking saves time.</li>
    <li> These are very cumbersome to use.  You need to have someone else put them on for you.  Even with someone else putting them on for me, they still did not take my polish off.</li>
    <li> These wraps make removing the shellac polish easy.  I really like them. They are easy to use and I always give a little twist as I remove them to wipe off more polish.</li>
    <li> Very useful to remove Shellac polish, but make sure to use it very damp.</li>
    <li> The concept of these are great, however they are a little tricky to put on myself. Perhaps with some more practice I will get the hang of them. The functionality of them is good though.</li>
    <li> This is a great price but also a waste. These are very difficult to put on your fingers, it&#x27;s hard to wrap them tight or straight so it doesn&#x27;t get the polish off efficiently. I&#x27;d suggest a different wrap, the ones that wrap tightly like bandages work the best.</li>
    <li> Using these is definitely easier than soaking your fingernails, but they don&#x27;t work quite as well as videos would have you believe. Perhaps I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it took significantly longer than 10 min to get the shellac polish to loosen up. It definitely doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as shown in pictures or videos. Especially in the sides and corners of your nails. But again, easier than soaking your fingernails in a bowl of acetone.</li>
    <li> I like the shipment on time. The Item is good, too, easy to use except there it isn&#x27;t any moist for this remover wraps.</li>
    <li> I was using aluminum foil and cotton balls, but I thought I&#x27;d splurge on these, and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I reuse them several times. They never drip, and work well to remove shellac.</li>
    <li> These are no better than just using a cotton ball, soaking it and placing it on your fingers for 20 minutes.  They are very hard to use if you are doing it on yourself.  You have to make sure you get it tight enough to have the cotton part touching your finger nail.  You do get to walk around in Freddie Crouger  fingers for a while but for the price and time I would just stick to the original cotton and remover.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, better than foil.</li>
    <li> These wraps probably work well if you have someone else put them on. It takes two hands to do a good job.  One hand doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is easy to use.  You can get the same affect with a cotton ball and foil but this is all connected and much easier especially if you are working on yourself.</li>
    <li> better value, great product.  The only way to do laquer or gel nails. What? 7 more words required ? !</li>
    <li> I did my first removal without these and searched for something to make it easier. These are worth the price and you can use 5 each time by reusing on the other hand, Shellac came off easier with these.</li>
    <li> They are very hard to put on. Fall off before polish is loosened. Did not work better off soaking your nails</li>
    <li> I am so very happy that I found this huge pack of CND Gel UV Polish Remover wraps!  I tried cotton pads, which I soaked in acetone and wrapped with foil to save the expense of purchasing the wraps, which was not as effective or as easy to use as the wraps.</li>
    <li> These work really well for gel nails. Just make sure you soak the wraps well before putting them on. Depending on the gel polish and thick the application was you may have to scrape some off and re-apply wrap for another few minutes.</li>
    <li> These really help remove the top part of the shellac at the tip of the nail. They are easy to wrap on my one hand but hard to do on the other. As it is time to remove them I just switch fingers as I removed them saves 5 wraps and while I prep the one hand the other is soaking.</li>
    <li> This worked so much better that using foil and cotton balls!  I got a dispensor for the soak off solution and that helped a lot in doing my own nails.  The wraps are a little tricky when putting them on my dominant hand, but still doable.  I was able to use less solution and it seemed like it worked faster and came off easier.  I only needed to do one application and only for about 15 minutes.  I only had to really scrape at one or two nails, and then only a bit, the rest came off very easily with just a little push from my orange stick.  I will definitely use these from now on!</li>
    <li> I received this 250 pack of shellac remover wraps in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all getting them on my fingernails/fingers.  The directions were easy and simple to follow and after saturating them with a couple of drops of acetone, and leaving it on my nails for 10 min, the shellac polish came off perfectly.  I would rather use these that have to mess with using cottonballs and foil.  Thank you for such a great solution to removing shellac or gel UV polish!</li>
    <li> This works beautifully and is so easy to use. I actually do one hand at a time and then use the first 5 again on the second hand. Saves a lot of use that way and the package lasts a lot longer.</li>
    <li> These work great. You use a lot less remover with these then with a cotton ball &amp; tin foil.&lt;br /&gt;I use five each time instead of 10. I do one hand at a time. I think they&#x27;re hard to get on tight to the 2nd hand when you have them on the other had. I reuse the first five on my 2nd hand. The gel doesn&#x27;t stick to the pads, the gel just softens &amp; you scrap it off.</li>
    <li> Makes soaking off a breeze! I love that I don&#x27;t have to soak my hand in a bowl of acetone.</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve to getting these on. Before I bought these it would take me 30-40 minutes of soaking to remove the gel and even then not all of it came off. I was soaking my finger tips in a small cup with acetone. With these wraps once I have them on I put a heating pad set on low over my hand and in about 15 minutes I give the wraps a little twist and pull them off. The nails are completely clear of the gel. There might be a slight bit still left sometimes but easy enough to scrape off. You do need to be sure you&#x27;ve put enough acetone on the pad. I don&#x27;t know if they would work as efficiently without a little heat from the heating pad. I only gave it 4 stars because of the difficulty getting them on your nails. I wish they would figure out a design that is more user friendly to apply. I also had tried those little pink and clear cap things for removing the gel, hated those things. I had tried the cotton ball and foil routine also, too much of a hassle.  These wraps work much better than all the other things I&#x27;ve tried and won&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> These are great does not dry the cuticle as bad as soaking.&lt;br /&gt;They are well worth spending the extra dollars to make your client happy.</li>
    <li> These are really hard to put on yourself. They work great when I have someone apply them for me.</li>
    <li> These wraps work great!  They were easy to put on the first time I tried them. (The people saying they&#x27;re hard to put on or they are falling off, must not be doing it right, or just aren&#x27;t very coordinated themselves to handle it.)  I did the same as what others suggested and just used five on one hand, then slipped them off, and slid them on the other fingers afterward.  Saves a little money that way.  I also left them on for a little longer than 10 minutes just to be sure it worked good.  The gel polish I had on (Harmony Gelish brand) lifted right up, off of the nail very easily.  Very impressed with the results.  I will NEVER soak my nails in a dish again!  Also thought these were way easier to use then cotton pads and foil.</li>
    <li> I read the lower rating reviews and understand their logic, but there is a trick for do-it-yourselfers.  Do one hand at a time and begin with your pinky finger and work to the larger fingers leaving your thumb last.  Acentone only needs to be on the portion of the pad that rests on the nail.  Once one hand is done, just slip off the pad and use it on the equivelant finger on the other hand; thus, getting two uses out of a single pad and generally not having to add more acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is pricing and refuse to pay shipping.  Rarely will I buy from a supplier that tacks on additional charges.</li>
    <li> These are hard to apply for an uncoordinated person.  They serve the purpose though. I use them mostly for removing the sticky goo that is left on my nails after curing.</li>
    <li> I love these! You still have to do a little scraping, but the gel nails come right off! They are easy to use and as less messy than cotton balls.</li>
    <li> I live in Costa Rica and the same product in here costs the double. The quality its the best and even more the price</li>
    <li> Order arrived timely and was as stated.  I would buy this again when needed, but plenty were in the package.</li>
    <li> A litle pricey but I find them easier to handle than the foil and cotton method.  I can apply them to my own nails and get the required results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use on yourself for shellac removal, nice number of wraps in the pack and price good.  Recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I just love these pads. I first tried a pack of 100, now bought these 250 which is a great deal! The only minus is that the orangewood stick, which you use to remove the rest of shellac, is not included. Luckily I had same saved from the 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;And I read a lot of reviews and saw that it&#x27;s hard to use the pads. Hmm.. I&#x27;m not a professional either but it&#x27;s very easy to use them for me, maybe just the 5th finger is a little bit tricky.</li>
    <li> This is a great product much better than the removers that came with my sephora by opi gelshine kit. Although they are a little tricky to get on all the way- they penetrate the nail better than other removers and they trap the heat so you don&#x27;t have to wear gloves over top like my sephora wraps. Although it says only 10 minutes to keep the acetone on I do 20/25 to avoid scraping the nail off as well. These get the job done and really do work well for at home use.</li>
    <li> These work great to remove shellac!  They wrap easily and do a great job of removing the shellac from your nails.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I got 250 wraps for $18.... but these are not easy to put on your fingers... When ever I used these up, I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> It is hard to do by yourself,  but practice makes perfect!!! But its such a great deal then buying it from sephora for only 30wraps</li>
    <li> Love these, makes easy work of getting gel off. I used to wrap with cotton balls and foil! No more.</li>
    <li> I use these remover wraps, to remove CND Shellac Power Polish from my nails.  I find them easy to use, and they do an excellent job of removing the shellac polish, without damaging my nail.  You soak the remover pad with acetone, then wrap it on your nail, and leave it on for 10 minutes. You can see how to use the wraps, by watching the following YouTube video:  [...]</li>
    <li> These wraps actually work better than soaking your fingers in a bowl of acetone. I use these wraps to remove my Shellac polish and I prefer them over the soak method.  I do my own nails. And, when I remove the polish I do one hand at a time, saving the wraps and adding a little more acetone to them to use on my other hand.</li>
    <li> I much prefer wraps to foil and cotton to remove gel nails, but these wraps are hard to get on if you have no one to help you. I&#x27;m hoping that practice makes perfect. Other than that, they are great to remove the gel.</li>
    <li> I like these better than using foil and cotton balls.  They stay on your fingers and worked great for me.</li>
    <li> These are next to impossible to use if your are a do it yourself&#x27;er. Seriously, you need a third hand to get it wrapped around your figure tip. I find that the pad is very thick and uses a lot of remover. What works for me is foil and gauze. The foils forms well around your tip, and a very small piece of gauze uses little remover. I just pre cut the foil and gauze, and I&#x27;m good to go. These were a waste of money.</li>
    <li> These wraps are not the easiest product to use, but they do work well.  Have tried other products and none work as well.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use it on my own nails.  I watched online videos on how to use these and it looked straight forward and easy.  Not really. It was extremely difficult to put it on any of my own nails.  I gave up and used foil instead.</li>
