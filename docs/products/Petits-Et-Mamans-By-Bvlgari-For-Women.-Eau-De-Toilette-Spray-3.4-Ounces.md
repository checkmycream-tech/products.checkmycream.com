    <li> I bought this product not having smelt it before and was very pleased with the scent. It smells a bit like Parma violets. Lovely bottle too the only downside is that the scent is not very strong and doesn&#x27;t last very long but if you are using it on children that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. Would buy again though.</li>

I am allergic to most scents, but surprisingly, I smelled this scent on a friend, tried it, and loved it.  It smells sort of like baby powder with a hint of adult flavor (for women). It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Smell as I expected. smells like baby powder. it&#x27;s not my favorite but I wear it in winter</li>
    <li> smile like fresh baby powder</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t what to else to say, this very amazing product.

    <li> Scent is lovely / came in a new package / prompt arrival - thank you</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this perfume. Very good scent. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough. I would expect nothing less from Bvlgari.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... The best perfum for my little sister. 5 stars i love it. This is my third time that i bought the same.</li>
    <li> I love the soft smell of this perfume that can be use for both babies and moms. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have worn this delicate scent for over 15 years... It is very refreshing, like steeping from the shower continuously throughout the day... Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annette</li>
    <li> smells SO clean and light!</li>
    <li> Thank you for carrying this perfume.  I love it  and it makes me happy.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> The scent is very good for little kids, but the product arrive without box, cover and with a sticker \\&quot;tester only, not for sale\\&quot;</li>
    <li> And, let&#x27;s face it, I&#x27;m far from innocent. :-) With this perfume, though, I can at least pull off &amp;#34;less slutty.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This perfume smells very soft and fresh since I stopped using my perfumes during my pregnancy. Know I can use some drops in my baby cloth and we smell very nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Smells baby powder-ish, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I bought this long time ago. At that time, I was looking for this purfume for few weeks because i dont really believe the perfumes and bags from the internet, but I think this is good enough:)</li>
    <li> This is truly a lovely scent, just like baby powder, soft and subtle. Sadly, Petits Et Mamans does not last on me. The scent is perfect after a shower, but in the hot, humid climate I live in, I can&#x27;t smell it much after an hour or so. Might be worth buying a small purse perfume bottle and carrying some around with me. It&#x27;s that nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume from WorldlyTreasures.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up got the wrong item but seller apologized immediately and quickly sent me the right item.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume itself smells great , just like the way l remembered ! (this is my second time using this perfume after my husband accidently dropped it off from shelf to break into pieces)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you WorldlyTreasures for wonderful customer service I will definitely buy it from you guys again ! :)</li>
    <li> My wife wanted me to buy this because some of the celebrities in the Philippines liked it.....lol  It smells exactly like baby powder and we both hate it.  Why would any adult want to walk around smelling like baby powder?  Anyways, she won&#x27;t wear it, I guess we will give it away.</li>
    <li> My grand babies smell Soooo good ( and I do too) just a clean winderful scent to spritz on little ones</li>
    <li> I love it on my young daughter!  It is soft enough that you know she is wearing something but not too powerful.</li>
    <li> This perfume really smells delicious, the next time I will buy the complete kid, and is very soft to my baby</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  I think it&#x27;s one of the best scents, if not the best for babies because it is so light.  My sister has used it on all three of her children, and I just bought a couple for my own baby.</li>
    <li> Love this delicate, subtle scent and I&#x27;m not allergic to it because it contains no alcohol! I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume its perfect for babies.. Its fresh and lovely.,. My mom and I used for our kids .. Everybody love how smell...</li>
    <li> I like it , Not My best buy but its nice and fresh not overpowering - overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;It would be nicer if it come in a bottle that spray .</li>
    <li> Best smelling baby perfume ever! I am very picky with baby perfume. But if you are looking for this &amp;#34;baby smell&amp;#34; this is your go to perfume bottle. It&#x27;s far from lemony like most baby perfumes.</li>
    <li> loved this product... smelled good and light. perfect for my babies. :o) light floral tones with a hint of baby powder scent.</li>
    <li> I love it, my favorite cologne for years; get compliments all the time. Don&#x27;t change it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really mad because the perfume has a sticker who said: &amp;#34;is NOT for sale&amp;#34; it was a sample!</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived on time, the perfume smells very soft, clean , last  all day, I highly recommend especially for babies with sensitive skin .</li>
    <li> Just too musky. Wish i could return it.</li>
    <li> This is straight baby powder smell. Not \\&quot;oh, smells like a baby!\\&quot; but very artificial, strong, powder smell. I only use it to spray in my daughter&#x27;s diaper genie.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Can&#x27;t describe the smell but really fresh and light. Good for young ladies. Wrapping is good as well.</li>
    <li> Great item, last for over a year with daily use on my baby. Smells delicious</li>
    <li> The bottle is cute and it smells perfect, like watered down baby powder. I can spritz it on liberally and it&#x27;s always light enough not to offend anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best cologne for babys I ever tried and here I found it quite less expensive than in Duty Free!</li>
    <li> Loved the product. Bought it for my daughter who just had her first baby girl and although she won&#x27;t be using it right away since she&#x27;s just a newborn both my daughter and myself loved the scent as well as the bottle.</li>
    <li> It does not have spay on it just water and the smell is so weird</li>
    <li> Huele super rico, es perfecto para mí bebé y para la mamá también. Ideal para cualquier ocasión, de diario ó especial.</li>
    <li> I have always worn this cologne when then weather turns warm. It exudes a clean powdery just bathed scent. As the day progresses and the scent wears off, the natual warmth from your body, brings it up again and still leaves you smelling very pleasant</li>
    <li> Nothing to write home about. Not a very strong scent. I would describe it as a soft baby soap scent.</li>
    <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t last! I think this product is fake!</li>
    <li> It no last more than 30 minutes. It not smell as the same as other that I bought in the past.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT FOR A PERSON WITH ALLERGIES</li>
    <li> This is very nice, powdery, little bit sweet EDT spray. I like it, it&#x27;s good for day , not too strong, but long lasting.</li>
    <li> I could not love this more! Excellent purchase, smells so fantadtic. I also tried the johnston one and was very dissapointed so i was a little nervous getting this which was 3xs the price, but it turned out better than expected!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, smells very good.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived perfect This perfume has a very mild scent fits my daughter perfect I recommend it for ages 1-3</li>
    <li> Soft smell..... Lasts all day!!!! Great scent even for an adult. Happy with perfume &amp; so is my baby. No complaints! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really love this scent of bulgari baby, this is my fave! I have been using this cologne for 10 years and i love it!  I. Highly recomment this!</li>
    <li> This item do not deserve even an star.i received plane water instead cologne.i want my money back.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it! My baby enjoys it as well would recommend it :) it came within a week.</li>
