      <li>Now, I gotta be honest here</li>

      <li>I love Nyx.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing price for fantastic make up.  </li>
      <li>I more then love it.</li>
      <li>The whites are lovely as well..  </li>
      <li>Came in excellent condition and colors are so rich, soft and luxurious.</li>
      <li>Other than that it was perfect</li>
      <li>And when all folded up, if you have a decent size purse, the whole box will travel beautifully.</li>
      <li>, I applied one of colors on my eyelids and it went on really smooth</li>
      <li>They are so much more vibrant than the picture captures, and the wear is phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I do wish the mirror was the whole size of the top, not just 1/2 of it.</li>
      <li>I am in absolute love with this makeup kit by Nyx.</li>
      <li>I love my new make up!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I will most definitely order more Nyx products.</li>
      <li>ok because i purchased this mainly for teh eye shadows and blush anyway.  </li>
      <li>I wish the lip gloss colors were not quite so sheer, but overall it is a great set!</li>
      <li>This is a great makeup kit the colors are beautiful and vibrant and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>She has fun picking out colors that match her outfits.  </li>
      <li>First of all, this is my very first Nyx product.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend over other more popular brands.  </li>
      <li>I love this set as it has so many options for doing smokey eyes and also a lot of plum / purple shades and even a few brighter tones.  </li>
      <li>am not a fan of the lip colours, they aren&#x27;t pigmented and they are very VERY sticky.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>My daughters first make up kit.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more of these kits.</li>
      <li>I was kind of worried because of the feedback I read that the make up came all broken, but in my case it was OK.</li>
      <li>So I informed her that I could look at amazon and check the reviews and based on the number of positive feedback and reviews I got one for my friend.</li>
      <li>but I much prefer higher quality cosmetics if I am going to use on my skin.</li>
      <li>Exelent, very god, I like</li>
      <li>I am not one for reviews really</li>
      <li>Really did not like the texture on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>The lip gloss and lip liner might not do much</li>
      <li>So i received it really fast and today I presented the kit to my friend.</li>
      <li>NYX is high quality at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m certain she will have fun experimenting with the different combinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but my only problem was that it does not last more than 3 to 4 hours and ended up as creases in my eyelids, other than that I love my new product.</li>
      <li>I use the Nyx eyeshadow primer underneath and the colors stay vibrant all day.  </li>
      <li>The colors were vibrant and as they were shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>Chose this brand because it is known to be decent quality of makeup.</li>
      <li>Makeup is high quality.  </li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>never use lip liner, but the one included in mine was a pale pink, and applied very nicely when I tested it out.</li>
      <li>The actual quality of the eye shadows and the blushes are AMAZING the second blush to the left is a dupe for MAC lovecloud!</li>
      <li>The blushes also provide a nice hint of flush, and the set includes two eyeshadow applicators and a small blush brush--plus a built in mirror!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is highly pigmented and some of the shades are in duplicates in the box, but I actually ended up loving that, because they are somehow colours that I use everyday, such as the matte blacks and the matte crease brown colours.</li>
      <li>this kit opens with so many levels &amp; drawers (and another hidden drawer I found 1/2 hour later!!!)</li>
      <li>It came timely (even for peak season) and complete.</li>
      <li>Not so much for the younger crowd</li>
      <li>I had forgotten about the middle compartment opening up, so it was a nice bonus when I found the lip gloss and extra eye shadow after a few weeks!</li>
      <li>I bought this as a Christmas present for a 16 yr old girl who asked for &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My skin is extra sensitive in allergy break out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this to my 13 year old daughter who recently asked if she could have some makeup.  </li>

    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for a 16 yr old girl who asked for &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;. Chose this brand because it is known to be decent quality of makeup. Received the pkg &amp; I was like &amp;#34;are you joking me?&amp;#34; It was SO TINY!!! Well, let me tell you....this kit opens with so many levels &amp; drawers (and another hidden drawer I found 1/2 hour later!!!) The colors are gorgeous and it has everything you would need (besides mascara). This is an excellent gift and if I knew of someone else that wanted makeup for Christmas, I would buy this again. My 16 year old will NOT be disappointed!! These are very sophisticated colors as well. Not so much for the younger crowd I don.t think. &amp;#34;Dramatic&amp;#34; is a good word to describes the shadows. EXCELLENT. GIFT. PERIOD. Thank you! PS...I do wish the mirror was the whole size of the top, not just 1/2 of it. That would be awesome!! And when all folded up, if you have a decent size purse, the whole box will travel beautifully.</li>
    <li> I am in absolute love with this makeup kit by Nyx. It&#x27;s a great deal for all that you get and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!😍</li>
    <li> Excelente. Recomendado</li>
    <li> I purchased this make-up set for my daughter for Christmas. She is a fan of the line and was very happy when she received it. The colors were vibrant and as they were shown in the picture. The product arrived intact without any broken or cracked pallettes.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup kit the colors are beautiful and vibrant and a little goes a long way.Very good quality product at a great price.Will definitely be buying more of these kits.</li>
    <li> High quality. I highly recommend it!! It is as good as announced. If i need another one, I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and go smooth. This arrived on schedule and I&#x27;ve been wearing and using the kit everyday since. I even bought one for my friend. I recommend this to any makeup lover. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is really nice. I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in a long time but recently I had to buy some due to commercial acting. My skin is extra sensitive in allergy break out. This stuff is great. No complaints at all. No spf so my sunscreen allergy is not blowing up my face like a pumpkin.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows in this collection are to die for! They are so much more vibrant than the picture captures, and the wear is phenomenal. I don&#x27;t even have to put primer on for the color to last, and a little bit goes a long way with these colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip glosses (both the tubes and palette) are lightweight and long-lasting. Great variety of colors, with just a hint of shimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never use lip liner, but the one included in mine was a pale pink, and applied very nicely when I tested it out. The blushes also provide a nice hint of flush, and the set includes two eyeshadow applicators and a small blush brush--plus a built in mirror!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girl friend after reading all the reviews, Its all as expected and works well for the price. She liked it a lot as she is at beginner level.</li>
    <li> 5 star product.  Case was convenient.  Makeup is high quality.  Very nice palette.  Useful for everyday.  Would highly recommend over other more popular brands.  NYX is high quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My friend and I were talking about makeup kits and such and she said that she wanted to get one for her niece overseas, and how expensive the name brands were at Macys. So I informed her that I could look at amazon and check the reviews and based on the number of positive feedback and reviews I got one for my friend. So i received it really fast and today I presented the kit to my friend. Her reaction was that she was keeping the kit for herself , the colors were really nice and we really love the eye shadows colors. So am planning to get myself one for the holidays, it is really a very nice kit..</li>
    <li> I was a little sad to see some of the eyeshadows were broken but that could have been from the mailman. Other than that it was perfect</li>
    <li> Not my favourite eyeshadow palette but it does have a very nice selection of colours.</li>
    <li> I love my new make up! It last long though, for me it&#x27;s not handy.</li>
    <li> Good price... But half the color was loose in the box... The color were stuck to the plastic cover... I recommend not buying this item... It seem like is not really NYX product</li>
    <li> Lots of choices and beautiful colors! Storage is nice and compact with everything in its place. I love experimenting with colors i havnt seen before!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of NYX cosmetics and this one did not disappoint.  Loved all the colours.  The lip gloss and lip liner might not do much but &#x27;twas ok because i purchased this mainly for teh eye shadows and blush anyway.  I know now what to get for my teenage nieces this upcoming holiday season!</li>
    <li> The actual quality of the eye shadows and the blushes are AMAZING the second blush to the left is a dupe for MAC lovecloud! I love this palette the only issue that i have with it is that i came barely protected. So the sliding compartment of the eye shadow is broken so it comes off. Other then that issue I more then love it.</li>
    <li> It it very cute but I much prefer higher quality cosmetics if I am going to use on my skin. Also, the case itself came to me broken, the wheels were completely shattered.</li>
    <li> Exelent, very god, I like</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife. It came timely (even for peak season) and complete. I was kind of worried because of the feedback I read that the make up came all broken, but in my case it was OK.</li>
    <li> Love this make-up and very happy with how quickly&lt;br /&gt;I received!  Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing price for fantastic make up.  I love Nyx.  And I plan on buying everything they make.  I love the colors in the palette!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and the set up.  Hate how the eyes shadows come out.  I will have to glue them in place.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this to my 13 year old daughter who recently asked if she could have some makeup.  I know this is even more than she was hoping for.  I can&#x27;t wait to give it to her.  I&#x27;m certain she will have fun experimenting with the different combinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While researching palettes to choose one for her, I learned about the NYX line of cosmetics.  I&#x27;m impressed with it!  Great quality and price.  I purchased a few other NYX products for her as well as for me and I am really enjoying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...UPDATE...my daughter is thrilled with this!  These colors are so nicely pigmented,  easy to apply and blend.  She has fun picking out colors that match her outfits.  I do think it is worth mentioning that these shadows work best on top of an eye primer or even better the NYX jumbo eye pencil in color called milk as a base.  NYX may be low cost, but definitely not cheap quality.</li>
    <li> Ordered this awesome  nyx  makeup set for my daughter  for her birthday.  It was beautiful  and are were sent  in a timely  manner.</li>
    <li> I love this set as it has so many options for doing smokey eyes and also a lot of plum / purple shades and even a few brighter tones.  The whites are lovely as well..  I use the Nyx eyeshadow primer underneath and the colors stay vibrant all day.  The blushes are beautiful.  I wish the lip gloss colors were not quite so sheer, but overall it is a great set!</li>
    <li> ..... she loved it!!!! :D Have not regretted purchasing. Came in excellent condition and colors are so rich, soft and luxurious. Price is amazing too. Will need to buy another one for myself soon!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not one for reviews really but here goes nothing, i think the colors are perfect for me I am a woman of color so I really have to look hard for makeup that works for my pecan brown skin tone.  First off I will start by saying none of the colors were broken that would have been a real bummer for me, I applied one of colors on my eyelids and it went on really smooth but my only problem was that it does not last more than 3 to 4 hours and ended up as creases in my eyelids, other than that I love my new product.</li>
    <li> My daughters first make up kit.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> First of all, this is my very first Nyx product. AND I AM IN LOVE WITH THE BRAND !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I would have given it 5 stars, but the set arrived with two of the little pots broken (not very broken, but enough to get black pigment all over the others) and the plastic was a little cracked close to the mirror. I am not one to complain about such minor things, but I guess I should remain objective as much as I can. ( Now, the packaging was very good, it has been sold by Amazon and I had a bunch of other things in the same box too, but I live in a military base overseas so maybe that&#x27;s the reason the palette came here a little bit damaged.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly pigmented and some of the shades are in duplicates in the box, but I actually ended up loving that, because they are somehow colours that I use everyday, such as the matte blacks and the matte crease brown colours. Now, I gotta be honest here: the colours don&#x27;t really pop on &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; skin, but I always use a lid primer or at least a face primer anyway. It&#x27;s pretty shocking how well and creamy and pigmented they become on a primer, which is the way I swatched them for you in the photos. (I used a Maybelline primer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of the lip colours, they aren&#x27;t pigmented and they are very VERY sticky. Really did not like the texture on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;The blushes aren&#x27;t that pigmented either, but they build up nicely. For the swatches I just used my foundtation as a base and that is the result of brushing over 3 times, like I would normally build up my blush anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will most definitely order more Nyx products.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get! I had forgotten about the middle compartment opening up, so it was a nice bonus when I found the lip gloss and extra eye shadow after a few weeks!</li>
