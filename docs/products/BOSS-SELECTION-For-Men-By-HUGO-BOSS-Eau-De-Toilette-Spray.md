      <li>well you get Avery thing right good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing like a citrus, just a nice fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>so strong - about 90% of them gives me a headache.</li>
      <li>This is my mourning perfume because it is not too strong to start a day.</li>
      <li>It freshness is ideal for hot weather and has a great fixing on the skin, lasting the whole day.</li>
      <li>no tax (I believe) and free shipping.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too light, but is never overpowering.</li>
      <li>No wonder it was selling for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Boss Selection is available in a sample vial.</li>
      <li>The scent is manly but unique and soft/subtle unless you spray a lot.</li>
      <li>This product smells very nice and it is cheaper in Amazon then any other store.</li>
      <li>and it got pretty fast to his house and in top condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is just great but wish it lasted little longer.</li>
      <li>VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>This is my scent right here.</li>
      <li>While eau de tiilette fragrances are certainly a personl choice, this is one worth considering.</li>
      <li>In Brazil is so expensive, but I got it on Amazon for a very good price!</li>
      <li>year later, when looking for more, some stores weren&#x27;t carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>first purchased it on a cruise ship tax</li>
      <li>FIRST I GOTTA SAY.</li>
      <li>This item came properly packaged and shrink wrapped so it looks authentic.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if you read reviews of Eau De Toilette spray before you buy it without going to Sephora or something to smell it first, but I had to order it online since I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE in the world.</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>Very basic but elegant.</li>
      <li>This fragrance really lingers!  </li>
      <li>This one smells nice and cheaper than sephora or other stores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable by women and compliments</li>
      <li>AWESOMELY FAST SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very contrasting fragrance.</li>
      <li>online Amazon was sooooo much cheaper...</li>
      <li>one is very good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just expected more from this product,&lt;br /&gt;it has no distinguishing feature, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not the same as the original Eau De Toilette</li>
      <li>say it&#x27;s generic, but I think it&#x27;s unique and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Not only did my cologne arrive ahead of schedule, but it was wrapped neatly in its original packaging.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for everyone .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh, at the same time masculine.</li>
      <li>My first couple bottles would last for days if you didn&#x27;t wash it off.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t explain, it must just be this particular scent because none of my others have had the same effect.  </li>
      <li>Last one was smashed by mistake and bought new one instead.</li>
      <li>My fiance is very picky and after careful deliberation I selected this scent for him in a store.</li>
      <li>The previous bottle lasted me for years and years, as it doesn&#x27;t take much of this to make an impact.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The smell is just great but wish it lasted little longer. Though it would linger for almost 4-5 hours. And not overpowering at all. I just hate colognes which are awfully strong.</li>
    <li> FIRST I GOTTA SAY. WHEN ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND SMELLED THIS COLOGNE AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE COUNTER AFTER WE WERE SHOPPING ONE NIGHT.  I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT. SO I CHECKED ONLINE. SAW THE LOWEST PRICE, AND ORDERED IT. I GOT IT LIKE IN 3 DAYS. AWESOMELY FAST SHIPPING. GREAT COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH. VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING. THANKS!</li>
    <li> Great clean aroma. While eau de tiilette fragrances are certainly a personl choice, this is one worth considering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got this fragrance for my boyfriend. It smells wonderful. It&#x27;s not too light, but is never overpowering. I do not like many men&#x27;s fragrances because they smell so strong - about 90% of them gives me a headache. This one, however, is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of Hugo Boss colognes.&lt;br /&gt;This one is very good.&lt;br /&gt;It starts out odd, but turns out to be great.&lt;br /&gt;Some say it&#x27;s generic, but I think it&#x27;s unique and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is great. Very basic but elegant. It did not last but half a day. I suppose the one I bougth here at amazon store it&#x27;s original.&lt;br /&gt;No further comments.</li>
    <li> I just expected more from this product,&lt;br /&gt;it has no distinguishing feature, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this type of product&lt;br /&gt;cannot be returned, my fault for&lt;br /&gt;buying something without testing it in person.</li>
    <li> My fiance is very picky and after careful deliberation I selected this scent for him in a store. I loved it and I was so relieved that he loved it too! The scent is manly but unique and soft/subtle unless you spray a lot. Now that I&#x27;ve found it on amazon I can make sure he never runs out!</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected, the scent was very weak. Within ten minutes of spraying in on, the scent was gone.</li>
    <li> Not only did my cologne arrive ahead of schedule, but it was wrapped neatly in its original packaging. Other sellers have sent it to me loosely surrounded by bubble wrap. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased it on a cruise ship tax free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later, when looking for more, some stores weren&#x27;t carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;I work in Chicago and Hugo Boss has its own store... but every where I looked, it was top price, plus tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching online Amazon was sooooo much cheaper... no tax (I believe) and free shipping.  Even the shipping which said it may not be shipped for more than a week and then the days it would take enroute... The bottle was in my hands in 3 days when I got home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very contrasting fragrance. It&#x27;s fresh, at the same time masculine. It freshness is ideal for hot weather and has a great fixing on the skin, lasting the whole day. It&#x27;s very noticeable by women and compliments tends to flow whenever you&#x27;re using it.</li>
    <li> it was a really nice purchase and I am very glad to buy it. I will buy it again anytime</li>
    <li> This item came properly packaged and shrink wrapped so it looks authentic.  It smells great when you first apply it.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the longevity I am used to.  My first couple bottles would last for days if you didn&#x27;t wash it off.  This doesn&#x27;t get through a single day.  Not the same as the original Eau De Toilette</li>
    <li> This is my mourning perfume because it is not too strong to start a day. Not another one of those citric scents, there are probably mostly wood notes. I love it.</li>
    <li> very good smell, durable, economical. wash clothes and the smell is still there. preferred.</li>
    <li> As advertised and way cheaper then buying from the mall</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume ever!  In Brazil is so expensive, but I got it on Amazon for a very good price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad for Fathers Day and it got pretty fast to his house and in top condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much else I can say, I suppoose it was an excelent service due to you are buying it from Hugo Boss, still I wasn&#x27;t expecting any less&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Service, Good Price.</li>
    <li> This product smells very nice and it is cheaper in Amazon then any other store. My nose never get used to this smell, I am always sensing it whenever my boyfriend uses it. Therefore, my boyfriend always uses this product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of Hugo Boss.  It&#x27;s similar to Prada for men. It does last quite a while if you spray it correctly.  This fragrance really lingers!  I&#x27;ll smell it after work constantly.  I can&#x27;t explain, it must just be this particular scent because none of my others have had the same effect.  It&#x27;s nothing like a citrus, just a nice fresh scent.  I&#x27;d always recommend searching Amazon for \\&quot;cologne vials\\&quot; though.  It&#x27;s best to try it for yourself.  Boss Selection is available in a sample vial.</li>
    <li> This one smells nice and cheaper than sephora or other stores. Last one was smashed by mistake and bought new one instead.</li>
    <li> Very impressive stay longer smell like real man. Highly recommend for everyone . ,.,.,.,.,.,.m .m,..m.m. . . ,,  ,. ,.., .</li>
    <li> Giving to a son-in-law for Christmas.  This is the only kind he wears, and it is very difficult to purchase from store in my area.</li>
    <li> Recebi a mercadoria sem nenhum problema dentro do prazo que foi estipulado para entrega. Vendedor recomendado. Produto de qualidade. obrigado.</li>
    <li> This is my scent right here. The previous bottle lasted me for years and years, as it doesn&#x27;t take much of this to make an impact. I don&#x27;t know if you read reviews of Eau De Toilette spray before you buy it without going to Sephora or something to smell it first, but I had to order it online since I couldn&#x27;t find it ANYWHERE in the world. If you can&#x27;t find a store that carries Selection to sample it, I&#x27;d recommend you just buy it anyway.</li>
    <li> Good nice exellent bery good perfect very well Was all good  here is well you get Avery thing right good</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It seems like the fragrance does not last at all... No wonder it was selling for a cheap price. Big mistake buying perfumes on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This was a preferred cologne but it seemed to be taken off the market for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
    <li> It was not sealed with the plastic sleeve, looks like it&#x27;s a used or a display sample, bad experience I ever had, strongly not recomended to purchase this!!!!!! dont spend high price to buy used stuff!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product shipped quickly</li>
