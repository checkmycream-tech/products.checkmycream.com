<li> it is a little expensive way to buy Orajel, but is is very easy to apply to only the sore gums and not all over the mouth.</li>
<li> They make it very easy to apply the medicine to my baby&#x27;s painful gums!</li>
<li> No problems returning it but wasted time.</li>
<li> I agree with the other people leaving feedback, it is expensive but it is worth the cost with application ease and on the run convenience you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> Since it is administered via a q-tip don&#x27;t have to worry about your baby swallowing unnecessary medicine</li>
<li> Even when my son had horrible teething pain.  </li>

    <li> These are the best thing made when you have a child battling teething! They make it very easy to apply the medicine to my baby&#x27;s painful gums! Absolutely wonderful!!</li>
    <li> much easier to apply than regular orajel</li>
    <li> This is the best teething soother there can be out there, we baught this for our baby boy, he really had a hard time while teething, so bad he had high fevers and couldn&#x27;t sleep at all, and these swabs were the miracle makers.</li>
    <li> They stopped selling this stuff in all the sores around me including larger re-sellers.  I agree with the other people leaving feedback, it is expensive but it is worth the cost with application ease and on the run convenience you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I tried this with my teething 8 month old, and with only the tiniest little dab, she started gagging and threw up (which she&#x27;s never done).  When I tried it myself, I could see why - it&#x27;s so strong!  Try it yourself first, and if you wouldn&#x27;t use it, don&#x27;t give it to your baby. We&#x27;re sticking to teethers from now on.</li>
    <li> Baby orajel is on the picture and description but regular orajel is what I receive.  No problems returning it but wasted time.</li>
    <li> Used this for my twins and it works like a champ!!! They would be so fussy and wouldn&#x27;t sleep or calm down, and as soon as we would use these swabs the boys would relax and calm down.</li>
    <li> These are great to carry in your purse for a teething baby.  Snap off tip and easy application.</li>
    <li> Great product and these swabs make it very easy to apply.  I use one swab for both of my twin boys and throw out the remaining medicine in the swab.  it is a little expensive way to buy Orajel, but is is very easy to apply to only the sore gums and not all over the mouth.</li>
    <li> These make using orajel easy and safe.  Could not recommend enough.</li>
    <li> Works but may be on recall list</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and it brings relief witching 20 seconds.  Even when my son had horrible teething pain.  A great alternative to Tylenol.  Since it is administered via a q-tip don&#x27;t have to worry about your baby swallowing unnecessary medicine</li>
    <li> I like the product I could&#x27;ve been more happy about this item to try it out just for the first time my baby girl and it bought I did say some work on this to her teeth and I want to preciate you guys for giving me the opportunity to doing that thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Lo recomiendo ampliamente para colocarlo en las encias donde salen los molares, realmente es muy bueno y practico! Very easy to put in the molars</li>
    <li> Wish someone had warned me that this product could cause choking. Just use teething pellets and try to use this only during awake time and when not being fed.</li>
    <li> These are great- they calibrate the amount of medicine and where it gets placed in the child&#x27;s mouth to reduce the numbed area, which is safer. We could not have gotten through molars without them.</li>
    <li> good product that helped my 10 months daughter a lot,especially if your baby is having trouble to sleep because of the regular teething pain,this product will make your baby sleep like a BABY, five stars no doubt.</li>
    <li> the product arrived in perfect condition, excellent product, all good, good seller</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to use with babies amd it works!&lt;br /&gt;And it tastes good also</li>
    <li> Very useful and it works like magic!</li>
