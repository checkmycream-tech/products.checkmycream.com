      <li>I haven&#x27;t even seen any more acne.</li>
      <li>I used this once an fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t like this soap, I love it.</li>
      <li>There are many versions of this soap, I&#x27;ve used this one for years.</li>
      <li>It didnt cure my acne but prevented lots more from popping up.</li>
      <li>Everytime i would get out the shower, my skin felt clean and nice.</li>
      <li>however, so far I am SUPER impressed.  </li>
      <li>It suds great, is gentle on the skin, yet DOES clean.  </li>
      <li>Great soap tightens and clears dirt like no other !</li>
      <li>Oh boy, it makes my skin feel so good and so very soft.</li>
      <li>but if you can get more than one I would say its worth it.</li>
      <li>i do like this soap, it leaves my skin bright and clear</li>
      <li>I know I must sound like a info-mercial</li>
      <li>I found that I need to wash my face with it, but rinse it off after a few seconds to get the best results.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>While Madina Black Soap works as well as I remembered (quickly clearing up the acne blemishes, &amp; is a superb skin softener.</li>
      <li>, I have noticed a pretty significant difference in my skin, mostly the redness has subsided.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my face and it keeps it clean and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin super smooth and helps with darks spots and scarring.  </li>
      <li>or I used to, when I first used this soap it got rid of the acne more quickly and, now, that I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this product is that it leaves you so clean that you squeek.</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast; which makes me even more excited about this product.</li>
      <li>I think I am really going to enjoy having it.</li>
      <li>It does have a nice feel, but it has chemical ingredients too (like  triclosan) and definitely isn&#x27;t legit.</li>
      <li>I love natural products on my skin.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it makes your skin soft and the soothing feelings.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a more natural route about two years ago when I found this by recommendation of a friend.</li>
      <li>I dont know which was the right package to order.</li>
      <li>My skin is becoming so clear.</li>
      <li>Left my skin smooth and   bump free.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed the soap so much that I reordered for 3 more bars of the black soap</li>
      <li>First time purchase for me.  </li>
      <li>This soap isn&#x27;t much different from what you&#x27;d buy in a grocery store, except that it has cocoa butter in it, which is easier on the skin than most detergent bars we call \\&quot;soap.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I am still using this product to see if it does exactly what it says...</li>
      <li>My first order was for 2 bars.</li>
      <li>this product is good but it disappears fast and it messes up your washa cloth by turning it black</li>
      <li>It may be better for people with dry skin.</li>
      <li>It really did nothing much for my skin.</li>
      <li>Received the soap fast but It doesn&#x27;t really work how I envisioned.</li>
      <li>People with oily skin like me should really avoid this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I wouldnt run out too fast.</li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t itch so much</li>
      <li>and it has really helped relieve him of some pain and discomfort.  </li>
      <li>I really like using it.  </li>
      <li>But i have to say i do prefer using Carley&#x27;s Clear and Smooth Natural soap bar.</li>
      <li>I love black soap</li>
      <li>Read a review in a magazine that Black African soap was great for your face, especially for combination skin.</li>
      <li>And the best is it doesn&#x27;t leave any bad after &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sounds like a lot of work, but after about a month of following the routine the razor bumps -- a plaque for the vast majority of African-American men -- are effectively GONE (they pop up on my neck every so often, but only a couple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found it again today, and I actually just bought 30$ worth.</li>
      <li>I love my black soap !  </li>
      <li>It takes off all of my makeup and leaves it very soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>For the first time, my skin actually feels supple, but not oily or stripped.</li>
      <li>The soap works well, though, so it&#x27;s not a total loss, but I&#x27;m not paying this much again for this particular soap.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more like little tiny heat bumps.</li>
      <li>The black soap delivers a soft and clean feeling after using it.</li>
      <li>If one has sensitive skin or anything like that</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been breaking out in hives and found that people were suggesting African Black Soap. So, I decided to try this product. It did not meet my expectations at all. It leaves black dye in the tub and everywhere else the suds go. Even though it reduced the itching, I was still breaking out in hives. I am using it until it finishes because I paid money for it. But, I will not be buying this product again and I do not recommend it to anyone. The only good thing about this product is that it leaves you so clean that you squeek.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for about 3 days and already notice a big difference.  It takes off all of my makeup and leaves it very soft and moisturized.  I will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was another African soap similar to the Dudu Osun soap that has all natural ingredients, except that this used cocoa butter for the fat content instead of shea butter (which is in the Dudu Osun brand).     This version of black soap has triclosan (labeled with a similar name used overseas for this chemical), which is an antibacterial chemical I am trying to get away from using because of health issues associated with it (it&#x27;s reportedly a hormone disruptor, for example). It also has other chemicals in it that are not natural ingredients. The soap works well, though, so it&#x27;s not a total loss, but I&#x27;m not paying this much again for this particular soap. Next time it will be the Dudu Osun brand.     The seller did ship the product within a few days, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a problem with the seller--it&#x27;s the product. Save your money and get the real thing, whether it&#x27;s Dudu Osun or another REAL african soap. This soap isn&#x27;t much different from what you&#x27;d buy in a grocery store, except that it has cocoa butter in it, which is easier on the skin than most detergent bars we call \\&quot;soap.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I purchased the African Black Soap. I was disappointed as it was the wrong one. I had gotten the soap before but it was green with oatmeal particles in it. I dont know which was the right package to order. Can anyone help. The one I got was actually black in color. I dont care for it as well.</li>
    <li> I love this. Everytime i would get out the shower, my skin felt clean and nice. But i have to say i do prefer using Carley&#x27;s Clear and Smooth Natural soap bar. I Love it way better than this soap and it think you would if you tried it.</li>
    <li> I have problems with my skin. Its weird. Its sensative, oily yet dry and nothing seemed to work. I also have acne. This soap is a miracle. I know I must sound like a info-mercial but i&#x27;m not. This soap caters to my sensative skin. Nothing damaging or itching happened when I used it. It made the oily parts not oily and the dry parts not so dry. It didnt cure my acne but prevented lots more from popping up. I still have those under the skin zits that hurt but it decreased it by alot. I used to get like 3-4 of them every week and now I get them about 2x a month! It also prevented lots of those little zits from taking over my face. Even I see a dermatologist I will still use Black soap. It also helped make my skin tone even. For less than $10 a bar what do you have to lose? Try this soap you will love it. Just make sure you have a soap dish bc it really is black soap and it does it everywhere if you dont contain it. ENJOY!!!! Sara</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for combo skin, or I am sure any skin. For the first time, my skin actually feels supple, but not oily or stripped. Even my dermatologist couldn&#x27;t do that for me. I wish I would have discovered this soap years ago. Would have saved me lots of headaches, money and breakouts!</li>
    <li> I am still using this product to see if it does exactly what it says...but it does soften and moisturize the skin.  The breakouts and marks have lessened some, but am not using it all that long...</li>
    <li> Received the soap fast but It doesn&#x27;t really work how I envisioned. Makes my skin dry if I just use it by itself. Hasn&#x27;t done anything to my skin yet. I&#x27;m going to keep using it until I&#x27;m finish with a bar.</li>
    <li> Great soap tightens and clears dirt like no other ! We LOVE this and buy it 4 bars at a time !</li>
    <li> I started out using this soap years ago. I am 34 years old now, I started using this soap back in my early to mid twenties maybe even late teens. More recently I have decided to go back to using Black Soap since no other over the counter products did much of anything for my occasional body breakouts. I purchased this particular black soap, but became interested in trying the 100% RAW AFRICAN Black Soaps as well (can be purchased online easily the brands I tried I will leave nameless, but they were authentic from AFRICA RAW BLACK SOAP, has a bumpy texture, and is Dark Brown in color). While Madina Black Soap works as well as I remembered (quickly clearing up the acne blemishes, &amp; is a superb skin softener. I never get skin this soft unless I exfoliate with sugar scrubs, this soap is UN MATCHED when it comes to skin softening), while the real RAW African Soaps have done things like tighten my skin (must use moisturizer immediately afterwards, irritated my skin, it didnt clear up the acne as quickly as the \\&quot;Madina Black Soap\\&quot; would have at all. After my last bar of the Madina Soap actually used up, I was disappointed (literally wishing I had purchased 6 bars instead of 2 bars), but took that opportunity to try the next Raw Black Soap from Africa, &amp; while it was \\&quot;good\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;smelled great\\&quot;..it still didnt get rid of pimples or acne as well as The Bar of Madina Black Soap, nor did it soften my skin as well as the Madina Black Soap. I dont use this soap on my \\&quot;face\\&quot;, I use it strictly as a BODY BAR of soap in the shower &amp; it works beautifully. You always know a good product when you keep coming back to it year after year after all others fail you. I am about to buy like 6 bars after this review! LOL</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has psorisis and exzema real bad.  I got him this and it has really helped relieve him of some pain and discomfort.  He doesn&#x27;t itch so much and I can see lots of improvement.</li>
    <li> First time purchase for me.  Good soap.  Did notice that the little pimples that   would pop up on my face, are no longer   doing so.  I use daily and there have been no   adverse affects.  Left my skin smooth and   bump free.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I reeeeally, really love this soap!  It&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used by far!  It makes my skin feel smooth and silky.  I will definitely buy it again.  The shipping was super fast; which makes me even more excited about this product.</li>
    <li> Blazing fast shipping and great product. My first order was for 2 bars. I enjoyed the soap so much that I reordered for 3 more bars of the black soap so I wouldnt run out too fast. I have decided to no longer use any other soap other than this soap from here on out.</li>
    <li> I purchase this soap as a bulk order. I used this once an fell in love with it. I&#x27;m not sure of the blemish and mark removals. I love the fact that it makes your skin soft and the soothing feelings. Blemish should be removed with exfoliation or removal of old skin, that is the only guarantee of acne scarring removal, to include chemical peels. I&#x27;m not sure of any soaps that would do this unless is contains hydro quinine in it.</li>
    <li> As guy who suffered from in-grown hairs and nasty, unsightly razor bumps, I&#x27;m always on the look-out for a regimen that would get rid of the bumps. Sure, I could not use a razor or grow a beard, but I hate the itch from a beard and clippers don&#x27;t give you a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a friend of mine recommended I do three things: one) use this Black Soap - at least twice a day, two) shave per the regimen outline by Art of Shaving (shaving with the grain, then shave again against the grain) and three) using a nail buffer brush to remove dead skin between washings and shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a lot of work, but after about a month of following the routine the razor bumps -- a plaque for the vast majority of African-American men -- are effectively GONE (they pop up on my neck every so often, but only a couple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is the key to it though. As I was doing the Art of Shaving routine for a month or so before, saw some relief, but once I started using this soap it was like night and day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive my first bar of African black soap - but was disappointed as soon as I opened it.  This soap has a very strong chemical fragrance which makes it unusable for me as a consumer.  I will look for something else.</li>
    <li> I heard this soap is supposed to work wonders on acne prone skin.  Some people I know swear by it.  I honestly don&#x27;t know if it works at all.  It seemed as if it would work on some days and on other days I would still get break-outs.  Vegetable oil is one of the ingredients, then how does it help oily skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...on to the next facial product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years. It smell great and it lathers well. It also makes a great gift because the ladies like this soap.</li>
    <li> i do like this soap, it leaves my skin bright and clear but i feel very dry after using it. i have to use a moisturizer...</li>
    <li> It may be better for people with dry skin. People with oily skin like me should really avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;It caused me severe pimples</li>
    <li> Works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> She tried two other soaps and this is by far the best&lt;br /&gt;and actually helps her skin, something about her pores&lt;br /&gt;being cleaned out and helped, not sure if the coco, or&lt;br /&gt;the vitamin e that does the trick but I order in packs&lt;br /&gt;of 6 each time or more and even ship them out over-seas.</li>
    <li> I love how nature and herbs gives out fantastic quick customer services, and excellent communications, KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT JOB!!!!! I GIVE YOU 2 THUMBS UP!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for 2 weeks and I love it. I can actually feel the difference after a shower (it is a little strange seeing gray suds), I feel clean, but not dry.    I&#x27;ve just recently started using it on my face, I&#x27;m very careful about what I put on my face as I am acne prone. No adverse reactions after a week. I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this soap it is great for my skin, if I could get it cheaper I would by a whole mess of it...</li>
    <li> As someone with combination skin that is also very sensitive, it has been a life long struggle for me to find something that works for me. I wanted to try a more natural route about two years ago when I found this by recommendation of a friend. This soap really is amazing. It gave me that \\&quot;pregnancy glow\\&quot; of healthy, mousturized, supple skin! I have always had to wear foundation, concealer and powder to hide my acne, redness and acne scars; I am not exaggerating when I tell you I was able to walk around without any make up on because it made my skin that good. It provides the perfect balance of cleansing and hydration, the lather smells really good. I only stopped using it because I could no longer find it in my area, since I stopped using it my skin reverted to being difficult. I found it again today, and I actually just bought 30$ worth. Its that good. I can use it on my face, and body- such a plus for people who are low maintenance and into natural products. Please give it a try, I guarantee you will see results!</li>
    <li> I had some similar experiences to the reviewer SaraLevine...dry skin and redness around the eyes and forehead. I tried a lot of different soaps and creams...even other brands of black soap, including the more expensive organic brands. For some reason, this particular Madina black soap is the only thing that has worked for me. I found that I need to wash my face with it, but rinse it off after a few seconds to get the best results. I get acne on occasion...or I used to, when I first used this soap it got rid of the acne more quickly and, now, that I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months I haven&#x27;t even seen any more acne. As Sara said, it makes the oily parts not so oily and the dry parts not so dry. An amazing soap for sure!</li>
    <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t like this soap, I love it. It leaves your skin super smooth and helps with darks spots and scarring.  I really like using it.  however the soap scum from it is terrible.</li>
    <li> I love my black soap !  I use it on my face and it keeps it clean and moisturized.  Better than the expensive Face soaps out there !</li>
    <li> The soap works to even skin tone. I wash with it twice a day. There are many versions of this soap, I&#x27;ve used this one for years.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase.  Use it daily.</li>
    <li> My skin is becoming so clear. My mother asked me if I had on foundation and I did not. I love black soap</li>
    <li> This was a very messy soap when wet. It did do the job when I had the chicken pox and I don&#x27;t have any pox marks left on my skin. This would be second to the raw soap.</li>
    <li> this product is good but it disappears fast and it messes up your washa cloth by turning it black It has a good smell but if you can get more than one I would say its worth it.</li>
    <li> Read a review in a magazine that Black African soap was great for your face, especially for combination skin. It really did nothing much for my skin. It also leaves behind a black residue on anything it touches leaving the shower/bath all slimy and black which was unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Black soap is named because it is just that, black in color. It lathers well and is gray to look at. It will not stain a wash cloth or hands/ skin. What black soap does do is cleanse while soothing the skin and the fragrance is mild enough to calm the senses.&lt;br /&gt;Unless left in water, black soap does not &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; as other moisturizing soaps do. Black soap is a natural way to cleanse and moisturize your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this soap it works good on my face I had a lot of blemish now my face is even all over it the best I&#x27;m a women of color</li>
    <li> Easily the best soap made.  Feels incredible just to use and really does something that most soaps don&#x27;t seem to do.  Must be the cocoa butter or something.  If one has sensitive skin or anything like that then this could be the best soap for you.</li>
    <li> This product cleared my acne within 7 days, it also toned my skin after a couple of months. Also my granddaughter had a rash from an allergic reaction around her stomach because of the materials use in diapers. They&#x27;re more like little tiny heat bumps. i bathed her twice with the soap and it immediately went away.</li>
    <li> I love natural products on my skin. The black soap delivers a soft and clean feeling after using it. I would recommend this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried nearly all of the black soaps.  I love this one.  Don&#x27;t think this soap is just for Africans.  I have used this for years since I discovered it.  It suds great, is gentle on the skin, yet DOES clean.  I have used it on the toughest stains on my clothes and it works well above other products.  And the best is it doesn&#x27;t leave any bad after &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34;.  I have used this for presents many times.  And, this is about the best deal you will get.</li>
    <li> My African black soap arrived today and I have already luxuriated in my bathtub with it. Oh boy, it makes my skin feel so good and so very soft. I think I am really going to enjoy having it. It has moisturized my face especially well. I like the cocoa smell and just absolutely love the way it feels. It seems to have softened my old rough hands, too. It is nice when a bar of soap can make somebody so happy and pleased. It is not the prettiest bar of soap that I ever bought but I believe it is going to be my favorite bar of soap! I recommend this soap to anyone who needs a bit of moisturizing in their life.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t real african black soap..I tried it anyways because of the good reviews and all it did was break me out horribly and never healed even though I was patient with it. It does have a nice feel, but it has chemical ingredients too (like  triclosan) and definitely isn&#x27;t legit. Once I switched to a REAL african black soap, it cleared my skin within days. Just be aware that this isn&#x27;t the real black soap you might be looking for, and although other people seem to like it anyways, it ruined my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great though and fast shipping, just not the product I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to speak too soon, as I have only been using this product for 3 days... however, so far I am SUPER impressed.  I bought this soap because I have really horrible pregnancy acne and have tried EVERYTHING that is safe to try.  I had never heard of this soap until a few weeks ago and decided to get it right away.  I have to say, I have noticed a pretty significant difference in my skin, mostly the redness has subsided.  I am hoping the more I use it, the more it will continue to work!... fingers crossed.....</li>
