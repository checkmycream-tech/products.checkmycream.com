      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Get this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The treated area is monitored every 8 to 6 hours, and necrotic cells are removed with warm, concentrated chamomile solution, via cotton balls.</li>
      <li>I can see why they call it a miracle cure, because it is shockingly effective.  </li>
      <li>I read that it is very important to not have the DMSO come into contact with anything that is toxic because it dissolves anything it touches.</li>
      <li>It is a solvent and if you want to be on the safe side buy in glass.</li>
      <li>Two tablespoons of DMSO and one teaspoon of distilled water, then add one teaspoon more of DMSO.</li>
      <li>I mix optimsm crystals in the dmso and have even more pain relief/anti inflammatory results.</li>
      <li>My foot feels all the way better after years of nagging pain after 2 months of twice a day application of dmso.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s been a week or more and the pain is there</li>
      <li>Once I add the distilled water, the scent fades even more.</li>
      <li>I use it for a tendon problem in my arm and also planters fasciitis in my foot with some good success.</li>
      <li>It works better than Neosporin, no side effects, and induces cell death by necrosis and apoptosis to Mesothelioma, and Melanoma tumor cells.&lt;br /&gt;Because of</li>
      <li>I wish I had bought this years ago, instead of taking so many over the counter pain</li>
      <li>It works like magic to relieve pain, even pain that pain meds could not touch.  </li>
      <li>That is pretty much the best you can get.</li>
      <li>I plan to purchase more of this product soon and am grateful to the manufacturer for making it available.</li>
      <li>After the two weeks of rubbing it into my scar, I have noticed significant improvement in the elasticity of the fascia and that my digestion has also gotten much better.</li>
      <li>Make sure to always use clean hands when applying.</li>
      <li>My acupuncturist also notices the huge difference.</li>
      <li>I DID buy this product, so this review is accurate.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
      <li>Great product especially for pain.</li>
      <li>completely significantly (P&amp;#60;0.05) inhibited mesothelioma (AE17) tumor growth and significantly (P&amp;#60;0.05) reduced tumor area by ~100% during treatment (2 groups of 3 mice).  </li>
      <li>induced significant necrosis and apoptosis.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is perhaps more effective than Aleve and has a lasting effect; applying it once a day is sufficient for me.</li>
      <li>once a day (between 2 treatments), for 90 days resulted in full remission of skin Cancer (Squamous carcinoma),  verified by dermatologist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>once a day (between 2 treatments), for 90 days resulted in full remission of skin Cancer (Squamous carcinoma),  verified by dermatologist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>works well for sore mussels and works quick</li>
      <li>I was even more amazed that the soles of my feet (which had unhealing wounds for over 6 years) were completely healed!</li>
      <li>Every credible source I read stresses that DMSO really needs to be sold and stored in glass, never plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very pure, 100% strength, and comes in a glass bottle.  </li>
      <li>This stuff has not been watered down at all, which is good.</li>
      <li>Other brands are already cut with water so when you compare actual dosages, this is as good or a better value.</li>
      <li>Pure!</li>
      <li>The order came quickly and it works very well.</li>
      <li>I bought the glass roller bottles here on Amazon at a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I couldn’t wait for more 15 to 20 years for FDA to approve the treatment and for the price of Tea Tree oil to be increased 5000 times by big farma.</li>
      <li>sure enough found that people use it for that.  </li>
      <li>I couldn’t wait for more 15 to 20 years for FDA to approve the treatment and for the price of Tea Tree oil to be increased 5000 times by big farma.ation of TTO</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Makes me wonder what else it is healing inside my body :) I will be keeping several bottles on hand for emergencies from now on.</li>
      <li>I will say that if the injury is chronic it takes a good month or 2 of everyday application to heal the chronic tendonittis.</li>
      <li>This has helped greatly with the pain that I have been feeling in various joints and tendons following the use for months of a very powerful but apparently harmful antibiotic.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because this DMSO is so pure, or some other reason, but I am very glad it is the case.  </li>
      <li>I have also used it on my heel for plantar fasciitis, but it seems to be less effective there.</li>
      <li>Purity is how pure the DMSO is.</li>
      <li>This stuff is 99.995% pure, meaning there are virtually no impurities.  </li>
      <li>5 drops rubbed into his shoulder and he was pain free in about ten minutes, and amazed.  </li>
      <li>As a dancer, this product has really come through for me.</li>
      <li>Fast shipment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The primary mode of cell death appears to be necrosis, with characteristics including cell swelling and membrane rupture; this is confirmed by the uptake of propidium iodide (PI) (red cells); which only enters cells with compromised cell membranes.</li>
      <li>Staurosporine was included as a positive control which induced apoptosis: brightly fluorescing Hoechst stained cells, displaying cell shrinkage and blebbing, and bind Annexin-V-FITC (green cells) and necrosis with positively stained red PI cells.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>Only concentrations of TTO (0.1%) after 24h, 0.06%-0.1%) after 48h and (0.08-0.1%) after 72h significantly (P&amp;#60;0.05) reduced HF32 cell viability.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Following just one treatment of TTO in DMSO, tumor area was significantly reduced by 6-fold.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a surgery on it which helped but reinjured it at work (framing houses) and the dmso really helps keep it feeling decent.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this particular brand of DMSO.  </li>
      <li>This ratio is highly recommended by experts, and does not cause any skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>one more thing--I have (had) stiffness and pain in a few of my fingers (I stand up paddle surf, and lift a lot of weights/do pullups, so I do a lot of grip work).  </li>
      <li>so this looks like a new product.  </li>
      <li>Yes this is the real thing, pharmaceutical grade DMSO and it barely has the smell of garlic.</li>
      <li>I have been using it consistently for about two weeks to help treat internal scarring on my abdomen after surgery performed four years ago.</li>
      <li>This pharma grade product comes in a blue glass bottle which is important for long term purity and strength.  </li>
      <li>A 70% to 80% solution of DMSO to distilled water also has given me immediate pain relief and increased mobility considerably.</li>
      <li>I only wish that I had discovered this Pharma-grade DMSO brand much sooner.</li>
      <li>She still won&#x27;t come near me with this brand.</li>
      <li>One thing that has helped considerably is Palates, which stretches and strengthens the area.</li>
      <li>applied Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil causes direct anti-cancer cytotoxicity in subcutaneous tumor bearing mice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Side effects manifested as skin irritation; dryness, erythema, edema, with eschar formation but began to heal 3 days post cessation of treatment and were completely resolved by day</li>
      <li>I had because my lady won&#x27;t even come near me when I have used it.</li>
      <li>I am delighted to say that I have not experienced either of these side effects!  </li>
      <li>My arm is more serious</li>
      <li>keep the concentration of TTO in DMSO, as high as possible, to induce tumor cell death by necrosis and apoptosis, but to minimize the effect against normal human fibroblast cells.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Watch out for MOST others which is industrial grade DMSO, not a good idea.</li>
      <li>This really helps, but the strange thing is that I have a trigger finger, and used that hand to put on the DMSO.  </li>
      <li>It has been 24 hours now, and so far no sign of blistering (cross my fingers).  </li>
      <li>This product at 70% strength gave me dramatic and almost instantaneous relief of nagging pain in my foot that had been bothering me for more than 10 years.</li>
      <li>I used it once or twice a day at first, then every few days.  </li>
      <li>Strength refers to how much it has been watered down.  </li>
      <li>Let it dry completely before putting on any clothing.</li>
      <li>This product works good for me, the only bad thing I can say about it</li>

    <li> Great stuff! Pure! Dark bottle. Manufacturer has good usage advice.</li>
    <li> Great product especially for pain. Use it for years now and would not be without it.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it does anything except makes the products I use absorb faster.</li>
    <li> It is the best you can get, but Pricey.&lt;br /&gt;I use DMSO as a carrier with Tea Tree Oil mixture 1 TTO / 9 DMSO. It works better than Neosporin, no side effects, and induces cell death by necrosis and apoptosis to Mesothelioma, and Melanoma tumor cells.&lt;br /&gt;Because of limited funds experiments are limited in vitro, and in vivo in mice.&lt;br /&gt;I continued over a skin cancer, while conventional medicine failed, and a growing bump was created under the scar of the biopsy.&lt;br /&gt;Topically applied Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil causes direct anti-cancer cytotoxicity in subcutaneous tumor bearing mice.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22727730&lt;br /&gt;In vitro experiments&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil inhibits cellular viability&lt;br /&gt;TTO inhibited cellular viability of the two tumor cell lines studied AE17 Mesothelioma and B16 Melanoma, in a dose-and time-dependent manner as measured by the MTT assay.&lt;br /&gt; TTO and Terpinen-4-ol induce cell death by necrosis and apoptosis&lt;br /&gt;Treatment of AE17 and B16 cells with TTO and terpinen-4-ol induced significant necrosis and apoptosis.&lt;br /&gt;The primary mode of cell death appears to be necrosis, with characteristics including cell swelling and membrane rupture; this is confirmed by the uptake of propidium iodide (PI) (red cells); which only enters cells with compromised cell membranes. Staurosporine was included as a positive control which induced apoptosis: brightly fluorescing Hoechst stained cells, displaying cell shrinkage and blebbing, and bind Annexin-V-FITC (green cells) and necrosis with positively stained red PI cells.&lt;br /&gt;In vivo experiments&lt;br /&gt;10% TTO inhibits AE17 and B16 tumor growth and induces AE17 tumor regression.&lt;br /&gt;Mice with established (~9mm2) AE17 and B16 (~15mm2) implanted subcutaneous tumors, were treated topically with 50μl 10% TTO in DMSO or DMSO alone (solvent control) for 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;TTO completely significantly (P&amp;#60;0.05) inhibited mesothelioma (AE17) tumor growth and significantly (P&amp;#60;0.05) reduced tumor area by ~100% during treatment (2 groups of 3 mice).  Following just one treatment of TTO in DMSO, tumor area was significantly reduced by 6-fold. Upon cessation of treatment tumors relapsed but with some degree of variability; ranging from 4-12 days post treatment, whilst 2 out of 9 of the mice displayed no signs of relapse until 3 months post treatment.&lt;br /&gt;TTO significantly (P&amp;#60; 0.05) retarded melanoma (B16) tumor growth by ~50% following 2 days post treatment (3 out of 3 mice). Tumors did resume growth upon cessation of treatment in 2 of the 3 mice, and grew rapidly to 100mm2 following 4 days post treatment. Side effects manifested as skin irritation; dryness, erythema, edema, with eschar formation but began to heal 3 days post cessation of treatment and were completely resolved by day 10.&lt;br /&gt;TTO was least efficacious against the normal human fibroblast cells HF32, with IC50 values of 0.08%±0.01 (24h), 0.07%±0.02 (48h) and 0.07%±0.01 (72h). Although there was a dose dependent decrease in cellular viability, prolonged exposure time from 24h to 48h to 72h had no significant effect on the cells. Only concentrations of TTO (0.1%) after 24h, 0.06%-0.1%) after 48h and (0.08-0.1%) after 72h significantly (P&amp;#60;0.05) reduced HF32 cell viability.&lt;br /&gt;My Goal was:&lt;br /&gt;To keep the concentration of TTO in DMSO, as high as possible, to induce tumor cell death by necrosis and apoptosis, but to minimize the effect against normal human fibroblast cells.&lt;br /&gt;The indicator is the rate of formation of necrotic cells.&lt;br /&gt;The treated area is monitored every 8 to 6 hours, and necrotic cells are removed with warm, concentrated chamomile solution, via cotton balls. This process takes at least 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The formation of scabs compromises the treatment, because it blocks the penetration of TTO, and creates pockets, prone of the secondary infections.&lt;br /&gt;This is a dose-and time-dependent manner treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Depending how the treatment progress, the concentration of TTO varies between 5% to 15%, and the frequency of applications every 6hours to 12 hours. Collateral damages cannot be avoided, but they are minimal. No Pain, no gain.&lt;br /&gt;Treating the spot for 3 months, every 12 hours, with 10 % TTO in DMSO, applied with a Q-tip Roll, and with Mg(HCO3)2  1500mg/L Mg++ once a day (between 2 treatments), for 90 days resulted in full remission of skin Cancer (Squamous carcinoma),  verified by dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is very complex, and varies from person to person. I couldn’t wait for more 15 to 20 years for FDA to approve the treatment and for the price of Tea Tree oil to be increased 5000 times by big farma.ation of TTO varies between 5% to 15%, and the frequency of applications every 6hours to 12 hours.

    <li> This worked SOOOO much better than I anticipated! I bought it to try and help repair my torn shoulder muscles which had kept me from sleeping for over a year. I took 2 t. in the morning and 2t. in the evening for a month, then backed down to 1t. per day. My shoulders no longer hurt after a month, and I spelt well at night. I was even more amazed that the soles of my feet (which had unhealing wounds for over 6 years) were completely healed! Makes me wonder what else it is healing inside my body :) I will be keeping several bottles on hand for emergencies from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been using DMSO for several years now, and it dramatically reduces my arthritis pain.  I also take several supplements and anti-inflammatories, but I have discomfort instead of pain when I apply the DMSO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about one week.  I have had patellofemoral arthritis for about 10 years in both knees, and several orthopaedists have told me that the only option they can offer is total knee replacement. One thing that has helped considerably is Palates, which stretches and strengthens the area. A 70% to 80% solution of DMSO to distilled water also has given me immediate pain relief and increased mobility considerably. It is perhaps more effective than Aleve and has a lasting effect; applying it once a day is sufficient for me. I have not taken Aleve since starting the DMSO applications. I have also used it on my heel for plantar fasciitis, but it seems to be less effective there. I have not noticed the garlic taste in my mouth as reported by others, but maybe that&#x27;s because we eat a lot of Italian food.</li>
    <li> I dilute this down to 70% with the use of distilled water. It really is nearly odorless; there is a very faint sent of what I would compare to the smell of beets if you force your nose down into the bottle and take in a deep breath, but it is very faint. Once I add the distilled water, the scent fades even more. If you applied this to your skin and then went out in public, no one is going to smell it on you. As a dancer, this product has really come through for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using DMSO for a very long time. After all why should just fancy race horses get the benefits of this product. I use it for inflammation, bruises, some cuts, swelling. There is a lot of research on DMSO . I do try to get it in a bottle and not plastic. It is a solvent and if you want to be on the safe side buy in glass. Read about it and use it.</li>
    <li> For survival, DMSO is a must-have in the med kit.  This pharma grade product comes in a blue glass bottle which is important for long term purity and strength.  Remember, it needs to be diluted with distilled water before use.  Other brands are already cut with water so when you compare actual dosages, this is as good or a better value.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff. I have been using it consistently for about two weeks to help treat internal scarring on my abdomen after surgery performed four years ago. The scarring caused a lot of adhesions to my descending colon which resulted in progressive digestive issues and deteriorating health. After my acupuncturist suggested working on breaking up the scar tissue, I started doing research on topical remedies. I ordered this 99.98% pharma grade DMSO because it had great reviews and also because it came in a glass bottle. I read that it is very important to not have the DMSO come into contact with anything that is toxic because it dissolves anything it touches. It has a very slight odor of garlic and burns a little if the skin is sensitive or if you apply too much. A little goes a long way! Make sure to always use clean hands when applying. Let it dry completely before putting on any clothing. It can leave a slight stickiness to the skin after absorption. After the two weeks of rubbing it into my scar, I have noticed significant improvement in the elasticity of the fascia and that my digestion has also gotten much better. My acupuncturist also notices the huge difference. I am so pleased and will continue to use it to help heal my body!</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing.  I had nagging, aching pain deep in my hip flexor that I&#x27;ve been dealing with for years.  Gone in 5 minutes.  I used it once or twice a day at first, then every few days.  Now it&#x27;s been a week or more and the pain is there but minor enough to ignore.  Raved about it to a friend who had extreme pain in his shoulder from a torn rotator cuff (he&#x27;s looking at surgery).  5 drops rubbed into his shoulder and he was pain free in about ten minutes, and amazed.  Then--I&#x27;m not making this up--last night I got one of the worst burns I&#x27;ve ever had in the kitchen.  I googled &amp;#34;DMSO burns&amp;#34; and sure enough found that people use it for that.  A few drops of DMSO and some Calendula cream, and went from extreme pain to zero pain in a few minutes.  I was expecting massive blistering, and an open wound that would last a week.  It has been 24 hours now, and so far no sign of blistering (cross my fingers).  The garlic flavor is terrible--mostly as an aftertaste that does have quite a negative impact on the flavor of food--however, I noticed that it went away after time.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it at all the last few times I used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like anything of this nature, my goal is to use it as sparingly as possible--not to rely on it.  That being said, I will NEVER be without this product in the medicine cabinet.  I can see why they call it a miracle cure, because it is shockingly effective.  Oh yeah, one more thing--I have (had) stiffness and pain in a few of my fingers (I stand up paddle surf, and lift a lot of weights/do pullups, so I do a lot of grip work).  The pain and stiffness in my hands (I used both of them to rub in the DMSO) is gone.</li>
    <li> Of very good quality grade.  The order came quickly and it works very well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is legit works well on shoulders and ankles no after odor and top quality grade! A must try for nagging injuries!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST DMSO THAT I HAVE FOUND.</li>
    <li> although odor has been mentioned as a side effect, the odor was not even close to being a problem. It was very slight. This product at 70% strength gave me dramatic and almost instantaneous relief of nagging pain in my foot that had been bothering me for more than 10 years. I applied it topically and did not take it internally.</li>
    <li> Yes this is the real thing, pharmaceutical grade DMSO and it barely has the smell of garlic. Watch out for MOST others which is industrial grade DMSO, not a good idea. Pray this company sticks around. Get this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I am ordering my second bottle.  I dilute it down to 70%.  I have spinal stenosis and extreme leg pain.  This really helps, but the strange thing is that I have a trigger finger, and used that hand to put on the DMSO.  I just realized that I no longer have the trigger finger.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I bought it for muscle/tendon pain in my arm, but have since used it for several other areas as well.  It works like magic to relieve pain, even pain that pain meds could not touch.  I wish I had bought this years ago, instead of taking so many over the counter pain meds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of reading and research before making my choice, and this product seemed the purest and safest (since it is packaged in glass).  I wanted it to be portable, so I could keep it in my purse and use it when needed, even on the go.  I bought some 1 oz glass roller ball bottles that are refillable.  I put a little DMSO into the bottle, then add distilled water to get a 70/30 ratio of DMSO to water.  This ratio is highly recommended by experts, and does not cause any skin irritation.  By using the roller bottle, I do not have to get the DMSO on my hands when applying, so I can use it even if I am not near soap and water to wash my hands afterwards.  I bought the glass roller bottles here on Amazon at a very reasonable price.  Every credible source I read stresses that DMSO really needs to be sold and stored in glass, never plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest concerns was that many people using DMSO reported having a bad taste in their mouth after applying it, and also that some people reported that they smelled like garlic, something rotten, or sulfur for a few days after use.  I am delighted to say that I have not experienced either of these side effects!  I don&#x27;t know if it is because this DMSO is so pure, or some other reason, but I am very glad it is the case.  I did some research, and a few articles said that the purer the DMSO, the less likely you are to get the bad taste or smell.  Other articles said that everyone is different, and some people get those side effects, while others do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this particular brand of DMSO.  Very pure, 100% strength, and comes in a glass bottle.  That is pretty much the best you can get.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Virtually no odor and works instantaneously. My right thumb is often stiff and painful in the morning and by using a mere drop of this DMSO the pain disappears in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, but no longer have the option to write an amazon reviewed one because this product, this picture, this pureness and the business who made it changed the info so this looks like a new product.  It was for sale for $29.99.  Now it&#x27;s $39.99.  It&#x27;s a minor monopoly, but a monopoly nonetheless.  The price jumped $10 in 2 months, and there&#x27;s no reason to have discontinued the $29.99 and restarted the identical item for $39.99 unless they were trying to hide that fact.  I DID buy this product, so this review is accurate.  It&#x27;s better than any other DMSO product I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s now at least 4x as expensive as any other I&#x27;ve used as well.  This is my product experience.</li>
    <li> really good for bruises and aches</li>
    <li> good, as advertised. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> I used it for tendinitis for a while.  It seemed to help.  It is hard to say as you can&#x27;t do a blind study using it.  I caution anybody using this for medical purposes to buy and use medical sterile swabs to apply it.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, go for it. Note that other products don&#x27;t make clear the difference between purity and strength. Purity is how pure the DMSO is. This stuff is 99.995% pure, meaning there are virtually no impurities.  Strength refers to how much it has been watered down.  This stuff has not been watered down at all, which is good. Think of it as \\&quot;100% strength DMSO which is 99.995% pure\\&quot;. So, read and understand the labels of all these DMSO suppliers. Some use tricky wording. The usual DMSO strength you want to use on your joints is 70%.  So you must water down this stuff, meaning this bottle goes a long ways. Measure out seven units of DMSO and three units of distilled water. I make up small batches at a time. Two tablespoons of DMSO and one teaspoon of distilled water, then add one teaspoon more of DMSO. One tablespoon equals three teaspoons. Do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to reviewer \\&quot;The Ranch (outback AZ)\\&quot;: Use scented DMSO cream instead. Look here at Amazon or visit the manufacturer&#x27;s website, ExclusiveWellnessClub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not connected to this manufacturer at all, just happy to find a good, honest, manufacturer and product.</li>
    <li> I use to have natures roll on dmso but I went for this pharma grade stuff for purity reasons. I use it for a tendon problem in my arm and also planters fasciitis in my foot with some good success. I will say that if the injury is chronic it takes a good month or 2 of everyday application to heal the chronic tendonittis. My foot feels all the way better after years of nagging pain after 2 months of twice a day application of dmso. My arm is more serious I&#x27;ve had a surgery on it which helped but reinjured it at work (framing houses) and the dmso really helps keep it feeling decent. I mix optimsm crystals in the dmso and have even more pain relief/anti inflammatory results. This product works good for me, the only bad thing I can say about it is it says low Oder so I was hoping it was less smelly than the natures brand I had because my lady won&#x27;t even come near me when I have used it. She still won&#x27;t come near me with this brand. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me though or my kids just her so maybe it&#x27;s her fault lol</li>
    <li> This has helped greatly with the pain that I have been feeling in various joints and tendons following the use for months of a very powerful but apparently harmful antibiotic. I only wish that I had discovered this Pharma-grade DMSO brand much sooner. I plan to purchase more of this product soon and am grateful to the manufacturer for making it available.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Thank you. I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> works well for sore mussels and works quick</li>
</ol>
