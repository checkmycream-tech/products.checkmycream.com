      <li>I ordered 5 different designs and was really excited to use them.  </li>

      <li>they are so thin and after applying a gel top coat as suggested you cant even tell its a tattoo sticker!</li>
      <li>i was shocked to get them way earlier then quoted since they came to the USA from Germany and the packing was great too!</li>
      <li>and you can see the paper still though the clear polish.</li>

      <li>It was a hot mess trying to cut just the design.&lt;br /&gt;It would not peal away from the paper and would tear....unusable.</li>
      <li>the application was easy and they are so thin they do not leave outlines of the design at all.</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re putting these on somebody else&#x27;s nails it might not be so bad put if you&#x27;re planning on gracing your own nails with these, grow an extra hand or have patience as your No. 1 virtue.</li>
<li> The back is the shiny part and the front is the rough edge</li>
<li> it was harder to peel the sticker</li>
<li> very very difficult to peel from original papaer.</li>
<li> Waste of money on my part - do not recommend</li>
<li> I recently just started wearing fake nails</li>
<li> The motif is very pretty but the fact that you have to cut each flower to size is tedious and annoying and makes it much harder to work with.</li>
<li> Designs to small to see in person and to hard to use.  </li>
<li> Was hoping for easier application waste stickers due to difficult application</li>
<li> stickers are too hard to take off backing and apply.</li>
<li> It is like they put them on the wrong side of the paper.  </li>
<li> I am very disappointed in these.</li>

    <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK AS GOOD AS THE PICTURE</li>
    <li> had to throw the whole mess away.  You have to cut out the design and then try to peal from the backing paper. It was a hot mess trying to cut just the design.&lt;br /&gt;It would not peal away from the paper and would tear....unusable.</li>
    <li> these are very pretty thank you.</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t get them off the paper they are on</li>
    <li> This product is just okay for me because of the difficulty I have in peeeling it from backing.  Once on it does look like an original tattoo.  It is an upscale nail sticker.  Love the look when completed.</li>
    <li> it was harder to peel the sticker then I thought it would be and you can see the paper still though the clear polish. and it wasn&#x27;t as bright as the pic shows its more of a dull color</li>

    <li> I love these stickers for the nails. I recently just started wearing fake nails and I&#x27;m thrilled at the results. The stickers are like icing on a cake. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 different designs and was really excited to use them.  The stickers won&#x27;t come off the paper. It is like they put them on the wrong side of the paper.  The back is the shiny part and the front is the rough edge so the sticker won&#x27;t peel off.  I am very disappointed in these.</li>
    <li> The motif is very pretty but the fact that you have to cut each flower to size is tedious and annoying and makes it much harder to work with.

    <li> very very difficult to peel from original papaer. Sticker falls apart.</li>
    <li> This is such a cute accent to fingernails. Adds fun to plain nails. Order came on time &amp; of high quality.</li>
