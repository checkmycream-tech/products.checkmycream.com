    <li> Very floral-heavy scent, if you aren&#x27;t into flowers (lavender/lilac?) then don&#x27;t buy this. G</li>
    <li> Not real strong perfume just right light floral scent</li>
    <li> Old fragrance, but one of my absolute favorites! Anytime I see this scent...I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance. It&#x27;s sophisticated, feminine, and sexy...a floral fragrance without being TOO flowery. More of a \\&quot;I am woman!\\&quot; scent than anything girly. Also, it has pretty decent staying power. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I love Vera Wang.  This was shipped in a timely manner.  I received it before the shipping deadline.  It is the original product. This was very affordable.  I had investigated prices at other places. I want to order Vera Wang lotion, and bath oil.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this!</li>
    <li> I got this perfume as an anniversary present for my wife... especially because of its name! And she loves it! It has a flowery smell (almost like Jasmine); I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as nice as Vera Wang Sheer Veil, but it&#x27;s a close 2nd.</li>
    <li> My cousin purchased this same perfume and I loved it so much that I had to buy a bottle for myself. It smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> love the whole process and it was 2xxs bigger then the one i alrwady had that was 2xs more money.. great</li>
    <li> Love it. Great spring time scent. In case you are wondering if it&#x27;s a knock off, it&#x27;s not. Smells exactly like it should and has lasting power.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a nice sent , but actually I think it is not as beautiful as the  yellow Vera Wang perfume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vera Wang scents but saw the reviews and great price on this and ordered it.  I&#x27;m happy I did. Very soft light scent.  Great for day or evening, not over powering.</li>
    <li> very good my wife like this smell very much</li>
    <li> I wear Veraly Pink and thought that I would try this new fragerance to do the review from other the shoppers.  I was very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I was in a discount store and happened to see this fragrance in a glass tube roll on version and I thought the scent was lovely.  When it arrived I found that it was a little overpowering for my taste.  It&#x27;s nice but you have to be careful as to how it&#x27;s applied.  It can be a bit strong, especially considering it&#x27;s a Parfum and not Eau De Toilette.  I want to think the roll on version had lighter scented (preferred) probably because it was mixed with a fluid (looks creamy in the glass tube).  I want to assume the additional roll on substance may make the scent lighter so that it flows from the roller easier and perhaps that&#x27;s why it is not as strong.</li>
    <li> Love this one and the scent last all day</li>
    <li> shipping was very quick on this. came as described. my wife loves the smell. for the money it was a big bottle. deffiently not a sample bottle, unlike some of the junk i have purchased on here.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, this is NOT the original fragance</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, We did not like the smell, it was strong and and exactly like rose water. I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> This is not the original fragrance,  waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Smells good, but does not last as long as other fragrances.</li>
