<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My sister told me to try this face cleanser for my 40 something adult acne based on recommendation form her dermatologist. This stuff cleared up my acne in no time! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It does its job: it cleans my face without leaving it feel dry or tight. Does it live up to its claims? No. Simply because a cleanser doesn&#x27;t stay long enough on your face to make a difference. Unfortunately I forgot about that little fact before purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Product came in timely fashion, but cap had not been on tight and cleanser leaked all over the bottle, and seeped through to warp the product packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I like to mix it with other products. I usually use a little bit of the facial cleaner and another facial cleaner and a glove to rub off the dead skin cells. The MD facial clanser really doesn&#x27;t do a good job of removing make-up on it&#x27;s own and it doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin cells. On the other hand when I use the other products by themselves, I notice that they don&#x27;t leave my face feeling soft. So overall, I think mixing this product with others is the best way to go. At least for me, that&#x27;s what has worked.</li>
    <li> I always use this product when I notice my face is beginning to be a little oily, or forming blackheads in the T-zone area. The product can be a little harsh for sensitive skin, so I usually mix the cleanser with a cleanser designed for sensitive skin ( especially during winter). I find it to be very effective in removing debris from my face, and it makes your face ready to absorb serums effectively.</li>
    <li> MD Forte is as fabulous as its name.  On the market for years and recommended by my dermatologist more than 10 years ago, it remains one of the highest quality cleansers of its kind and the price is wonderful.  This bottle will last you more than a year.  I alternate the III with the II since the III is stronger and I often use the product on my body prior to tanning and especially several days before any spray tan.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years and find it to be the best on the market.  Although pricey, it is still competitive and always does the job.  I continue to receive compliments on a youthful appearance, though I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to the MD Forte II or my parents&#x27; genes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for eight months and it really makes a difference in your skin. It stings a little, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male and have used several brands throughout the years trying to get rid of my blackheads.  My blackheads aren&#x27;t complete gone, but they are so much better than they used to be.  As long as I don&#x27;t skip a night washing my face, I never get breakouts anymore either.  I love M.D. Forte and have worked myself up to level III.</li>
    <li> So unfortunate that this brand has been discontinued. The price is astronomical considering it used to be $30... But I have been using this product for 13 years and I get complimented on my skin EVERY DAY because of it!!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I&#x27;ve been using for many years and it helps me look years younger.  I get mistaken for my granddaughter&#x27;s mother all the time!</li>
    <li> Helps reduce fine lines and the look of scars. Helps keeps my skin clear of breakouts. Lasts a good while. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. I have used MD Forte for several years and know I can rely on this cleanser to treat my skin well and provide a healthy look as my skin ages.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MD Forte in the past.  This product worked more like MD Forte I and not MD Forte II.</li>
    <li> MY SON LOVES THIS PRODUCT AND FEELS IT WORKS WONDERS ON HIS SKIN</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful I have been using it for over 8 years now. I first purchased it from Dr downing in Montclair my dermatologist home I use to visit. I no longer have to continue to go to her because I know what my skin now needs with all of what you eat, taking care of your skin, and what products you. If you say on a consistent veggies then it would be a perfect product</li>
    <li> I have great skin -- you would never know I have acne -- and this has been part of my routine for years. It was first recommended by a dermatologist. This does not cure or treat acne, but it does help keep my complexion bright and helps clear up dark spots over time.</li>
    <li> This product is one I have been using for a long time. My dermatologist&#x27;s office no longer had it available, so I was relieved and very happy to order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I only use this only once every 2 months.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It was recommended to me by my aesthetician and has done wonders for my skin.  Way more than my dermatologist ever did!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cleanser!! I have extremely oily skin, but also dry... this keeps my skin free of dead skin, leaving happy clear pores! I use this in conjunction with retin-a .05% at night, 10% benzoyl P cream morning ...</li>
    <li> I have used the product numerous times this formula was white instead of clear which I previously used but it works.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it works in combination with the lotion to reduce fine lines and skin flaws.  I wish it were not so expensive, but I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Acne was always an issue for me, the product really help.  I highly recommend, especially for people with dark/brown spot</li>
    <li> It is just a very good cleanser I hope I can continue to get it.</li>
    <li> I used this product back in high school and college, as my dermatologist recommended it.  He said to put it on and leave it on for awhile in the evening (I worked up to several hours)- people would comment all the time how bright and clear my face looked.  So for whatever reason, I moved away from it and here it is 15 years later and I just started it up again.  Already I can see a difference in my skin brightness and clarity.  I still leave it on for a few hours, but I always make sure to really hydrate my skin after I wash it off before bed. Highly recommend this product, but I will warn that depending on your skin sensitivity, if you leave this on too long, it can irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I start using this product while I was pregnant since there are many topical products for acne are not safe.  At first I bought it from the doctor&#x27;s office but then found it on Amazon and started ordering it from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it, and my skin was better than usual during pregnancy (although I don&#x27;t know if it can entirely be attributed to this product).  I&#x27;ve kept using it since though, and am still pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a few days ago but my skin is already very soft and because it&#x27;s creamy - it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. And don&#x27;t expect a foamy or sudsy cleanser. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my skin, but recently it&#x27;s been starting to get dry and dull so I&#x27;ve used many different facial products but nothing seemed to work. I&#x27;m very pleased with this cleanser so far and my complexion is so much brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> It cleanses my face without leaving it dry.  I use a quarter size amount each time I wash my face. The bottle lasts amount 13 months. It&#x27;s an excellent facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product and likes it.  She is seventy one and looks great to me. Three more words.</li>
    <li> This product helps to keep my skin clear and soft. It also lasts a long time and is worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> Used it in the past and now I am using it again. It has helped a great deal to reduce the size and clarity of my pores. Skin feels softer too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This product is one that I have been using for 20 years and this was the best experience that I have ever had purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> My praise for this product still stands, but the $200 price tag means I am now searching for another glycolic acid product. What follows is my original review. The fact that I have used this product for years should tell you that I like it.  First, I remove my makeup with an oil facial cleaning product and a warm wash cloth. I apply MD Forte Cleaner, either II or III, leave it on while in the shower and then use my Clarisonic brush. My skin feels and looks good, especially for my over 60 age. I frequently receive compliments and inquiries about my skin care.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a cleanser for my face that helps with adult acne and wrinkles.  I have not had a pimple since using this cleanser and my skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> Although this has saved me from much embarrassment from acne, I still have to complain about the price. I know these kinds of products are always expensive but still. I usually buy more than one at a time to save on shipping, But it works great, and was more effective for me than the MD Forte Facial Cleanser I.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I was having some hormonal issues causing some adult acne. The dr asked if I had ever heard of this product, MD Forte. Since then, I have raised 3 teenagers with FLAWLESS skin. Nevermind those ads for proactive and all those routines- this is the magic potion right here.....</li>
    <li> The seller did a great job packaging the product &amp; delivering it on time.  This is the finest facial cleanser on the planet.!  You must use it sparingly &amp; use a broad spectrum sunscreen to avoid sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for all types of skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok and did not irritate my skin but I prefer Aqua Glycolic.</li>
    <li> It is the best product to gently soften lines and lighten brown spots on my aging skin. I use it every winter.</li>
    <li> I have no bad reaction using this cleanser and i really love it.  This bottle is 5th bottles I use.</li>
    <li> Best glycolic wash for my skin.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market for youthful glowing skin.</li>
    <li> a great product have been using MD forte products for years and they are the only product that my skin will tollerate.  I can&#x27;t seem to buy them anywhere any more what has happened.</li>
