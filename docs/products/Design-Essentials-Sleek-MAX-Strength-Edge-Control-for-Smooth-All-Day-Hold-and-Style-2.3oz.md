      <li>Unless I find something even better</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this product and when it&#x27;s finished I will be getting more</li>
      <li>This one might be slightly better than Hick&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to use any more when I got up to go to work today.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Great for edges add much needed shine</li>
      <li>It is very easy to smooth and it locks in non sticky</li>
      <li>Great for natural hair.</li>
      <li>It was perfect for a few hours.</li>
      <li>but they made it there business to make sure I was satisfied with my product and there business , and I must say I am and would totally do business with them again</li>
      <li>So I would say it is definitely worth the cost and a must buy</li>
      <li>I think this is my favorite edge control so far.</li>
      <li>So I purchased this because of all the good reviews and my hair laid down &amp;</li>
      <li>Very please with product!</li>

      <li>Other than this feature, it isn&#x27;t any better than your typical greasy edge tamers that cost less for more (i.e Jam).</li>
      <li>I perfer the regular edge control by design essentials, this Max one seemed sticky and you need a little more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural and this didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m completely natural so that might be the reason why it doesn&#x27;t hold all day.</li>
      <li>My hair is completely natural.</li>
      <li>The only good thing about this &amp;#34;edge tamer&amp;#34; is that when the hair is damp you can use a thin layer to control frizz throughout your hair if you are setting twists for a curly style.</li>
      <li>This is awesome,  especially for 4c type hair that can be hard to slick down.</li>

<li> This is awesome,  especially for 4c type hair that can be hard to slick down.</li>
<li> I wanted to do a really slick high ponytail and for obvious reasons I couldnt use gel.</li>
<li> But I will definitely purchase again because all the other edge controls I have used don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
<li> This edge tamer is not worth the price as it does not last long in 3a-4c hair.</li>
<li> but when I put it in my hair the hold lasted for (literally) less than 5 minutes and it clumped up and left residue.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m natural, so it&#x27;s hard to find something that works for me and when I do I stick with it.</li>
<li> I have three daughters with varying grades of natural African American hair and am not impressed in the slightest with this product.</li>
<li> It sleeks my edges all day and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> My slick back be on FLEEK, with this edge gel!</li>
<li> I put some on yesterday before work and used my scarf to hold it down for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it last all day but it will give you a few hours of hold and I have tried at least 10 other edge controls on the market</li>
<li> I have a combination of type 4b &amp; 4c hair and it is extra THICK!</li>
<li> This works so well at keeping my edges down!</li>
<li> A few problems with shipping that had NOTHING to do with the seller/shipper</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t hold my thick hair down.</li>
<li> Maybe my hair is just too thick.</li>
<li> Kinda disappointed</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural and this didn&#x27;t help me. It seems like it would have a good hold but when I put it in my hair the hold lasted for (literally) less than 5 minutes and it clumped up and left residue. I like the smell though. Maybe my hair is just too thick.</li>
    <li> great product! We will buy again</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my thick hair down. Hair must be freshly relaxed or soft</li>
    <li> My slick back be on FLEEK, with this edge gel!</li>
    <li> I think this is my favorite edge control so far. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a lot of them. This one might be slightly better than Hick&#x27;s.  Recommended</li>

Other than this feature, it isn&#x27;t any better than your typical greasy edge tamers that cost less for more (i.e Jam). Save your money or invest in another product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hold like it said it do</li>
    <li> Holds well and hair will not frizz even with high humidity.</li>
    <li> Great for edges add much needed shine</li>
    <li> Very please with product! I like the look and the hold !</li>
    <li> Best edge control on the market!</li>

    <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s the best out there. ..I wouldn&#x27;t say it last all day but it will give you a few hours of hold and I have tried at least 10 other edge controls on the market</li>
    <li> Has very good control to start with but as the day goes on it wears off. But I&#x27;m completely natural so that might be the reason why it doesn&#x27;t hold all day. But I will definitely purchase again because all the other edge controls I have used don&#x27;t hold at all.</li>
    <li> I perfer the regular edge control by design essentials, this Max one seemed sticky and you need a little more. Kinda disappointed but it does its job.</li>
    <li> Best edge tamer ever. This has optimum beat.</li>
    <li> This is awesome,  especially for 4c type hair that can be hard to slick down.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to smooth and it locks in non sticky</li>
    <li> Very good holding gel for the edges....</li>
    <li> 3 stars because as the day wears on it turns white. My hair is completely natural. I have a combination of type 4b &amp; 4c hair and it is extra THICK! I wanted to do a really slick high ponytail and for obvious reasons I couldnt use gel. So I purchased this because of all the good reviews and my hair laid down &amp; my edges were sleek! It was perfect for a few hours. So I would say it is definitely worth the cost and a must buy but I need to find something that wont turn white as the day wears on...</li>
    <li> Great for natural hair.</li>
    <li> This works so well at keeping my edges down! I&#x27;m natural, so it&#x27;s hard to find something that works for me and when I do I stick with it. I had been using Olive Oil Edge Control, and it worked okay but I went to the salon and she used this and I love it. I put some on yesterday before work and used my scarf to hold it down for about 15 minutes. It lasted all day yesterday and I didn&#x27;t need to use any more when I got up to go to work today. Unless I find something even better this is what I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
