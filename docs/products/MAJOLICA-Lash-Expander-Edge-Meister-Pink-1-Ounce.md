      <li>This mascara is great.</li>
      <li>love, love this product!!!  </li>
      <li>It takes quite a bit of maneuvering, but if you succeed, you look like a bright eyed baby doll.</li>
      <li>Always loved Shiseido&#x27;s eye products.  </li>
      <li>(on the days I wear it) I use good ole&#x27; cheapie Olive Oil to remove this mascara and it works wonders.</li>
      <li>Good for layering up on volume.</li>
      <li>waterproof&lt;br /&gt;+ gorgeous package</li>
      <li>under your eyes...not good.</li>
      <li>and the packaging is so gorgeous</li>
      <li>Super awesome time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mascara is magic!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>and it will be pretty flawless.</li>
      <li>, I feel so fancy and amazing just using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I knew I liked the formulas coming out of Japan</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for a day at the beach or when you&#x27;re in water all day, but you need an intense eye makeup remover to get it off</li>
      <li>I prefer Fairydrops Scandal Queen Mascara because I get volume in 1-2 coats, it doesn&#x27;t bleed, and washed off very easily.</li>
      <li>This one is interesting as it has lash extending fibers that you brush on to give lashes amazing length.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that this is by far the best one !</li>
      <li>, now I gotta spend more money on the remover and makeup brushes?</li>
      <li>Make sure to do the backside of your lashes too for volume.  </li>
      <li>The wand is more like a comb, with fibers sticking to it.</li>
      <li>With another coat, there would be more volume.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the dual edged comb.</li>
      <li>I bought these as gifts and my friends love the formula as well.</li>
      <li>I have to make sure I dont have those pieces of hair/lashes on my brush before applying it. )</li>
      <li>Lengthens okay but does not thicken</li>
      <li>but once you master it I think this style of wand gives you better control while applying mascara.</li>
      <li>But if you love to apply loads of it until it looks like spider eyes...</li>
      <li>I use eyedrops constantly and had even taken a shower and the mascara was still perfectly in place.</li>
      <li>I prefer my Covergirl Lashblast Waterproof (the orange tube) as it holds my curl better, gives me volume AND length.</li>
      <li>My favorite was Shu Uemura lash extensions which has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The applicator is interesting</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I like more length and separation versus having volume.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>look that emphasizes the eyes without going over the top.</li>
      <li>I used Paula&#x27;s Choice gentle makeup remover and it came off SO EASY!!</li>
      <li>If you use a more traditional mascara brush it works great.</li>
      <li>I recommend curling your lashes first, applying this amazing mascara</li>
      <li>pretty nice.</li>
      <li>I think Shiseido makes some of the best mascaras hands down.</li>
      <li>The tube it comes in is very pretty as well!</li>
      <li>Precise lash coverage.</li>
      <li>The mascara has no scent which is fantastic.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels good to wear as well, never flaking, clumping, and not heavy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies, Maybelline&#x27;s Mega Plush Volum&#x27; Express, Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash (horrid, I know), Covergirl&#x27;s Lash Blast, Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stiletto, even monolid-ians&#x27; Holy Grail of mascaras - heroine make (long + curl) mascara, all to the effect of my transformation into an emo panda.    </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s not the cables since I use the original cables and the charge time with the default brick</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this mascara.</li>
      <li>and once it&#x27;s dry curl once more for more effect!</li>
      <li>Fair enough, it&#x27;s tougher to take off, but nothing coconut oil can&#x27;t take care of.</li>
      <li>love the comb instead of the brush because I can control how much I put on at a time, I can see my eyelashes during application, it prevents clumping and separates the lashes.</li>
      <li>Like the concept, and the mascara is good and has the extensions mixed in.</li>
      <li>it works really well without hesitating, one of my favorite lash make up.</li>
      <li>He reached out to me to make sure I was satisfied, and if not he wanted to work it out with me before I left a review.</li>
      <li>If you like a bold look, this may not be the mascara for you.</li>
      <li>It definitely makes my eyelashes longer and more prominent.</li>
      <li>The best part is that once it&#x27;s dry it won&#x27;t smudge, is waterproof and lasts sooooooo long!</li>
      <li>Wanted to like this product because I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras with fibers in them and loved them.</li>
      <li>excellent for my typical Asian lashes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of new mascaras lately, and I&#x27;m really impressed with this one, which I actually like better than the Heroine Make mascaras I&#x27;ve clung to for ages.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes as many people online rave about this, however, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>It takes some getting used to, as far as application goes, but the mascara formula is so smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The product has these lash fibers when you first take out the applicator.</li>
      <li>You must brush out your lashes into position first.</li>
      <li>When I first opened the tube I thought, &amp;#34;No&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>but you get used to it very quickly....nice coverage and adds length!</li>
      <li>The fibers in the formula add length, and amazingly, REALLY stay put!</li>
      <li>I have purchased similar ones because it recieved more reviews</li>
      <li>Not the same kind of magic as other mascaras that transform me into a panda animagus!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t wait too long to brush out, as the mascara will &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and the brush won&#x27;t be able to get through.</li>
      <li>After Shiseido discontinued my favorite The Makeup Lasting Lift mascara and my eyes became too sensitive for Maybelline Colossal Volume Express</li>
      <li>The smart ports does not seem to charge as fast.  </li>
      <li>While this doesn&#x27;t give me quite as much length or volume as Heroine Make or Fairy Drops mascaras, what the Majolica Majorca provides is a very pretty and natural (but much enhanced)</li>
      <li>very bushy and waterpoof.  </li>
      <li>Does really nothing for volume but legnth...tons.</li>
      <li>&quot; (whatever they are) add lash extensions to your lashes, and then since it&#x27;s waterproof, those \\&quot;extensions\\&quot; don&#x27;t move after a whole day of work.  </li>
      <li>Oh my god, this came in so fast</li>
      <li>Unusual brush</li>
      <li>The fiber formula really works-</li>
      <li>It holds a curl very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Non-smudging once it dries.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really doesnt smudge at all.</li>
      <li>The one in green packaging washes off with warm water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely like to keep some of this handy for more subtle makeup looks.</li>
      <li>I was a little weirded out at first, but I love</li>
      <li>I love how long the fibers make my eyelashes look and the mascara naturally curls them.</li>
      <li>Try cold cream let it sit for a while and wipe off with a hot rag that&#x27;s pretty much the best you can do until like 3 showers later.</li>
      <li>If you have a heated eyelash curler, you can comb your lashes after they dry, and it&#x27;ll look even more natural</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did a lot of make up research for my daughters wedding!i wanted my make up to stay on all day without smearing!  This mascara definitely stayed on all day! With no smearing or flecks getting on your face.  However, getting t he mascara off was quite a chore! Using make up remover on cotton, it took me quite a while to get it all off.</li>
    <li> It smudged on me.  I thought it was waterproof.</li>
    <li> I tried quite a few mascara before and I have to say that this is by far the best one ! It has fibers in it so that you can build your lashes up and they look extra long and natural ;) Several people asked me if I was wearing fake lashes since my real ones looked so long ! It also hold your curls if you have a eyelash curler ! I definitely recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Finally! This mascara is magic! Not the same kind of magic as other mascaras that transform me into a panda animagus!  I have pockets of fat resting directly on my short oily lashes, so I thought mascara was a beauty product I would have to do without. I&#x27;ve tried Maybelline&#x27;s Falsies, Maybelline&#x27;s Mega Plush Volum&#x27; Express, Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash (horrid, I know), Covergirl&#x27;s Lash Blast, Maybelline&#x27;s Lash Stiletto, even monolid-ians&#x27; Holy Grail of mascaras - heroine make (long + curl) mascara, all to the effect of my transformation into an emo panda.    So if you&#x27;re a monolid like me, maybe give this mascara a try. You might find yourself whisked away to Olashvander&#x27;s Wand Shop and see the mascara wand elongate your stubby lashes into glamorous feathery eye-wings and illuminate the hidden sparkles in your eyes to their full brightness. I always thought I was forever going to be some mascara squib/muggle, but my lashes have changed forever.    Enough Harry Potter references in all seriousness. When you first open the mascara tube, the wand is very strange. It&#x27;ll look like there&#x27;s teensy strands of hairs/lashes clumped around the brush, but these, I assume, are what make your lashes longer and fuller. It took a little getting used to, but a couple strokes of practice and I got down and jiggy with it. The mascara will last me ~6 hours before I could see even a wee bit of smudging around the corner of my eyes (which is nothing compared to the other mascaras). Fair enough, it&#x27;s tougher to take off, but nothing coconut oil can&#x27;t take care of. I&#x27;ll take that over my raccoon eyes any day. I haven&#x27;t tried swimming or showering with it on yet, but I&#x27;ll update my review when I do. It&#x27;s a bit on the more expensive end for me (as you can tell from my mascara history), but I think it is completely worth it.    As for the effect on my lashes, I wouldn&#x27;t say it is overly dramatic. It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes as long as heroine make mascara does, but it does give my lashes a noticeable difference. I would say the mascara makes \\&quot;longer\\&quot; a priority rather than \\&quot;fuller.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for volume but it&#x27;s advertised aas a lengthener and that&#x27;s what it does. Everything smudges on my awkward shaped eyes but this lasted most of the day without smudging when I had on NYX HD eye primer. Without primer, maybe lasted a few hours without smudging.&lt;br /&gt;Comes off decently if you hold a cotton ball with makeup remover to your eye for like 30 sec before wiping</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> There are two versions of this product. One is in pink packaging (pictured) and one is in green packaging (the one that was delivered). The tube in the pink packaging is the waterproof/original version. The one in green packaging washes off with warm water. I was expecting the waterproof tube pictured, but received the green version instead. I guess I will try out the green version. Please label/ picture the item correctly!</li>
    <li> gooey, gloppy, smeary JUNK</li>
    <li> I have blonde short lashes. I am obsessed with finding the ultimate lash lengthener. My favorite was Shu Uemura lash extensions which has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;This Majolica product is outstanding!!! You must brush out your lashes into position first. Keep a brush nearby as you may need to adjust the direction of your lashes throughout application as the applicator is a double sided comb. Start from the base and comb on; the product is on the thinnish side which I love because it doesn&#x27;t clump and looks soft and natural, like real lashes. Then... blam! the extensions start sticking on. My lashes doubled in length. they look real and LONG!!! The color is what I would call a soft black.&lt;br /&gt;you can add a second layer for a more dramatic night affect. Make sure to do the backside of your lashes too for volume.  love, love this product!!!  Cheers... Nicole</li>
    <li> Unusual brush but you get used to it very quickly....nice coverage and adds length!</li>
    <li> I have nearly invisible eyelashes, and I wanted a look that was fairly natural. Tried another brand and found it clumpy. This product has great definition! I can&#x27;t do a second application without clumping, but one is enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations for this mascara and I have to say they were definitely met. I&#x27;ve been battling with my short curly lashes all my life, and have tried everything from Maybelline GreatLash (the famous pink and green bottle) to Covergirl Lashblast and beyond. I agree with everyone else when they say it makes it look like you&#x27;re wearing false lashes. I look freakin&#x27; good! C : The wand is more like a comb, with fibers sticking to it. Which in return makes it look like you&#x27;re wearing falsies.    I see a lot of people are saying even with makeup remover this thing is difficult to remove. I don&#x27;t know what type of makeup remover everyone is using but to remove my makeup (on the days I wear it) I use good ole&#x27; cheapie Olive Oil to remove this mascara and it works wonders. I put the olive oil on a cotton pad and then leave it on my eye for about 3-5 seconds so the olive oil can break down the mascara before wiping it off completely. I learned that from a fellow makeup guru on youtube: [...] I also heard from a friend that Coconut Oil is a great makeup remover as well (and besides, I already spent about $30+ on my makeup alone, now I gotta spend more money on the remover and makeup brushes? Pssssh no way!!).    The only con would be that through out the day I noticed that a little mascara has smudged on my lower eyelids as well. This could be due to my extremely oily eyelids though...    And I know this review should be strictly on the product but I gotta give points to the seller as well. He reached out to me to make sure I was satisfied, and if not he wanted to work it out with me before I left a review. Good for him!</li>
    <li> This mascara was extremely messy to apply.  I threw it out after 1 wear.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this product because I&#x27;ve tried other mascaras with fibers in them and loved them. But this formula didn&#x27;t do it for me. The problem is that the fibers don&#x27;t always fully adhere to your lashes. This can cause flakes...under your eyes...not good. The applicator is interesting but I think it lends to the problem. It&#x27;s just not good at applying the fibers so that they might stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of new mascaras lately, and I&#x27;m really impressed with this one, which I actually like better than the Heroine Make mascaras I&#x27;ve clung to for ages. The Majolica Majorca&#x27;s unusual brush allows for very defined and separated lashes with minimal clumping, nothing that a quick pass with a lash comb can&#x27;t take care of, and the mascara formulation applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t look flaky, dry, or spidery. While this doesn&#x27;t give me quite as much length or volume as Heroine Make or Fairy Drops mascaras, what the Majolica Majorca provides is a very pretty and natural (but much enhanced) look that emphasizes the eyes without going over the top. I&#x27;d definitely like to keep some of this handy for more subtle makeup looks. And it holds a curl remarkably well, lasting all day on my usually stubbornly straight lashes.</li>
    <li> Awful, awful,awful  doesn&#x27;t do anything except a mess</li>
    <li> Not a real Shiseido product.</li>
    <li> it works really well without hesitating, one of my favorite lash make up. but the problem is that it is hard to take off..</li>
    <li> This product was not what I was looking for. My lashes fell off and it was hard to take off. I ended up throwing it away. A waste of my time any money.</li>
    <li> Always loved Shiseido&#x27;s eye products.  This one definitely did not disappoint.  First, I wasn&#x27;t used to using the plastic wand, takes a few practice and time, but after a few uses, it was fine.  The fibers sticks on very well and extends my lashes very long.  The plus is that it stays on all day and night, even after showering.  It&#x27;s waterproof but that also means you&#x27;ll have a tough time taking it off.  I don&#x27;t mind since I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that&#x27;ll give me the &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; effect.  This product definitely does the job without clumpy lashes.</li>
    <li> Lengthens okay but does not thicken</li>
    <li> I missed it in the description before ordering, but this is waterproof, which means it&#x27;s a pain to take off, but ALSO means it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, so it automatically earn a star just for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strange to put on mascra with a comb instead of a brush, but doesn&#x27;t take much to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s VERY dark black but not thick adn clumpy.  At first, when I opened it, I was confused b/c it appears to be full of small fibers... turns out these \\&quot;fibers\\&quot; (whatever they are) add lash extensions to your lashes, and then since it&#x27;s waterproof, those \\&quot;extensions\\&quot; don&#x27;t move after a whole day of work.  So I&#x27;ve ended up with lash lengths that I didn&#x27;t know I could achieve, but that also actually last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good to wear as well, never flaking, clumping, and not heavy.  Highly recommend, in fact I&#x27;m making my mom try it b/c she&#x27;s 54 and her natural lashes are getting thinner and shorter.</li>
    <li> very bushy and waterpoof.  pretty nice.</li>
    <li> I have typical &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; eyelashes; straight, short, sparse etc. After Shiseido discontinued my favorite The Makeup Lasting Lift mascara and my eyes became too sensitive for Maybelline Colossal Volume Express, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a really great lengthening and curling mascara that is gentle, or at least minimally irritating. Here is the business:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The fiber formula really works- it will make your eyelashes LONG.&lt;br /&gt;- It holds a curl very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Non-smudging once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not irritate my sensitive eyes (yet) despite being a waterproof formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes some practice to apply with the comb: the formula is very wet and I find wiping the comb off a little before application helps.&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on wet (careful if you have a monolid) and dries hard. People with naturally voluminous eyelashes should actually probably avoid this product because I can imagine it will make your lashes look crunchy. I noticed a lot of mascara seems to come off on the curler after I re-curl post-application and you have to curl carefully.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes off rough even with waterproof makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail mascara! This item does NOT clump and it looks very beautiful on my eyes! The tube it comes in is very pretty as well! It definitely makes my eyelashes longer and more prominent. I love it. I won&#x27;t use anything else now. If used with a mascara primer, my eyelashes look even longer!</li>
    <li> Like the concept, and the mascara is good and has the extensions mixed in. The problem is the applicator. If you use a more traditional mascara brush it works great.</li>
    <li> This mascara does wonders. I always hated how mascaras got everywhere after a couple hours. This really doesnt smudge at all. Even after shower. I wouldve given it 5 stars, but I took a star ojt cuz I think they gave me a used one... (when I first opened my masacra to see how the brush was like, it looked as if it had short pieces of lashes or hair. I have to make sure I dont have those pieces of hair/lashes on my brush before applying it. )</li>
    <li> Precise lash coverage. I love the dual edged comb. It takes some getting used to, as far as application goes, but the mascara formula is so smooth. Not waxy at all. Very black, a bit shiny once dried. The fibers add some volume to my lashes, but they&#x27;re not really necessary. The mascara has no scent which is fantastic. I have a second tube ready for when my first tube (lasted me at least 6 months) is done for. I bought these as gifts and my friends love the formula as well.</li>
    <li> The smart ports does not seem to charge as fast.  I know it&#x27;s not the cables since I use the original cables and the charge time with the default brick is faster.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a couple of years now... I have purchased similar ones because it recieved more reviews but I did not like the formula base. With this mascara I hated it in the beginning because I did not apply it right... if you want the natural look it is the perfect one. But if you love to apply loads of it until it looks like spider eyes... This product is not for you. The little hairs in the mascara are just fibers that lengthen your lashes. Try not to get them in your and and do soft strokes slowly and it will be pretty flawless.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great.</li>
    <li> Great product! Stays long, no flakes, lengthens lashes. Super fast shipping. Will order again, definitely!</li>
    <li> Oh my god, this came in so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw in the mail! I didn&#x27;t expect it for at least the month since I usually buy makeup from Asian stores quite often and they would at least take a month to come! This came in only about a week and a half I believe? Super awesome time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the product, the product is curved to match the eye, it has lots of mascara on the applicator and it shows immediate results for longer eyelashes. However it does clump so be careful on applying it! The best part is that once it&#x27;s dry it won&#x27;t smudge, is waterproof and lasts sooooooo long! I recommend curling your lashes first, applying this amazing mascara and once it&#x27;s dry curl once more for more effect! and the packaging is so gorgeous, I feel so fancy and amazing just using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Waterprood&lt;br /&gt;Smudgeproof&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Lengthen lashes greatly! (especially if you have straight asian lashes like me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It can clump easily so be careful!</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this mascara. I had high hopes as many people online rave about this, however, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I prefer my Covergirl Lashblast Waterproof (the orange tube) as it holds my curl better, gives me volume AND length. This mascara only gives me length and has a weird applicator brush. The mascara looks very natural but doesn&#x27;t hold my Asian, straight lashes. I am going back to my Covergirl mascara, the only thing about the Covergirl mascara is that it smudges but that can be fixed with a waterproof topcoat from Bareminerals. All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you already have thick lashes.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the tube I thought, &amp;#34;No&amp;#34;. It comes with a flat, curved comb-like head with tiny teeth around the border. I thought it was just gonna glob on the mascara without separating or combing out the lashes but I was pleasantly surprised. The design does take some getting used to but once you master it I think this style of wand gives you better control while applying mascara.</li>
    <li> Actually lengthen and kept my stubborn Asian eyelashes curled! I look like I had false eyelashes on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush was a bit weird but the mascara works. It has little hair-liked fiber that will attach to your eyelashes, making them look longer (so when you remove the mascara and see little hair fell off, don&#x27;t worry, those are not your real lashes falling off). I use eyedrops constantly and had even taken a shower and the mascara was still perfectly in place. No smudging whatsoever. Very impressed. I take it off using Q-tips dipped in olive oil</li>
    <li> excellent for my typical Asian lashes~This new version has some “fibers&amp;#34; in it that you can see on the brush when you use it and it helps to lengthen your lashes.</li>
    <li> BEST. MASCARA.EVER. PERIOD!</li>
    <li> I was using FairyDrops Scandal Queen mascara, but when Sephora stopped carrying it, I decided to try something else. I knew I liked the formulas coming out of Japan so I did some research which led me to this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unbelievable at adding length and it does not budge! I wear glasses and also have sensitive eyes, so this is the main concern for me. I love how long the fibers make my eyelashes look and the mascara naturally curls them. I have seen a tiny bit of flaking after wearing it for a few hours, but it is nothing compared to the other fiber mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. The color is a rich black that doesn&#x27;t stand out against my black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;I love the comb instead of the brush because I can control how much I put on at a time, I can see my eyelashes during application, it prevents clumping and separates the lashes. I apply three very thin layers to build it up and it doesn&#x27;t take any additional effort. I&#x27;ve heard of some people using this for length, then adding a volumizing mascara on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main features:&lt;br /&gt;+ lengthening&lt;br /&gt;+ curls lashes&lt;br /&gt;+ comb applicator&lt;br /&gt;+ waterproof&lt;br /&gt;+ gorgeous package&lt;br /&gt;+ affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this mascara as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> Definitely gives you long doll eyelashes. Does really nothing for volume but legnth...tons. The comb like applicator is definitely a learning curve I suggest trying it before you do all your makeup it will get everywhere if you&#x27;re not seasoned with it. After it dries it will not come off...ever. Spare your delicate eye area and just accept it. Try cold cream let it sit for a while and wipe off with a hot rag that&#x27;s pretty much the best you can do until like 3 showers later. One star deducted for the odd comb you need to get used to and having racoon eyes for a day or two trying to scrub it off.</li>
    <li> Really interesting mascara with little hair fibers in it. Good for layering up on volume.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Comb, not a brush applicator, but I immediately adapted.&lt;br /&gt;NO smudging or sticking to areas above or below the eye.  Unlike other brands with fibers, this one does not make individual eyelashes look \\&quot;furry\\&quot; - lashes are shiny, separated and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it everyday; removal is a breeze with an oil or cream based remover.</li>
    <li> I think Shiseido makes some of the best mascaras hands down. This one is interesting as it has lash extending fibers that you brush on to give lashes amazing length. It is a bit tricky to get the fibers on to the lashes however. It takes quite a bit of maneuvering, but if you succeed, you look like a bright eyed baby doll. I really like it! The missing star is only because the application takes more time and care.</li>
    <li> This mascara is NOT going to give you a fluffy, full, fringy look. You&#x27;ll want to have a clean, dry mascara wand to &amp;#34;fluff out&amp;#34; your lashes after applying this mascara. Don&#x27;t wait too long to brush out, as the mascara will &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and the brush won&#x27;t be able to get through. With a comb applicator you get detailed, precise coverage, right down to the tiniest hidden lash. The fibers in the formula add length, and amazingly, REALLY stay put! I wore this mascara swimming and was amazed at it&#x27;s staying power! I even washed my face with soap and water, and it barely budged. On day three (yes, I said day THREE) I used Paula&#x27;s Choice gentle makeup remover and it came off SO EASY!!</li>
    <li> If you like a bold look, this may not be the mascara for you. In order to get it on thick, I had to apply several coats.. like 5. Not sure if this was because of the brush or the product. Looks alright on and definitely lengthens, but not much volume. My least favorite part was how difficult this stuff is to wash off! It&#x27;s perfect for a day at the beach or when you&#x27;re in water all day, but you need an intense eye makeup remover to get it off and even then it takes several washes. I prefer Fairydrops Scandal Queen Mascara because I get volume in 1-2 coats, it doesn&#x27;t bleed, and washed off very easily. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I like more length and separation versus having volume.&lt;br /&gt;This does a really good job! With one layer, I can see my lashes longer than before. With another coat, there would be more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has these lash fibers when you first take out the applicator. I was a little weirded out at first, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, these don&#x27;t make my eyes tear up. If you have a heated eyelash curler, you can comb your lashes after they dry, and it&#x27;ll look even more natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even wore this to sleep and there was very little under eye circles. Though my lashes weren&#x27;t as full as the other day. (probably rubbed off in my sleep). Definitely buying this again!!</li>
