<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent fragrance and received on time!</li>
    <li> Fake.  I bought this for my mom. She always gets this at the mall which cost more than what I paid for this. Apparently there is a reason, this &amp;#34;toilet water&amp;#34; is a fake. What a waste of money. Now i have to go buy her the real thing as she would not even bother to spray this on. Now I use it as a bathroom air freshener. Unfortunately even Febreze does a good job than this piece of crap. Save yourself $50 and go get the real thing at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom.</li>
    <li> Nothing negative about Light Blue!</li>
    <li> Light blue is one of my favorite light scents to wear.  It&#x27;s refreshing and not over powering.  I always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> A light, clean scent, I love when she wears it and she gets compliments on it all the time.  Great in the summer time too!</li>
    <li> It smells great and my girl loves it. She smells so so sexy. It was here with perfect  timing. Y</li>
    <li> I love this, wife has used it for 20 years and I found this at a fraction of the price from the original store purchase made long ago.  This will last us at least 10 years.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite&#x27;s.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Dolce &amp; Gabbana!  I love it and all my giftees love it as well!</li>
    <li> Perfect blend of floral,cedar,fruit and musk, not too sweet or heavy. Buying through Amazon let me find the best price and shipment was prompt.</li>
    <li> We worried that this was a knock-off when purchasing it off my mother&#x27;s Christmas wish list. Fortunately, however, if it is a knock-off she says she can&#x27;t tell and is very happy. She was missing her Light Blue and is excited to have it back.</li>
    <li> Perfume has always been one of my favorite purchases.  This scent is way too strong for my liking.  Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is lite enough to use every day at work, without being too heavy or cloying around others.  It lasts throughout the day and comments are complimentary rather than negative.</li>
    <li> Love this product  the price is so great this is not my first bottle and its not going to be my last thank you</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent by Dolce &amp; Gabbana and it isn&#x27;t overly feminine, almost uni-sex.&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of my trip to Europe, where I first smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on my clothes for a long time, which I like.  Not so much on my skin, I have to squirt it a few times a day, but that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the product/value.</li>
    <li> The color if off  and the the scent is not has pure has my previous bottle. I am not satisfied</li>
    <li> This is one of my wifes favorates and she was very happy to receive this item!  Will purdhase again when this supply runs low!</li>
    <li> It seemed not the real deal. The scent did not stay long unlike the real one. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend as an Christmas present and she absolutely loves it! The perfume last all day and is classic.</li>
    <li> I could smell the fragrance as I opened the package. Perfect! Will order my other favorite fragrances from here when available.</li>
    <li> Light Blue Perfume - Product received in good condition.  Retail store quality and smells just like what I always buy in a department store.</li>
    <li> I always get worried about buying name brand perfume offline.  Ice just heard to many horror stories. But I&#x27;ll be back to buy another bottle when I run out because this was as if I bought for full price at Macys happy customer!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my wife after she has been out of it for a while now. I forgot how good the smell is. I love it and I know my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I simply love this fragrance. It is so delicate and delicious.</li>
    <li> Great perfume! Doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the one I bought at Sephora, but smells the same!</li>
    <li> This is a gift. I assume it is fine. It was shipped as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this scent, arrived quickly and at a fraction of the price as the department stores. Definetely will be buying again.</li>
    <li> There is something about this soft citrus fragrance that I have not found in any other fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite winter fragrance that can be used any season of the year!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice clean scent . Every time I use it I get compliments. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This smells wonderfully and it will last a long time because you use a small amount on your body.  It lasts all day and smells good all day.  I put this on at 5:00 a.m. and at 5:30 p.m. it still smells good.  My daughter tells me when she picks me up from work in the afternoon that I smell just like I did when she picked me up in the morning, you cannot beat that.  I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> i am amazed, would have paid triple at macys, PERFECT! the scent is out of this world, so pleasing and it is my daughters favorite. will order more high end fragrances from amazon.</li>
    <li> I picked this rating because I was disappointed that the bottle was only 3/4 full. Love the fragrance though. Yes, I would recommend this for that reason.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not the real stuff. I compared it to a friend&#x27;s Light Blue, which she acquired at an authorized retailer, and it is very different. I then went to Macy&#x27;s and compared this one to the one they have as a sample spray, and again, very different. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> wish the smell last longer</li>
    <li> Smells exaxtly like the original to me. Absolutely love it</li>
    <li> merchandise received in good condition</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Eau De Toilette, light blue.  It is so delicate and perfect for summer. I am concerned as to whether mine is the real deal or not.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the scent for very long, where the sample bottle they gave me in the store does.  I also read your reviews on how many people felt they were scammed and got a fake bottle of cologne, and wondering if I too was scammed.. I think from now on I&#x27;ll pay full price and be satisfied knowing I got the real stuff...a lesson learned..&amp;#34;buyer beware&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It couldn&#x27;t possibly be authentic. First of all the base notes were very lemony, your suppose to smell amber and a mix of musk when you first spray. The middle notes smelled like a musty lemon and it&#x27;s suppose to smell like jasmine and white rose. The top notes well it disappeared after 2 hrs, it&#x27;s suppose to smell like apples and cedar it didn&#x27;t go with my chemistry at all which means FAKE. Used since 2004 I know how it smells on me. I was sooo disgusted to say the least.  You should never alter your products because you never know who your selling too!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne.  Its my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; scent that can be worn all year round.  Light and fresh, not heavy or flowery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to&lt;br /&gt;Feel about&lt;br /&gt;This one. I went into sephora to get a sample of&lt;br /&gt;The perfum before buying bc it was over 50$ I wanted to make sure the smell would&lt;br /&gt;Last &amp; as I expected it did! So I ordered this one online for 10$ cheaper I received it and  I&#x27;m really convinced I got a fake. Which is really disappointing to me the perfume is like 99% water or something bc it does not last not even 10 mins!!!!!! You have to spray a couple of times to even smell it! Never buying perfume online ever again I&#x27;ll rather spend the extra money to get the real one. So disappointing</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping!! Was not expecting this as soon as it came!  Very happy</li>
    <li> Excellent perfume! Not too strong yet it has an expensive scent. You can wear this daily during the day for work or for a night out with friends. Highly recommended! Also makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> My best freind bought me the same purfume and paid more at the store and got less!  Thank you for helping me on this one!</li>
    <li> last long and does run out quickly will order again love the case it is really pretty thanks really enjoying</li>
    <li> My wife has been dying to purchase this cologne, but it was to expensive in the Department stores, so when I saw it on Amazon for less money, I purchased it right away....She gets many compliments .........</li>
    <li> Great smell. I love it. But it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I love lemon scent and it contains it.</li>
    <li> This product is not legit, it is a fake.  I have been buying Light Blue for years and as soon as I received this item, I recognised that the packaging did not look the same as the ones i&#x27;d bought previously from stores.  For starters, the color on this one is a much lighter blue and it is missing a lot of the information on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying on the perfume, I noticed that the scent was gone within about 30 minutes - whereas, the real Light Blue lasts for around 12-14 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fake product, DO NOT buy and waste your money!</li>
    <li> Excelente servicio al cliente, excelente producto, recomiendo este suplidor 100%.&lt;br /&gt;La forma de empaque asegura que el producto llegue en perfectas condiciones.</li>
    <li> great perfume, thanks</li>
    <li> very good product, met the estimated time, I loved it</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, I was turned on to this fragrance by my finace who wears the men&#x27;s version.  I have always loved the way it smelled on him, so I went out on a limb and tried the women&#x27;sversion and fell in love all over again!  Since I&#x27;ve started wearing it, I get so many compliments from everyone, including total strangers.  I absolutely love this fragrance!  I&#x27;m already on my second bottle and getting ready to order my third!&lt;br /&gt;If you like light, fresh and crisp frangrances that are not overwhelming or musky, this is the fragrance for you.</li>
    <li> Fake fake fake!  Beware this scent does NOT last.</li>
    <li> This perfume has to be a fake.  I say this because I had an old bottle and compared the bottles.  This bottle had a yellow tint to it.  I have been buying this perfume for years but in a store.  I saw the price and didn&#x27;t even think it was too good too be true.  I feel duped but I should have read the reviews.  The positive ones HAVE to be from the seller.  Because there is no way this product is the real deal.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Spend the extra $20 on the real deal.</li>
    <li> We gave this to our 30-something year old niece recently and she was thrilled with it.  This is her signature scent and Amazon had it for a good price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. I love it too, makes me want to be over her constantly.</li>
    <li> I really like the Light Blue from Dolce @ Gabanna but this is not the real fragrance .....i&#x27;m really upset that i wasted 50$ on this  .</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one of my all time favorites.  So clean and refreshing.  It never fails that I get the most compliments when I wear this perfume.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what my wife wanted and the product was well priced.this was a Christmas gift. Worked out perfectly</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying this after reading some reviews but it smells just like it should and lasts.</li>
    <li> The packaging was close, but flawed along with the product. After a few weeks the silver tape on the bottom began to wrinkle and smell of the perfume became very weak and watered down. Also the stickers on the bottom were off center. Beware!!! I will never buy perfume from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely :) very pleased.</li>
    <li> Although it took several days longer to arrive than I had anticipated, it was worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews worried me, but I purchased the item that was sold by and shipped by Amazon and I have no doubt that this is the authentic product. Even after a very light application, it is extremely long lasting - well over 12 hours of  fragrance.</li>
    <li> One of my daughter&#x27;s FAVORITES!&lt;br /&gt;Asks Momma for it every Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Price for the size of bottle is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;We will be ordering more from this company for this Christmas as well.</li>
