      <li>Use this along with the Deva diffuser and you&#x27;ll have amazing curls...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is nice for a microfiber towel, I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
      <li>Partly this was my own fault</li>
      <li>go nicely with the set.</li>
      <li>That was my own fault for not reading the dimensions.</li>
      <li>I own three of these towels.</li>
      <li>It has a nice logo</li>
      <li>no matter what kind you have.</li>
      <li>It reduces frizz and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s not designed to do anything more than just scrunch out the excess moisture, but I&#x27;d like to let the towel do that on its own while it&#x27;s wrapped around my hair and brushing</li>
      <li>Perfect for drying natural hair.  </li>
      <li>size is ideal for gently squeezing water out of your hair without roughing-up the cuticle,</li>
      <li>I love my Devacurl towel, but more importantly my curls appreciates it!!</li>
      <li>Using this towel is great and does get the water out of your hair so that you can get a beautiful air dry finish.  </li>
      <li>I have wavy hair that, if treated just so, can be remarkably curly and fun.</li>
      <li>Great product &amp; works great and will use it a very long time.</li>
      <li>It makes my curls more frizzy than they normaly would be</li>
      <li>I have already ordered one as a gift for another curly girl :)</li>
      <li>but I really do love it now.  </li>
      <li>My curls respond better to a smoother tshirt material cotton towel.</li>
      <li>I am glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>This took awhile for me to love</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to wrap your hair up in this towel either.</li>
      <li>I love this towel.  </li>
      <li>I ended up having better luck with the much-maligned bath towel, when I purchased one that was sheared on one side to a velvety surface that didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rough up&amp;#34; my hair at all.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll save $$ and probably have more fabric.</li>
      <li>I love deva cul products.</li>
      <li>Even a run of the mill microfiber all-purpose drying cloth like a Sham-Wow would be better for the price.</li>
      <li>It is more like t-shirt material.  </li>
      <li>I have been using these products for about 4 years now and love them.  </li>
      <li>My hair is in much better shape and my curls are better defined.  </li>
      <li>If you are just scrunching, putting product in and going or diffusing your hair, it&#x27;s probably OK.</li>
      <li>I love this along with the DevaCurl products.</li>
      <li>My curls are looking much better.</li>
      <li>This towel and the lavender mist are the best things in this entire line.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee, and then I realized it&#x27;s just a microfiber towel.  We went to a local store and got a 2 ft by 3 ft towel, larger than this towel, for half the price.  If you need the towel but not the brand name, go with a regular microfiber towel.</li>
    <li> As someone else said, I had no idea a towel could make such a difference. I love what it does for my curls, aiding the drying process but without leaving crazy frizzy. Leaves hair feeling smoother, and I don&#x27;t have to leave the house with sopping wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is small as other reviews reflect. However,  it is not necessary to wrap your head with it. It is simply to squeeze the water out and scrunched the curls up in the process. In this way, it is perfect for me, and I am very pleased. Just need to buy another one for when it&#x27;s in the washload! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this towel for a few months now and I like it. This is a good towel and it&#x27;s definitely easier on my curls, but it&#x27;s a little small. You can&#x27;t easily wrap it around your head (if you like to do that sort of thing). My hair is less frizzy than when I use a regular towel. I just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> While the theory behind this is great, the fact that I can&#x27;t get it to wrap around my hair or even cover my head is a bit of a problem.  I had to put it over my hair and then wrap a regular towel around it.  This is a way overpriced washcloth.</li>
    <li> I love this towel for my curls! If you use it according to deva&#x27;s directions, it is perfect. I scrunch my hair with this towel sopping wet in the shower and it dries my coarse wavy hair to where it doesn&#x27;t drip even a little bit. It is not meant to be used as a turbin. If you want that, this towel isn&#x27;t for you. But if you want to get the moisture out for frizz-free curls, this is your towel.  Buying one for my sister now :)</li>
    <li> I love this. Making such a difference for my hair!</li>
    <li> I let my wavy hair air dry and so I use this after I shower and my hairs drys a lot quicker.  I also think it helps with frizz.</li>
    <li> This towel really cuts down on drying time and hair dries frizz free. Great product for curly hair. I would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Best towel for curly hair! Super absorbent! Will never dry my hair with terry cloth again. This definitely helps reduce frizziness.</li>
    <li> So this is a microfiber towel.  Plain and simple.  What makes it different?  The cute little Deva logo.  AND it&#x27;s not big enough to wrap around my hair.  Perhaps it&#x27;s not designed to do anything more than just scrunch out the excess moisture, but I&#x27;d like to let the towel do that on its own while it&#x27;s wrapped around my hair and brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it does what it claims (5), but is way too overpriced (1).  Averages out to 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  Unless you&#x27;re hung up on cute little logos, go buy a cheap microfiber towel anywhere.  You&#x27;ll save $$ and probably have more fabric.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; works great and will use it a very long time. Smart purchase on my part. Packaged well.</li>
    <li> Softer than I thought. Helps keep my hair from breaking.</li>
    <li> When one reviewer said this towel was cotton and not microfiber, I thought maybe it was cotton or a smoother microfiber or was in some other way special. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a plain, thin microfiber towel, with Deva stitched in. You&#x27;re basically paying for the Deva logo. (And it is microfiber; it says so on the packaging.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size isn&#x27;t really a problem for my shoulder length (when wet) hair, but if my hair was much longer, I think I&#x27;d have problems with it being too small.</li>
    <li> It is a nice towel, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Nice towel to have for hair only. Kinda reminds you to use the Deva towel instead of automatically grabbing a regular towel after washing your hair.  Best bet, get it on sale.</li>
    <li> Would be great if it were larger.  This towel is much too small for \\&quot;plopping\\&quot; curly hair.  Won&#x27;t wrap around your head unless you&#x27;re a child.  It is, however, good for scrunching hair.</li>
    <li> Using this towel is great and does get the water out of your hair so that you can get a beautiful air dry finish.  However i have tried a regular microfiber towel and have gotten the same results!</li>
    <li> I really wish I had found this sooner. I have wavy hair that looks a hot mess if I leave it to dry on its own so 90% of the time it gets blow dried and this has been great. Gets a lot of the moisture out before hand and my waves are much easier to tame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Girl and Happy Hair!</li>
    <li> I own three of these towels. The first one I got in a travel kit and I liked it so much I bought two more. For starters, I do use several Deva Curl products, but I don&#x27;t use the exact method they recommend with the towel. What I do after I step out of the shower is gently wring my hair out then loosely turban wrap it in a regular towel. After a few minutes I take off the towel and put in my styling products, then use the Deva towel to scrunch the excess water out of my hair. I keep one towel in the bathroom, one at my vanity and one in the master bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, these towels aren&#x27;t the same as microfiber towels you can buy in the store. I bought some shop microfiber towels, thinking they were the same, and they were horrible on my hair. Not only that but they attracted static like crazy. These little towels might be kind of expensive, but in my opinion totally worth it as I can see a difference in my hair when I use one and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I do like how it works... I just wish it was bigger.  I have long hair so I could use a bigger towel.  I like to tie it up on my head while I dry the rest of my body but this is to small to even do that.  But again...... I do like how it works on my curls!!!</li>
    <li> I love this towel! I have very curly hair, and I used to use a cotton t-shirt to get any extra water out of my hair. The t-shirt worked ok, but I have to say I love this towel better. It leaves my hair much less frizzy than drying with the t-shirt! The towel washes well and dries quickly. It&#x27;s also soft! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewer said, it&#x27;s way overpriced here. I bought it at a beauty shop in my hometown and paid $3 or so for it. It&#x27;s good for scrunching my hair and I definitely like my curls better now than when I used a washcloth, but for $12, don&#x27; expect miracles like with the other Deva products. Maybe look elsewhere for it?</li>
    <li> I think it increased my frizz. I prefer paper towels.</li>
    <li> This is a total rip-off.  You can buy microfiber hair towels elsewhere.  There is nothing special about this one and it&#x27;s about the size of a shoulder-rag to catch baby spit-up.  I do NOT recommend this.</li>
    <li> too small to actually wrap on your head.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference than my other hair towels.  Wish I would have not waisted my money.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that, if treated just so, can be remarkably curly and fun. Having a lightweight towel and not wrapping my hair turban-style out of the shower is helpful in keeping my hair curly; however, the price of this towel is out of line with what it is. Does it do what it says? Yes -- and please do read the instructions because they are clear that it is small and not for wrapping your head in the towel. I&#x27;m just not sure it is absolutely necessary. Get it for a splurge. Use as instructed.</li>
    <li> Its drys my hair way quicker than anything else I have used. I like it when I do need my hair to be perfect. It makes my curls more frizzy than they normaly would be but on the go its perfect</li>
    <li> Wish this towel was towel sized.  It works as promised , i suppose.  The price for a hand towel sized barely covers my hair and leaves the floor really wet.  Not too impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I choose this rating because I felt this product was not worth the price.  I feel like I paid for the name and I would not reccomend it to anyone at this time.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s microfiber, but I was expecting it to be a little larger than it is, since I have long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> To be clear, this is not a microfiber towel.  I have one and this is different. It is more like t-shirt material.  If you have read Curly Girl and use the DevaCurl products you will appreciate the difference.  This won&#x27;t make your curly hair frizzy the way microfiber or terry cloth will.  You can always use your old t-shirts, but I got tired of accidentally using the ones I wanted to wear and bought this.  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I do agree that it is too small.  It is less than half the size of my old microfiber towel, so I can only use it to scrunch water out of my long hair--I can&#x27;t wrap my hair in it.  It would be great if it were at least twice the size.</li>
    <li> This towel is so absorbant. Dries my shoulder length hair to the perfect dampness neede for the follow on Deva products.</li>
    <li> This towel works better than other towels I have tried and is super easy to pack! I would recommend using this towel everyday.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in product.  Even though I knew it was small I wanted it because I usually use paper towels to help squeeze the excess water out of my hair and was tired of wasting them on my hair.  I thought this towel would work as well as the paper towels but I was wrong.  The paper towels win, hands down! Curls are much more defined and hair is far less frizzy.....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a micro fiber towel</li>
    <li> Use this along with the Deva diffuser and you&#x27;ll have amazing curls...plus I use the Deva curling creme and my curls never looked so beautiful 😃</li>
    <li> Not too small. Helps reduce frizz</li>
    <li> Reall helps with keeping the frizz down when I wear my hair curly &amp; let air dry.</li>
    <li> The microfiber and feel of the towel is nice, however the size is too small for my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for about 4 years now and love them.  My hair is in much better shape and my curls are better defined.  I am a fan for life!</li>
    <li> Towel too small to fit all of my hair! And my hair is not that long :(</li>
    <li> Great quality but if you have long hair, check the size out.</li>
    <li> Too small! It was the size of a dish towel, I couldn&#x27;t even for it around my head! Too bad!</li>
    <li> Way too small. I&#x27;ve purchased a bigger one in bed bath and beyond.</li>
    <li> Good but not really necessary - at least not for my curls.</li>
    <li> Given that it&#x27;s affiliated with the Devacurl system, I would have expected this towel to be larger. The correct way to use this towel is to squeeze the moisture out of section by section, but it misses the point that when you have thick, curly hair (especially when it&#x27;s long!) it&#x27;s a real comfort to be able to put it up in a towel while it continues to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a shame that it&#x27;s white. If you dye your hair ever, you can expect this thing to stain. Mine is currently streaked in peacock blue hair dye... would have been nicer if it were black or a darker color that would hide something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice for a microfiber towel, I&#x27;ll give it that. I notice less frizz on the whole when using it. However, consider that you can get other *packs* of microfiber towels for your hair for the same price on Amazon to use frequently. With this, you&#x27;ll have just one and you&#x27;ll have to either buy many (price adds up!) or be constantly washing it.</li>
    <li> I wish it were a little bigger!</li>
    <li> Great absorption but the towel is absurdly small. No head full of hair, even a child&#x27;s, could be small enough for this towel.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me angry because this company KNOWS that their product is a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I love all the other Divacurl products. This is just useless.</li>
    <li> It drys my hair quite well with me scrunching.I just wish it was a tad bigger it looks like a wash cloth /rag as it is on my shoulders it doesn&#x27;t reach from on shoulder to the other .i thought I got the wrong size or it was for a baby. It feels like a tshirt / microfiber material combo so basically a much softer version of a micro fiber towel .</li>
    <li> The towel absorbs, but I&#x27;m giving it a low rating because of the size.  It&#x27;s so small that I cannot be wrapped around the head,</li>
    <li> Yeah, They are great but it is too expensive. You can find similar products more cheaper than this, but they do what they supposed to do</li>
    <li> A must have for curly hair.  I use this every day and can&#x27;t imagine what I did without it. I am sure you can use a cheaper knock off and it will work just as well but this is def worth the money</li>
    <li> I bought this towel because I own the 2010 edition of &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; that advised me to &#x27;use an old t-shirt, paper towel, or microfiber towel&#x27; to dry my hair, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste paper towels or get rid of any shirts. The good news is, it does what it claims to do: It dries the hair with less frizz once styling takes place. The bad news is, after the first wash in the laundry, now it has &#x27;fuzzies&#x27; all over it that I can&#x27;t get off! I even skipped the bleach like it said in the instructions. I still have the towel, but sadly it gets little to no use anymore. Personally, I&#x27;m back to putting a towel on my head for 20 minutes before styling it.</li>
    <li> Wish it was bigger, but it&#x27;s exactly as described!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my curly hair after using this towel.  It&#x27;s supposed to help hair be smoother and less frizzy. My hair seemed no different than when I use a terry cloth towel. It&#x27;s also much smaller than I expected. It&#x27;s the size of a hand towel. I&#x27;m honestly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for curly girls!!! Regular towels cause frizz but this does not. I love it! Even got my hairdresser to get one for her other curly girl clients.</li>
    <li> Microfiber towels soak up much more moisture than regular towels,  without roughing up the cuticle of the hair which creates frizzies.  My only complaint is I wish Deva Curl or someone made a much larger towel to wrap your hair in while putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size is ideal for gently squeezing water out of your hair without roughing-up the cuticle, so still a stellar product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> Good quality, and the perfect size—for a Chihuahua. Otherwise, good luck getting this on enough of your hair to be useful.</li>
    <li> This towel is really nice and comfortable, except, it is very small and I have very long hair to wrap up.  I would not buy this again only for that reason.</li>
    <li> While it does seem to help control frizz in my hair it is no where near the size needed to wrap hair in. I could not even use it on my 4 yr old niece&#x27;s hair. While it does work well to get moisture out - it really needs to be bigger.&lt;br /&gt;I will look for one that gives size next time.&lt;br /&gt;If you just want the name brand  and have money to burn fine. But I would need 4 times the size of this one to use it as I would like.</li>
    <li> Very tiny! My hair is medium length and this towel does not fit. If you have really short hair then this is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> It clearly states that it&#x27;s a microfiber towel. My curls respond better to a smoother tshirt material cotton towel. That said, it is very absorbent just be aware that it may still &amp;#34;rough up the cuticle&amp;#34; and create frizz.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that I am a huge fan of the DevaCurl products; they are the only thing that can tame my wavy, frizzy curls. So naturally, I thought I should start using the towel, too, for even better results. Nope. This thing is saturated with water after once or two &amp;#34;scrunches&amp;#34; of my curls. I ring it out, but it&#x27;s still a cold, damp mess that won&#x27;t absorb any more water. I had high hopes for this, but it turned out to be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works per description.  Will use it whenever I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely tiny, not even large enough to wrap around my head, and totally unsuitable for plopping. The material is very nice, but don&#x27;t expect to use it for your hair.</li>
    <li> I love deva cul products. My hair is healthier than it&#x27;s ever been since youth, however, this towel is the size of a hand towel. It has a nice logo but I&#x27;d rather have a size large enough to wrap up my hair.</li>
    <li> Too small. This towel is just for dabbing and crunching the hair dry. don&#x27;t even think about wrapping this around your head.</li>
    <li> Perfect for drying natural hair.  I have noticed a different in my frizz from using the microfiber towel vs. a regular towel.</li>
    <li> Calling all of us who are blessed to have curly hair!! We all know the struggles that come with having our awesome curls. This towel and the lavender mist are the best things in this entire line. Microfiber is simply better for your hair...no matter what kind you have. I have convinced the majority of my friends, both male and female, how awesome microfiber towels are for your hair. My male friends who have thinning hair find that they lose less hair when they use microfiber. My female friends love the way microfiber cuts the frizz that we all hate so much. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I noticed my naturally curly hair is not as frizzy now that I use a microfiber towel. Absorbs water quickly without drying out my hair. One Deva towel was too short for my hair length so I purchased 4, and sewn them together. Love it!!! I maintain it&#x27;s softness and original texture by not putting in the dryer as instructed.</li>
    <li> Great towel for curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or cause it to frizz. It is light-weight and easy to tie up.</li>
    <li> The towel is great and does all it&#x27;s supposed to.  My hair is less frizzy and it&#x27;s summer!  I just wish that it were large enough to go all the way around my head and not fall off.  4.5 stars</li>
    <li> Excellent for taking out all the wetness and excess product. Hair dries in half the time.  Seems to help set the curls too when used with Frizz Free Foam. I actually can&#x27;t live with out it. I travel with it. Its worth having a few so you have one handy while the other is getting washed.</li>
    <li> Love it if you haven&#x27;t tried it ,, best thing for curly girls</li>
    <li> DevaCurl products never disappoint me.  I use this towel as it is recommended, to blot and scrunch my hair a little post shower.  It is perfect for it&#x27;s intended use.  Sure, it&#x27;s a little expensive, but I tried using my microfiber cleaning cloths that I have that have a denser loop pattern and my hair was frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just the right size to hang on my towel rack next to my fancy hand towels.  It&#x27;s unobtrusive, and looks better than the old t-shirt I had been using to blot my hair with.  The microfiber will still pull out moisture from my hair even when it gets wet. I have used it in a pinch to dry off my body when I forgot my bath towel and it dryer off my whole body great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular towel blotting makes my hair look terrible and disturbs the curl patters.  These towels keep my curl pattern intact, which is why I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I had 1, but needed another (because, gotta have one on hand at all times!).  These deva towels are fabulous.  If you&#x27;re expecting a regular bath towel to wrap your hair in, forget it! But, if you&#x27;re following the Deva steps for curly hair, you shouldn&#x27;t be wrapping those gorgeous curls in a towel to begin with.  This is for scrunching out the water and getting it ready for the deva products.  If you start wrapping up your gorgeous curls, you&#x27;re going to end up with no curls on one side (since typically when wrapping, you twist your hair around your head 1 direction, pulling it straight on one side).  I usually scrunch out the water, clip up my hair lightly, get my make-up on, get dressed, add my Deva products, re-scrunch and go.</li>
    <li> This towel is WAY too small</li>
    <li> smaller than I thought. Barely covers all my hair.</li>
    <li> really good for curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> Love the towel! I have already ordered one as a gift for another curly girl :)</li>
    <li> this towel is a must when you use Deva Care products.....Great towel...</li>
    <li> Does not hold up well in the wash.</li>
    <li> Nothing incredible. It helps a little bit with frizz.</li>
    <li> I love this towel.  I just wish it was larger.  You cannot put your hair up in it but it soaks up water well.</li>
    <li> Great for curly and wavy hair.  I use the Deva shampoo and conditioner and it the towel just helps.</li>
    <li> Purchased with the three step system and towel. Great products!</li>
    <li> I have very curly, dry hair.  This towel reduces frizz and encourages natural curls.  I would recommend it to everyone - especially curly heads!</li>
    <li> This is not microfiber. I use microfiber towels around my kitchen and this towel is far closer to a fuzzy t-shirt. This towel is part of the DevaCurl &amp; Curly Girl hair routine. I&#x27;ve found that the towel, along with the hair products, has made a huge difference with my curls.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because it is pretty small. I have medium length hair and this is too small to do anything other than scrunch out excess water.</li>
    <li> This towel is very absorbent, and a nice material, but I&#x27;m not sure it is a miracle towel for curly hair.  My biggest complaint is the size -- it is the size of a small hand towel, and I can not fit all of my hair wrapped up in the towel at the same time.  My hair is medium length, and not super thick. It should be larger, then I would give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Not Big enough to wrap around my head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used a regular terry cloth towel on my natural curls and bought this at the suggestion of my stylist. I could not believe how great it works. Gently scrunching then wrapping around my head for a few minutes and my hair comes out equally as dry as with the terry towel yet it&#x27;s not all frizzed/dried out. I can apply product and my hair feels super soft. Definitely a must for curly haired girls. I do agree it&#x27;s a little small if you have hair shoulder length or longer, but it really grabs a lot of moisture for such a small towel. Also, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s in between a t-shirt and microfiber -- thicker and more textured than a t-shirt and thinner yet textured similar to microfiber. Finally, I wish it came in a darker color option. I used mine the day after a brunette hair coloring and stained it pink -- so beware of that.</li>
    <li> I was introducted to Deva Curl products a few months ago and have been hooked ever since.  Never knew my hair could look so good.</li>
    <li> I really like the deva towel, I have very thick and curly hair and the deva towel definitely soaks up the water, however, the towel its too small. Unlike a regular towel, the deva  towel is not large enough to wrap your hair up on top of your head. The towel has really helped with keeping the frizz under control and I am pleased with the overall results.</li>
    <li> I understand that microfiber absorbs much faster, but unless your hair is above your shoulder i guess, then this isn&#x27;t for you.  I use it for my daughter (3 head full of thick hair but smaller head of course) ... I bought a microfiber hair towel for myself from walmart after realizing the size was basically the size of a car rag.</li>
    <li> It does dry hair, I&#x27;ll give it that, but I had my frizz under control, used it two days in a row &amp; both days I had bad frizz. It actually took me a while to get the frizz under control again, even after I stopped using it. Maybe it depends on the curls you have, but it&#x27;s a no-go for me unfortunately. :(</li>
    <li> Just a towel nothing extra special about it.</li>
    <li> The size is a little bit small but it absorbs all the water and doesnt pull on my hair strands. Really good microfiber towel</li>
    <li> Absolutely yes its small but it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this towel is small enough that I can dry my hair fast and easy</li>
    <li> This towel is basically wash cloth size.</li>
    <li> It will be great for travel but I think an old t shirt works better! It could be a little bigger too,</li>
    <li> I began using this on recommendation of my curly hair salon. It reduces frizz and absorbs nicely. Hair usually takes a longer time to dry without it. I now have two. I did try using a microfiber cloth and the results were not the same.</li>
    <li> buyer beware it is what it states .. but it is tooooooooooo small to use the curlygurl method with even though this is what it is advertising itself with. I got this to use one my 11 year old and its too small for her head let alone an adult woman. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I actually really like this and I think it has made a difference with my curly hair but I would give it 5 stars if it was a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Too small for what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my hair after I wash it! Will recommend this products to others. I am glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I was completely disappointed with this product! Haven&#x27;t even used it. When I first saw this while purchasing my hair product, I was thrilled and couldn&#x27;t wait on it to arrive. I had big hopes of wrapping my hair in it while I dressed and applied make-up every morning. I was using an over-sized t-shirt to do the job, just as my curly hair stylist had shone me. Normal terry bath towels are a no-no with curly hair! Then it came in the mail and I opened it up. It&#x27;s not big enough to be more than a hand towel! I was expecting something somewhere between the size of a hand towel and a small bath towel. This thing wont wrap around my head and meet, much less overlap and tie up to hold my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you just want a soft hand towel.</li>
    <li> I love this little towel. It actually does suck moisture out but.... it&#x27;s a little small! By the time I&#x27;m done scrunching my hair, the towel is soaked and wish I had more towel to actually wrap my hair with it.  Overall it works</li>
    <li> The towel was soft and easy to wash and dry. I have used it and do not have any friz to my curls.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> I like this towel so well, I bought a second one! It really soaks up the water from my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it frizzy. I use it as my stylist recommended and scrunch my curls immediately after I shower or wash my hair. I will be purchasing one for my daughter as well. Good product.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would help alleviate my frizz issues, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I usually use the hair turban towels (turbie twists?). It would be more useful if you could actually wrap your hair in it (like the turbie twist things), but I guess that defeats the company&#x27;s marketing claim.</li>
    <li> I love Deva and I&#x27;m happy to support this product but I&#x27;m also cheap and would rather that I had just gone out and bought a regular microfiber towel. The logo is cute and all but not worth the price. Right after buying this product I saw the same thing being sold as a cloth for washing cars. Needless to say, the car towel was much cheaper.</li>
    <li> You can buy a similar sized microfiber towel in the home goods department of most discounts for 1/4 to 1/3 the price of this one. There is nothing uniquely Deva about it. The point is the good absorption so you can squeeze your hair dry and not rub it dry. Any microfiber kitchen towel will work the same.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with most of the Deva Curl line of products when I wore my hair longer and curly. Partly this was my own fault, I did not get a ruler out to do measurements on it. It was very costly when one considers that it is absolutely tiny, extremely thin, and because of the extremely small size/thickness it was nearly useless for sopping up water from my hair. I had long, porous, color treated hair and this towel was a waste of money entirely. I ended up having better luck with the much-maligned bath towel, when I purchased one that was sheared on one side to a velvety surface that didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rough up&amp;#34; my hair at all. One can also use a cut-open cotton knit tee shirt, per the Curly Girl book recommendation. Unless you have money to burn, I&#x27;d pass this one by. Even a run of the mill microfiber all-purpose drying cloth like a Sham-Wow would be better for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I have natrually 3b, 3c, and 4a frizzy curly hair that takes 3-4 hours to dry. This is the perfect size to scrunch out the access moisture and give curl definition. It took less than half of the time it would take to regularly dry! Didnt make my hair frizzy either! Shipping came earlier than expected! very happy!</li>
    <li> Wish it was bigger love!</li>
    <li> Wish it was a tiny bit larger, but it works really well. Leaves my hair in perfect curls.</li>
    <li> So, so much better than any other microfiber towel for hair!!</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t cause my curls to frizz, keeps moisture locked in. I use this as a wrap around my curls after showering, I simply bend my head, pat dry (in an upwards motion) a bit, and then tie around my head, flip my hair back, and tie the other ends of the towel on top of my head, leaving the ends of my curls outside of the towel, so I am mostly drying the roots of my hair which always take the longest to air dry. I definitely recommend for curly girls!</li>
    <li> It works like it&#x27;s supposed to but I was expecting it to be a lot larger than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not wrap fully around my head so I had to use a different microfiber towel I had to do the job.</li>
    <li> I love my Devacurl towel, but more importantly my curls appreciates it!! Thanks 💚</li>
    <li> Great towel for natural hair, but is a bit small.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small to be a towel ... Very disappointed ..</li>
    <li> This is a must have. A fellow curly girl recommended it, and  said she can&#x27;t do without it and now neither can I. No frizz . No static.</li>
    <li> Great towel but too small to use on your hair. If it was bigger I&#x27;d give it 4 stars. Make bigger!</li>
    <li> This towel is good for scrunching out excess water from hair, but it is tiny.  It is only the size of a dishtowel.  You cannot wrap your hair up in it.</li>
    <li> I see what people were expecting and that is probably why they rate this towel so low.  It is not designed to be as big as a body towel or the like, it is specifically designed for scruching excess water and not wrapping your entire head in it.  There fore it actually is designed and works better than a full size heavy body towel.  You have more control on how you are drying your hair which is a big plus for us curly girls.  It does not cause frizz like microfiber or the regular bath towel which is also what it was designed for.  The $12 price is still a drop in the bucket compared to what we \\&quot;curlinistas\\&quot; have spent on our journey to the perfect curls!  Its starts off with how you wash then DRY your hair.  That sets the foundation and this towel does a good job of that.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this special towel when I use the Deva Products in my hair and when I don&#x27;t.  (I sometimes like the lather of a real shampoo).  It definitely keeps the frizz away and helps to define my curls.  It is not your run of the mill towel or Microfiber towel.  I highly recommend the towel and ALL of the Deva products.  I bought the Travel Kit so I could try everything (plus I travel a lot) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. FINALLY.. products for us curly haired girls.  WOO HOO!!</li>
    <li> This towel made a difference with my curly hair-- it helped contain the frizzy hair!!  My curls are looking much better.</li>
    <li> This towel is great. It&#x27;s super absorbent and it removes just enough water to keep my hair moist. But, it is very small. It&#x27;s 22.5 x 14.5 in. It just needs to be bigger. It absorbs water quickly and I would assume that if you hair is longer than mine, 4in. then it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Shipping and handling excellent towel size was a disappointment not big enough for an adult size head.</li>
    <li> This took awhile for me to love but I really do love it now.  It works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to and it works with my hair.</li>
    <li> The towel does what is says it will do--reduce frizz for us curly haired people. But....it is way too small. If you are just scrunching, putting product in and going or diffusing your hair, it&#x27;s probably OK. But if you want to scrunch your hair, then wrap it up so you can do your make-up and then do your hair, it won&#x27;t work. I have long hair, to the middle of my back so I wrap it up best I can and then use hair clips to clip towel to hair so it stays in place. I like to do make up then finish with my hair. I have considered buying another one and sewing them together. Scrunching and using the Deva Curl Arc Angel gel I have had great results. My hair would be considered a wavy curl. Must also say for $13 it&#x27;s pricey. Really only worth $5 but at least it has reduce the frizz on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, to my mid back, and this towel is the size of a dish towel.  What am I suppose to do with that???</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT FOR CURLY HAIR!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and mistakenly washed them both with other clothing. They&#x27;re like their very own lint brushes so my towels were instantly covered in black and blue lint (the colors of my other towels). Another reviewer recommended that I just use a lint brush to remove it and we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my next two towels, I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances and I wash and dry them separately as the manufacturer recommends. So far, so good. I still find that the towels have a particular static cling...reminding me of my dust grabbing microfiber rags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towels are small because you&#x27;re not supposed to be squeezing all your hair at once but instead squeezing it in sections. While on vacation, I ran out of towels (all towels) period in my hotel room and I used a man&#x27;s undershirt (Hanes) on my hair and I really noticed the difference with my hair. I hope I notice the difference using these Devacurl towels soon.</li>
    <li> My hair is just prone to frizz. This towel works for me. The fiber is very soft, unlike any towel fabric. I can actually use it to get excess water out of my wet hair, gently of course, and that seems to minimize my frizz. I love it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so soft! I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this towel cuz the stylist says its a great way to dry your hair without causing frizz from a regular towel.  Honestly I can&#x27;t tell the difference and for the most part I forget to use the darn little thing.  Speaking of little, I like to wrap my hair up in a towel when I get out of the shower and this towel is too little for that.  So if you are a dab hair and go kinda curly girl, then give it a try.  It just may work.</li>
    <li> Too small for longer hair. It does well with absorbing excess water, but needs to be a bit larger to fully do the job.</li>
    <li> Really helpful in drying curly hair without causing frizz! This is my second one.  It also helps to scrunch the gel and set the curls.</li>
    <li> This towel is a perfect size.  I love the idea of the micro towel which works very well to absorb the excess water.</li>
    <li> Because of the (small) size of this towel, it gets sopping wet quick but, If you have really short hair, I suppose it would be ok. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to wrap your hair up in this towel either. Way to small. It&#x27;s about the size of a kitchen dish towel (it&#x27;s actually over an inch SHORTER than one of my kitchen towels).</li>
    <li> Works great at taking a bulk of the water from my hair without making it frizzy.</li>
    <li> I like the material of the towel and the way it dries my hair.  I was expecting a little bit larger towel as this one is about the size of a hand towel.  If it were a little larger I would give it 5 stars.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really small towel for anyone with significant hair.</li>
    <li> This towel has made a big difference with my curly hair since apparently towel drying your hair with a normal towel can cause frizzing. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Sorry I wasted my money on this. Just got a little too caught up in my excitement about the Devacurl line - and I really LOVE my new found curls by the way! However, this is really something you could just buy at the dollar store. And it&#x27;s way too small. Save your cash.</li>
    <li> Towel works as it should, not taking away too much moisture. I just wish it were a little bit bigger.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair this is the BEST towel to use !!! I love it!</li>
    <li> This towel is great for sucking the extra water from your hair, without over ruffling the surface of the hair.  I do wish it was a little bigger, but it seems to do the job with the size it is.</li>
    <li> Never thought a towel would make a difference but it does!!!! This towel dries my curls super fast! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> i found it too small and a little uncomfortable, personally i like to get out of the shower and wrap up my hair or dry it up with the towel and this specific towel is very small. I only had trouble with the size, other than that it fabulous!</li>
    <li> Made a big difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much water it can pull from the hair.  One big pat down and my hair is ready to set or style.  Wow!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t love.....picks up color from week old hair dye....boooo</li>
    <li> Only problem is that this towel is too *small! They need to make a larger one. Other than it being too small, it is a nice towel. Very absorbent.</li>
    <li> As described. Wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Too small for use as a towel to wrap.</li>
    <li> it almost wraps around my head, but not quite ... will be adding some fabric to make it a little bigger to wear as a turban while hair dries</li>
    <li> My sister was excited to receive her gift and loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this along with the DevaCurl products. Makes my hair look great! Never thought my curls could look so good.</li>
    <li> Only gave the towel 4 stars because of  the size.&lt;br /&gt;Love the towel...just a little small for my liking.&lt;br /&gt;Does go nicely with the set.</li>
    <li> My son had super curly hair and this product has helped us finally control them.  He has autism and this was easy to use and he is able to do it himself.  He loves that he can take care of his hair without mom fussing over him.</li>
    <li> I thought the DevaCurl Deva Towel was going to be bigger. That was my own fault for not reading the dimensions. However the first (and last) time I used it I dried my hair and was curious as to what were the black spots all over the towel and on my hands. The black ink of the logo on the towel ran and was everywhere! Not impressed with this product at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping I could plop with it, but the towel is too small to plop.  I use it to scrunch &amp; plop with a tshirt now</li>
    <li> very small. Not possible to wrap around head.</li>
</ol>
