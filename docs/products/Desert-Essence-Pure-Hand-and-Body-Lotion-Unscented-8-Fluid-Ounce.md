      <li>Pretty good lotion</li>
      <li>Smell is very mild even though it says unscented, its an enjoyable scent.  </li>
      <li>It is important to treat our bodies well so that they function better.</li>
      <li>The price is great too for a natural lotion with no chemicals.</li>
      <li>Most children&#x27;s products that are fragrance free, contain aloe.</li>
      <li>It is also fragrance free and that is what my hospital, a fragrance-free zone, requires.  </li>
      <li>And I have to have gluten free and unscented.  </li>
      <li>This Desert Essence product used to be called \\&quot;Unscented Hand and Body Lotion,\\&quot; and is now called \\&quot;Fragrance Free Hand and Body Lotion.\\</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly and my skin stays moist.</li>
      <li>Very safe for sensitive skin and works well.</li>
      <li>This is a great product that soothes dry skin without the irritation of a fragrance.</li>
      <li>The lotion does a very nice job mosterizing dry skin.</li>
      <li>Love Desert Essence products, not only Organic, but most are Gluten Free as well.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that it is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>It is not oily and is easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>Their ingredients did not get absorbed into my skin</li>
      <li>Even though no fragrance is added, it of course does have a slight scent, which is a pleasant one.</li>
      <li>I assume the new product might be not as good as the old formula, but still it looks quite decent without those methy*</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different vegan, cruelty-free lotions--and non-vegan lotions for that matter--that I did not like because of their oily composition.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I have to admit I thought it was a bit greasy</li>
      <li>No greasy feeling, just soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite natural, unscented lotion.  </li>
      <li>I wanted non-greasy, no smell, well absorbing lotion and that is exactly what I got.</li>
      <li>Absorbs nicely, does not leave a greasy feel, and no powerful fragrance</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m \\&quot;back to the drawing board\\&quot; looking for a new, truly unscented lotion, as I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again (or recommending it as I&#x27;ve done many times).</li>
      <li>we use the whole line of body wash, shampoo and lotion.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>but wish it was available in larger size.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite lotions because of the simple ingredients, and being sensitive to smells</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and preferr to use as many natural products as possible.</li>
      <li>This product by Desert Essence on the other hand is fantastic, and a lotion that I will be using for life.</li>
      <li>I maybe could live with that, but the new ingredient(s) cause some stinging/burning on my skin as I apply it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bit confused by one reviewer saying hers had changed because I have the more recent product labeled Fragrance Free</li>
      <li>Although at first I thought that this unscented product did in fact have a sent, I found that the scent was of the actual ingredients themselves, and was undetectable when applied to my skin.</li>
      <li>This is a very emollient lotion that keeps my skin very hydrated all day long.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I don&#x27;t have an old tube to compare ingredients, but instead of being unscented (my entire reason for choosing this product the first time), it now has a lemony scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m generally very sensitive to strong scents and have to be careful what I wear or I&#x27;ll develop a migraine in no time flat.  </li>
      <li>This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really works for me.  </li>
      <li>and so far I like it.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, I&#x27;m even sensitive to the finish on some thread and have had to throw away clothing because the seams give me a rash.  </li>
      <li>so perhaps she is just sensitive to one ingredient changed.</li>
      <li>It is organic, which makes me feel good about using it and the price is less expensive than other non-organic products, and the product is better.  </li>
      <li>I use it after I shower on my whole body, when my hands are dry after frequent hand washing, keep it by my bedside, in the bathroom and the kitchen.  </li>
      <li>I am also thankful that it is completely organic, gluten free, wheat free, with nothing artificial in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>This is the only hand and body lotion I have found that actually has a reasonable number of ingredients that are all natural.  </li>
      <li>but as soon as I cut down the amount I use the residue gets absorbed into the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you really have dry skin, try something else.</li>
      <li>I keep a tube on my desk and can use my computer quickly after using the lotion without getting everything messy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I live is a very dry climate and use it daily.</li>
      <li>Ive already used a huge amount in just a few weeks if less.</li>

<li> This still has a bit of a fresh scent from the natural ingredients, but no overpowering perfumey smells to make me sick.  </li>
<li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> this lotion has a thicker consistency than the other body lotions from Desert Essence with the exception of the pumpkin handcream.  </li>
<li> (the ingredients do have a slight smell, but I don&#x27;t find it strong or unpleasant).</li>
<li> Definitely not an issue with this delicately scented lotion.</li>
<li> This is one of the few products that I am not allergic to.</li>
<li> sinensis (green tea) leaf extract*,&lt;br /&gt;SD alcohol 38-B*,&lt;br /&gt;glycerin</li>
<li> There are a few changes in the ingredients from the product description.</li>
<li> see they took away the radish root and honeysuckle flower extract, and added a few ingredients, like sodium *</li>
<li> There are very few selections</li>
<li> It&#x27;s alright, but a little thin &amp; watery for my tastes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been a great lotion but I was VERY disappointed to find they&#x27;ve added sodium benzoate to this lotion. I won&#x27;t buy this again ! April 2015</li>
    <li> this lotion has a thicker consistency than the other body lotions from Desert Essence with the exception of the pumpkin handcream.  I like the fact that it is dense and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use more of the product.  I suffer from eczema on my legs and when I apply this lotion within a matter of minutes the discomfort begins to fade away.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and naturalness of this product.  I do not like smelly creams the emit a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; long after it&#x27;s applied.  And this product, being fragrance free, is PERFECT.  And it moisturizes great too.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it!</li>
    <li> Pretty good lotion but wish it was available in larger size. Ive already used a huge amount in just a few weeks if less. I like that there are no chemicals and the lotion is on the thicker side.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  Very moisturizing.  I&#x27;m generally very sensitive to strong scents and have to be careful what I wear or I&#x27;ll develop a migraine in no time flat.  Definitely not an issue with this delicately scented lotion.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions because of the simple ingredients, and being sensitive to smells I love that they have the unscented version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different vegan, cruelty-free lotions--and non-vegan lotions for that matter--that I did not like because of their oily composition. Their ingredients did not get absorbed into my skin and I could feel the product washing off when I showered twenty-four hours later. This product by Desert Essence on the other hand is fantastic, and a lotion that I will be using for life. It is not oily and is easily absorbed into my skin. Although at first I thought that this unscented product did in fact have a sent, I found that the scent was of the actual ingredients themselves, and was undetectable when applied to my skin. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion.  It is really sheer and not at all oily.  It is the perfect hand cream.</li>
    <li> Aloe based instead of water. Great product!</li>
    <li> My son gets eczema when using products with fragrance or aloe on it. Most children&#x27;s products that are fragrance free, contain aloe. There are very few selections and I was so happy to find these. They work great for him....we use the whole line of body wash, shampoo and lotion.</li>
    <li> I love that this lotion is organic.  It is also fragrance free and that is what my hospital, a fragrance-free zone, requires.  Great lotion, non-greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand and body lotion I have found that actually has a reasonable number of ingredients that are all natural.  Love it!</li>
    <li> There are a few changes in the ingredients from the product description. I bought mine as of Jan 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ingredient list of my bottle:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe barbadensis leaf (aloe vera) juice*,&lt;br /&gt;butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*,&lt;br /&gt;camellia sinensis (green tea) leaf extract*,&lt;br /&gt;SD alcohol 38-B*,&lt;br /&gt;glycerin (palm),&lt;br /&gt;stearic acid (coconut),&lt;br /&gt;cetyl alcohol (coconut),&lt;br /&gt;hydrolyzed jojoba esters,&lt;br /&gt;Gluconolactone,&lt;br /&gt;helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil,&lt;br /&gt;simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*,&lt;br /&gt;jojoba esters,&lt;br /&gt;tocopherol (vitamin E),&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Phytate,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Benzoate,&lt;br /&gt;Water(Aqua)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see they took away the radish root and honeysuckle flower extract, and added a few ingredients, like sodium ***. I assume the new product might be not as good as the old formula, but still it looks quite decent without those methy***, ***paraben. And it has very faint, if any, scent. I just got the product and try it out and so far I like it. A bit oily</li>
    <li> This is a great product that soothes dry skin without the irritation of a fragrance. Anyone with allergies will appreciate this product.</li>
    <li> This Desert Essence product used to be called \\&quot;Unscented Hand and Body Lotion,\\&quot; and is now called \\&quot;Fragrance Free Hand and Body Lotion.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have an old tube to compare ingredients, but instead of being unscented (my entire reason for choosing this product the first time), it now has a lemony scent. I maybe could live with that, but the new ingredient(s) cause some stinging/burning on my skin as I apply it. So I&#x27;m \\&quot;back to the drawing board\\&quot; looking for a new, truly unscented lotion, as I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again (or recommending it as I&#x27;ve done many times). Don&#x27;t you just hate it when companies change product ingredients for products you like? Me too...</li>
    <li> Great lotion from a great company.  Smell is very mild even though it says unscented, its an enjoyable scent.  The lotion is quite good and lasts for sometime.  Very safe for sensitive skin and works well. I would buy it again without hesitating.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good fragrance-free non-greasy vegan hand &amp; body lotion and this is it.  Absorbs nicely, does not leave a greasy feel, and no powerful fragrance (the ingredients do have a slight smell, but I don&#x27;t find it strong or unpleasant).</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and preferr to use as many natural products as possible. This is an organic product that acutally works on all your skin including your face. I just love it! No greasy feeling, just soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love Desert Essence products, not only Organic, but most are Gluten Free as well. The fragrance free lotion smells nice, not like chemicals.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this wonderful product. I wanted non-greasy, no smell, well absorbing lotion and that is exactly what I got. I am also thankful that it is completely organic, gluten free, wheat free, with nothing artificial in the ingredients. We often think of allergy intolerances when it comes to food but we never equate that same thought to lotions, soaps, make-up etc... It is important to treat our bodies well so that they function better. I use this product every day!!!</li>
    <li> I did not care for this lotion it seems to just sit on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy and smooth.  It does have a pleasant, light smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my chemical sensitivities.  It has sodium benzoate as a preservative which is unfortunate but all in all it&#x27;s good quality product.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite natural, unscented lotion.  This still has a bit of a fresh scent from the natural ingredients, but no overpowering perfumey smells to make me sick.  This is a very emollient lotion that keeps my skin very hydrated all day long.  The price is great too for a natural lotion with no chemicals.</li>
    <li> Good creme, nice smell, good price, good handling by the distributor, got it in time, very satisfied, would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Provides deep relief for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I like the even creaminess and moisture. It goes on smoothly and evenly and my skin stays moist. It is organic, which makes me feel good about using it and the price is less expensive than other non-organic products, and the product is better.  I have been using this for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product and value.</li>
    <li> If you really have dry skin, try something else. Otherwise I like that it&#x27;s organic and unscented and it is pleasant to use.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, I&#x27;m even sensitive to the finish on some thread and have had to throw away clothing because the seams give me a rash.  And I have to have gluten free and unscented.  This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really works for me.  It isn&#x27;t too sticky and it rubs in well. I keep a tube on my desk and can use my computer quickly after using the lotion without getting everything messy. I use it after I shower on my whole body, when my hands are dry after frequent hand washing, keep it by my bedside, in the bathroom and the kitchen.  It does add the moisture my dry skin needs without irritation and I&#x27;d be lost without it. I&#x27;m a bit confused by one reviewer saying hers had changed because I have the more recent product labeled Fragrance Free and there is no fragrance odor I can detect and it doesn&#x27;t irritate so perhaps she is just sensitive to one ingredient changed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, but a little thin &amp; watery for my tastes.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion. I have dry skin and this works great and it is not greasy and absorbs fantastically. I really like the fact that it is fragrance free. This is one of the few products that I am not allergic to.</li>
    <li> The lotion does a very nice job mosterizing dry skin. I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and face. It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way. The first time I used it I have to admit I thought it was a bit greasy but as soon as I cut down the amount I use the residue gets absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a slight ordor due to the natural ingredients but not overpowering and it&#x27;s a rather pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and fragrance free lotion I have found. I live is a very dry climate and use it daily. Even though no fragrance is added, it of course does have a slight scent, which is a pleasant one.</li>
    <li> Good product,not oilly.</li>
