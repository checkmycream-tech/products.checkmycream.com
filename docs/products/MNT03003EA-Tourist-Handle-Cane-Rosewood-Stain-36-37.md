      <li>Thanks!!</li>

      <li>Finish chipped in two places on the first day.</li>

      <li>I liked that I could see the grain on my old cane, and this one is suppose to be solid wood, but almost looks like a hard plastic.  </li>
      <li>Old fashioned cane.  </li>
      <li>low cost,, fast shipping  </li>
      <li>And the rubber tip doesn&#x27;t look as big and strong as my old cane, but it appears to be sturdy and should last a long time if I don&#x27;t lose it.  </li>
      <li>Most mass produced canes use the same wood on the inside, and are stained on the outside to look like other wood.</li>
      <li>The only reason that my old one is being retired, is that the paint wore off of the handle.</li>
      <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I keep comparing it to my old cane.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Rosewood&amp;#34; is not the kind of wood that this cane is: that is merely the color of the paint they put on it.</li>
      <li>This cane is the same as my old one, and from the same supplier.</li>
      <li>I spoke with the company directly and their canes are made of either solid maple or solid ash.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> very strong cane.  Bought 2 to assist with walking.  It looks better than the industrial medical equipment and preforms as a medical device.</li>
    <li> It serves its purpose. The color is nice. It was easy to trim to the right length.</li>
    <li> It is not rosewood.  It is a white wood laminate with a vaguely rosewood colored paint finish.  Yes, like plywood in the center.  I know this because I bought the cane for the 1&amp;#34; diameter and solid wood, not the color or finish.  I sanded the cane down to bare wood in order to solar burn a Victorian pattern on it, then I stained and clear polyurethaned the finished result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who would ask, solar burning is done with a magnifying glass, the sun, and a welding helmet.  Not with a plug-in wood burning tool.  The burn is much deeper with a better color/scorch pattern and no indentations from the metal tool.  Nor does wood grain make the burn go askew because the magnifying glass never touches the surface being burnt.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a solid wood cane that isn&#x27;t like those aluminum canes, then this is the one for you.  It can be cut to the size you need, the quality is perfect, the dark stain is a great feature and it is light enough so that it doesn&#x27;t weigh me down.    Update: I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. I spoke with the company directly and their canes are made of either solid maple or solid ash. It is now 2015 and the cane still looks new. It has not cracked or even hinted at breaking and can handle my weight with no problem. I would buy another one in a heart beat. You can either pay more if you so choose or pay less for this beautiful solid wood cane.</li>
    <li> The finish on this cane looks and feels very cheap.  Most mass produced canes use the same wood on the inside, and are stained on the outside to look like other wood. In this case, it feels and looks like plastic laminate, rather than actual staining.  Still, it&#x27;s functional, works, and was packaged and shipped well.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and color is beautiful</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and price. I recommend the cane.  Best price of all hook canes that I have ever seen. Most places&lt;br /&gt;want 4 or 5 times as much.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Rosewood&amp;#34; is not the kind of wood that this cane is: that is merely the color of the paint they put on it. This cane was so light and flimsy feeling, I thought it might be plastic. I pulled off the rubber tip, and found that it is IS wood, but it is some sort of very light, soft wood, maybe mimosa or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will work for my purposes, but it is not a fine wooden piece or anything. It is just a cheap, painted cane.</li>
    <li> This cane is the same as my old one, and from the same supplier. It&#x27;s lasted over 3 years, and it&#x27;s light, and strong. The only reason that my old one is being retired, is that the paint wore off of the handle. Bear in mind, that I wash/sanitize it every time I do my hands. That&#x27;s a lot of wear. It did the job well, and that&#x27;s why I stuck with the same one. I do recommend this one.</li>
    <li> this cane is very  comfortable  to use the handle is perfectly shaped and easy to  hold. It is also very good looking.</li>
    <li> low cost,, fast shipping  i will recommend this product to friends..nice finish on cane and lite weight,, i will order again when i need a new one</li>
    <li> Old fashioned cane.  I cut it down for my grandson, and replaced the rubber tip.  He loves to play Doc Terminus from the Pete&#x27;s Dragon movie.  He went crazy for the cape, and cane and hat that I bought from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I inspect wood no plastic colored ast was wood .i hop nex time I have more information aboute the item</li>
    <li> We bought 2, and Mr. Martin uses his constantly. Other is on standby since it is too long for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> It said wood, Its not wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its made out of the same aluminum they make crutches out of. Its just painted to look like wood.&lt;br /&gt;Its not extendable, the box arrived in shoddy condition.&lt;br /&gt;As a disgusting rubber odor.&lt;br /&gt;Assuming your taller than 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; Do not bother with this, it will be too short for you.</li>
    <li> I have just received this cane.  It is a replacement the VA hospital gave me for one I lost.  It is lighter then my old one, but seems very sturdy.  I liked that I could see the grain on my old cane, and this one is suppose to be solid wood, but almost looks like a hard plastic.  I haven&#x27;t pulled the rubber end off yet to see if I can see the grain.  And the rubber tip doesn&#x27;t look as big and strong as my old cane, but it appears to be sturdy and should last a long time if I don&#x27;t lose it.  I didn&#x27;t shorten it yet, the length is a standard 36&amp;#34;, and though I&#x27;m not very tall it seems to work.  I only gave it 4 stars because I keep comparing it to my old cane.</li>
    <li> I had it cut to my size, and have been using it for two weeks now, and it&#x27;s great!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Got it for a Waldo costume. Looked great. Seems sturdy for someone that would need it for walking too.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted and at a great price.  Just as advertized.</li>
    <li> Nice, widely curved handle is very comfortable and supportive.    Love the color - BUT, I&#x27;m worried that it is only a veneer and that if it scratches or chips, the wood is a pale color underneath..    In any case, it&#x27;s a nice, comfortable and elegant cane for the money.</li>
    <li> Finish chipped in two places on the first day. Does not appear to be rosewood but is solid wood.</li>
    <li> Rosewood, any of the three major types found in the world, is an extremely hard, tough, and rather expensive wood.  The ad needs to specify, it is stained in a rosewood color, vice calling itself  cane Rosewood.  It is almost certainly made from a soft, cheap wood.  This is ok, just say what wood you are using.</li>
    <li> exactly as pictured very sturdy</li>
