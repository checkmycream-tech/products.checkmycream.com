### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best clipper iv owned.</li>
      <li>The best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>Excellent, proffessional grade clippers, at a great price.  </li>
      <li>One Great Price for the best machine you can buy to cut one hair.</li>
      <li>This item works great and in the end save me money and time.</li>
      <li>I am SO happy I got this clipper.  </li>
      <li>I cut my own hair now.</li>
      <li>Now these clippers are WAY more powerful and that is great!  </li>
      <li>If you prefer to cut your own hair then this is the one for you.</li>
      <li>I have to agree with everything I read about this guy, its in a league of its own.  </li>
      <li>Nice to have many blades to choose from for use without attachments.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very happy to have purchased something worth the value.  </li>
      <li>Very good professional hair clipper.</li>
      <li>Quieter than Wahl but does not cut better for the price.</li>
      <li>Buy it, ull love it, wont regret it.   </li>
      <li>I have been a cosmetologist for 32 years and was looking for a better set of clippers.</li>
      <li>These clippers are better than what my barber used.</li>
      <li>: A bit heavier than competitor choices, but acceptable for something that will see many years of use.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
      <li>Delivery was ok though</li>
      <li>Plus all accessories include, What more can you ask for</li>
      <li>I LOVE it</li>
      <li>I have had many cheap, disposable hair clippers over the years that I have tried to stretch their life span.  </li>
      <li>They do get pretty warm when using them.</li>
      <li>I Love my new set of Oster Clippers!!!</li>
      <li>Just witnessing how the blades work was enough to convince me that I had purchased a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
      <li>I still had a cheap pair to compare, and the Oster model clearly had a better design.  </li>
      <li>however, they get really hot!  </li>
      <li>The attachments that came with this particular kit are easy to use and appear to be built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is so much better than my old clippers (also Oster).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re well worth the money.</li>
      <li>also, you have to use trial and error (in my opinion as I am not a professional barber) on what number of blade to use, you have options which is nice, but the blade that came with mine doesn&#x27;t get the fine/short hairs very well at all</li>
      <li>If u cant handle the hot blades then go buy a fast feed with ur 76.</li>
      <li>These clippers really do get hot but they are quality that you can&#x27;t beat.  </li>
      <li>As professional barbers dont use this for the whole haircut the blade will get hot and may burn sensitive (baby) skin, pros however use two more clippers to do their work (oster fast feed and t finisher).</li>
      <li>Sturdy construction that appears designed for the occasional accident and easily replaceable blades.  </li>
      <li>Cuts hair very effectively.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Being a broke colllege student cutting college students hair the 76 is the best clipper money can buy.</li>
      <li>I finally got tired of searching for a good clipper and decided to go with what I perceived to be a more quality product and ended up choosing the Oster Classic 76.  </li>
      <li>They cut fine, but heat up way to fast, they are also too loud and sounds as if there is something loose inside.</li>
      <li>This is my second clippers I have owned, my first was a cheaper whal brand</li>
      <li>Nearly $300 a year for haircuts for ONE kid?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful, lasts and stay sharp forever.</li>
      <li>and now I cut my hair twice a month with no mess.  </li>
      <li>Unlike other clippers and their gaurds, these gaurds are long and not as user friendly, for me.</li>

    <li> Obliterates dense, thick, coarse hair in one pass. As professional barbers dont use this for the whole haircut the blade will get hot and may burn sensitive (baby) skin, pros however use two more clippers to do their work (oster fast feed and t finisher). Being a broke colllege student cutting college students hair the 76 is the best clipper money can buy. Tips from my hair cutting hobby went to the completion of my oster clipper set ( fast feed and t finisher) resulting in professional results.  Buy it, ull love it, wont regret it.   If u cant handle the hot blades then go buy a fast feed with ur 76.</li>
    <li> These clipper are heavy duty and maintainable. They are not loud. Everything was in this this package you will need to start using them.</li>
    <li> These clippers really do get hot but they are quality that you can&#x27;t beat.  I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I did my research, read a lot of reviews.  I have to agree with everything I read about this guy, its in a league of its own.  The best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.  I bought the vacuum attachments and now I cut my hair twice a month with no mess.  I LOVE it</li>
    <li> Quieter than Wahl but does not cut better for the price.</li>
    <li> Best clipper iv owned.</li>
    <li> Clippers were delivered on time and as described. I have been a cosmetologist for 32 years and was looking for a better set of clippers. I find that they are a bit heavy and bulky. They do get pretty warm when using them. Also I really am disappointed with the universal gaurds. Unlike other clippers and their gaurds, these gaurds are long and not as user friendly, for me.</li>
    <li> I Love my new set of Oster Clippers!!!</li>
    <li> One Great Price for the best machine you can buy to cut one hair. Plus all accessories include, What more can you ask for</li>
    <li> My husband uses it to give my son haircuts. When we realized it would cost $20 for a haircut for him every month or 2, we thought that was nuts.  Nearly $300 a year for haircuts for ONE kid? No way!</li>
    <li> If you prefer to cut your own hair then this is the one for you. It&#x27;s powerful, lasts and stay sharp forever.</li>
    <li> Excellent, proffessional grade clippers, at a great price.  Sturdy construction that appears designed for the occasional accident and easily replaceable blades.  Looks and feels like it was designed to last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> They cut fine, but heat up way to fast, they are also too loud and sounds as if there is something loose inside. Delivery was ok though</li>
    <li> These clippers are better than what my barber used. I cut my own hair now. I just shave it all off, and it takes less than 5 minutes with these clippers. One swipe will remove all of my hair without leaving stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing purchase. They paid for themselves within a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This is my second clippers I have owned, my first was a cheaper whal brand and I like it, but one of my boys has really thick hair and it would actually stop the clippers, but my other kids did just fine with it.  Now these clippers are WAY more powerful and that is great!  They go right through thick hair, no problem!  however, they get really hot!  also, you have to use trial and error (in my opinion as I am not a professional barber) on what number of blade to use, you have options which is nice, but the blade that came with mine doesn&#x27;t get the fine/short hairs very well at all, it doesn&#x27;t get close enough, so I had to purchase a different one.</li>
    <li> Very good professional hair clipper. May be a little heavy and a little large for for people with smaller hands.</li>
    <li> I have had many cheap, disposable hair clippers over the years that I have tried to stretch their life span.  I finally got tired of searching for a good clipper and decided to go with what I perceived to be a more quality product and ended up choosing the Oster Classic 76.  I could not be happier.  I expect these clippers will outlive me.  I still had a cheap pair to compare, and the Oster model clearly had a better design.  Just witnessing how the blades work was enough to convince me that I had purchased a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Solidly built with replaceable parts.&lt;br /&gt;  Cuts hair very effectively.&lt;br /&gt;  Nice to have many blades to choose from for use without attachments.&lt;br /&gt;  The attachments that came with this particular kit are easy to use and appear to be built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A bit heavier than competitor choices, but acceptable for something that will see many years of use.&lt;br /&gt;  Not really anything else that I could complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have purchased something worth the value.  Would recommend to anyone who&#x27;s tired of trying to get quality clippers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same clippers for over 25 years now and they finally started to fall apart. I am SO happy I got this clipper.  It is so much better than my old clippers (also Oster). Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I am sick of buying junky clippers at the stores and it won&#x27;t even cut through my sons and husbands thick thick hair. This item works great and in the end save me money and time.</li>
