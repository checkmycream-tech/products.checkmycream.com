      <li>I used to swear by all Sally Hansen products but not any more.</li>
      <li>Time to buy more, I guess...)</li>
      <li>I used this many years ago.</li>
      <li>(Except for this morning, I dropped the bottle after taking a picture of it and the top shattered off all over my kitchen floor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was immediately pleased by how shiny my nails were.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for more than a year now.</li>
      <li>I loved it at first.</li>
      <li>so I need strong and healthy nails.</li>
      <li>Cheap, available, glossy, effective.</li>
      <li>makes a great clear polish as well!</li>
      <li>I applied two coats before I spent 2 weeks abroad in Japan, and my nails were all flawless, except by the end it had started to peel off, and</li>
      <li>it chips and comes off way too easy</li>
      <li>My nails do not chip so easy when I use this</li>
      <li>It removes easily with just about any type of polish remover but stays without chipping on my nails even though I type, do dishes and garden.</li>

      <li>(there&#x27;s a fine dust that comes off your nails from the buffing).</li>
      <li>I feel I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; nails, but they are quick to split and break most days.</li>
      <li>when my nails grow a bit longer than I am comfortable with.</li>
      <li>I painted my nails on Saturday morning and they still look shiny and chip free today (Wednesday).</li>
      <li>Cheap, available, glossy, effective.ervation.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this polish.</li>
      <li>- I care about my polish lasting and this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>I use it under a manicure most of the time but even alone it gives such a nice glossy look.</li>
      <li>, good thing it was only $2..</li>
      <li>it also comes off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>The layer of polish will consistently come off a couple days after its application, and is quite easy to peel off manually when it does.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super shiny, super cheap and does exactly what I want.</li>
      <li>I need to be more consistent with applying it regularly to give it a better chance of hardening my nails, but it does help as a protectant.</li>
      <li>It always seems to come off the chipped parts of my nails, which is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be protecting!</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t get better when my doctor fixed my diet.</li>
      <li>and when I went to get my nails done professionally they ended up even weaker and more brittle.</li>
      <li>Best remedy for thin nails</li>
      <li>I use it as a bottom and top coat or just to wear it as a clear polish.  </li>
      <li>It peels right off, doesn&#x27;t harden, and isn&#x27;t even all that glossy unless you put on 2 coats.  </li>
      <li>was honestly looking for a different product with higher reviews (OPI&#x27;s strengthener)</li>
      <li>works well but have to put a new coat on daily to make my nails look good.</li>
      <li>You can buy the same buffer anywhere for less than 2 bucks and get perfect shiny nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It helps to strengthen my nails which in turn allows my  nails to grow long and very strong.  </li>
      <li>for the first two weeks (or two applications.</li>
      <li>You can use this when you apply your regular polish on top.</li>
      <li>It seems to peel first off the tips of my nails, which is what I wanted this product to protect..</li>
      <li>I bought this product after getting acrylics for the first time.</li>
      <li>If I apply another coat on top, it chips in larger pieces.</li>
      <li>even if I did, I don&#x27;t trust anyone who wants to clip off my cuticles!</li>
      <li>Thanks Sally Hansen!</li>
      <li>I know I was always aware of which of my friends</li>
      <li>Though my nails do not look any better, after just one day of wearing this, I could definitely tell the difference.</li>
      <li>the tiniest bit of splitting was evident.</li>
      <li>However, as soon as I arrived home, I brushed on two more coats, and</li>
      <li>I am an avid nail polish lover with over 500 bottles</li>
      <li>Despite having only applied 1 coat, my nails are still nearly as shiny and nice right now as they were Friday.</li>
      <li>My nails have grown long and strong!</li>
      <li>But it dried very fast, and it has stayed on for 3 days and maybe more!</li>
      <li>The gloss is high on this product, which for me was a big plus - like having shiny hair, I feel shiny nails look healthy, youthful, feminine, and pretty.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and clear without any hint of color.  </li>
      <li>I do have to agree, if you only use one coat, it will come off rather easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shipped quickly, and does exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in store and loved it. I have really thin nails that would not grow past my tips. Once I started using this product my nails are growing thick and strong without breaking off. It dries quick and is an amazing base coat. I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> i use to bite my nails constantly. and when I went to get my nails done professionally they ended up even weaker and more brittle. so I tried this. for the first two weeks (or two applications. I painted my nails once a week) there was no change. I then figured out that before each new application I have to completely remove all old polish and oils before I applied a new application. after I figured that out by the third week my nails were showing growth. they were slowly growing but firmer and harder. now I use this polish religiously. I will use it as a base polish and I will use it as a top coat if I add a colored polish. I also started adding the sally hansen vita surge growth gel. when I made this change my nails have become so strong that I cannot clip them myself. when my nails grow a bit longer than I am comfortable with. (I don&#x27;t like them too long incase of an accidental break) I would clip them down. now with regular clippers my nails are so hard at times that it is hard to clip straight across without feeling like my nails are bending back when I get the clipper half way across my nail. I now hold my finger as my husband cuts my nail across.&lt;br /&gt;beside the hardness of my nails when it comes to clipping. I really enjoy this polish. and I have been using it for two years. I added the growth gel one year ago.</li>
    <li> Decent clear polish. I use it to cover nail decals after applying them onto my polished nails but as every woman with NATURAL nails knows - it&#x27;s impossible to find a top coat that lasts as long as it&#x27;s advertised and there are better top coats available.</li>
    <li> This hardener is the best thing invented. I had terrible nails and had acrylic tips since high school. I thought there was no hope for me ever having nice nails without a trip to the salon. After doing some research on more expensive brands I picked this one up at a local drug store. Within days after using it my nails grew, a few days after that I noticed how thick and strong they were getting. I use it under a manicure most of the time but even alone it gives such a nice glossy look. I would definitely recommend this polish.</li>
    <li> Love the product cheaper than the stores. Works great, came in great condition. I will buy this product again and will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> When I was young, I used this product. Then I improved my diet and my nails became very good. I am 72. I began living by myself and let myself get malnutrition, and consequently, my nails begin to get soft as plain skin, break, split, peel, develop huge ridges, slow growing, and every other problem in the book. They didn&#x27;t get better when my doctor fixed my diet. I began using this product again and before the first bottle was gone, my nails were growing again and the only problem left was small ridges. I would recommend this product every day of the week.</li>
    <li> I used to buy only this nail polish to keep my nails strong.  It was great.  Recently I bought it and the product has been considerably cheapened.  It starts flaking and peeling the same day it&#x27;s put on.  I bought several bottles thinking I might have gotten a bad batch, but they were all the same.  And what&#x27;s the deal with the brush being 1/4 inch above the bottom so it&#x27;s impossible to use the whole tiny bottle.  I&#x27;m so disappointed in this company.  I won&#x27;t ever buy another one of their products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It doesn&#x27;t harden your nails and glossy nail polish is probably cheaper.  If you are bothered by splitting nails, the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that really works is Gorilla Glue.  Here&#x27;s how you should apply it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squirt a drop of Gorilla Glue onto a piece of wax paper--don&#x27;t squirt it directly onto your split nail, or you will end up gluing your nail to your finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a toothpick and apply the gorilla glue to the split in your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the glue has dried, cut your nail short, leaving as little of the split as you possibly can.  The remaining split with its spot of glue will grow out in due time and you can trim it off.</li>
    <li> Very good nail hardner</li>
    <li> Use as a base coat - 4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as a \\&quot;strengthener\\&quot; - 2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this a 3/5. It&#x27;s great for a base coat and doesn&#x27;t let my nails stain, but I specifically wanted a strengthener. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months. My nails are woefully weak from 20+ years of biting, so I am hoping continued use might help. I will update this review if I see an improvement.</li>
    <li> I have used this product off and on for several years now. I don&#x27;t know that it really hardens my nails (I use it inconsistently), but it does help protect them on a daily basis when I remember to apply it. It basically looks like a clear nail polish, but tends to chip less for me than regular polish and last longer. I need to be more consistent with applying it regularly to give it a better chance of hardening my nails, but it does help as a protectant. I purchased this product at my local store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my nails. They were soft, dry, and brittle. Whenever my nails started to get a little length to them, they would become very fragile and end up splitting off. I started using this a couple weeks ago and it&#x27;s awesome! I use it as a top/base coat when I color my nails or just by itself if I want plain nails. My nails have grown long and strong! I&#x27;m probably driving my boyfriend and co-workers crazy because I keep tapping my nails on things, I&#x27;m just so happy to have such strong nails :-)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive nail polish, but I don&#x27;t need to with this as a top coat! It seems to speed up the drying time on my nails (not as fast as those specifically designed to dry fast, but able to touch them within a minute or two). The shine seems to last a long time too. I painted my nails on Saturday morning and they still look shiny and chip free today (Wednesday). I also have never noticed any yellowing of the nail with this polish.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this nail hardener. :-) (Except for this morning, I dropped the bottle after taking a picture of it and the top shattered off all over my kitchen floor. :-( Time to buy more, I guess...)</li>
    <li> Have been using it for more than a year now. It makes your nail polish stay longer.</li>
    <li> Have used for years , very good product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hardener for years, for me the best. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and it arrived earlier then expected delivery. When I first put it on it was just like a clear coat. But it dried very fast, and it has stayed on for 3 days and maybe more!</li>
    <li> I used to swear by all Sally Hansen products but not any more.I started using them in the 80&#x27;s. I recently purchased a bottle of Hard as Nails hardener. My nails have always been very strong. I let them grow out very long and kept them natural. I bought this product hoping to prevent breakage and it completely ruined my nails. They started to break off and now they are all broken off and worse, they keep peeling. This product ruined my once beautiful nails and I will never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff used to be great, but now it is horrid.  It peels right off, doesn&#x27;t harden, and isn&#x27;t even all that glossy unless you put on 2 coats.  It doesn&#x27;t even last an entire day.  I will never be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> My nails grow fast and are naturally a bit soft and bendy. My nails would grow a decent amount, then snag, break, or just get so dirty and ragged and uneven that I would clip them super-close to avoid being embarrassed by them. I never had the money to go to a salon and even if I did, I don&#x27;t trust anyone who wants to clip off my cuticles! Nor did I want fake nails - they had always struck me as uncomfortable, unsanitary, a bit dangerous, and just too false-looking. So I had just figured that my nails would stay in their sorry state until I was old enough and bourgeois enough to afford a good-quality weekly manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I became single for the first time in 6 years, and found I wanted to pamper myself and do something to feel more feminine in a small and easy way. People notice nails - I know I was always aware of which of my friends had glossy, beautiful nails. I specifically went into the nail-hardener search looking for a product that would give me long, glossy, hard, natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was honestly looking for a different product with higher reviews (OPI&#x27;s strengthener) and after trying 3 different stores without success, I bought Sally Hansen&#x27;s Hard as Nails in Clear instead, out of sheer shopping exhaustion. It&#x27;s available everywhere and cost at least 5 dollars less than what I was looking for. At Target it cost less than 2 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a super cheap 4-sided nail buffer (also less than 2 bucks at Target). I wanted my nails to look as smooth and shiny as possible and I knew that progressive-sided buffers like this were the best first step. I once got roped into buying a 25 dollar buffer-and-moisturizer set from a mall kiosk salesman - what a crock! You can buy the same buffer anywhere for less than 2 bucks and get perfect shiny nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night I used the various sides of the nail buffer to sand down the ridges in my nails, buff, and shine all 10 nails. A note - sometimes it&#x27;s easier to hold the buffer still and move your nail over it instead, especially when doing your dominant hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I washed my hands (there&#x27;s a fine dust that comes off your nails from the buffing). I noticed that my nail tips were looking a bit yellow, so I soaked them in a strong solution of hydrogen peroxide, water, and lemon juice for about 5 minutes, until they had clearly bleached out to a shade much closer to white. I washed again and dried thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the moment of truth - I got the medicinal-looking little bottle out of its package and opened it. As I applied it, I was very happy with how easy it is to apply. It&#x27;s clear, so it&#x27;s tough to mess up, even if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am. I applied one coat to my nail and one coat to the underside of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff dries reasonably fast. I gave it 30 minutes or so on each hand before doing anything strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately pleased by how shiny my nails were. The gloss is high on this product, which for me was a big plus - like having shiny hair, I feel shiny nails look healthy, youthful, feminine, and pretty. It&#x27;s clear, so it&#x27;s understated, but it&#x27;s still obvious my nails have been cared for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was Friday night. This is Monday night, so I&#x27;ve had it on about 72 hours. I had a big 3 days that involved a trip to an amusement park, a day-trip to Washington DC, and a day&#x27;s work as a nanny. Despite having only applied 1 coat, my nails are still nearly as shiny and nice right now as they were Friday. After 3 days of being rough with my hands, none of my nails have chipped, torn, cracked, split, or peeled in the last 3 days, even though they are all at an advanced stage of growth. They are long and shiny and glorious, and they definitely don&#x27;t bend anywhere near as much as they did - they&#x27;re positively hard, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert and a believer. If you&#x27;re interested in a glossy, hard nail that lasts long enough to grow out, I recommend Hard as Nails without reservation. Cheap, available, glossy, effective.ervation. Cheap, available, glossy, effective.</li>
    <li> I use this as a top coat to harden my nails and lengthen my manicure, as was recommended by a manicurist, Best Top Coat Ever, wish I would have figured this out years ago!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for for 3 years as a base/top coat for my nail polish. It is hands down the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Part of why my polish chipped was because my nails bent, and this fixes that problem. Even though I change my polish up every few days, I never have a chip unless I&#x27;m really tough on my hands. It&#x27;s super shiny, super cheap and does exactly what I want. I love how glossy it looks over my polish!</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting, it was a little bigger than what I thought. But it does its job perfectly</li>
    <li> Had used this product for years....works well but have to put a new coat on daily to make my nails look good.</li>
    <li> I loved it at first. But then it seemed to get a little thick n harder to spread n to get smooth. Also as it got thick it took longer to dry n i could scratch it off when it was supose to be dry. I feel it does harden and that&#x27;s what I love about it. This is my second Sally Hansen product that I have bought that has gotten thick. I also think this product may be the reason my nail polish would come off in sheets when used as a basecoat. I have mixed feelings about this product. But the price is great which makes it disposable without hurting your wallet. So its ok even if I&#x27;m only able to get usage of about only half the bottle.</li>
    <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t last a day.....it chips and comes off way too easy.......I don&#x27;t want to reapply nail polish in the middle of the day! Why does it not last through hand washings? I hate it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended that I use it as a base and top coat for my polish.  I was a little skeptical as I felt I had the best base and top coat already (and this doesn&#x27;t state base or top coat on the label).  I have painted my nails 9 days ago and they have yet to chip.  I don&#x27;t care about my natural nails being long - I care about my polish lasting and this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> This product works okay, it is more like a base coat than a nail hardener. I feel like I would need to put on 5 coats to get the hardener effect that I am going for especially having pretty brittle nails. I like to apply this product under my base coat just for added protection against chipping my manicure and ripping a nail.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much.  It provides a great covering for my nails.  My nails do not chip so easy when I use this</li>
    <li> I needed a Hard nail clear enamel. You can use this when you apply your regular polish on top. I remember this back in the late 1960-1980. Excellent to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was only $2. My natural nails are, very thin, brittle, grow out misshapen and are just flat out embarrassing so I got this in a very last ditch effort to fix my nails before I just cave and get acrylics. Well this &#x27;hardener&#x27; is the worst!  It&#x27;s so thin that it peeled right off my nails..  It seems to peel first off the tips of my nails, which is what I wanted this product to protect..&lt;br /&gt;Two of my nails were razor thin and even tore right off while using this product. Now my nails look even more misshapen and awkward.&lt;br /&gt;It did not harden my nails any, it doesn&#x27;t even like to stay on my nails, good thing it was only $2..</li>
    <li> If I remember to use it, it works well.</li>
    <li> This polish is the absolute worst! It take forever to dry and is very sticky. It didnt harden anything! It&#x27;s also easy to peel off! Save your money and invest in opi or essie!</li>
    <li> I have used Sally Hansen nail hardener products for years and have found them to be great. My nails always do well with them and the polish stays on really well.</li>
    <li> In an effort to put a stop my nail-biting routine, I decided to apply some clear nail polish to my fingernails every once in a while. While the polish does its job well (it doesn&#x27;t taste awful but reminds me that I shouldn&#x27;t bite my nails :P) it also comes off pretty easily. The layer of polish will consistently come off a couple days after its application, and is quite easy to peel off manually when it does. I suppose it would probably last longer when applied over another layer of nail polish, but still.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other clear polishes for top coats, and keep coming back. This is the best!!! I use it for both the base coat &amp; top coat. I&#x27;ve used a few/several coats it to keep thick (I mean thick!!) nails stickers on for 5 days! It shouldn&#x27;t have been able to for those dumb things, but it did it!!! I&#x27;m always impressed with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Ladies - Sally Hansen Hard as Nails is product I have used for years.  You will not be disappointed.  Just use it as your base coat, let it slightly dry before using your favorite nail polish.  Your nails will be stronger, longer and admired. I hope this information has been helpful to you.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! best ive used for hardening your nails...makes a great clear polish as well! Thanks amazon for always having great prices :)</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another one of my nail strengtheners. I&#x27;d hoped it would help me grow out my nails but it&#x27;s so brittle it chips and peels at the slightest touch. It always seems to come off the chipped parts of my nails, which is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be protecting! I&#x27;ll have to go buy a different brand if I ever want my nails to grow out.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for well over 20 years and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I don&#x27;t use it to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; my nails, as such, but to help me repair them.  When they start to split below the nail line I use this liberally to &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; the split so that they nail can grow out instead of ripping off.  It works great.  You have to apply it about once a week to keep the split sealed as it does wear off a little, but it does work.  And, of course, it makes your nails look great is you use is as regular clear nail polish.  The fact that it takes a little longer to dry is actually GOOD as it shows that the protection given to your nail is stronger than regular &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; nail polish.  Try it, you will like it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after getting acrylics for the first time. When I got them taken off, my nails were ruined. As a last ditch effort before going to get my nails done again, this product was referred to me by a friend and I am so impressed. Though my nails do not look any better, after just one day of wearing this, I could definitely tell the difference. My nails are so much stronger, and I am not worried about them constantly breaking until the damage from the acrylics is gone.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  Yes, it seems silly for such a low cost item to be a gift, but she couldn&#x27;t find it locally and it was her birthday.  She swears by it, and has been very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was 12 years old and swear by it.  It dries quickly and clear without any hint of color.  It helps to strengthen my nails which in turn allows my  nails to grow long and very strong.  I use it as a bottom and top coat or just to wear it as a clear polish.  It removes easily with just about any type of polish remover but stays without chipping on my nails even though I type, do dishes and garden.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. I know this keeps getting a lot of bad reviews, but it&#x27;s been a fantastic product for me. I do have to agree, if you only use one coat, it will come off rather easily. However, I&#x27;ve been slathering this on, and it works wonders. I feel I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; nails, but they are quick to split and break most days. I&#x27;m in food service, so I can&#x27;t have any polish, technically, but I want my nails to be longer, so I use it since it&#x27;s clear. It&#x27;s been wonderful, even with all the handwashing. I applied two coats before I spent 2 weeks abroad in Japan, and my nails were all flawless, except by the end it had started to peel off, and the tiniest bit of splitting was evident. However, as soon as I arrived home, I brushed on two more coats, and no fuss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may not be for everyone, but bottom line it&#x27;s saved my nails, no questions asked. Besides that, it&#x27;s a total value for under $4 a jar. I&#x27;m usually fond of higher-end brands, but I would MUCH rather get two of these for the price of one bottle of essie or OPI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re consistent with its application, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Nail hardeners don&#x27;t always work some really suck and some just leave your nails the same. although Sally Hansen hard as nails did help my nails a little, but i  wouldn&#x27;t consider it the best.</li>
    <li> My nails are always brittle and weak, they break so much. I am an avid nail polish lover with over 500 bottles so I need strong and healthy nails. I am amazed at how well my nails are now because of using this! Thanks Sally Hansen!</li>
    <li> Best remedy for thin nails</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t smooth enough for a standalone polish. as a base layer it probably works fine</li>
    <li> I log like this. It makes my nails stronger and grow faster. It is also really good at saving my nails from breaking. I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> I used this many years ago. Couple of months ago my nails had gotten to be a good lengh and wanted them to stay that way till my daughters wedding. So I started using it. With in a few weeks all my nails broke off, are split, cracked and in horrible shape.  It had to be this product cause I have never had this problem before using this product. Now I have no nails, nothing to file they are so short. Must have changed the formula, was so disapointed.</li>
    <li> Works for stronger nails A++</li>
    <li> Always use this. Works vet well.</li>
    <li> My nails still split. Wish there was something harder that would protect them better. I make greeting cards so don&#x27;t do hard labor.</li>
    <li> In just a few days my nails have grown and gotten extremely health and hard. So happy with this product. I would recommend it to anyone. Purchsing another one for my mom! Great great stuff</li>
    <li> This product chips off within hours after applying it. I would like to know why, but never find any suggestions from the company or others who see to like it. If I apply another coat on top, it chips in larger pieces. If I remove it and start over I dry out my nails more and start another round of cracking, pealing fingernails.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money.</li>
