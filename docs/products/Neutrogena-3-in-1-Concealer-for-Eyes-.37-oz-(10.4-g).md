### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely wonderful!!</li>
      <li>I have been on a quest to find the perfect concealer, and my quest was fulfilled when I tried this concealer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is very good.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>It works amazing.  </li>
      <li>A good concealer needs to sit on top of the skin to mask discoloration.   </li>
      <li>But for now, this is my FAVORITE concealer! :)</li>
      <li>It has adequate SPF, but that is all it is good for.</li>
      <li>Love this concealer, I&#x27;ve worn this on 10 hour days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this on amazon.</li>
      <li>It makes a better foundation than concealor.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite eye concealer, and I used it for years.</li>
      <li>Worth it ladies!!</li>
      <li>Strong fragrance.  </li>
      <li>so it works fine for me.  </li>
      <li>This product with additional concealer over it looked cakey and emphasized the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I use the light.</li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as some others I have used.  </li>
      <li>Since it is absorbed into the skin very quickly, the concealing effect is short-lived, maybe an hour or so.</li>
      <li>, it works great on the fine lines, doesn&#x27;t get cakey or granulated with time, lasts the whole day, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and blends easily with its smooth hydrating</li>
      <li>It works really well and does what it suppose to...CONCEAL!!</li>
      <li>This is amazing stuff and the only concealer I&#x27;ll ever consider using.</li>
      <li>This one wins by a mile.</li>
      <li>so when you list things you need to be more complete in the description.</li>
      <li>Maybe that is why it is so easily absorbed?)</li>
      <li>Because I wanted to believe I could still use the product in some way, I tried using it as a moisturizer/SPF, and applying a \\&quot;good concealer\\&quot; to select places under the eye that are the darkest, hoping to achieve an overall natural look.</li>
      <li>Only one came.&lt;br /&gt;Uts is very light.</li>
      <li>I said, I bought and used this every day for years, and I know exactly how it should feel, look, smell, etc...</li>
      <li>It does begin to wear off after about 4 hours, and it gives me a chance to wash my face again, but I give it 4 stars since I&#x27;ve been on the market for a longer lasting one(with more color options) for a couple years.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well for all day shadow.  </li>
      <li>but it does absolutely nothing to conceal any blemishes around the eye.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much for coverage</li>
      <li>But I really don&#x27;t need much coverage</li>
      <li>It covers both really well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of trying the \\&quot;best seller\\&quot; concealers out there, they weren&#x27;t working for me, and I guess it makes sense since each person is different from the others.</li>
      <li>This product works fairly well (especially when you consider the lower price compared to other concealers).  </li>
      <li>pat under eyes in a triangle shape, beginning right under the eye and ending right next to the nostril.</li>
      <li>assumed that these tubes were tampered with, thinned, or quite possibly not the true Neutrogena product at all...</li>
      <li>The coverage is decent.</li>
      <li>I think the effect will be better using two or three different products instead of this poorly-designed attempt at using only one.  </li>
      <li>Rather than using a single product to do all three jobs, I recommend using an eye cream with mineral SPF first, then applying a high quality concealer on top of it to cover dark under eye circles after the cream has moisturized the eye area.</li>
      <li>For those mornings when you havent really had your coffee, covering up those dark circles under your eyes is important, makes the rest of your makeup complete.</li>
      <li>A great concealer for under and around the eyes, especially for dark circles due to allergies.</li>
      <li>This product is a great disappointment.  </li>
      <li>I have combination oily skin that tends to break out frequently</li>
      <li>I had to apply my old concealer over it.</li>
      <li>covers well, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much.</li>
      <li>The product photo clearly displays TWO tubes, however, only one was shipped so I paid TWICE what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>old and have tried several concealers over the years.</li>
      <li>should have sent this back for a refund but was too busy.</li>
      <li>have a problem with severe dark circles under my eyes, and this concealer covers them very well</li>

    <li> Threw it away after a few uses.  It streaks after it has been on for a while.</li>
    <li> For those mornings when you havent really had your coffee, covering up those dark circles under your eyes is important, makes the rest of your makeup complete. It works really well and does what it suppose to...CONCEAL!! Worth it ladies!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this on amazon. I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for about 3 years now, and it has always cost upwards of 10 bucks or so. I like that not only I can have it delivered to my door, but it&#x27;s also cheaper.</li>
    <li> This was tacky in substance and shows every line, unfortunately, I was on vacation and by the time I got around to it, it was too late to return.:(  I am concerned that the product is old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> The product photo clearly displays TWO tubes, however, only one was shipped so I paid TWICE what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This product is a great disappointment.  It does not conceal anything.  I have dark eye lids, but it did not help.  The worst thing is the smell---terrible.</li>
    <li> Love this concealer, I&#x27;ve worn this on 10 hour days and it didn&#x27;t budge. I&#x27;m a chronic insominiac and often live on only 4 or so hours of sleep, this causes DARK circles. This is amazing stuff and the only concealer I&#x27;ll ever consider using.</li>
    <li> I want to order this as I have herd it is very good. I won&#x27;t order from here altho it would save me several dollars as there is no shade description in this listing? I comes in 4 shades, Fair,Light, Buff &amp; Medium. That&#x27;s a big range of color so when you list things you need to be more complete in the description.</li>
    <li> It works amazing.  I have deep circles under my eyes and this is not too heavy for me.  But - i wish there was a correcting concealer out there.  This just hides - it doesn&#x27;t fix the problems.</li>
    <li> This product works fairly well (especially when you consider the lower price compared to other concealers).  I use this under my eyes and find that the coverage is a little \\&quot;thin\\&quot;.  But I really don&#x27;t need much coverage so it works fine for me.  If you have really dark circles, this is probably not the product for you.</li>
    <li> This is the only concealer I&#x27;ve used for about 8 years, besides trying several more expensive types at Sephora. I have combination oily skin that tends to break out frequently and I have to have a special routine to catch it in time before it gets really bad. I dot and dab this under eyes, on imperfections and corners of nose/mouth. This is the only concealer I&#x27;ve used that can be worn all day without making me break out, covers well, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much. It does begin to wear off after about 4 hours, and it gives me a chance to wash my face again, but I give it 4 stars since I&#x27;ve been on the market for a longer lasting one(with more color options) for a couple years. Still, a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I have very dark circles and some age spots. It covers both really well. You don&#x27;t need much for coverage so don&#x27;t squeeze out but just a little dot on your finger.</li>
    <li> This is the only concealer I will ever use. I use the light. I am 51 yrs. old and have tried several concealers over the years. This one wins by a mile. It&#x27;s one of those \\&quot;if I was stranded on a desert island, what one make up item would I want to have\\&quot; things. And the SPF...awesome bonus.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible concealer. It has adequate SPF, but that is all it is good for. Since it is absorbed into the skin very quickly, the concealing effect is short-lived, maybe an hour or so. (This concealer is supposed to function as an eye cream, too. Maybe that is why it is so easily absorbed?) A good concealer needs to sit on top of the skin to mask discoloration.   Because I wanted to believe I could still use the product in some way, I tried using it as a moisturizer/SPF, and applying a \\&quot;good concealer\\&quot; to select places under the eye that are the darkest, hoping to achieve an overall natural look. No luck. This product with additional concealer over it looked cakey and emphasized the fine lines under my eyes. I looked worse with the product on than I did with no makeup at all!  It also did not keep the area under my eyes hydrated.   Rather than using a single product to do all three jobs, I recommend using an eye cream with mineral SPF first, then applying a high quality concealer on top of it to cover dark under eye circles after the cream has moisturized the eye area. I think the effect will be better using two or three different products instead of this poorly-designed attempt at using only one.  This product gets an A for intent, but a D- for performance. Disappointing. Good thing it was cheap. I don&#x27;t feel that bad about tossing it.</li>
    <li> It does not conceal my dark circles or make them look less visible.  Using the product alone is not moisturizing enough. I have to use eye cream.  I was enticed by the 3-in-1 convenience and thought that I would give it a try. Disappointed.  Strong fragrance.  2 stars because I can still use it as a sunscreen for my eye areas.</li>
    <li> If you have dark under eye circles this product is worthless. It vanishes the second I apply it to my skin. It moisturizes and contains an SPF but it does absolutely nothing to conceal any blemishes around the eye. I had to apply my old concealer over it. Not a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only takes a very small amount to do the job. A great concealer for under and around the eyes, especially for dark circles due to allergies. Will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely wonderful!! Being naturally pale and having thin skin, this product (the lightest shade of it of course) worked wonders for me. Trick for applying- pat under eyes in a triangle shape, beginning right under the eye and ending right next to the nostril.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite eye concealer, and I used it for years. I would have given THAT concealer 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;But it is no longer carried in stores...and I was naively optimistic that maybe this product would not be expired.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it from this distributor on Amazon, the product appeared opened, was not sealed, and the concealer&#x27;s ingredients had separated. I shook it to try to remix. When I put some on my hand to test it, it was thin and watery--not at all like the original.&lt;br /&gt;I assumed that these tubes were tampered with, thinned, or quite possibly not the true Neutrogena product at all...&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I bought and used this every day for years, and I know exactly how it should feel, look, smell, etc...&lt;br /&gt;I should have sent this back for a refund but was too busy. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought this concealor came in a 2 pack as pictured. Only one came.&lt;br /&gt;Uts is very light. It makes a better foundation than concealor. I wont buy&lt;br /&gt;it again when it runs out. I think the photo is false advertising.</li>
    <li> I have been buying concealers from the drugstores for the last few months, trying them at home, finding out that they don&#x27;t work for me, and then taking them back to the store to exchange it for another. I have been on a quest to find the perfect concealer, and my quest was fulfilled when I tried this concealer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with severe dark circles under my eyes, and this concealer covers them very well, it works great on the fine lines, doesn&#x27;t get cakey or granulated with time, lasts the whole day, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and blends easily with its smooth hydrating formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of trying the \\&quot;best seller\\&quot; concealers out there, they weren&#x27;t working for me, and I guess it makes sense since each person is different from the others. But for now, this is my FAVORITE concealer! :)</li>
    <li> A little gummy.  It works pretty well for all day shadow.  Just doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as some others I have used.  Probably the price you need to pay to have it last all day.  The coverage is decent.</li>
