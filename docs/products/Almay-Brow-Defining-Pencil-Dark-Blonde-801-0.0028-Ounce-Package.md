      <li>I can&#x27;t get it any more in any store near me, so I thought that I would try Amazon.com.  </li>

      <li>The holder for the Pencil didn&#x27;t push new product up to be used.  </li>
      <li>bug with these is that some tend to break off a lot (even with a pretty short tip rolled out)</li>

      <li>and I love the thin pencil .....</li>
      <li>Plus the brush at the other end is very convenient.</li>

<li> the only problem I have with the pencil is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t actually make a dark enough line.....</li>
<li> this is so delicate it looks just as if it was a real eye brow.</li>
<li> The color was to be dark blonde, but it was orange.</li>
<li> however, the second box contained the wrong product even though it was marked correcty, had to return it.</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t waste any of the pencil.  </li>
<li> Will not order again but will use what I have because the color is hard to find.</li>
<li> It was hard to apply and if you applied pressure it would break.  </li>
<li> Did not like how thin and hard the pencil was.  </li>
<li> I have been unable to find Almay eyebrow pencils in stores.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find though.</li>
<li> this product was terrible.</li>

    <li> This is an easy way to buy this product which is hard to find in stores in my area.  The color works well for me with my graying light brown hair. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it tends to be a bit hard and crumbly and not go on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> The only pencil I&#x27;ve found that has a perfect natural color and goes on smoothly.  It&#x27;s losing one star in the rating because I always have to glue in the brush end in order for it to stay.</li>
    <li> this product was terrible. The color was to be dark blonde, but it was orange. I made the mistake in purchasing two. pencils</li>
    <li> I have always used almay products , but the eyebrow pencil is one of the best, I think is great!!</li>
    <li> Received in good time, one box was fine ( ordered 2 ) however, the second box contained the wrong product even though it was marked correcty, had to return it.</li>

    <li> This is really an awesome product.  So easy to use and precise. It&#x27;s very difficult to find though. I&#x27;m so happy that I can get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product is terrific.  I can&#x27;t get it any more in any store near me, so I thought that I would try Amazon.com.  It&#x27;s easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to sharpen the pencil.  It just twists up.</li>
    <li> I saved time and energy buying on line as I could not find the color I needed locally. I am quite satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Of the three pencils I have used two have had to be thrown away, as they crumbled into pieces with use.&lt;br /&gt;The third one I am using now appears to be okay.</li>
    <li> I have used this brow defining pencil for years and no longer find it in stores.  I&#x27;m so pleased to find it online.</li>
    <li> I use this brow pencil all the time.  Love the color.  I can define my brows perfectly with it.  I&#x27;ve tried others...not the same.  CVS use to carry this, now they don&#x27;t.  So glad I found it here!</li>
    <li> Everything was exactly as advertised.  Best Part??  Shipping was immediate.  I could not believe how fast my items were at my door.  Love this vender and will definitely tell others about them.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best brow pencil I have ever used!! I wish they made this product in waterproof . I highly recommend this product to anyone who struggles finding a brow pencil that actually works!!</li>
    <li> Loved the color.  Did not like how thin and hard the pencil was.  It was hard to apply and if you applied pressure it would break.  Will not order again but will use what I have because the color is hard to find.</li>
    <li> the product still breaks off....but I do like the item</li>
    <li> I love using an eyebrow penci to fill in my brows. this is so delicate it looks just as if it was a real eye brow. id recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow pencil.... I tried many others before I found this one..... the color is perfect for me...... and I love the thin pencil ..... the only problem I have with the pencil is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t actually make a dark enough line..... and it gets tossed..... but I feel it is still a great product ...</li>
    <li> Only one pencil was in the 2-pack.  The holder for the Pencil didn&#x27;t push new product up to be used.  Finally got some &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; to use, but had to keep working for it.  I&#x27;ve liked this product in the past, but this is a &amp;#34;bum&amp;#34; batch.</li>
