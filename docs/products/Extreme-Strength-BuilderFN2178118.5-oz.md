### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Can&#x27;t stop raving.. was running my fingers through my hair today and it felt great!</li>
      <li>Its great!</li>
      <li>Best product I ever used on my hair</li>
      <li>Very good!</li>
      <li>I find that it works best if I leave it in my hair for about 20 minutes and apply some heat.</li>
      <li>Great conditioner!</li>
      <li>this was great.  </li>
      <li>this is a great preventative.</li>
      <li>This is a great strengthening mask.</li>
      <li>use the mask about once a week or every two weeks for a great fortifier</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an attractive length, but it means that over-bleaching has become a problem.</li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>It smells good and feels good in the hair.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>but i love how it makes my hair feel! . . . .</li>
      <li>I honestly believe you can use their \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot; products (any of them) and tell an immediate difference.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really seeing WONDERFUL results.</li>
      <li>I tried this product and it was ok.</li>
      <li>In one of the reviews or more it suggested to use it once a week or so.  </li>
      <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>prefer Joico K-Pak is better.</li>
      <li>This mask helps me most of all.</li>
      <li>but then it gradually got better.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>My hair was shinier, softer, and more silky looking.  </li>
      <li>and it is very good and did make my hair feel wonderfully conditioned but as an older person, I have the need for something a little heavier.  </li>
      <li>All they do is smooth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair, without volume</li>
      <li>This works great for dry, damaged hair as a repairing treatment.  </li>
      <li>Because it is true, once your hair is split, there is no remedy for it, any products that say they fix it are lying.</li>
      <li>Good product for deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>I am 58, and as you get older, your hair needs even more care.  </li>
      <li>I was looking to see if there was anything better than All Soft by Redken.  </li>
      <li>I put it on my hair for about 15 minutes, and it really conditions the hair, makes it smooth, even silky at times, much healthier looking.</li>
      <li>I think the all soft is better for us older folk with drier hair</li>
      <li>and I noticed a result after the first use.</li>
      <li>I first had this at a salon, where the lady recommended it.  </li>
      <li>I feel my hair very light and extremely soft after using it, and I have noticed clear difference in my split ends.</li>
      <li>After a lifetime of using various products (salon purchased &amp; high quality), I have found Redken Extreme to be the best I&#x27;ve ever used (so far anyway).  </li>
      <li>Kerastase&#x27;s Age Recharge which I liked very much but could be heavy for my hair some times.</li>
      <li>and I believe its a great product for anyone with weak hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Its really helped my hair from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I came back from vacation devastated that I would have to cut my hair, but after using this I&#x27;m SO excited.</li>
      <li>That isn&#x27;t really what damaged my hair, it was going to the beach the week right after and constantly exposing my hair to salt water, pool water, and too much sun.</li>
      <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny, and it actually is genuinely starting to look like commercial hair.</li>
      <li>I do recommend this product, highly.</li>
      <li>Longer hair, maybe a little more of course.</li>
      <li>my hair is soo soft and shiny also way more less breakage.</li>
      <li>It has greatly reduced the rough harsh look my hair had, and has left it silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have fine  straight bleached blonde hair which I have recently allowed to grow beyond my former pixie style.</li>
      <li>After using it weekly for a few months, I noticed that my hair was a lot stronger and didn&#x27;t break as easily.</li>
      <li>I really like this and since a little goes a long way, the price is ok.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a dark haired brunette and recently got a nice blonde hombre.</li>
      <li>I had VERY damaged hair from getting blonde highlights and a perm.</li>
      <li>DOES NOT MAKE IT TOO SOFT</li>
      <li>I have very damaged, bleached hair, and although I am not bleaching it anymore, the ends are still pretty dead.</li>
      <li>I have straight, very fine, very thin hair.  </li>
      <li>When your hair needs a little extra care and conditioning, this is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Once my hair went short, I use it only monthly or it seems too much</li>
      <li>This product REALLY helped bring back strength and smoothmess back to my hair.</li>
      <li>Most conditioners are too heavy for me, but as long as rinsed well and only used once a week</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, bleached blonde, and a couple inches past my waist.</li>
      <li>Hair is soft and definitely a lot smoother.</li>
      <li>but if you are younger and don&#x27;t need a really heavy conditioner than this product is probably the right one.</li>
      <li>My experience was neither bad nor good.</li>

<li> If your hair is dry or damaged and needs something extra, this product will help a lot!</li>
<li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> At that time, i had long, dry, damaged, color treated hair.  </li>
<li> If you have short hair like I do, a little squirt about the size of a pea is enough.  </li>
<li> I have very long hair.  </li>
<li> I definitely notice my hair being a lot softer and breaking a lot less!</li>
<li> I use the Redken Extreme Shampoo and the Redken Extreme Conditioner and this product, Redken Extreme  Strength Builder.  </li>
<li> I use it in conjunction with the redken extreme anti-snap</li>
<li> BUT IS FOR EXTREME THINGS THAT WE DO TO IT...</li>
<li> I asked for Redken extreme strength builder plus and it says that  Redken extreme strength builder fortifying mask is in transit.</li>
<li> I use Redkin Extreme Shampoo and condition, plus redkin  extreme snap, now this.  </li>
<li> and my hair gets weighed down.  </li>
<li> You need to use very little of it (a little goes a very long way)</li>
<li> Previously I have tried a mask by Aveda, which I didn&#x27;t like at all, and before that I was using for years</li>
<li> This product is helping to strengthen my weakened hair, making it stronger and less breakable.  </li>
<li> I knew when I bought it that this is not a quick fix; it takes time to repair the damage done to your hair.</li>
<li> This allowed thorough penetration and prevented waste of product.</li>
<li> not really sure if it builds strength</li>
<li> This mask nourishes my hair without making them dull.</li>
<li> After I ran out of the tub I purchased this because it was slightly less expensive.</li>
<li> I purchased the Redken Strength Builder Plus (in the tub) in the hope that it would help my weak hair.</li>
<li> Since its expensive (for my budget), I would apply a small bit throughout my hair, put it in a bun, and let it sit for a couple days.</li>
<li> Seriously!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is helping to strengthen my weakened hair, making it stronger and less breakable.  This is the second bottle for me.</li>
    <li> I use Redkin Extreme Shampoo and condition, plus redkin  extreme snap, now this.  I love it.  Just have used it once and could tell a difference.  In one of the reviews or more it suggested to use it once a week or so.  I think I will use mine a couple times a week  I have very long hair.  I am 58, and as you get older, your hair needs even more care.  I really love this stuff.  I will write again, if need to. I do recommend this product, highly.</li>
    <li> I have fine  straight bleached blonde hair which I have recently allowed to grow beyond my former pixie style. It&#x27;s an attractive length, but it means that over-bleaching has become a problem. I use this product daily as a conditioner leaving it on for three minutes. It has greatly reduced the rough harsh look my hair had, and has left it silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> Use once a week, especially in these Wisconsin winters!  Just wash hair, smuch as much water out of your hair as possible and comb this product through - cover hair with towel and relax for at least 20 minutes.  Works well!!</li>
    <li> I used all the Redken Extreme products and my hair changed completely. It smells good and feels good in the hair. Go for it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for a month now and I love it. To help you decide about this product, I will provide some information regarding my hair type. I have very fine, straight hair, without volume and I need products which don&#x27;t leave residues. I colour my hair with ammonia-free products, my roots are oily and I have split ends. This mask nourishes my hair without making them dull. I feel my hair very light and extremely soft after using it, and I have noticed clear difference in my split ends. Previously I have tried a mask by Aveda, which I didn&#x27;t like at all, and before that I was using for years Kerastase&#x27;s Age Recharge which I liked very much but could be heavy for my hair some times. This mask is lighter than Kerastase&#x27;s Age Recharge but I think it provides the same degree of protection. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good product for deep conditioning. I find that it works best if I leave it in my hair for about 20 minutes and apply some heat. Hair is soft and definitely a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> This is a great strengthening mask. My hair is fine, bleached blonde, and a couple inches past my waist. The bleaching made it a lot weaker, and every time I brushed my hair I would experience some breakage. I purchased the Redken Strength Builder Plus (in the tub) in the hope that it would help my weak hair. I knew when I bought it that this is not a quick fix; it takes time to repair the damage done to your hair. I hoped with continued use that it would strengthen my hair. My hopes were fulfilled. After using it weekly for a few months, I noticed that my hair was a lot stronger and didn&#x27;t break as easily. Since its expensive (for my budget), I would apply a small bit throughout my hair, put it in a bun, and let it sit for a couple days. This allowed thorough penetration and prevented waste of product. After I ran out of the tub I purchased this because it was slightly less expensive. It works just as well and I believe its a great product for anyone with weak hair.</li>
    <li> This works great for dry, damaged hair as a repairing treatment.  I first had this at a salon, where the lady recommended it.  At that time, i had long, dry, damaged, color treated hair.  This worked like a miracle when I used it once a week.  My hair was shinier, softer, and more silky looking.  I have straight, very fine, very thin hair.  Most conditioners are too heavy for me, but as long as rinsed well and only used once a week this was great.  Once my hair went short, I use it only monthly or it seems too much and my hair gets weighed down.  I really like this and since a little goes a long way, the price is ok.  I have recommended this to several friends, who had complimented me on my hair&#x27;s improved texture when I started using this.</li>
    <li> I like the Redken Extreme-Anti snap treatment that I have diside to try this one too. I only use this one once of month. After using my hair shine for weeks.</li>
    <li> Best product I ever used on my hair</li>
    <li> My hair was so bleached damaged and just after 2 deep conditions my hair is soo soft and shiny also way more less breakage. I we never use another product again.</li>
    <li> Very good! Recommend.</li>
    <li> Works ok too expensive... prefer Joico K-Pak is better.</li>
    <li> I asked for Redken extreme strength builder plus and it says that  Redken extreme strength builder fortifying mask is in transit.</li>
    <li> I was looking to see if there was anything better than All Soft by Redken.  I tried this and it is very good and did make my hair feel wonderfully conditioned but as an older person, I have the need for something a little heavier.  I think the all soft is better for us older folk with drier hair but if you are younger and don&#x27;t need a really heavy conditioner than this product is probably the right one.</li>
    <li> I have very damaged, bleached hair, and although I am not bleaching it anymore, the ends are still pretty dead. This mask helps me most of all. I put it on my hair for about 15 minutes, and it really conditions the hair, makes it smooth, even silky at times, much healthier looking. Love it!!</li>
    <li> IT RESTORES YOUR HAIR..DOES NOT MAKE IT TOO SOFT BUT IS FOR EXTREME THINGS THAT WE DO TO IT...ONCE A WEEK!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week and I noticed a result after the first use. I use it in conjunction with the redken extreme anti-snap and I&#x27;m really seeing WONDERFUL results. I&#x27;m a dark haired brunette and recently got a nice blonde hombre. That isn&#x27;t really what damaged my hair, it was going to the beach the week right after and constantly exposing my hair to salt water, pool water, and too much sun. I came back from vacation devastated that I would have to cut my hair, but after using this I&#x27;m SO excited. My hair looks healthy and shiny, and it actually is genuinely starting to look like commercial hair. Definitely recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner! Really helped my damaged hair feel less dry.</li>
    <li> I had VERY damaged hair from getting blonde highlights and a perm. This product REALLY helped bring back strength and smoothmess back to my hair. Its great!</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of using various products (salon purchased &amp; high quality), I have found Redken Extreme to be the best I&#x27;ve ever used (so far anyway).  I use the Redken Extreme Shampoo and the Redken Extreme Conditioner and this product, Redken Extreme  Strength Builder.  When your hair needs a little extra care and conditioning, this is fantastic.  It&#x27;s like a \\&quot;hair repair\\&quot; product.  If your hair is dry or damaged and needs something extra, this product will help a lot! I honestly believe you can use their \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot; products (any of them) and tell an immediate difference.  I highly recommend it! You need to use very little of it (a little goes a very long way) so it lasts a long time.  If you have short hair like I do, a little squirt about the size of a pea is enough.  Seriously!  Longer hair, maybe a little more of course.</li>
    <li> not really sure if it builds strength but i love how it makes my hair feel! . . . .</li>
    <li> My hair was so brittle and damaged before I used the line. I mean, at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working but then it gradually got better. Getting my hair trimmed and cut also helped a lot. Because it is true, once your hair is split, there is no remedy for it, any products that say they fix it are lying. All they do is smooth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a great preventative. I bought the Shampoo, conditioner, mask, anti-snap leave in treatment, and the cat protein treatment. Its really helped my hair from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the mask about once a week or every two weeks for a great fortifier</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it was ok. My experience was neither bad nor good. I&#x27;m starting to think that the Redkin line is just not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about two months now and I absolutely LOVE this product! I wash my hair every 3 days or so and just use it as my regular conditioner. I definitely notice my hair being a lot softer and breaking a lot less! Have to go for trims less frequently. I also use the shampoo and anti-snap. Can&#x27;t stop raving.. was running my fingers through my hair today and it felt great!</li>
