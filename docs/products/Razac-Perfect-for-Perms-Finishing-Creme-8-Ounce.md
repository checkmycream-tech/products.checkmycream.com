      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I live in a new area and it is not carried in the beauty supply stores</li>
      <li>With a change in the formularies in all hair products, I was searching for a new product.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my super dry hair.  </li>

      <li>Smooth, not too heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product if you have natural hair or even a relaxer.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I have natural 4b/4c hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, all you need is a dime size to get the achieved look.</li>
      <li>it makes your hair feels silky soft</li>
      <li>My only tip would be don&#x27;t use to much --- if you do your hair looks oily.</li>
      <li>There are no beauty supply stores that I found so far that carry this product</li>
      <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>Leaves my curls soft and without any frizz.</li>
      <li>The creme is more expensive, but worth every bit.</li>
      <li>I use this product daily, but it was better in the past.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, my hair is thriving once again...and to make this little experience even better, my local grocery store recently remodeled, has an amazing Black Hair Care products section and this Razac product is now a regular item they carry.  </li>

    <li> This is the best stuff ever...Here in Texas the heat can be very brutal.&lt;br /&gt;This finishing creme keeps the moisture and shine in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy and you only need a little.  Perfect stuff. I try to by it at least 2 at a time to keep from running out.  There are no beauty supply stores that I found so far that carry this product so I always order it on line saves the headache of driving all over town.</li>
    <li> Not heavy at all. My hair feels so healthy. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry hair. I live in a new area and it is not carried in the beauty supply stores so I have to purchase it on line. Keeps my ends from being dry and breaking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a long time and now I use it on my daughters.  I use a tiny bit on their hair everyday.  Their hair is beautiful and shiny.  It takes out the morning frizzes.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It moisturizes my super dry hair.  I&#x27;m between relaxers and it moisturizes and smoothes my hair as if I have a fresh relaxer.</li>
    <li> This product works really well on me and my daughters hair, smells really good also and not too greasy on the hair either!</li>
    <li> used this finishing cream before and just felt in love with it .the cream has just the right amount of oil and is not greasy at all, really leaves your hair nice and soft.thank you!</li>
    <li> Hands down! This is the best cream if you&#x27;re looking for a shiny/silky look to maintain short hair.  A previous hairstylist introduced me to this.  I needed a perm before she styled my hair. Before I left there, looked as if I had gotten a perm since she used the cream.  I asked her what she put in my hair, and then she showed me.  I&#x27;m married to this product!  I don&#x27;t recommend if someone has long hair and having body is your primary status.  If you&#x27;re rocking a short hair style, then bam!  It&#x27;s not heavy, all you need is a dime size to get the achieved look. I&#x27;ve tried other products once I ran out, and it doesn&#x27;t give me the same effects. It&#x27;s very hard to find it in Sally&#x27;s or beauty stores.  So of coarse, thought to check Amazon!  Don&#x27;t knock it, until you try it!</li>
    <li> The only thing I use on my hair. Have used it for a few years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Can&#x27;t understand why stores aren&#x27;t carrying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. If you have dry brittle hair, then this product is for you! I have been using this product about 10-15 years and I still love it! Your hair will have shine and moisture, but not greasy. The best thing about this finishing crème is that it lasts a long time because you do not have to use a lot of it. I recommend this product if you have natural hair or even a relaxer.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily, but it was better in the past.  When I first purchased it years ago, it left your hair softer than this one does.</li>
    <li> This product was referred to me by a colleague. I absolutely am in love with it!!!!!! My hair is extremely thick, coarse, and dry.  The razac finishing creme was readily absorbed by my hair. With a change in the formularies in all hair products, I was searching for a new product. The creme is more expensive, but worth every bit. I have since referred another colleague.</li>
    <li> Thsi product provides the moisture and shine you hair needs with out the heavyness of hair oils and the build up of sprays! Its like nivea  for hair![[ASIN:B000ALIL8M Razac Haircare Perfect for Perms - Finishing Creme Daily Hairdressing 8 oz.]]</li>
    <li> does wonders for your hair, would recommend this product as a great hair conditioner.  Just hard to find in retail stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years... I would definitely recommend for black  short hair. it makes your hair feels silky soft</li>
    <li> This product keeps your hair soft and healthy with a natural shine without weightiness.  I&#x27;m glad I can order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smooth, not too heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair creme that I have ever used.  I have tried others, but nothing else impresses me like this one.  I even love the smell.  I loved this product the first time that I tried it and have been using it for years.  I am definitely one happy customer.  The seller is awesome, too because I got it at a great price!</li>
    <li> This hair cream is awsome! Non-greasy. Leaves hair soft and silky. Scent is fabulous. Smells good enough to eat, but don&#x27;t eat it, It&#x27;s for the hair. Every night I use it on my hair, and my husband says , you smell nice. I luv it and he does too.</li>
    <li> This product works very well especially for people with thick dry hair. I use this for when I straighten my hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and it helps my hair look healthy.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product and I wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere. Of course amazon had to have it. Its amazing if you have damaged hair or you blow dry it on a regular basis. My only tip would be don&#x27;t use to much --- if you do your hair looks oily.</li>
    <li> love it, it is a very good moisturizer for your hair and scalp I will buy this product again and again</li>
    <li> AMEN...finally found and remembered the name of this product.  My mom was introduced to this product by an owner of a Black Hair care products store in our area.  I decided to try it and had no idea my hair would literally thrive on this product.  I used it for years and had amazing results with the product, but it was challenging for me to get to that particular store to purchase this.  I stopped using it for about 2 years and noticed a huge decline with the health, strength, and growth of my hair.  I remembered that I had ordered it online like 3 years ago and thankfully, I was able to find the receipt in one of my email folders for the Razac.  Even better, I ordered it here on Amazon and have been using it since January.  Needless to say, my hair is thriving once again...and to make this little experience even better, my local grocery store recently remodeled, has an amazing Black Hair Care products section and this Razac product is now a regular item they carry.  I&#x27;m beyond thrilled...will never use another product or switch again.  Also, there is very little to no build up with this product and it has a very light, nice smell.  Huge plus...</li>
    <li> i like how it works on my daughters hair. It lays it down. It smells really good too. I love it.</li>
    <li> It is the best product to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for many years on my curly hair. I have tried other products and I always come back to this one. Leaves my curls soft and without any frizz. I love it and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I must say that this product is great. I wear a short hair style with a perm and a little of this go a long way. The shine is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with purchase. Will shop for this item again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again for selling this item at your store.</li>
    <li> I had been using a product &amp;#34;Perm Repair&amp;#34; for years. Perm Repair was discontinued and I could not find a product to substitute. I have finally found a haircare product that will condition my permed hair! I am now good to go :-)</li>
    <li> I have natural 4b/4c hair. I use this with shea moisture. Adds lots of shine. Price is not so bad.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly as it always has over the last several years.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the results I have been getting, as I mentioned before, I have been using it for over ten years, and there is nothing to replace it.</li>
    <li> We found this cream when visited the States a couple of years ago. My daughters and wife love it because it leaves their hair shiny and smooth after the styling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because she has really curly hair that&#x27;s dry and this product works wonder. I would not use this product if your hair is fine, too straight or oily.</li>
    <li> Love Razac Haircare products.</li>
