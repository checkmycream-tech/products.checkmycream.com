      <li>lol</li>
      <li>The glove was great.  </li>

      <li>but it def works great and</li>
      <li>It came in a great decorative box along with the styling glove (so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers when holding and wrapping your hair around the wand.</li>
      <li>Also the package comes with the glove, I dont use it even though I could, but the price for this great wand and the glove when its valued at $200 is amazing.</li>
      <li>This came in and she just loved it</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>but for experienced people who&#x27;ve gone through flatirons and curling irons like i have most things likw this</li>

      <li>I purchased this for my grand daughter.</li>
      <li>love  </li>
      <li>The longer pieces of hair do curl pretty nice.</li>
      <li>I ordered with 1 day shipping and got it right on time!  </li>
      <li>This curling iron is what will save the curls :), my only dilemma is that it does not have a temperature setter just and on and off switch and it heats up quickly which is okay</li>
      <li>Either way it looks great and if you have the patience and upper arm strength, it definitely make great baby curls that last all day and doesn&#x27;t burn out your hair.</li>
      <li>Worth purchasing</li>
      <li>but my hair looks adorable sexy tight curls which is what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would get so hot</li>
      <li>Made such cute Shirley Temple curls.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was looking for and should have purchased a thicker wand than this one.</li>
      <li>that you cant control eventually start to spaz out and get TOO hot and burn your hair.</li>
      <li>I was able to hold the tiny ends of the hair right on the iron to prevent straight ends</li>
      <li>They kept a nice curl the second day and the third day we brushed through them and with some product made some separate nice wavy curls.  </li>
      <li>I have layered, straight, fine hair that sits right above my hips.</li>
      <li>My hair usually doesn’t do a good job at holding curls</li>
      <li>I have very long hair and there aren&#x27;t many products that will hold for a whole day.</li>
      <li>The curling wand works really well.</li>
      <li>This iron heats up fast and the curls don&#x27;t fall.  </li>
      <li>My hair does not hold curl very well at all.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t bother with the glove, doubt it would protect the hand much anyways.</li>
      <li>heats up quickly and my curls last for days!</li>
      <li>so the curls are super tiny...</li>
      <li>The device gets hot enough to get the job done, but sometimes it gets too hot (even the handle part where I’m holding)</li>
      <li>it makes my curl cute n tight</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
      <li>Probably takes a little more practice.  </li>
      <li>and I was pretty much holding the iron with those tiny ends.</li>
      <li>after I’ve used it a few times I’ll be able to get it done faster.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for a thinner curl than this works really well and was really inexpensive if you just want to try it out before making a big purchase.</li>
      <li>Works very good but be careful it gets super hot and will burn you pretty bad!</li>

<li> Works very good but be careful it gets super hot and will burn you pretty bad!</li>
<li> If you get tired like me when doing the tight curls, you can just grab bigger sections of hair and end up with a lot of wave and volume almost like the old hot roller look.</li>
<li> so i would watch it and not leave it on for too long if you know youre going to be taking breaks.</li>
<li> but I was surprised that after using this wand the curls stayed for a few days.</li>
<li> Because I wanted really small, tight curls and because my hair is pretty long</li>
<li> i dont need such tight curls</li>
<li> Wish it was a little bigger</li>
<li> so I kept burning my finger tips and my hair kept slipping off the tip</li>
<li> I  have used only a few times, but haven&#x27;t had any troubles.</li>
<li> the only thing i can guess is maybe the wiring is faulty because the other one started shorting near the end and would work only when it wanted to.. weird?</li>
<li> the curls stay for a few days (with minimal touch up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I have to switch it off for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;-There</li>
<li> And if the ends of the hair are not secure around the barrel the curl does not look &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> So far so great...a little drying dangerous</li>
<li> This iron is a little hard to use.  </li>
<li> My only complaint is this is my 2nd in a year, which means the 1st one died and therefore makes it not a great longterm product, unfortunately.</li>
<li> I burn my self twice :/</li>
<li> Also kept the groups of hair to no more than 1 cm cube of hair at a time at the root end.  </li>
<li> If your looking to create small &amp;#34;baby curls&amp;#34; then this is the product you are looking for!</li>
<li> very small (pencil/baby) curls – think Taylor Swift</li>
<li> I had to wrap very small sections each time.</li>
<li> I had been looking for the one that makes very small curls.</li>
<li> It took me less than an hour to get it all curled and the curl was still there this morning even after sleeping on it!!!  </li>
<li> plus it&#x27;s so much less expensive then in the mall</li>
<li> My hair is very thick and needs a bigger curl, the small curles look really bad</li>
<li> but it is very hard to get the hair curled around the bottom</li>
<li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very hard to curl.</li>
<li> My hair is almost to my waist and is very thick.  </li>
<li> not a happy coustomer!</li>
<li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this for my grand daughter. I had been looking for the one that makes very small curls. This came in and she just loved it</li>
    <li> This was the perfect wand size I needed and the curls come out so beautiful and can last for 2 days. The only issue is you can&#x27;t change the heat setting.</li>
    <li> Just got my Herstyler baby curling iron today... tested it out on a friend who hair would never hold a curl and it lasted all day !! Wish it was a little bigger but i didnt check the size bc i dont need such tight curls but it def works great and it def saved me a lot of money!! I would recommend this product to anyone who thinks their hair would NEVER curl :)</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very hard to curl. The curls always come out. This iron heats up fast and the curls don&#x27;t fall.  Great item</li>
    <li> The curling wand works really well. I didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was looking for and should have purchased a thicker wand than this one. My hair is very thick and needs a bigger curl, the small curles look really bad so I don&#x27;t use it often. That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for a thinner curl than this works really well and was really inexpensive if you just want to try it out before making a big purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchesed this product about 2 months ago. Ive used it once...it did not come with the atachments with it..so the curls are super tiny...ive tried to just buy the attachments but of cours noone sells them..because they are sopost to come with the hersttylerr!! not a happy coustomer!</li>
    <li> Getting the \\&quot;Baby Curls\\&quot; is quite a work out and almost requires two people to do your hair to get the desired results. If you get tired like me when doing the tight curls, you can just grab bigger sections of hair and end up with a lot of wave and volume almost like the old hot roller look. Either way it looks great and if you have the patience and upper arm strength, it definitely make great baby curls that last all day and doesn&#x27;t burn out your hair. Also awesome price of $30 was a plus when this curling iron sells at the mall for over $200.  It came in a great decorative box along with the styling glove (so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers when holding and wrapping your hair around the wand.</li>
    <li> This curling Iron works geat but it is very hard to get the hair curled around the bottom so when I use it I have awesome curls with straight tips urgggg!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my curler. It was everything it was promised to be. No complaints here. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> Great wand, makes beautiful curls and gets piping hot. My only complaint is this is my 2nd in a year, which means the 1st one died and therefore makes it not a great longterm product, unfortunately. But when it works it is awesome! the only thing i can guess is maybe the wiring is faulty because the other one started shorting near the end and would work only when it wanted to.. weird?</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and my curls last for days!</li>
    <li> This item is not as pictured. It&#x27;s a much bigger curling wand. The only reason I didn&#x27;t return it is because I didn&#x27;t have time to.</li>
    <li> love  it makes my curl cute n tight</li>
    <li> I ordered with 1 day shipping and got it right on time!  I have used it on my daughters hair and she loves the curls.  I finally got to try it on my hair last night.  My hair does not hold curl very well at all.  I never bother to curl it because it doesn&#x27;t last.  My hair is almost to my waist and is very thick.  It took me less than an hour to get it all curled and the curl was still there this morning even after sleeping on it!!!  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Works very good but be careful it gets super hot and will burn you pretty bad! Worth purchasing plus it&#x27;s so much less expensive then in the mall</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would get so hot lol I burn my self twice :/ but rather than that it&#x27;s great and curls came out great :)</li>
    <li> Best curls with this product and the value was great as well . I also liked the surprise glove that was included.</li>
    <li> Curls in no time at all and actually stays. I have very long hair and there aren&#x27;t many products that will hold for a whole day. I  have used only a few times, but haven&#x27;t had any troubles. I don&#x27;t bother with the glove, doubt it would protect the hand much anyways. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wand because I have used similar ones with bigger barrels and I wanted to try something new. I am very pleased with my purchase and I would recommend this product to a friend. I have layered, straight, fine hair that sits right above my hips. My hair usually doesn’t do a good job at holding curls but I was surprised that after using this wand the curls stayed for a few days. (I did have to touch it up though, as to keep it looking neat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;-Long chord&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to work with if you know how to use a wand&lt;br /&gt;-Creates very small (pencil/baby) curls – think Taylor Swift&lt;br /&gt;-Gives a lot of volume and the curls stay for a few days (with minimal touch up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-THERE IS NO TEMPERATURE DIAL! – there is simply and on and off switch on the device, nothing to regulate the temperature on it. I would say that is the only flaw. The device gets hot enough to get the job done, but sometimes it gets too hot (even the handle part where I’m holding) and I have to switch it off for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;-There is no rubber/stopper at the end to protect your fingers so I kept burning my finger tips and my hair kept slipping off the tip and I kept having to rewrap it around the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that using this wand does take a substantial amount of time. Because I wanted really small, tight curls and because my hair is pretty long I had to wrap very small sections each time. So it took me a lot longer than it would have if I had used a bigger barrel obviously. But I think for each person it’s different. And I’m sure after I’ve used it a few times I’ll be able to get it done faster.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product and sent in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girls.  Made such cute Shirley Temple curls.  They were bouncy and cute.  They kept a nice curl the second day and the third day we brushed through them and with some product made some separate nice wavy curls.  Wound the hair on as quickly as possible and only needed to hold the iron on for about 5 seconds.  Also kept the groups of hair to no more than 1 cm cube of hair at a time at the root end.  The glove was great.  I was able to hold the tiny ends of the hair right on the iron to prevent straight ends and I didn&#x27;t even feel the heat through the glove... and I was pretty much holding the iron with those tiny ends.</li>
    <li> Used it today! If your looking to create small &amp;#34;baby curls&amp;#34; then this is the product you are looking for! Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t tell you when its already heated but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. Glove is not the best otherwise no  complaints! Works very good!</li>
    <li> So far so great...a little drying dangerous but my hair looks adorable sexy tight curls which is what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Best thing that happened to my curls. They spring and bounce into place, i used this on my bleached virgin hair because it was damaged and changed the curl pattern from kinky curly or &amp;#34;baby curl&amp;#34; to wavy. which means there&#x27;s still bounce but it&#x27;s not like it once was. This curling iron is what will save the curls :), my only dilemma is that it does not have a temperature setter just and on and off switch and it heats up quickly which is okay but for experienced people who&#x27;ve gone through flatirons and curling irons like i have most things likw this that you cant control eventually start to spaz out and get TOO hot and burn your hair. so i would watch it and not leave it on for too long if you know youre going to be taking breaks. Also the package comes with the glove, I dont use it even though I could, but the price for this great wand and the glove when its valued at $200 is amazing. The people at my mall try for 100 or $80. I would never splurge, when i have a great deal right here :)</li>
    <li> This iron is a little hard to use.  I do have shorter hair so getting it to wind around the barrel is tricky.  And if the ends of the hair are not secure around the barrel the curl does not look &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34;.  Probably takes a little more practice.  The longer pieces of hair do curl pretty nice.</li>
