      <li>It does have a strong perfume smell, stronger than I prefer because I had suspected I was allergic to the fragrances that are in most products.  </li>
      <li>The scent is way too strong, think overwhelming cheap perfume.  </li>
      <li>The only good thing about this purchase was the case it came in!</li>

      <li>Now I only have breakouts when I either become allergic to something I am using (I suspect this is from them altering the recipe, or from my own changes in body chemistry)</li>

      <li>Also gave me red itchy bumps over most of my face.</li>
      <li>I bought this to sample before I bought the large cleanser.</li>
      <li>and I really like that I can refill the bottles.</li>
      <li>The care cream is fanatic, it hydrates without feeling greasy and it smells so good.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I felt comfortable going without makeup, probably when I was 10 years old.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I actually find it a little too strong and only use that on very hot days when I feel I need a quick refresher.</li>
      <li>These products will not cure you but will not cause flare ups and if used regularly will calm your skin.  </li>
      <li>and I was hoping for some return to normal skin tone.</li>
      <li>My fase became itchy and red right after I applied the cream.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to return the product, but it is not refundable.</li>
      <li>or I try something new and I am allergic to it.  </li>

      <li>This whole line is not good for sensitive skin!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had rosacea for years and have tried several products.  I have a prescription from my dermatologist but if I use harsh beauty products I still have flare ups.  The 3 products in this kit are amazing.  They will not cure your rosacea but will help you keep the flare ups under control.  I also use the Pevonia Rose serum as a part of my routine and the results are even better.  These products will not cure you but will not cause flare ups and if used regularly will calm your skin.  But, again, the product won&#x27;t cure all your problems and can&#x27;t reverse broken capillaries, and your diet and the cosmetics you use are important.  That said, I swear by these products.</li>
    <li> I have two trips planned with only carry on bags, this is the best size and I don&#x27;t like to interrupt my skin care routine when I travel. I am really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I did not like the Pevonia Botanica Rosacea Skin Pack. I have sensitive skin and this product made it red and irritated. I did not like the strong fragrance. The lotion felt like it was sitting on my skin, the cream was heavy and the cleanser felt like it never rinsed off fully. The only good thing about this purchase was the case it came in!</li>
    <li> So far so good- no new break outs, skin feels great. Hope the product and my skin have a long term relationship.</li>
    <li> perfect for travelling.</li>
    <li> This kit is extremely good for traveling and I really like that I can refill the bottles. A few years I had the same kit but it was not refillable so this kit is definitely an improvement.</li>
    <li> Awful products.  The scent is way too strong, think overwhelming cheap perfume.  Also gave me red itchy bumps over most of my face.</li>
    <li> I always buy expensive products for my face but these are my favorite products so far. When I clean my face, my skin feels refreshed and clean without striping oil from the skin. I actually love washing my face with and I also smells like roses without being overwhelming. The lotion was a waste of $ because it irritated my skin a little. The care cream is fanatic, it hydrates without feeling greasy and it smells so good. I highly recommend it. Yes, it is expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality skincare items which are helping to curb my symptoms of Rosacea, especially the peeling skin on my nose and cheeks. I bought this &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; to test all three of the basic products. Very nice travel case.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  It took her years to find an effective skincare product for her Rosacea.  This is made in USA for this Italian brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as shown, with the travel case and received small bottles, without the travel bag. This item was purchased for traveling. There was a plan involved so substituting was not appreciated.</li>
    <li> This whole line is not good for sensitive skin!!! My fase became itchy and red right after I applied the cream.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to return the product, but it is not refundable. Be carefull!!!</li>
    <li> the product was fresh, n worked just as I remembered. helps me alot w my rosecea.all pevonia skin care line is excellent. these r a great size for travel and you can actually  refill them!</li>
    <li> This is a good way to try the rosacea line without spending a lot of money.  This a travel pack size of the cleanser, spray and lotion.  I love this product line!  It has helped my skin and has a nice light scent (not strong for those sensitive to strong perfumes).  I have used this for years!</li>
    <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have struggled with sensitive skin all of my life.  As a teenager, acne was an embarrassing battle for me.  Now I only have breakouts when I either become allergic to something I am using (I suspect this is from them altering the recipe, or from my own changes in body chemistry) or I try something new and I am allergic to it.  My face is always red, but my makeup covers it.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I felt comfortable going without makeup, probably when I was 10 years old.  This skin pack works.  It has been 2 weeks and my face is almost back to it&#x27;s fair color.  I had a recent breakout (I think I&#x27;m allergic to bug spray) and this skin pack has helped in clearing that up faster.  It does have a strong perfume smell, stronger than I prefer because I had suspected I was allergic to the fragrances that are in most products.  It&#x27;s more expensive than I would like, but it lasts longer than I thought it would for what little bottles they are.  I would recommend this product to anyone experiencing redness or acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pevonia skincare products for over 6 months and it has helped lessen the redness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these sample sizes as a gift for my sister to try.</li>
    <li> Not for me.  I have mild rosacea.  Was looking for something to help as my usual products weren&#x27;t working as well.  Always get mild flare ups at change of seasons.  Rosacea flared up even worse with this.  I don&#x27;t believe in the adjustment phase that some people mention.  If I had continued to use it for several weeks as they mention, I would have had the absolute worst case of my life (past 20+ years).</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!! Love this product.</li>
    <li> This product feels really nice but I saw no improvement in my skin and I was hoping for some return to normal skin tone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to sample before I bought the large cleanser. I love the cleanser as it cleans without over drying and rinses off clean. The cream I thought was okay. Nothing better than any of the others I&#x27;ve used/still use. The lotion is actually a liquid spray. I actually find it a little too strong and only use that on very hot days when I feel I need a quick refresher. The fragrance does take a bit getting used to. I do recommend the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I am 50+ and have skin that needs calming after cleansing or use of exfoliants or toners. The RS2 line in this kit is creamy and the cream leaves a moisturized, plumped-up, dewy complexion. Other women ask me what I am using!</li>
