      <li>Very pleased with awesome product.</li>
      <li>, this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Good to have on hand.  </li>
      <li>this product, is the best of the best when you overtake the sun, and you are red, the alleviate burn its almost immediate, please use it, its a help for the skin</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This product worked better than calamine lotion on my poison oak rash!</li>
      <li>HUGE bottle for a great price</li>
      <li>This is the absolute best sunburn lotion out there.</li>
      <li>OMG it is so cool and refreshing to your skin!!</li>
      <li>Nothing better for burns of all kind.</li>
      <li>I think it would be good to use on kids because it brings relief so quickly when applied or re-applied.  </li>
      <li>Will sure continue buying this.</li>
      <li>By including lidocaine, it reduces pain and burning sensations more than aloe-only, but at a concentration which is safe for periodic usage.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Wish it was still readily available.</li>
      <li>Specially for sun burn</li>
      <li>good bye old hawaiian tropic quality product, hello to another entry to a cavalcade of lesser than.</li>
      <li>As you can see, the pricing is much higher, and the discount packs are no longer offered.</li>
      <li>sunburn and first degree heat burns</li>
      <li>It numbs pretty well for OTC.</li>
      <li>Instant relief, love it.</li>
      <li>Have used this product for years and was glad to find it on the net since I can&#x27;t find a store that carries it anymore.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I could have slept without something that would really reduce the pain and that didn&#x27;t wear off too fast.  </li>
      <li>This gel had a very cooling effect and took the sting out.  </li>
      <li>It kinda burns when putting it on a sunburn but it instantly cools like ice...plus when I used it I was near a fan which made it even better.  </li>
      <li>The Hawaiian tropic is particularly useful on areas that can&#x27;t be treated with bandages such as near my heals.</li>
      <li>As a result, this isn&#x27;t a much better value than other products you can find in a drug store, especially generic formulations of aloe + a &#x27;caine&#x27; anesthetic.</li>
      <li>had a bottle previously that felt  &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; for lack of a better word, although this works I think a generic would be a wiser purchase.</li>
      <li>For a larger area, such as a sunburn on the back, wearing a light t-shirt over the  area keeps the gel from rubbing off, for instance, on bed sheets or furniture and holds the gel against the site.  </li>
      <li>It if not messy, absorbs well and stops itching while relieving pain.</li>
      <li>at least I suspect this as so many things have done this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Higher Lidocaine % than a lot of the other AloeVera gels out</li>

<li> /&gt;Beyond helping with pain, the aloe, plus several other ingredients, help to expedite healing and benefit the skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> By using aloe as the primary ingredient, it avoids the issues that ointments/oils present that can slow healing and make a burn worse.</li>
<li> I found that the thicker the application, the less pain.</li>
<li> I kept a rather thick coat of it applied, and the relief lasted as long as there was a coating of gel on my skin.  </li>
<li> My daughter got a bad sunburn and this product really helped in relieving the pain.</li>
<li> Small burns on hands can be treated by keeping a layer of gel on the burn site with a band-aid.  </li>
<li> It also contains a small amount of menthol, which also helps with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> It kinda burns when putting it on a sunburn but it instantly cools like ice...plus when I used it I was near a fan which made it even better.  Wont stop the peeling though. &#x3D;S</li>
    <li> HUGE bottle for a great price</li>
    <li> Used it on my face for derma-stamping. It numbs pretty well for OTC. Very pleased with awesome product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have always used this for sunburn but it also works for insect bites or anything that itches.  Works immediately upon application.  Good to have on hand.  Will order again.  Seller delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Instant relief, love it. Will sure continue buying this. Specially for sun burn</li>
    <li> I have an on going problem with leg edema due to diabetes and related heart issues. I have a three part treatment. Unna boot bandages...reviewed elsewhere, silvadene prescription cream and this. The Hawaiian tropic is particularly useful on areas that can&#x27;t be treated with bandages such as near my heals. The lidocaine content is low but when combined with the aloe works rapidly.</li>
    <li> I really like this refreshing product with lidocaine in an aloe base.  It if not messy, absorbs well and stops itching while relieving pain.</li>
    <li> meh, .. seems as if some key ingredients have a cheaper source at least I suspect this as so many things have done this.&lt;br /&gt;I had a bottle previously that felt  &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; for lack of a better word, although this works I think a generic would be a wiser purchase. good bye old hawaiian tropic quality product, hello to another entry to a cavalcade of lesser than.</li>
    <li> I have used Hawaiian Tropic&#x27;s Lidocaine gel for years. But recently, I&#x27;ve shifted to Solarcaine and generic brands because the price on this went up about twice of what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sunburn and first degree heat burns, this stuff is great. By using aloe as the primary ingredient, it avoids the issues that ointments/oils present that can slow healing and make a burn worse. By including lidocaine, it reduces pain and burning sensations more than aloe-only, but at a concentration which is safe for periodic usage. It also contains a small amount of menthol, which also helps with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond helping with pain, the aloe, plus several other ingredients, help to expedite healing and benefit the skin in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while the product itself is 5 stars, the price has to be factored in. For a long time, I got these in a 3 pack for about $20. As you can see, the pricing is much higher, and the discount packs are no longer offered. As a result, this isn&#x27;t a much better value than other products you can find in a drug store, especially generic formulations of aloe + a &#x27;caine&#x27; anesthetic. So I can recommend the product, but not at this price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Wish it was still readily available.</li>
    <li> Must have this on hand, at home. Nothing better for burns of all kind. It&#x27;s the best on the market! Thank you.</li>
    <li> A BIG Tip - Put this in your refrigerator and then apply it, OMG it is so cool and refreshing to your skin!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and was glad to find it on the net since I can&#x27;t find a store that carries it anymore.</li>
    <li> Awesome product helped my terrible sunburn like a charm!</li>
    <li> I had tried this brand before when I had been sunburned during a vacation.  I don&#x27;t think I could have slept without something that would really reduce the pain and that didn&#x27;t wear off too fast.  This gel had a very cooling effect and took the sting out.  I kept a rather thick coat of it applied, and the relief lasted as long as there was a coating of gel on my skin.  I had never found a cream, gel, or spray that worked so well.  I now keep a bottle on hand all the time in case of burns.  But it will also work for itching or soreness (from chafing) on the skin surface.  I think it would be good to use on kids because it brings relief so quickly when applied or re-applied.  The relief lasted a couple of hours before needing to reapply.  Small burns on hands can be treated by keeping a layer of gel on the burn site with a band-aid.  For a larger area, such as a sunburn on the back, wearing a light t-shirt over the  area keeps the gel from rubbing off, for instance, on bed sheets or furniture and holds the gel against the site.  I found that the thicker the application, the less pain.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best sunburn lotion out there.</li>
    <li> My daughter got a bad sunburn and this product really helped in relieving the pain.</li>
    <li> this product, is the best of the best when you overtake the sun, and you are red, the alleviate burn its almost immediate, please use it, its a help for the skin</li>
    <li> This is a must have during the summer. Provides instant relief from sunburns with the soothing aloe and lidocaine. This product worked better than calamine lotion on my poison oak rash!</li>
    <li> Love it. Higher Lidocaine % than a lot of the other AloeVera gels out there.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it&#x27;s the Aloe that helps you recover from your own stupidity, but it&#x27;s the Lidocaine that lets you sleep at night while you&#x27;re trying to recover.</li>
