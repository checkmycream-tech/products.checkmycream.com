### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great mousse!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I think this hair mousse is awesome!  </li>
      <li>About 1/2 that amount was perfect and I love using the product!</li>
      <li>It gives my hair body , protects it from heated appliances, and gives a great shine.  </li>
      <li>This mousse works great</li>
      <li>The thermal protection is a great bonus as well, I put my hair through heat almost every day.</li>
      <li>i leave the mousse as is, with no heat styling, it still looks great.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel good and naural, not sticky.  </li>
      <li>My hair holds all day, and the heat protection is a great bonus that keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
      <li>I purchased this mousse yesterday, used it this morning and absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is and how great it works.</li>
      <li>SO, great product, great brand and highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Now my hair poufs on its own and does not require teasing unless I want a going out look.</li>
      <li>Kind of a lot</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this mousse.</li>
      <li>This volumising mousse now helps my hair look nice and bushy.</li>
      <li>Also I like the smell of it and that my hair smell that nice after I use it.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product :)</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair but lots of it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t carry many brands as before.</li>
      <li>I was happy to get my product through Amazon and it came really fast.</li>
      <li>What more can you want?</li>
      <li>I think the foam now is more concentrated</li>
      <li>but glad Amazon has it.</li>
      <li>I just had more layers put in my hair, and this shows them off.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>have fine, but wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product very much!  </li>
      <li>It’s also alcohol free and has a mild, refreshing smell.  </li>
      <li>The mousse is the consistency of lightly whipped cream, meaning it has some body to it.  </li>
      <li>This is such a good product.  </li>
      <li>I have my hair cut in a fairly short swing bob, which demands some volume to look good.</li>
      <li>The best volumizing mousse out there for fine, thin hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this on sale at Lucky&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>So glad I was able to find it here, have looked at various stores and can&#x27;t find this exact one.</li>
      <li>So worth it.</li>
      <li>I may flat iron it if i don&#x27;t feel like leaving the curls, so that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; part comes in handy.</li>
      <li>These is some frizz, if the humidity outside get intense, so make sure to use your serums or other anti-frizz products, but besides that the product is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still cheap, so if you don&#x27;t mind tossing half the product, it&#x27;s pretty good when brand new.</li>
      <li>It provides great volume, when left in, even if i flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that tends to fall flat all of the time...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel crispy or drying, leaves my hair pretty shiny</li>
      <li>I bought this for my son and he really likes it!</li>
      <li>First of all, this product lasts forever.</li>
      <li>I recommend using the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray instead, much lighter product and does not make my hair oily at all!</li>
      <li>I use this product daily and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>This inexpensive product does the job of others costing multiple times more.</li>
      <li>i have tried many brands but have always came back to this one.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>However after a while it stopped producing good fluffy foam</li>
      <li>As far as the volumizer goes, the first half worked great</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell or feel sticky and it really does give my hair volume that lasts!</li>
      <li>I have fine blonde hair and this product really makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>Knots up my hair, doesn&#x27;t give me much volume.</li>
      <li>I lose the frizz too thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really use it as it is intended, but it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but this made my hair really oily looking by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It is very helpful in your hair holding its shape.  </li>
      <li>If I accidentally used even a teensy bit too much, it hardened my hair and made it look greasy.</li>
      <li>kind of messy, rock-n-roll look</li>
      <li>This mousse also holds my styles really well - and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, which can be pretty foggy at times.</li>
      <li>It is a very toxic product, and I believe the company has stopped selling this particular item.</li>
      <li>Before when I would do this I would have a static filled flat mess.</li>
      <li>I then use a round brush and dry my hair in sections to make sure it all gets good and dry.</li>
      <li>Decent product.</li>
      <li>Would reccomend it highly.  </li>
      <li>I notice a definite boost in my fine hair and the heat protectant is a definite plus.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s still available online--the other Tresemme volumizing mousse is safer.</li>
      <li>Aside the volume and healthy shine, it&#x27;s hard to tell I have product in my hair at all.</li>
      <li>I started using this a few weeks ago when I cut my hair, and I can see a huge difference on the days I do use it and the days that I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I use the same bottle for over 6 months and it doesn&#x27;t finish, so you really get a bang for your buck with this</li>
      <li>Using the general &amp;#34;egg sized&amp;#34; amount I would of a normal mousse</li>
      <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighed down, greasy or full of product.</li>
      <li>I put dryer on cool and blew my hair upside down, when I stood up</li>
      <li>Out of all similar products it really gives volume to my hair that last.</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very hair specific person, so I&#x27;ve tried a million different hair products.</li>
      <li>When onee finds a prodcut that they like, it seems to disappear into a new and improved one and it really is not the same.</li>

<li> When my hair is still wet</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, as my hair is really heavy and thick and often big-hair products are defeated in an hour.</li>
<li> I just put it on wet hair and blow dry upside down.  </li>
<li> I have a decent amount of hair, but it is thin.</li>
<li> My hair is a little dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> It left little flakes in my hair after I blow dried.</li>
<li> Yet it does not weigh my hair down.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product leaves my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Lightweight in feel; a heavyweight in performance! This is a great mousse! It delivers!</li>
    <li> I started using this a few weeks ago when I cut my hair, and I can see a huge difference on the days I do use it and the days that I don&#x27;t use it.  This mousse works great but it isn&#x27;t at all sticky or icky as some mousses tend to be.  I am very pleased with this product :)</li>
    <li> This inexpensive product does the job of others costing multiple times more. My hair is short, thin, and curly.  In damp weather, it can frizz.  A small dollop of this does the trick--fuller, smoother, neater. No greasy look, no sticky hair.  What more can you want?</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but lots of it. If I let my hair air dry, I look like a wet Pomeranian, but when I blow dry it by itself, it tends to become unwieldy and generally doesn&#x27;t listen. I&#x27;ve been using Tresemme Thermal Volumizing Mouse for about a year, and I adore it. It gives me just enough control to make my hair look how I want it to and a little extra lift in there too. I also have seen a difference in the shine and health of my hair - probably from the heat protection! I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mousse yesterday, used it this morning and absolutely love it!  I had volume galour!  I dried my hair 80%, added the mousse, dried with a round brush, holding in place so it held shape of brush all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;Then I put dryer on cool and blew my hair upside down, when I stood up, I had volume like I&#x27;ve never had.  I just had more layers put in my hair, and this shows them off.  Definitely will keep using.  Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, but wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair when used correctly. If I accidentally used even a teensy bit too much, it hardened my hair and made it look greasy. I figuratively threw my money in the toilet with this one.</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse that give volume to my hair. They used to keep it in all the drugstores but since drugstores are all converted in mini-groceries...they don&#x27;t carry many brands as before. Groceries don&#x27;t carry food brands because they keep drugstore stuff; freaking crazy world!! Here we are online searching for the products we really like because retail sucks.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that tends to fall flat all of the time... I have my hair cut in a fairly short swing bob, which demands some volume to look good. I always use a hair dryer and a flat iron every time I style my hair. When my hair is still wet I add this product just as it instructs to and towel dry my hair until it isn&#x27;t dripping wet. I then use a round brush and dry my hair in sections to make sure it all gets good and dry. Before when I would do this I would have a static filled flat mess. Now my hair poufs on its own and does not require teasing unless I want a going out look. My hair holds all day, and the heat protection is a great bonus that keeps my hair looking healthy.</li>
    <li> The best volumizing mousse out there for fine, thin hair. Trust me i have tried many brands but have always came back to this one. So worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and when I could not find it in stores, Amazon came through for me.  It gives my hair body , protects it from heated appliances, and gives a great shine.  I&#x27;d be lost without  it.</li>
    <li> This product performs as promised.  The mousse is the consistency of lightly whipped cream, meaning it has some body to it.  So when dispensed it doesn’t start to disintegrate like some of the lighter mousses do.  Yet it does not weigh my hair down.  It’s also alcohol free and has a mild, refreshing smell.  For those concerned about animal testing as I am, this product has not been tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Decent product. I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> My hair is a little dry and frizzy. This volumising mousse now helps my hair look nice and bushy. I lose the frizz too thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> I think this hair mousse is awesome!  The shipping and price were affordable and I would recommend anyone to order this product.</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair and this product really makes a difference.  My hair is noticeably thicker and it does seem to protect from the heat. I just put it on wet hair and blow dry upside down.  Hard to find in stores but glad Amazon has it.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and absolutely love it.  I notice a definite boost in my fine hair and the heat protectant is a definite plus.  When I think about subjecting my hair to 400 degree temps daily, I get anxiety but when I use the Tresemme Thermal Creations line, I know I&#x27;m doing everything I can to avoid damage.</li>
    <li> Using this I definitely saw a difference in the amount of split ends I had but this made my hair really oily looking by the end of the day. I recommend using the Tresemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Protective Spray instead, much lighter product and does not make my hair oily at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he really likes it!</li>
    <li> This is such a good product.  It is very helpful in your hair holding its shape.  Would reccomend it highly.  It also is a&lt;br /&gt;quick and effient delivery.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with this mousse. It left little flakes in my hair after I blow dried. I went back to got2be collagen boost volume mousse and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> With all the jels and moussee on the market, they change them often. When onee finds a prodcut that they like, it seems to disappear into a new and improved one and it really is not the same. I was happy to get my product through Amazon and it came really fast.</li>
    <li> Love this product very much!  Out of all similar products it really gives volume to my hair that last. Also I like the smell of it and that my hair smell that nice after I use it.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product lasts forever. I use the same bottle for over 6 months and it doesn&#x27;t finish, so you really get a bang for your buck with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I am a very hair specific person, so I&#x27;ve tried a million different hair products. My hair is wavy/curly, so it could get annoyed sometimes. This mousse makes my hair manageable. I don&#x27;t really use it as it is intended, but it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I put some in my hair after the shower, with serum occasionally for extra shine and to obliterate the potential frizz, and then let it dry. I may flat iron it if i don&#x27;t feel like leaving the curls, so that&#x27;s where the \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; part comes in handy. This product has protected my hair so well. I have seen no heat damage and I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year in this manner.&lt;br /&gt;If i leave the mousse as is, with no heat styling, it still looks great. These is some frizz, if the humidity outside get intense, so make sure to use your serums or other anti-frizz products, but besides that the product is great. It provides great volume, when left in, even if i flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found a hair product that works!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a heat guard product as the name implies. If you go to their website, you&#x27;ll learn that the \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; part in the name refers to the way ingredients work when under the heat. it&#x27;s suggested to heat guard the hair with another product in addition to this one.    As far as the volumizer goes, the first half worked great (volume + no grease residue). However after a while it stopped producing good fluffy foam (yes, I shake and turn upside down). Now the hair gets oily look sooner and my scalp ITCHES. I think the foam now is more concentrated (it looks firmer and comes out as stream). Tried to use less - same result. It&#x27;s still cheap, so if you don&#x27;t mind tossing half the product, it&#x27;s pretty good when brand new.</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because I would just caution about the amount you use.  Using the general &amp;#34;egg sized&amp;#34; amount I would of a normal mousse made my hair stiff and sticky.  About 1/2 that amount was perfect and I love using the product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Works well, but makes hair feel textured given that they ask you to use quite a lot--three egg size dollops.</li>
    <li> This is the only mousse I use.  Makes my hair feel good and naural, not sticky.  So glad I was able to find it here, have looked at various stores and can&#x27;t find this exact one.</li>
    <li> Check EWG on this one. It is a very toxic product, and I believe the company has stopped selling this particular item. Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s still available online--the other Tresemme volumizing mousse is safer.</li>
    <li> #1 essential I need in my hair care!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell or feel sticky and it really does give my hair volume that lasts! I have a decent amount of hair, but it is thin. I like how my hair feel when I use this product and how long it lasts. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighed down, greasy or full of product. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at Lucky&#x27;s. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, as my hair is really heavy and thick and often big-hair products are defeated in an hour. So sometimes to get the big-hair, kind of messy, rock-n-roll look I&#x27;ll wash my hair every 2-3 days, pile on a load of volumizers and hairspray, blow dry &amp; roll it. Kind of a lot, yeah?! This mousse does all that. I&#x27;m not kidding. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is and how great it works. The volume in my heavy hair lasts till my next wash. It doesn&#x27;t feel crispy or drying, leaves my hair pretty shiny and if there is a smell to it, I can&#x27;t tell. Aside the volume and healthy shine, it&#x27;s hard to tell I have product in my hair at all. I also don&#x27;t have to use 10x the amount recommended. Two \\&quot;egg\\&quot; size dollops is all I need. The thermal protection is a great bonus as well, I put my hair through heat almost every day. But I still use the thermal heat-tamer spray also from Tresemme anyways. This mousse also holds my styles really well - and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, which can be pretty foggy at times. SO, great product, great brand and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Knots up my hair, doesn&#x27;t give me much volume. ;( Very disappointed!</li>
