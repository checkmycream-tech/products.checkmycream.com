      <li>They&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>

      <li>- maybe I can get more use out of mine! :-)</li>

      <li>Love them and would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>I would say that #953 (Duet fiber foundation) is my favorite</li>
      <li>Most of these brushes can be used with liquid or cream foundation and powder.</li>
      <li>I have tried top name brand</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.</li>

      <li>bristles are soft and good use!</li>
      <li>They are super soft, easy to clean and work great!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for powder and cream blush.</li>
      <li>I bought this set along with two others and they are all absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>Also the handles are shorter than the standard MAC or Sigma brushes, thus being great for travel-just need a brush roll for that.</li>
      <li>its a GREAT foundation brush, compares with the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki brush.</li>
      <li>They are VERY soft on the touch to the face, I have small hands so the length of the brush is perfect for me... not to mention easy to carry around with me when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes come in a plastic cylinderical container that you can use for carriage, but the top seems to pop off sometimes.</li>
      <li>The color is vibrant, the handles are very smooth and easy to hold, and the bristles are perfectly soft and apply color very easily.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>the brushes are super soft, I love how my skin gets smooth and buffed.</li>
      <li>You can use it for foundation, blending concealer, setting the concealer with powder, apply brush, high light, etc, etc!</li>
      <li>I would still very much recommend them!</li>
      <li>I recently stumbled on to Bdellium brushes and I love them!</li>
      <li>especially for how cute they are!</li>
      <li>These brushes come in a nice cylindrical container and are individually wrapped.</li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with these and will absolutely recommend them.</li>
      <li>My first time with this brand for my mineral make-up.</li>
      <li>For all the Eco-friendly persons and for the others, I absolutely recommend them!</li>
      <li>I look forward to buying more bdellium brushes in the future.</li>
      <li>I personally haven&#x27;t used these a lot yet, but let me admit that it&#x27;s more because I tend to wear foundation and not minerals.</li>
      <li>I have never used the higher end brushes from like Mac or Sephora</li>
      <li>They are the first set of brushes I bought</li>
      <li>I really love these brushed, they are super soft and no shedding once so ever.</li>
      <li>They are so soft and  I really feel that my makeup goes on smoother which of course makes it seem more natural.</li>
      <li>The bristles are super soft and dense.</li>
      <li>They are super soft and very well assembled.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this set!</li>
      <li>I received them super fast and would definitely recommend these to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was concerned that after I washed them for the 1st time they would not be as soft but many washes later they are still just as soft as the 1st day</li>
      <li>Cruelty-free and a high quality product.  </li>
      <li>I had heard really positive things about these brushes and was curious if the hype about them was really true.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a little over a year, and I still love them.</li>
      <li>The bristles are dense and very soft.</li>
      <li>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that they take a long time to dry after being cleaned (like more than 24 hours).</li>
      <li>I actually dont really use all of it, just because they&#x27;re all for face</li>
      <li>And are always as soft as the day I got them.</li>
      <li>I have been using these brushes for about a couple weeks now (almost everyday) and I must say they are worth the price!  </li>
      <li>Ok first off, the previous review is for the wrong item so don&#x27;t pay attention to it.</li>

<li> The bristles are firm yet soft which help you use product efficiently without waste.</li>
<li> That said, at least for me, these don&#x27;t have any other use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If you are a mineral makeup person, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in these.  </li>
<li> The brushes that came with the BareMinerals makeup in the starter kit are just terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> are really pleased with the product and shipping! bristles are soft and good use! excellent value for money! the experience is definitely to be repeated! bye bye</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a travel size brush to fit in my make up box, and these are very cute and works amazing. the brushes are super soft, I love how my skin gets smooth and buffed. I actually dont really use all of it, just because they&#x27;re all for face and I think two brushes are enough to set the face makeup. cleaning process is a killer, but that has nothing to do with the brushes itself. It&#x27;s a great product. Do not regret paying the money for it.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a good quality foundation brush set for some time now, and stumbled on this set. I ordered them because they had the best reviews out of other sets shown. I really love these brushed, they are super soft and no shedding once so ever. I received them super fast and would definitely recommend these to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a little over a year, and I still love them. They are very good quality brushes, I clean them with baby soap and water... And are always as soft as the day I got them. I would still very much recommend them!</li>
    <li> I only gave this item 3 stars because only the foundation brush &amp; a few of the eye brushes really do what theyre intended to, teh rest shed a lot, &amp; the so called \\&quot;leather case\\&quot; isnt real leather, so save ur money &amp; dont even waste it on this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using these brushes for about a couple weeks now (almost everyday) and I must say they are worth the price!  I have never used the higher end brushes from like Mac or Sephora but I DO KNOW that these brushes do NOT shed like some do.&lt;br /&gt;I wash them after every use with the Sephora Daily cleanser and it has NOT shed on me once.  They are VERY soft on the touch to the face, I have small hands so the length of the brush is perfect for me... not to mention easy to carry around with me when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes come in a plastic cylinderical container that you can use for carriage, but the top seems to pop off sometimes.</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  Cruelty-free and a high quality product.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok first off, the previous review is for the wrong item so don&#x27;t pay attention to it. I almost didn&#x27;t buy these because of that-silly me!  These brushes come in a nice cylindrical container and are individually wrapped. The bristles are super soft and dense. The ferrels are nice and sturdy. Also the handles are shorter than the standard MAC or Sigma brushes, thus being great for travel-just need a brush roll for that. Overall I am very pleased with these and will absolutely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I personally haven&#x27;t used these a lot yet, but let me admit that it&#x27;s more because I tend to wear foundation and not minerals. I was kind of disappointed with these at first, but then I realized I was being unfair because these are obviously meant for mineral makeup, especially loose powders. So I dug out my BareMinerals makeup that I had given up on because it never applied right, and lo and behold, FLAWLESS!!! I actually got compliments on my skin that day.  The brushes that came with the BareMinerals makeup in the starter kit are just terrible. These brushes should come with the kit instead!  If you are a mineral makeup person, you won&#x27;t be disappointed in these.  That said, at least for me, these don&#x27;t have any other use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use them for something else, I would love to hear it - maybe I can get more use out of mine! :-)</li>
    <li> This brushes are amazing quality! They are super soft, easy to clean and work great! If you are starting with make up brushes, i truly recommend you getting this brush set (and the other Eco-Friendly Makeup Brush Sets - Bamboo Professional Line, for that matter)! The #953 its an AMAZING multipurpose brush. You can use it for foundation, blending concealer, setting the concealer with powder, apply brush, high light, etc, etc! The #957 its a GREAT foundation brush, compares with the Sigma F80 Flat Kabuki brush. My only regret is not finding this brushes earlier!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I bought this set along with two others and they are all absolutely fantastic. The color is vibrant, the handles are very smooth and easy to hold, and the bristles are perfectly soft and apply color very easily. I&#x27;ve owned these for several months now, and wash them all weekly and I haven&#x27;t experienced any color bleeding or shedding, which is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent set of brushes! They are the first set of brushes I bought and I am very satisfied with them! The bristles are dense and very soft. I would say that #953 (Duet fiber foundation) is my favorite : it gives the best finish you need for you foundation ans it&#x27;s very handy!  For all the Eco-friendly persons and for the others, I absolutely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I recently stumbled on to Bdellium brushes and I love them! This set is fantastic because it is so versatile. Most of these brushes can be used with liquid or cream foundation and powder. The bristles are firm yet soft which help you use product efficiently without waste. They blend beautifully. I especially like the 957B precision kabuki. It&#x27;s fantastic for powder and cream blush. The 955B finishing brush is interesting and fun because I&#x27;ve never used a brush like it. I use it when I want a lighter application of loose powder but would also work well for blending. I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good. The hairs don&#x27;t come out and makeup goes on nice.</li>

    <li> These are truly amazing! I have been searching for foundation brushes that are good and affordable and these were perfect!! especially for how cute they are!</li>
