      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it all static looking.</li>

      <li>When that store went &amp;#34;out-of-business&amp;#34;, I was pleased they</li>

      <li>This was a phenomenal price for this product.  </li>
      <li>have been using this shampoo for years; love it.</li>
      <li>It was especially good to her hair when we lived on a boat in the Caribbean very close to salt water with many hot and humid days.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and leaves you with really fresh smelling hair..</li>
      <li>I tried it, and noticed that my oily hair stayed clean longer and was much more manageable with styling.</li>
      <li>Super!</li>
      <li>I bought two and got free shipping.  </li>
      <li>My hair is now shiny, soft and keeps my highlights bright.</li>
      <li>leaves our hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Not too abrasive, not too light weight</li>
      <li>Nice shamoo at a decent price</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much to clean my hair and it also gives it shine.  </li>
      <li>So when I saw this product on Amazon many years later, I was thrilled and looked forward to using it again.  </li>
      <li>For any &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; who still has enough hair on his head to wash, this is a pleasant and cleansing shampoo.</li>
      <li>Although some of the ingredients in this product are not entirely environmentally friendly, it does a MUCH better job at making my hair look and feel lovely than any of the organic hair products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for years, love the way it makes my hair feel so clean, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>&quot; my hair feels super clean after just the first application.  </li>
      <li>It gives body to my fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>Somehow years later, this product is no longer effective as it use to.  </li>
      <li>, this works just fine on my naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
      <li>(At my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; age, I am fortunate to still have a full head of hair which has only gray touches on the edges!?</li>
      <li>I am almost done with my first bottle and will definitely order more..</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Iso shampoo and conditioner fifteen years ago by a friend of mine who is a hairdresser.  </li>
      <li>my scalp is free of that oily/greasy feeling, but my ends still feel soft and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted fast delivery</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft, full, and managableable.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really cleanses my hair without drying it out like Aveda&#x27;s cleansing shampoo.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I could REALLY tell a difference.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure to buy the larger size bottle, it&#x27;s a much better deal than the small bottle.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the same great product I have used in the past.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>With other shampoos, I have to use a ton of it, just to make sure my whole head of hair is washed properly.  </li>
      <li>its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason I love this stuff: I&#x27;ve never had a problem with buildup (that gross feeling you get after using the same shampoo and conditioner after a while) when using Iso and,</li>
      <li>and she said the exact same thing-</li>
      <li>I notice that I can go longer between trims, sometimes four or five months, and can make it nearly two days (if needed) between washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Becoming harder and harder to get in the normal brick and mortar outlets.</li>
      <li>The only negative is that I feel I have to use a little bit more than other shampoos to get a good lather.</li>
      <li>The real downside was that the salon she worked at was the only one nearby that sold Iso, and after she left, they stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>The ends of the hair need that extra hydration from the oils your body naturally produces.  </li>

<li> I will be buying this shampoo, and only this shampoo, for as long as I can get my hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have dry course curly hair and have been experimenting with different products.  </li>
<li> I tried everything from stupidly expensive salon products to the cheap stuff you can find at any Walmart.  </li>
<li> For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve had issues with the hair closest to my scalp looking greasy</li>
<li> Since I was washing it all the time, the ends of my hair would get dry and brittle, and then split.  </li>
<li> this stuff works, doesn&#x27;t leave a gummy residue in your hair and the only drawback has been tracking it down.</li>
<li> My hair was very dry afterwards and felt like straw.  </li>
<li> I was constantly washing my hair, which, as you know, isn&#x27;t verygood... especially for long, thick, curly hair.  </li>
<li> I spent a few years exploring the market, trying different things, thinking Iso couldn&#x27;t be all</li>
<li> My hair is crazy-long (hangs down past my bottom), super-thick, and naturally curly.  </li>
<li> I know it sounds crazy, but my hair seems to stay clean longer.  </li>
<li> /&gt;First off, a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I use it every other day and it keeps my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
<li> My wife, Mary, won&#x27;t use any other shampoo for her hair.</li>
<li> Then years later, very few US salon carries this, and it disappeared from their shelves.  </li>
<li> Typically, with other brands, I&#x27;ll use two or three handfuls of shampoo in the course of one washing.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s been at least ten years.</li>
<li> The end result is that I end up using less shampoo, which is easier on my budget.  </li>
<li> I normally don&#x27;t buy expensive shampoo, but my daughter had a lot of build up, so I paid a ton and bought some from the hairdresser.</li>
<li> Too heavy for my thin/fine hair.</li>
<li> Tried the real expensive ones and also the new cleansing conditioners which left my hair feeling stripped and brittle..</li>
<li> , hate it has no pump.</li>
<li> It made my hair feel awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my hair dresser suggested this shampoo to me...thank god I trusted her judejment.hydrates my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it all static looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hydrate my hair but it did just the opposite. It made my hair feel awful. My hair was very dry afterwards and felt like straw.  I would never recommend this product.to anyone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really cleanses my hair without drying it out like Aveda&#x27;s cleansing shampoo. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Iso shampoo and conditioner fifteen years ago by a friend of mine who is a hairdresser.  Eventually, she moved out of state.  The real downside was that the salon she worked at was the only one nearby that sold Iso, and after she left, they stopped carrying it.  I spent a few years exploring the market, trying different things, thinking Iso couldn&#x27;t be all *that* great.  I tried everything from stupidly expensive salon products to the cheap stuff you can find at any Walmart.  Well... fifteen years later, I am, once again, living in the same city as my hairdresser friend, who reintroduced me to Iso.  I will be buying this shampoo, and only this shampoo, for as long as I can get my hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a little goes a long way.  My hair is crazy-long (hangs down past my bottom), super-thick, and naturally curly.  With other shampoos, I have to use a ton of it, just to make sure my whole head of hair is washed properly.  Typically, with other brands, I&#x27;ll use two or three handfuls of shampoo in the course of one washing.  For some reason though, one palm-full of this stuff is enough to get through all my hair.  Even better, although I know the instructions say, \\&quot;lather, rinse, repeat,\\&quot; my hair feels super clean after just the first application.  Sometimes I skip the \\&quot;repeat\\&quot; part of the instructions (gasp!).  The end result is that I end up using less shampoo, which is easier on my budget.  If that were the only advantage, it&#x27;d be enough for me.  Good news for me: its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason I love this stuff: I&#x27;ve never had a problem with buildup (that gross feeling you get after using the same shampoo and conditioner after a while) when using Iso and, I know it sounds crazy, but my hair seems to stay clean longer.  For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve had issues with the hair closest to my scalp looking greasy just hours after I&#x27;d washed it.  The result?  I was constantly washing my hair, which, as you know, isn&#x27;t verygood... especially for long, thick, curly hair.  The ends of the hair need that extra hydration from the oils your body naturally produces.  Since I was washing it all the time, the ends of my hair would get dry and brittle, and then split.  I&#x27;d have to go and get a trim every month or so, or suffer with scraggly looking hair.  When I&#x27;m using Iso (my favorite is the Hydra Cleanse) my scalp is free of that oily/greasy feeling, but my ends still feel soft and hydrated.  I notice that I can go longer between trims, sometimes four or five months, and can make it nearly two days (if needed) between washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t claim that there&#x27;s no better shampoo out there, I am certain I haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
    <li> have been using this shampoo for years; love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product so I know the benefits for my type of hair.  Think hair but lots of it and curly when it behaves.  So I can attest to how great it is for me.  This was a phenomenal price for this product.  I bought two and got free shipping.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else for as good a price.</li>
    <li> I use it weekly for hydrating my hair</li>
    <li> For years this is the IT product that I use since my salon introduced it to me.  Then years later, very few US salon carries this, and it disappeared from their shelves.  So when I saw this product on Amazon many years later, I was thrilled and looked forward to using it again.  Somehow years later, this product is no longer effective as it use to.  It doesn&#x27;t even lather up and rinse and shampoo properly.  Something changed.  I will not endorse this product.</li>
    <li> Nice shamoo at a decent price, hate it has no pump. I knew that when I bought it but a pump would be nice.</li>
    <li> I have dry course curly hair and have been experimenting with different products.  Tried the real expensive ones and also the new cleansing conditioners which left my hair feeling stripped and brittle.. This shampoo is amazing!! My hair is now shiny, soft and keeps my highlights bright. It smells really nice and leaves you with really fresh smelling hair.. I am almost done with my first bottle and will definitely order more.. I also bought the matching conditioner and I am equally happy with the product... Finally my search is over!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy expensive shampoo, but my daughter had a lot of build up, so I paid a ton and bought some from the hairdresser. I tried it, and noticed that my oily hair stayed clean longer and was much more manageable with styling. I could REALLY tell a difference. So, I even bought some my picky mother and she said the exact same thing-her hair stayed cleaner and it was more manageable. The only negative is that I feel I have to use a little bit more than other shampoos to get a good lather.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist. I was able to get it in just a couple of days with Amazon Prime. all in all a perfect experience.</li>
    <li> My wife, Mary, won&#x27;t use any other shampoo for her hair. It was especially good to her hair when we lived on a boat in the Caribbean very close to salt water with many hot and humid days. And for me, it leaves her hair smelling so nice....</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years, love the way it makes my hair feel so clean, soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I used this product for years but when I moved to another state I couldn&#x27;t find it at my hairdressers.  I was glad to find it on Amazon and glad to know it&#x27;s the same great product I have used in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t take very much to clean my hair and it also gives it shine.  So happy to being able to use it again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It gives body to my fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> Becoming harder and harder to get in the normal brick and mortar outlets. buying it on Amazon makes up for this difficulty. this stuff works, doesn&#x27;t leave a gummy residue in your hair and the only drawback has been tracking it down.</li>
    <li> For any &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; who still has enough hair on his head to wash, this is a pleasant and cleansing shampoo. (At my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; age, I am fortunate to still have a full head of hair which has only gray touches on the edges!?*.....) I discovered it at a &amp;#34;Beauty Store&amp;#34; where my wife buys her &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and have used it since. That&#x27;s been at least ten years. When that store went &amp;#34;out-of-business&amp;#34;, I was pleased they it was/is sold on AMAZON.com Now I do have a source where I can buy it.</li>
    <li> Bought this and the conditioner together. My wife wanted to buy this because our stylist uses this in his salon.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves our hair smooth and silky. Works great for her as well as me. :D</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great purchase</li>
    <li> Too heavy for my thin/fine hair. Made it greasy before 20 hours haf passed. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I have split ends and sometimes oily hair and this shampoo is perfect for me. I use it every other day and it keeps my hair shiny and manageable. I flatiron my hair so dryness and split ends are often a concern for me. Although some of the ingredients in this product are not entirely environmentally friendly, it does a MUCH better job at making my hair look and feel lovely than any of the organic hair products I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner. Also, make sure to buy the larger size bottle, it&#x27;s a much better deal than the small bottle.</li>
    <li> Paired with Hydra Condition, this shampoo does an excellent job cleaning and caring for my hair. Not too abrasive, not too light weight, this works just fine on my naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo - I discovered it at the salons in Florida, and now you can buy it here. It leaves my hair soft, full, and managableable. It also has a nice light smell that doesn&#x27;t detract from my perfume. Super!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years.  I buy the largest size and fill a smaller bottle which I keep in the shower.</li>
