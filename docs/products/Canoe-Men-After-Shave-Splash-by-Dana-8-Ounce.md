      <li>For some reason I remember Canoe being a bit more potent -- not over-powering like some after-shaves that announce their presence a mile away</li>

      <li>But it is OK; I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>

      <li>It isn&#x27;t all that easy to find in stores anymore.</li>
      <li>Nice fresh clean scent.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is fine</li>
      <li>i needed more aftershave and this fills the bill.&lt;br /&gt;it has a nice soft aroma</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t know it was available in USA.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve compared it to some of the genuine article still on hand.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t like overpowering after shave, this one is really light..</li>
      <li>for it and enjoy.</li>

      <li>IT IS AN OLD SCENT THAT HAS STAYED ON THE MARKET BECAUSE IT IS SO NICE.  </li>
      <li>do not know how to describe what it smells like, but it is fresh and light but not flowery.</li>

      <li>Fresh smelling and feeling, and not overpowering to me or those around me.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and my husband has sensitive skin on his face, so we both want Canoe.</li>
      <li>Nice scent like back in the day.</li>
      <li>Why pay fives times as much for &amp;#34;Designer Fragrances&amp;#34; when the tried and true still works after 50 years being together.</li>
      <li>i like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>However it sells at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;super hot product for a man face...</li>
      <li>I bought him his first bottle in 1981 when we first started dating.  </li>
      <li>Have enjoyed this cologne for years so pleased to find it easily on line - not easy to find locally.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> actually my wife loves it. I apply it morning and just as i go to bed</li>
    <li> Somehow it just doesn&#x27;t smell like Canoe...  I&#x27;ve compared it to some of the genuine article still on hand.</li>
    <li> Was able to buy gift online in reg. size instead of trial size..Don&#x27;t care that not the latest scent, my husband loves it &amp; so do I not overpowering just smells great.</li>
    <li> i like this product very much.  Canoe has a clean crisp smell about it.  i use it daily after showering.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for somebody and he loved it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my father in-law for Christmas. He loved it! was blown away by how big the bottle was. It&#x27;s the only thing he wears.</li>
    <li> For some reason I remember Canoe being a bit more potent -- not over-powering like some after-shaves that announce their presence a mile away but akin to say Jade. But it is OK; I&#x27;m glad I found it. My wife has terrible sinuses; and, this is mild enough for us to be close and intimate (while I&#x27;m wearing it).</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find Canoe ... was so glad to be able to purchase from Amazon.  My spouse used to use Canoe over 35 years ago and he loved getting a bottle as a surprise gift.  As a plus, I love the smell too!</li>
    <li> Product delievered as requested.  Have enjoyed this cologne for years so pleased to find it easily on line - not easy to find locally.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 40 years, Dana makes a great product. The women love it. Well when I was younger and on the prowl. Sometimes it has been difficult to find, and this is a great suplier, fast shipping and great service.</li>
    <li> Canoe dates from the thirties, but it has a mellow, comforting scent. I&#x27;ve worn it for forty years and they&#x27;ll probably spray it on my corpse when my time comes...</li>
    <li> Great product.  Customer Service is outstanding.  I would like to find some Canoe deoderant</li>
    <li> Great brand, meant to actually order cologne though, not after shave.  Just ordered the after shave.  Not sure the difference between the two colognes from this brand and why they&#x27;re different prices and one is free shipping.</li>
    <li> I have used before. I just like it.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite guy colognes and my son likes it a lot</li>
    <li> A great after shave. Very mild fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and used this as a teenager. In later years I could not find it and switched to Old Spice. I don&#x27;t know what happened, (I suspect they changed to formula, which they deny) but it has a very heavy scent. Canoe is more subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite happy with it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband has used it for at least 50 years &amp; continues to use &amp; enjoy it&#x27;s wonderful scent. Great deal getting it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very nice after shave, not overpowering like some others.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have the aroma I was expecting. The other ones I ordered were fine. My problem, not knowing.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped without the box.  It leaked in it&#x27;s packaging, and it was no longer a surprise for a gift.  You couldn&#x27;t help but smell it in the mailbox and everywhere when it came in the house for a while.  I was very disappointed in the shipping.  I have purchased this through the mail before but it came boxed.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for that.</li>
    <li> Canoe is manufactured in the USA but bottled in China! Does that make sense? I don&#x27;t think so. Do you?</li>
    <li> My BF is not a fancy man and definitely not anywhere near metro but has used this forever.  Came on time with no bumps or bruises on the pkg.</li>
    <li> My husband likes it and likes the price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been around for a long time and the reason for that is it is a good value and men like it......women too.</li>
    <li> Good, quick transaction!</li>
    <li> This aftershave is a good buy for the price. Its not a new fragrance or an exotic fragrance. However it sells at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This has a nice &#x27;clean&#x27; scent.  I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;musty&#x27; products.  The best part is that my girlfriend LOVES Canoe.</li>
    <li> My wife got this for my birthday in May. This was one of the scents I wore (other was English Leather) while we were dating in the early 1960&#x27;s. She still likes it and so do I.  Why pay fives times as much for &amp;#34;Designer Fragrances&amp;#34; when the tried and true still works after 50 years being together.</li>
    <li> I have used Canoe Men After Shave Splash by Dana, 8 Ounce for many year&#x27;s now and I&#x27;m very please with it and my Wife loves it, so that sell&#x27;s it for me.....................</li>
    <li> Be aware - Canoe Aftershave \\&quot;Splash\\&quot; is NOT the same as Canoe Aftershave. I&#x27;ve been wearing Canoe for years, and ordered this recently. The scent is reminiscent of traditional Canoe, but not quite the same. It also barely has any fragrance - you can hardly tell I&#x27;m wearing it. In addition, the bottle is slightly oval, rather than round.</li>
    <li> What a deal!! Great price, received it quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used Canoe off and on for many years. My wife really likes it. I tried some other stuff for a while but I prefer the Canoe fragrance over those other products. It is not an overwhelming fragrance. It does not have the astringent or excessively sharp fragrance of other shaving lotions and aftershaves. My wife actually prefers it, though, after it has worn off a bit. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT AFTER SHAVE FOR MEN WHO DO NOT LIKE FRUITY SMELLS.  IT IS AN OLD SCENT THAT HAS STAYED ON THE MARKET BECAUSE IT IS SO NICE.  COMES WITH A DEODORANT FOR A LAYERING SMELL.  WOMEN LOVE IT ON MEN BECAUSE IT IS NOT &amp;#34;TOO MUCH&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This item shipped immediately and it was a total surprise, so thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My friend has it and it smells so good.  The one I got doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it.  Don&#x27;t know if it was old or what.  I can&#x27;t even tell when my husband is wearing it.</li>
    <li> not a fragrant as I had anticipated</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and so do I.  I bought him his first bottle in 1981 when we first started dating.  He&#x27;s been using it off and on ever since then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 1970. Love it!</li>
    <li> This was my brother&#x27;s favorite.  I introduced it to my son and now it is his favorite.  Smells oooohhhhh so good.</li>
    <li> The after shave lotion is very pleasant to put on my face when I am through shaving. It,s not too strong and leaves a pleasant feeling on my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my dad and as long as item is in stock I will continue to order product for my (very specific in taste) dad! Thanks a bunch for the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Many colognes are just too overpowering. My husband &amp; I are both happy with Canoe. I will have to investigate some travel bottles as well.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine but I like at least one other review received the product leaking. The shipping on these need to get better. This was a Christmas gift and the box was crushed and it had leaked all over and soaked into the box. You try to hide what that is as a gift now. The shipping is why I gave 3 out of 5 stars. If you want it in one piece you may want to look local.</li>
    <li> This is a very good aftershave. I like it a lot. The fragrance is very nice It does the job of an aftershave well. Soothes the skin and helps keep down the razor burns and bumps. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> i needed more aftershave and this fills the bill.&lt;br /&gt;it has a nice soft aroma and it does not smell like a whorehouse scent</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells great but n ot overpowering and does not &amp;#34;linger in your nose&amp;#34; too long, but my wife says she can still smell it on me.  Been using Canoe for years, great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> has been one of my favorite colognes for many years</li>
    <li> great fragrance, love the smell, not too musky, not too sweet....an favorite for many years.</li>
    <li> A college girlfriend gave me a bottle of Canoe After Shave and I have been wearing it on and off over the years since.  It is always the after shave that I come back to after using something else for a while, just to switch it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canoe After Shave smells nice, and from time-to-time I still have ladies at work stating that they like it and asking what brand it is. I really can&#x27;t stand those obnoxious after shaves that announce you are coming 30 seconds before you get there (or let people know you were there 5 minutes after you have already left)... and this is definitely not one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how to describe what it smells like, but it is fresh and light but not flowery. Maybe a little spice mixed with oak? I don&#x27;t know... but I like it. Fresh smelling and feeling, and not overpowering to me or those around me. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canoe has been hard to find in stores for a while, so we are glad that Amazon sellers still have it readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it and enjoy.</li>
    <li> Odor is as I remember it, but it seems a very weak product that barely maintains it&#x27;s scent for more than a few minutes.. Although I don&#x27;t like overpowering after shave, this one is really light.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again..</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent for years, and just love it for an everyday cologne - it has a nice, clean smell.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find in stores.  The majority of stores sell Canoe in the packaging with canoes on it - this is NOT the same scent as that packaged with the nautical flags on the packaging.  I think this is a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> It does not have menthol in it, normally menthol come in it. Seems like downgraded this one. Otherwise it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Used this in 1973 &amp; 1974 in Peru, South America. Didn&#x27;t know it was available in USA. Everywhere I looked they told me they &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to carry it. I tried internet and voila!</li>
    <li> I have used Canoe for 50 years... Need I say more. it is not one of those powdery, overwhelming scent that some men like to inflict upon others, this is a discreet and pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Great value - speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering or flowery. It&#x27;s fresh, clean &amp; woodsy. Smells great. Affordable. My husband actually asked me why I hadn&#x27;t purchased it, sooner!</li>
    <li> Excellent, love the aroma,good choice for the money</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband twice a year, I stock up he likes it and so do I. it smells fresh and clean on him and great for his face&lt;br /&gt;super hot product for a man face...</li>
    <li> Nice scent like back in the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for more years than I would like to remember.  It isn&#x27;t all that easy to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> My dad loves this stuff, it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere these days. They need to work on the packaging though. This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it, and both times the bottle had leaked because the lid wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight enough.</li>
    <li> I have been using this after shave for years. It is very distinctive and always gets great comments for everyone, most importantly my wife.</li>
    <li> See above. Some sort of defective packaging. Leaked in transit, but not enough to return. Canoe is great stuff, have used for years.</li>
    <li> Box was damp when opened package, about 1/4 of the aftershave had leaked out either prior to or during shipping. im thinking it wasnt a new item, had no seal.</li>
    <li> As advertised and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and my husband has sensitive skin on his face, so we both want Canoe. Love it.</li>
    <li> By all appearances this may be a knockoff. The label was on crooked, there was no tissue paper or any other wrapping around the bottle inside the box which was not sealed.  I bought 2 and on 1 the lid was not on all the way so much of it had leaked out.  The smell is the same but I need to reapply to get the same effect in comparison to the Canoe I have bought at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> A classic men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this.  It is hard to come by.  It made a great gift!  I will know where to go from now on when we get low on it.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is Fantastic.  Nice fresh clean scent.  It is a nice change from over priced aftershaves and colognes.  I have received numerous positive compliments.</li>
    <li> Watered down or worn out</li>
    <li> One of my husband&#x27;s favorites! Love it! Great price! Great shipping time!</li>
    <li> Excellent and as advertised. Please tape bottle top to keep from leaking during shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Canoe since 1969. Love it</li>
