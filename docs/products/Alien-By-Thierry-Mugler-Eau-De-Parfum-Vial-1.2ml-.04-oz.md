<li> I am not satisfied with this purchase, the spray container that it come in barely sprays out,</li>

<li> Not as I expected, this looks like a sample that you receive when you purchase Avon</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to chance it that we would be around each other</li>
<li> May work for others, however, I prefer a less chemical odor.&lt;br /&gt;Wore</li>
<li> and I would have to smell that mess.</li>
<li> Thought I&#x27;d try Alien.</li>
<li> THIS IS NO GOOD.</li>
<li> I WANT THE REAL ALIEN PARFUM.</li>
<li> I hated this stuff, too mature.</li>
<li> but I was proven wrong.</li>
<li> , I hate to even say, it reminds me of Deep Woods OFF bug repellent.  </li>
<li> I should have listened to the reviews because this stuff stinks!!</li>
<li> Give me a terrible sinus headache.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great perfume. A wonderful aroma that goes with most ocassions. And a good price, I would recommend this</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all! Something like a fragrance is so personal so even reading reviews may not help. I should have listened to the reviews because this stuff stinks!! I didn&#x27;t bother asking anyone I knew if they would like it...I didn&#x27;t want to chance it that we would be around each other and I would have to smell that mess. Straight to the trash it went. I really was hoping I&#x27;d like it but I was proven wrong.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT THAT I WANTED. I WANT THE REAL ALIEN PARFUM. THIS IS NO GOOD. I WILL NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!</li>
    <li> Excellent scent! As described and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I love Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Angel.. Thought I&#x27;d try Alien. It&#x27;s sort of &amp;#34;older lady&amp;#34; smelling to me. But that is a personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend&#x27;s mother loved it.</li>
    <li> The right size to sample a new fragrance.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t smell good on me</li>
    <li> I bought it just to try.  I am still deciding if I will get a bigger bottle. It does not last as long as I expected.</li>
    <li> too much chemical in this sample - smells acidic.  May work for others, however, I prefer a less chemical odor.&lt;br /&gt;Wore it and immediately had headache!</li>
    <li> This is the thing :) Great lasting longer projection. THE SMELL IS JUST MILD BLOWING</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I recently had gotten a free sample of it and wanted more. I don&#x27;t wear it often so the smaller bottle suits. Only 1-2 sprays needed and you can smell it all day!</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this purchase, the spray container that it come in barely sprays out, Not as I expected, this looks like a sample that you receive when you purchase Avon, I feel these are samples being sold!</li>
    <li> I had a friend who had this and I tried it and it smelled so good on me.  This one didn&#x27;t seem to last as long. Smelled the same tho.</li>
    <li> recieved on time..great product</li>
    <li> It smells really good and lasts all day. I put in on in the morning and can still smell traces of it when get home at night. I will buy a bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> Everybody compliments me on this perfume. I absolutely love it and ended up buying the larger size bottle. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought the smaller size to test it first.</li>
    <li> Smelled great on someone else but not as good on me.  Glad it was a sample size!</li>
    <li> So glad I could try this before spending the $$ to get a big bottle.  I loved it, so I made the investment and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells great</li>
    <li> I loved the Parfume.  It was a quick delievery and I will order more!  I was very happy with the whole thing!</li>
    <li> Great scent, perfect size for someone curious about the product. Scent stays on for quite a while. Will definitely be purchasing the bigger one.</li>
    <li> I hated this stuff, too mature. I actually think it smells like a harsh chemical. Glad&lt;br /&gt;it was only a sample vial. Thierry Mugler makes Womanity, also. Womanity is one&lt;br /&gt;of my favorite scents of all times, very alluring.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this ! It smells so good ! Even though it was a sample I am bummered it ran out after about 5 squirts!</li>
    <li> Nothing personal against the product, it just smells too strong on me, doesn&#x27;t mix well on my skin.  Give me a terrible sinus headache. Smells wonderful on my colleague whom I gave it to</li>
    <li> I likenthe cedar and cashmere scents, but the jasmine is overpowering, I hate to even say, it reminds me of Deep Woods OFF bug repellent.  I&#x27;m nor sure why, I found it by smelling it on a coworker and loved it.  But on me, it just gives me a headache</li>
