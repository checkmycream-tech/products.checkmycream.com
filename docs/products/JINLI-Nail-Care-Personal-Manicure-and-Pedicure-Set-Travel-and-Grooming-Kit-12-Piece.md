<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is decent for the price. The tools are of average quality and the case does look nice. However, just trying to undo the button holding down one of the tools caused the plastic/leather to tear off before the button would unsnap.</li>
    <li> Excellent but the delay in the arrival me and without tracking number</li>
    <li> The clipper things got caught during transit and when I attempted to open the case it ripped the flimsy paper faux-leather strap. The image doesn&#x27;t really show the outlandish brass colored design all over the case. It&#x27;s a bit tacky, but I just need it to clip and trim nails for the family and doesn&#x27;t leave the house so I think I will be ok with it. If this was a gift, I would be embarrassed. But, it&#x27;s nail care products. What more could I expect?</li>
    <li> So far so good. The case is cute and the clippers all work well.</li>
    <li> It works awesome!  I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s not made from flimsy material.</li>
    <li> Was nicer quality then what was expecting for the price, case is very nice and all the pieces in kit are very nice quality.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. Can barely clip my finger nails and when it does it leaves them jagged.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. It has everything you need for nail care. I may order some for Christmas so that my buddies will have one and stop asking for mine.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. The metal used is completely sturdy and easy to use, not to mention the nice compactable size. I absolutely love this product, but the best about this is the service. I honestly cannot describe how nice, helpful, and caring the service was. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Very versatile set, but as soon as you touch any of the items you can tell how cheaply made they are. But for the price...who can really complain? Get what you pay for. Not a bad product, the metal is just very thin. It makes the tweezers pretty useless as they&#x27;re so flimsy they don&#x27;t meet like they should. Same with the scissors. The handles want to cross each other instead of coming together. The case is really nice though. I might use it and just replace the items inside it!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised of the quality of this item! It far exceeded my expectations. The picture doesn&#x27;t reflect the great quality! I have not seen a set of this quality in any store! If you are looking for great quality, durable product, I would high recommnend this!!!</li>
    <li> I got this today and it is very high quality. The case itself is beautiful, and there are implements in this set that I have never seen in a manicure set before. I love it!</li>
    <li> These were cost effective enough to purchase for everyone in the house, now no one has an excuse to steal mine.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for, but I at least expected the nail clippers to work. The nail clippers are way too thick for cutting nails nicely. The curved clippers are useless, they will not cut because they are so weak. All of the tools feel and look cheap and the case will not close. I would return the set, but it&#x27;s not even worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> very nice set..everything is very sharp..</li>
    <li> This is a great selection of tools in a very nice case.  The manicure set is easy to keep track of and ready to travel.  Unfortunately, I have already broken my nail clippers; so I think they could have been more sturdily crafted.</li>
    <li> These work great. I love them.</li>
    <li> The set has so many nail care items to use. I&#x27;m very happy with how the carrying case looks and each item works really well. My only complaint is the cuticle scissors are worthless. The metal they used is flimsy and they have a dull blade.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Inexpensive, comes with all tools indicated</li>
    <li> Three of the items in the kit broke almost immediately. Had to ship it back.</li>
    <li> I bought (6) of these thinking they would make great stocking stuffers. All (6) had  defects. The cases wouldn&#x27;t close  correctly. Very I mean very cheaply made (in china) Total waste of money...fyi...They do not come with any identifying remarks so you won&#x27;t know what device does what.I did find a video so if you didn&#x27;t listen and bought this hot mess anyway you can get on line and watch the video.</li>
    <li> Great item and price!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and stepdaughter for stocking stuffers. They love them. I have noticed that the clippers do not seem sharp though.</li>
    <li> Historically I&#x27;ve not taken good care of my nails and found previous kits felt cheap and I haven&#x27;t looked after them.  I&#x27;ve had these for almost a month and I love the quality, the range of tools and how they feel in the hand.  I&#x27;m not an expert but for most people I would confidently say that this kit is just what you need.</li>
    <li> very good gave out to my girls as christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment, but the clipper quality is not so good.  I like the case, but will replace clippers with quality ones I find at beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome kit. I did read some reviews on the kit wouldn&#x27;t close. Problem solved u just have to flip of of the nail clippers around and it closes perfectly. Other than that great nail kit.</li>
    <li> Nice basic kit for home or travel. Items are sturdy and comes in an attractive case. Good for personal use or as a gift</li>
    <li> This item is a VALUE for its price. We received it exactly as it appears on its webpage. It took a little bit of extra time to arrive from China, where it is manufactured. The package fits in your mailbox. We are extremely pleased with the vendor, CLICK DOWN. They were courteous, efficient and helpful in all of our dealings with them. We recommend this product and we highly recommend the vendor, CLICK DOWN.</li>
    <li> I received the item and the case was falling apart and had tears in it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my fiance&#x27;s Christmas present. He is very conscious of his grooming habits and I thought this would be pretty manly and still functional. Most of the other options amazon has are not very manly or they are not very functional (only having a pair of clippers and tweezers). This has many little gadgets as you can see in the picture. However I didn&#x27;t realize that the clippers have smiley faces on them. This made me giggle quite a bit when i opened the package but it took forever to ship and it was actually very well made and heavy duty. I would consider this manly other than the smiley faces and very fully functional. Everything inside is very well-crafted and not flimsy at all. All in all, after the smiley faces, i think i made a great purchase for the price! :) I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> The nail care kit is shipped directed from China, so go figure as to the quality for the price. I did sanitize the set prior to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to share a few observations of my Foonee 12 pc. Nail Care kit:&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the fit &amp; finish is not to the same level as similar products you would buy at a store in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;The case is a little undersized for so many tools and required repositioning of an item or two for it to stay closed. Not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;The steel tools do not have the same perfect mirror like finish as similar items you would purchase at your local pharmacy. A few items have a brushed finish but the rest have a less than mirror like metal finish, similar to what leftover buffing compound residue might look like. To be safe, I plan to sterilize any of the instruments that might come in contact with mucus membranes or blood before use.&lt;br /&gt;With all of that said, I am extremely satisfied! All of the tools I have used so far work great! All 3 pair of nail clippers cut much better that the last 10 pair I&#x27;ve purchased locally. The cuticle nippers are super sharp and precise. If none of the other tools worked (but I&#x27;m sure they do) I would still be completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you can accept a little less fit &amp; finish, this is an unbeatable value!</li>
    <li> This kit has way more then the average person would need. I dont even know what half the things are. The nail clippers feel sturdy and cut well. The case is a piece of junk and came broken. Not only that but all the items hardly fits in the case. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to the average person. Maybe someone experimenting with doing manicures.</li>
    <li> The case doesn&#x27;t stay closed</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping just got one thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everything is for but the quality is good. I have a set at home and at work.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality tools at an absolutely fantastic price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice kit.  Superfast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like it only thing is the twizzers are very flimsy..</li>
    <li> Nice product! Tools are sharp...and they seem to be of good quality!</li>
    <li> This is a cool set, but it didn&#x27;t have a picture of the outside of the case when I purchased it.  Wished it had, because it was a gift for my nail-biting husband and the outside is a little too feminine for his taste.  Cool tools though.  Not even sure what some of them are for....</li>
    <li> Needed at new nail grooming kit. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Narrow openings.  Must have designed for little people.  Rough edges.  Especially file is soooo rough.  So cheap I rated 2.  Wish I could find some good quality products...</li>
    <li> They are keeping me trimmed. The quality is also good. I can not complain. It&#x27;s everything needed in one set.</li>
    <li> Awful purchase. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Everything broke. Cheap all around.</li>
    <li> Not the most fancy product in the personal hygiene area, but gets the job done and done well. The case is pretty cheesy, but the tools perform well for some minor personal grooming. Found that I only manage to use about 3 to 5 tools in this kit with any regularity (and probably about as many i&#x27;ve never touched).</li>
    <li> all of the clippers are sharp and cut nicely. It is sturdy and feels like the set will hold up for a long time :)</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift and my partner loved them(likes to keep his feet and hands on point) seems to be nice quality for really a good price of $7.39. You get a lot of tools for the price. Was able to throw away all our old ones and replace it with this kit.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I think this kit could be very good for someone with thin nails. Unfortunately, my nails are quite this none of the pieces in this set can quite handle them. Rather than cutting straight through my nails, the clippers seem to &amp;#34;chew&amp;#34; their way through and require a little extra pressure and twisting than any clippers I have every used before. The same is true of both sets of clippers and scissors. However, my wife has extremely thin nails and this set works just fine for her.</li>
    <li> Good looking case holds all of the essential items necessary to keep your nails looking good. Appear to be good quality items for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous manicure set that I was proud to give as a gift. The tools are well made and work well. The exterior is sophisticated and classy. Just the right size for a purse or travel bag. I even bought one for myself. smile</li>
    <li> This kit is so worth more than the price.  Items are not inferior and I have received compliments from those persons that I gave these to for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> This manicure kit is a very good deal. Nicely made.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It has a ton of implements - some of which I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need, but I&#x27;ve used everything in it so far - and an awesome hard case. the hard case was important for me since it spends most of it&#x27;s time at the bottom of my purse being abused by everything else in said purse. Part of the fabric cover has started to come loose, but it doesn&#x27;t bug me.&lt;br /&gt;The smiley faces on the clippers are a little creepy though.</li>
    <li> Nice tools. You could probably add a room to your house with these things. Cute case, too. And the shipping was pretty darned fast. I can&#x27;t ask more.</li>
    <li> the tools were very dirty and had to be cleaned individually before using. Looks as if it was just sitting around a warehouse unprotected for years.</li>
    <li> Great set for the price! Not sure what many of the tools are for though.</li>
    <li> The picture hid the fact that it had girlie looking gold swirls on if. It would have been great to go with my husbands overnight kit like suggested, but didn&#x27;t look like a opulent manicure set, not for a man.</li>
    <li> good heavy construction</li>
    <li> Awkward to use, poorly crafted.  Would not recommend.  I would of spent a little more to get something of better quality .&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed !  Did not send back had thrown out packaging and didn&#x27;t want the hassle.</li>
    <li> Product quality is not good as shown and the case broke in 2 weeks</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t tell from the photo but the case for this has a distinct floral pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail clippers don&#x27;t close evenly so each time a nail is cut it needs to be pulled and torn slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers likewise don&#x27;t close evenly, and hairs don&#x27;t get pulled but instead cut. This can be alleviated by pinching the included nail file and pulling several times with the tweezers.</li>
    <li> The case will not close unless you take out the nail care tools that the case comes with.  Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> Well, I got exactly what I paid for. It&#x27;s NOT a high quality product. It&#x27;s a cheap nail care kit made with love by our friends in the great land of China. It has a pile of different tools for your pleasure, most of which I have no idea what they&#x27;re used for. Fortunately they did a good job of clipping my nails.</li>
    <li> Solid feeling tools. Everything that should be sharp is very sharp and all other edges have been adequately smoothed. Case will not close if items are slightly out of position, which is mildly irritating, but necessary to keep the case compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product ships directly from China, with standard delivery (to Washington DC, USA) taking over a month. Information on the customs label was incorrect, with the item classified as a gift and described as a &#x27;phone case.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Purchased as a stocking stuffer, the recipient was happy.</li>
    <li> ordered 2 sets one to keep and one to give as present... gave both away as quality is just okay, cutters have misaligned jaws</li>
    <li> This tool kit has everything one needs to do a manicure.  Excellent tools!  I will be buying 2 more as gifts</li>
    <li> It was damaged on arrival!</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Just received it; one week earlier than promised. First impression is that it&#x27;s of really cheap material. But, I&#x27;m gonna be trimming my nails not performing surgery. The items are really packed in the case tight. I can barely close the case. One 3.5 earthquake and it will pop open. Luckily, the items are secure and probably won&#x27;t fall out even if it opens. The case actually opened during shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this kit, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This item is an okay item. It took a long time to get here. One of the loops in the manicure set was broken. The instructions are written in Japanese or Chinese but overall its okay; you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Seems high quality.  Lots of tools!  No instructions though or anything to tell you what the tools are or what they do.</li>
    <li> This is a well built, high quality set.  I am happy with the purchase and it well exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> This set is cheap. Yes the fingernail snippers are kind of dull, the cuticle nippers were so dull they were not useable, HOWEVER, for the price, you get a set with lots of tools to use, so if you aren&#x27;t familiar with manicure tools, and want to see what everything is before you buy the expensive ones, this may be a good way to go.</li>
    <li> Nice case but some items are poorly made.</li>
    <li> received but the case received (not like pictured on Amazon) is very &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; and not for man at all!</li>
    <li> Okay I guess. A lot of things (I don&#x27;t know what half of them do). The quality of the nailcutters is absolutely awful. It feels like there are microscopical ridges throughout the part that you cut and the nails get caught on everything until you use a filer to even it out a bit. One of the cutters broke in half within a few days of receiving it. The rest of the things are great. Just angered at the quality of the cutters (yes it&#x27;s cheap, but I can still buy nail cutters for a dollar and get better quality).</li>
    <li> Excellent quality item A+</li>
    <li> Has everything I think I would ever need to take care of the basics. Most of the pieces (save the clippers) feel like aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Everything stays together and in their place, even when the case is shaken around.&lt;br /&gt;- The case feels solid.&lt;br /&gt;- Clippers cut well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Minor con, but I think the opening clip is backwards. If I&#x27;m holding the case in my right hand with the case&#x27;s hinge facing left, pushing the button in, it rises with the lifting side. Not a very big deal, but just something I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;- Sewing job looks a little choppy and one of the seams that separates tools has come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the product and price.</li>
    <li> Has all of the too;s needed to do a personal Manicure &amp; Pedicure Set both at home and while traveling.  Got this set for my 89 year old mother and she loves it and uses it almost daily.</li>
    <li> strong and not cheaply made</li>
    <li> Really nice stainless set.  I had a similar gold plated one from a while back, this is an excellent replacement.  All the tools are quite well made and have a nice heavy feel to them.  I just find  the smiley faces mildly annoying.</li>
    <li> Not good quality pieces.  Cheap.  They were housed in a very nice case though.  Tools were also not very sharp</li>
    <li> Has absolutel everything I needed plus things I didn&#x27;t know existed. For great price. One things I was not happy with is color. It said brown if you were just buying one of them but it came with the same pattern when buying multiples cases. The black with gold sortof waves design. It is more feminine than I like, and was not brown as described. I can live with it though</li>
    <li> I returned the item because it was in the mens section and it has a very girly design to the outside of the case(not shown in main picture but is shown in the return/review icon) As for the actual quality, its just ehh...nothing special. just your average made in china thin cheap metal. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the clippers, the scissors are flimsy but does the job, other items all work.  Really surprised by the quality and the case is decent and held up during our recent trip.</li>
    <li> Nice set. Like the case. Have used it often. Thanks</li>
    <li> Has everything I needed in a nice case. Not too big either</li>
    <li> The tools in this kit are too small for my use. Gave it to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> Very feminine-should have said that!</li>
    <li> Really cheap quality. What can you expect for $9 though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers don&#x27;t work. The clippers arent very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found a need for the other tools</li>
    <li> I would recommend it. Its not top of the line but its not garbage either. So go head and purchase mine came fine free of defects.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality...</li>
    <li> I bought one of these kits for each one of my children as stocking stuffers! BEST IDEA EVER! Now they never come looking for my clippers or tweezers!</li>
    <li> nail cutters broke after first use</li>
    <li> Love it! Comes in nice case. My husband is now jealous. I am going to have to buy him one too. The clasp didn&#x27;t click at first but after messing with it, it is working fine.</li>
    <li> Great value, seems to be made of good materials</li>
    <li> Still using it, tools are great everything has lasted</li>
    <li> Poor quality, should have known at this price.</li>
    <li> Make no mistake: you get what you pay for. The quality of these items is very low - scissors and clippers are not sharp and they are basically useless.</li>
    <li> No stars would be better. I threw it straight in the trash</li>
    <li> Not good quality...that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> exceeded expectations -</li>
    <li> For the price this is by far the best Nail Care kit I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned when it took weeks and weeks for this to arrive, but it was coming from China and I know customs can really present a hang-up for goods coming into the US from any Asian countries.  When this arrived, I was shocked not only at the great quality of the case, but the number of items inside and they seem well made.  I will re-review if anything breaks apart before it&#x27;s time...but the metal used is not flimsy and the items appear well made.  Like some other reviewers, I am not sure what all the items even do - so I need to investigate some of the components included.  All in all I am surprised at the quality for the price, this would easily sell here in the US for a lot more.</li>
    <li> The instruments are so crudely made as to be worthless to use.  Nice case though.  Instruments look good, just to crude to work.</li>
    <li> This is a nice kit for the price. There are a couple tools I don&#x27;t really have a need for, but the ones I use do the job well.</li>
    <li> First the good: there are many nice tools in here, and some I had never seen or used before but now enjoy. The bad: the main fingernail and toenail clippers are not very good. They do not have enough spring in them to open them back up after you push down on the lever, so the &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34; is too narrow and it&#x27;s hard to get around the nail without extra effort. It&#x27;s too bad, as otherwise it would be a really nice set. That said, still not bad for the money. The scissors-type clippers are really good, and I&#x27;ve actually come to use those for clipping my fingernails.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use half of the stuff in this pack, but it looks to be made of good material.  I just bought it for replacement of other stuff and so far the clippers are decently sharp and work well for my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> Really great nail set, lots of useful items here to help keep yourself manicured.  I enjoy the clippers the most, work really well, are strong and cut right through.</li>
    <li> This set is soooo chip that every single item of this set cuts from more side then just one. I was filing my nails and got such a nasty cut when I was filing the side of the nail that it took me a week to heal it. And thats only a filer..</li>
    <li> For someone who isn&#x27;t a nail queen this set was overwhelming (too many implements for me) .  Having said that however, my daughter who IS a nail queen liked it so I gave it to her.  I was impressed with the implements, however the nail cutter seemed...dull.  The case won&#x27;t stay closed.  But for 8 bucks (basically) what do you expect?</li>
    <li> The item is working very well, I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this manicure set. Not only does it fit perfectly in my purse (it&#x27;s smaller than my wallet) but the quality of the pieces are fantastic also! They are solid and look to be very well made!</li>
    <li> Well worth and my wife is very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Very basic kit, the metal feels light and a bit skimpy bit it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the price paid for them. Way cheaper.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Cheap metal barely works.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a bad piece, but every time I flip the lever on the nail clippers the pin just shoots off.  Pretty dangerous, especially earlier since I forgot and it nearly hit me.</li>
    <li> Lots of interesting tools in this kit, but they don&#x27;t seem to work as well as I expected.  Kit came in a case that didn&#x27;t match the picture, and the items are packed into the container which sometimes doesn&#x27;t close if you don&#x27;t have them just right.  The only redeeming part of this kit is that the cost is very good for the amount of items that you receive,  just don&#x27;t expect high quality.</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised. The lid of the box doesn&#x27;t close sometimes but overall the stuff inside is really good quality.</li>
    <li> Great looking case, all the clippers work very well. THere is some stuff that I don&#x27;t know what it could be used for, but the case hides them well.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWS.</li>
    <li> great for a price. I am sure I can find better, just didnt want to splurge</li>
    <li> Quality of case is fair, Clippers are not particularly sharp.  I am not sure I would have purchased this if I were at a store and could see it first hand.</li>
    <li> Great case, great price, but the nail care tools themselves are mediocre. I plan on replacing the tools with better quality ones.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Poor cutting quality.  The &#x27;emery board&#x27; is craptastic. This is not a good set.</li>
    <li> This set is very nice. All the tools are very sharp. All the toe nail clippers have happy faces on them. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So far, highly impressed for the cost and quality.  The clippers are indeed sharp and the quality is better than most of the items you buy individually at most stores.  I actually would compare this to a x-mas gift set I got a few years back from BB&amp;B.  Have had relatives visit see it in the bathroom and ask me about it.  I just order another set and have it delivered to them.  Well worth the money.  Impressed.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of tools. Has everything I needed and strong products. Another great surprise was the price.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality product</li>
    <li> i ordered this product because of an ingrown nail i was having problem with.  I needed a plier type clipper to help me with the ingrown nail.  With all the other items in this kit., there was no way I was not going to handle this painful situation.  Thie item came equipped with all the necessary tools to take care of your nails.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute must have for the business traveler or even home-body. All the tools were assembled just as advertized, the shipping was unbelievably quick, and the product looks incredible. I was expecting just a basic kit, and what I got was everything I could need while away. All the tools that I&#x27;ve used thus far are sharp, shiny, durable, and most of all clean. I&#x27;m very impressed with this seller, their product, and the shipping. It came a day after I ordered.</li>
    <li> First off I really like the case! The instruments inside not as much. The thickness of the instruments is thin and they are very small. The \\&quot;throw\\&quot; on the clippers (the amount of distance it takes to close while in use) is long. What I mean by that is when you place the clipper on the nail and begin to press them down you have to almost press the handle all the way closed (the throw). I have a half dozen nail clippers and the throw is much shorter. The cut on the nail does not seem to be a clean cut... the nail is left jagged. The cuticle clipper has a long throw but do not seem to be very sharp and they are small. These may be ok for a woman or man with smaller hands but for me (a man withe medium hands) I find the instruments too small.</li>
    <li> The quality is not so bad. I like it! And why should I type so many words to finish this review?</li>
    <li> Not great quality, not as sharp as they should be, the case falls apart internally pretty quickly. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality of the tools and the case seem really good. the button clip that opens the case is a bit fidgety.</li>
    <li> It arrived much faster than anticipated coming from china. It came in a box that is classically &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; but the product itself is quite stylish and quality considering the price. It has a brushed stainless Art Deco aviator type design so unique and quite masculine. The tools are sharp and accurate and well made and solid. I bought a second kit at Walmart for the same price and what a piece of garbage!  Probably the first thing that will break down is the case which is decent quality as well. I will buy more of these as gifts in the future.</li>
    <li> Clippers break easily</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price, not sure what a couple of the tools do though. All in all I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This piece included a few items I didn&#x27;t expect making this set on par with those found at the spas. Totally enjoy giving myself manicures. I will purchase another kit and have the employees use this as my go to set at the spa.</li>
    <li> Got this in time, all the cool tools that i have no idea what to do with yet, but i will eventually figure it out</li>
    <li> everything i could want in a kit.</li>
    <li> yes it&#x27;s true&lt;br /&gt;it was thin and brittle and looked brown&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty grossed out, but not enough to go through the trouble of exchanging it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tons of useful tools, you can probably find a use for every single tool in there&lt;br /&gt;idk why so many are saying that they dont use most of the tools provided, maybe they dont remove their cuticles or hang nails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only tool i havent used is the one with a pointy side on one end and a loop on the other. i think this is for blackhead extraction but i&#x27;m not sure because it doesnt look as safe as the ones ive seen in stores. meaning, this one looks of very low quality like you&#x27;d create a crater on your face from using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the rest of the tools are great and very useful&lt;br /&gt;though i must admit, it can be a little difficult to remove the tools from the case. it&#x27;s a pretty tight squeeze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when it comes down to it, i&#x27;m pretty glad i bought this set. it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than most and contains everything you need to keep up your nail care</li>
    <li> But I find a use for it, even it has nothing to do with my nails. I love that it had both a large and small nail clipper, especially. It looks like they will last a lot longer than my last pair too.</li>
    <li> Pretty weak, won&#x27;t clip my nails at all.</li>
    <li> Only took a month and a half to get them in the mail but well worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> The sharpest tool is the toenail clip, which I end up using for everything because it actually cuts instead of tears.  There are some tools I&#x27;m not even entirely sure what they&#x27;re for.  The small nail clip would be the perfect size if it actually cut instead of tore your fingernails off.  And I have thin nails so I feel like they should be able to be cut.</li>
    <li> I only used the small nail clipper once.  It feels weak and flexes when I try to cut my nail, but eventually it does the job, so I can&#x27;t complain.  It&#x27;s nice to have all these tools in a case.  I like multi-tasking tools and these are it.  doesn&#x27;t only have to be for grooming.  also good for rebuilding atomizers</li>
    <li> Great for college kids that have the habit of swiping your favorite clippers when home on spring break. Got two of them!!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this product. The Nail clippers are worthless. Poor quality.  I did not think, there is a nail clipper that can not clip the nail.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband as a stocking stuffer this Christmas. He loves it. He has very hard nails and this kit works well for him. The kit is attractive and good quality. For this price you really cant beat it, heavy duty and has all you need.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Lots of godly bits I don&#x27;t know how to use, but the scissors and cuticle cutters are shop and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product.  Tools themselves are not sharp or are misaligned so they don&#x27;t perform their function well &amp; case cover started separating within a day or two of when I started using it.  Should have returned it but never got around to it.  One of the worst products that I ever purchased on Amazon.  So basically I have NOTHING good to say about it</li>
    <li> just very nice stuff only used it once so we&#x27;ll see how it holds up but it is so far worth it</li>
    <li> This nail clipper set is made of descent quality material good carry case I would recommend this product, item arrived on time and in good condtion</li>
    <li> I recieved these at a discount for an honest review. Just what I needed. Trying to save money and do my own pedicures and these tools are perfect !</li>
    <li> I bought three of the manicure kits and all of them were in excellent condition.  A very good buy and good quality utensils.</li>
    <li> It was like in the picture</li>
    <li> For the money this is an EXCELLENT set. This is perfect as a dedicated travel or purse set or an inexpensive primary. What surprised me most is the quality feel of each tool. Many of times with a cheap set you get those weak pointless pieces that bend when you look at them intensely, but each of these has an extremely STURDY feel. Also very pleased to say that each of the clippers clip effortlessly, the cuticle nippers, though a tad bigger/bulkier than I like, are sharp and have no real issues getting in there on the sides and clipping nice and close. The scissors are pretty darn impressive for the money spent on this altogether, they completely meet at every point and have a very nice edge that cuts well. As far the other tools go the nail file is a bit useless since the crisscross lines that make it a file are to far apart to provide a smooth file but the others perform as intended including a nice grip from the tweezers.Though I did received flat tipped instead of a slant tip but they gripped even the finest eyebrow hairs and I am again impressed. I know some have asked why this set over the other one that about the same price and I will say that I went with this one solely because it had a blackhead remover included and I love it. The case that everything comes in looks pretty cute and mine shuts ok but the large toenail clippers definitely strain it and I took those out to help it close better, still I wouldn&#x27;t count on it lasting very long, the tools will definitely outlast it. Overall for the price you pay I think this is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> this is awesome, there are a couple of &#x27;&#x27;tools&#x27;&#x27; i dnt know how to use but i&#x27;ll learn.... very good quality outside/inside and very sharp!! the cuticle remover works magically</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you could possible need. I honestly dont know what to do with half of the stuff in there!</li>
    <li> Good deal for that price and have all piece you need for the nail</li>
    <li> I really like the case that the kit comes in; however, some of the tools aren&#x27;t the best ones I have ever used (what do you expect for the price though?).  For example, the nail clippers just aren&#x27;t up to par with an older pair I have, so I never use the ones that came in the kit.  I really like the cuticle trimmers, but the little metal piece that keeps them slightly open and springy never stays in place, which could be annoying to some.</li>
    <li> The case falls apart very easily and the utensils are pretty dull. I never use the finger nail clippers they don&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Has everything you need. I bought for what i thought were curicle nippers and theyre not exactly what i thought but gets the job done. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even waiste your time buying such cheaply made nail kit. I bought the kit expecting that I was paying less for a whole kit than what 1 pair of nail clippers would cost , but the truth is the springs are not strong and they are not sharp only leading to ripping of my nails. Very cheaply made.</li>
    <li> No complaints with this product. So many tools that I will never use, but it&#x27;s really no big deal. The ones I do use, work great</li>
    <li> Love this personal care pack. I havent actually used all tools yet, but most are useful and of good quality. The best part is it&#x27;s very handy and easy to carry around. Great product!</li>
    <li> Really great kit at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for the man in your life. This kit is so neat, organized and well put together that my husband makes sure he always puts everything back in its little space.</li>
    <li> the nail clippers in this set are junk!! dont waste your money, now I know why the set was so cheap.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Fast ship.  Arrived much sooner than I&#x27;d expected. Very nice price.  I&#x27;d gotten 2 of these as gifts; will be ordering another for myself.</li>
    <li> Ideal for Travel or Gift-Giving..</li>
    <li> The most valuable nail clippers package I ever bought, can use it fixing everything I want to, really nice thing</li>
    <li> The tools seem to be made of decent quality metal, but they are not all finished properly. It seems like they were hastily made with no kind of quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting edges on the clipper style tools had metal shavings/dust still stuck to them. Some edges don&#x27;t line up properly and some were bent wrong and very sharp at the tips, pretty much making them all unusable. The cutting edge in the cuticle slicer/remover thing (the one you&#x27;re supposed to glide across, not a clipper style) was not a good shape for its purpose, and besides that it was also not finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a metal grinder I might be able to fix these things, but I don&#x27;t so instead I&#x27;m going to have to replace some of the tools with better quality items that I will be purchasing elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why I even ordered this because I have no clue what most of the tools are nor how to use them. But I have them nonetheless just in case someone wants to show me. Wait, I ordered it because of the case and the low price.</li>
    <li> Assuming I will be able to keep all of the parts of this kit together, it may be the last manicure kit I ever need to buy. I love the addition of the nippers, very helpful.</li>
    <li> First, the case does not close properly. But this is just the beginning, the clippers are dull, the materials are junk. Honestly I lost money buying this. I tried to use it once, and went straight to the trash.</li>
    <li> looks cheap in real product, not on pictures. however, the function of the set is fine. if you&#x27;re looking for a fancy-looking set, get something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK set that - the finish of the tools could be better - but at this price it&#x27;s a triumph of function over quality.</li>
    <li> Most of the tools in here will go unused but it&#x27;s a solid kit.</li>
    <li> Nothing impressive about the kit in my opinion.  Somethings a little cheaper than others. I think its a decent case for a guy to use. Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set for the price.  The case will not close properly but the items inside the case are will worth it.</li>
    <li> just one thing wrong  with it my but and outhers like it so much they disapear</li>
    <li> This is a pretty great set! The nail clippers aren&#x27;t my favorite, but work alright. Everything else works great and overall I am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails but got sick of carrying around all my stuff. This little set is perfect not just for travel, but for around the house, too! The tools are fairly quality. I gave four starts because one of the nail clippers was very dull (split my nails the first time I used it) and the case itself looks like it might break. Other than that, the other tools are nice and sharp and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> awesome kit for the price! quality of the tools isn&#x27;t so great but for 7 dollars its totally worth it. i just needed the nail clippers but the price of this kit was cheaper than buying just the clippers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude and it works great! This is the shiet!  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret, I don&#x27;t rate much unless it is great.  This is great.</li>
    <li> If only the product was as good as the picture - very low quality</li>
    <li> work well, good quality</li>
    <li> Great for the money.  Has all the nail related tools I need and some I&#x27;m not sure what to do with.</li>
    <li> This is a complete manicure/pedicure set. It has all the required tools. They, however, are not as sturdy as they appear to be in the photos. I do use it and will continue to do so. If you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive and functional I suppose this is a great value but I would prefer something more substantial.</li>
    <li> Only received a few weeks ago and the faux leather cover is already separating from the metal frame.  Tools are nice, but disappointed in the case.</li>
    <li> These are the best toe tools I&#x27;ve ever had. They work very well for getting hard-to-reach areas. The large toenail cutter is long to give you more leverage against tough nails. The extra tools are great for manicures. The case is nice, but the latch isn&#x27;t very sturdy. Keep a rubber band nearby.</li>
    <li> Works fine for couple of months..not a long term stuff</li>
    <li> Nice array of accessories, small clippers were not as sharp as I thought that should have been, but did the trick.  Nice compact case</li>
    <li> Real piece of crap. It&#x27;s a Chinese knock-off of very poor quality -so poor that I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my nails. The edges are uneven and the cutting blades unreliable. Since it was only $7.00 I will not bother to return it, but it will only be used for trimming wire, modeling work and such.</li>
    <li> All items were fine and met my expectations. I was happy with all the items ordered. Tks for the correct and on time shipment</li>
    <li> Case doesn&#x27;t latch properly, looks like it was damaged somewhere along the line.  Items inside case are fine, although I&#x27;m not sure what some of them are supposed to be used for.</li>
    <li> They are good quality stainless steel and they work. I have no idea what most of the tools do but $7 (from HealthSpot seller) for 3 clippers, a pair of scissors and a cuticle trimmer is more than worth it.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift for my wife. It is just what she needed to help with her nail care.</li>
    <li> The various sized clippers, and the cuticle nipper and scissors are all nice instruments, but the picks are worthless to me. The case also doesn&#x27;t close tightly around the entire edge, and the unlocking mechanism is bent. It was worth the small investment to get the four or five quality tools I actually use.</li>
    <li> Set and case are nice well built items, so far there are no complains about the product, the only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is that you need to wait too long since it is shipped from the Far East so, with that in mind, if you don&#x27;t mind to wait then I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my second set, I&#x27;ve been using the first one for a couple years. I really like this quit, it&#x27;s effective. But the second set arrived with broken nail clippers. Returned and ordered an identical replacement set.</li>
    <li> I wanted a simple and affordable kit for home use. This turned out to be the perfect fit. The case is rather convenient too. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Should have known better when you see similar products, that they were all just clones with different names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kit lasted a day.  Nail clippers came apart after first use.  Yes, I could have put it back together, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These kits are a dime a dozen.  Do yourself a favor and buy something reputable.</li>
    <li> This set looks nice, and the case is sweet, but the tools in it is a bit useless.&lt;br /&gt;As nice as it looks the tweezers are the only part useful to me.&lt;br /&gt;The other tools are bulky, and the cutting parts are not usable because the bad designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute kit, bad tools, and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a five star all the way. Everything you could need is in this elegant 12 piece set. If you are getting one as a gift, get another one for your self.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in my purse and it is pretty nice. It&#x27;s a little big, but considering all the pieces that are in it, that&#x27;s not surprising. Quite honestly I don&#x27;t know what all the pieces are, but the ones I do use are good quality and work as they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and the Case broke as soon as He opened it lol! Yet the supplies were up to part.</li>
    <li> When I came across this nail care kit I thought they were going to b cheap bc of the price but WOW they fabulous excellent product nice sturdy tools and for only 6 bucks u couldn&#x27;t even buy the nail clippers for that no less a whole kit and it&#x27;s in a leather snap shut case..I really love my kit I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Lots of tools but all are cheap. Clippers and cuticle trimmer are good but the scissors aren&#x27;t, and all stamped items were a disappointment, especially the nail file. At least the case looks nice before you open it up.</li>
    <li> this comes in handy on a daily basis for me. Great amount of tools and the price was great also!</li>
    <li> This set is complete and now I bring it everywhere I go. The most used one in here is of course the nail cutter since I almost always break my nails. Saves me from unnecessary pain . Truly a must-have for women.</li>
    <li> Some of the clippers were covered with sharp metal dust from manufacture.  I have experience with this and I know metal fragments spear into the skin and is difficult to remove, not to mention painful.  It is very dangerous if it gets into the eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the pieces had to be rinsed off with hot water and dried.  Upon use, one of the large clippers did not cut on one side.  Ironically it and the nail file was not &amp;#34;grinded or machined&amp;#34; enough making them difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if it were made correctly.  Target, here I come.</li>
    <li> The small kit was purchased for a traveler and it works as expected.  The case has everything that is needed.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my son-in-law needed!  Its case is handy for both home use and for travel also.  A nice gift.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and assembled but does the job. A couple pieces, such as the tweezers, were unusable.</li>
    <li> I do not understand a negative review for such an inexpensive set. The quality is great for the price. The case is quite nice. My only complaint is I have no idea what to do with most of these tools. If anybody knows where I can find such info please post it here.The tools I have used are great.</li>
    <li> The case does not close. It was open upon arrival, is there anyway you can send a new case only?</li>
    <li> Does a very nice job! Don&#x27;t use all the tools, but you never know when you will need them. Nice kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage boy so that he can keep his fingers and toes maintained without using my manicuring tools. He loves it, it has a hard durable case and all the tools you need. I would say its more for teens since it has little smiley faces on some of the tools (i didnt notice this when I purchased it). The tools are pretty sharp so be careful.</li>
    <li> Comes in a stylish case and has all the pieces you would ever need to get a salon-quality manicure.  The pieces fit in the case in an organized way and the smiley faces make me want to smile every time i open the case.  Would recommend for anyone that wants more than the simple clippers and nail file combo.</li>
    <li> Will not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> For under 10 bucks, was not expecting a whole lot, but the case and all the tools were of surprisingly good quality. Not sure why everything had Japanese writing stamped on it, but that&#x27;s nothing to do with the overall quality..</li>
    <li> great kit i had to ask what some of the stuff did but in the end ill find a use for it some how</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how nice this is for the price.  I needed toe nail clippers and couldn&#x27;t find the kind I like in a single package.  These are heavy and work great.  The rest of the items also.  It would make a beautiful gift. It&#x27;s that nice.</li>
    <li> inexpensive set.  Serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice quality set to own. Sometimes the clippy things can slip while you&#x27;re using them because the metal is a bit thin but overall I would buy them again. Very useful for travel. The smiley faces are a nice touch.</li>
    <li> have a lot of thins, but package is just china made</li>
    <li> I really like this and the price was right. You get plenty get plenty of tools and all work great even the case locks and is easy to unlock. Glad I bought this to replace my old zipper case one.</li>
    <li> Not only does it look sharp, but it is sharp.  Really sharp, in fact.  You have to have some sort of skill to utilize some of the tools in this kit as they are serious.  Ultimately, it&#x27;s a great price, totally worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This nail kit was very nicely priced so I was a little worried as to the quality of it when I purchased it. When it arrived I was very impressed to see how nice it was. Nothing cheap about the quality of this manicure set. It has everything you need and comes in a nice little case. Great product!!</li>
    <li> The kit has multiple instruments/tools to provide a very nice manicure. It was when one of the gift recipients opened the gift, it was noted there is a smiley-face on several of the tools. The gift recipient was very pleased with the complete set and the compact case.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Great gift for my husband. Nice case and tool set. I am glad I bought two sets.</li>
    <li> Chinese made and wait for it great quality</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Box was almost hard to close and open. with a smell. Won&#x27;t believe you can buy something good in this price.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product was decent at best. The straps that hold the tools in the case broke off or weren&#x27;t ever attached to the case when it arrived. On one of the clippers, the actual metal was cracked. The case itself was pretty sturdy but the straps and tools were obviously poor quality. The smiley faces are cute, though!</li>
    <li> Case will not close, cheap construction. Plastic Leather interior has ripped for majority of slots. Scissors do not work well at all.</li>
    <li> Damn I&#x27;m looking fine! I mean with all these new clippers, cuticle cutters, and random pointy sharp object to stab myself with while grooming I&#x27;m looking good. This is a great product you can&#x27;t go wrong unless you try and use the sharp objects to remove eyebrow hair and you accidentally stab yourself in the eye with the miniature metal weapon. In, which case you then have to go the the hospital and spend $500 large to safely remove the fifty cent tool from your eye socket. If that were to happen to you then I probably wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to you. Wouldn&#x27;t that be embarrassing though to have to explain to the doctor that you were to incompetent to successfully use a cuticle skin pusher back thingy. That would not be a fun time for anyone&#x27;s self esteem. Oh, if you do need a grooming kit then this is a good one and it cheap like me so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The product arrived after almost a month that I ordered it. Buy it if you can wait that long. Its a great product for the price if you can wait that long!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much for the price that I was paying.  But after reading so many glowing 5-star reviews here, I actually started to think that this manicure set was going to be my new best friend.  Well, the product arrived and I was disappointed.  The clippers and tweezers cannot compare with my Revlon ones.  The edges are noticeably thicker and not angled well, so you don&#x27;t get nearly as much precision.  The press-down movement of the clippers is not very controlled and the other tools are also too blunt to get around the nail effectively.  I wanted a kit to do mani/pedi&#x27;s, so for me, this set was a waste of money (but thankfully not much money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just need a set of tools that can clip, trim and nothing more, then this may do the trick.  The case is nice and compact too.  But if you are looking for more precision, ease or overall quality, look elsewhere.  And look carefully - I&#x27;ve already started my quest to find a new set, and I see that this same set is sold under many different brand names on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is obviously not a grooming kit that costs over $400.00 but for the price paid you cannot complain. Bought 4, may buy more, only to use the case which is sturdy and very mobile. The slots that hold the tools in place inside the carrying case were broken when I opened the case, or broke right away when I tried to remove the tools. I plan to use these containers for travel purposes. So the tool holder straps are insignificant for me. May buy more and keep my own personal tools.</li>
    <li> Very well made would order them again</li>
    <li> Came fast and in good condition. And what I like most is that there are various type of tools I can use.</li>
    <li> I did not find this to be a great purchase.  Maybe I need instructions to come with this but I have no clue what half these tools are for and I do not find it a good quality.  They seem &#x27;cheap&#x27; - well that is just me anyway.  I bought it cause other people has lots of good stuff to say but I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
    <li> for price good!!! took forever though</li>
    <li> My wife bought these as gifts  for a fight basket to include with shaving kits. Everyone like the little add on included in the gift. The case isn&#x27;t to bad and the items inside are decent good deal for the money. And was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nicely designed set and the case is pretty good. But I didn&#x27;t purchase it for these reasons alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is of ridiculously poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to use the fingernail clippers the lever broke under very limited pressure. As in snapped, not just came apart. The. First. Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are made of metal that is way too flexible, causing them to bend inwards too much to be of great value. I&#x27;m not even going to try the toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending the set back.</li>
    <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much --  total junk, suitable for the garage toolbox rather than personal care</li>
    <li> Great gift. My son has been using it for 2 years now and he still loves it.</li>
    <li> This set is ok if you are looking for something in expensive to keep in a travel kit or as a girls first set.</li>
    <li> Most of the stuff didn&#x27;t work.  The clippers are really awful.</li>
    <li> All of the tools are good and work well, however the case is cheap.  The fabric of the case slowly started to peel off until it eventually fell apart.  Now the case is in two halves without the protective fabric.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it! She gets little compliments from other people who care about their nails and are very impressed with its quality and really cheap price. The files are nothing to write home about but all in all this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Everything you need is there.</li>
    <li> You can clip and groom and everything works except the case which isn&#x27;t very sturdy on the closure. Stay in a drawer near my recliner so it works great. If I had to carry this when I am traveling I would be greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap stuff, the steel is not good. But think about the price, it&#x27;s OK. If you have money, can switch to a better one.</li>
    <li> the case is worth the full price i paid for this set.  it keeps everything neatly in place.  however, i&#x27;m going to have to replace all of the clippers because none of them are sharp</li>
    <li> This set is nice. It has a nice case. The nail clippers are sharp. Not super high quality, but, does the job. Love the price..&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Mrs. Rick</li>
    <li> The quality and presentation exceed the price point. I would recommend these to the individual who needs to have a few gifts on hand for that unexpected occasion.</li>
    <li> The case and the tools are nice. I don&#x27;t know what to do with half of the tools though, and there&#x27;s no instructions indicating what they are. The clippers are not particularly sharp.</li>
    <li> Local grocery store has a fancy pink case with 3 or 4 tools in it for the price of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive kit that does an OK job.  The pieces are pretty flimsy.  I&#x27;m male so I really just need to clip my fingernails/toenails every now and again or use one of the other many tools to take care of a hangnail.  Don&#x27;t expect to get the case that&#x27;s shown, however.  There is another set on amazon that is the same thing but has a far more feminine looking case - that&#x27;s the one i got, not the one pictured.  Not a huge deal, as it works fine but this is the type of thing you&#x27;d want to be gender specific.  If I&#x27;d gotten the case pictured, I&#x27;d give it four stars, given the price.  However, I give it two stars for having to have a girly looking case on my desk.</li>
    <li> Casing is ugly and not as described</li>
    <li> It took me one month to receive the package but I must say, this manicure set is worth the wait! I love the completeness of the set and it is very handy.</li>
    <li> materials are cheaply made, they said it had 12 piece but....received only 11 piece,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great set for starters and trail size is great also</li>
    <li> great deal for all the tools you get! very sturdy and good quality ..cant find a bad thing to say.. really good little set!</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for, every piece came to me,clippers are sharp and precise.Containing box was very functional and handy.</li>
    <li> Kit looked nice and got some good reviews, and I needed new fingernail clippers. Seemed perfect. However, When I received the kit, the tweezers were in two separate pieces because they are cheaply made. Seller offered to exchange my kit but I have tweezers so I just threw out the broken pair and replaced with my own. Not a huge deal. However, the clippers (all three sets) are too dull to cut anything. What good is a nail cutting kit if it doesn&#x27;t cut any nails? It only gets two stars because I like the organization the case offers.</li>
    <li> Good deal....couple minor setbacks. This was a great deal, I have been having a lot of hangnails lately and I bought this case to take better care of my hands. This set comes with so many useful utensils, and I do not think there is any other better bang for your buck on Amazon right now. The only minor downfall to this kit is the case; it is a bit flimsy seems rather cheap...but I guess the whole package was rather cheap so it doesn&#x27;t really matter. Go ahead and buy this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Cheap kit. Cut my toe open with the metal file. Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Cute but not sharp.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a first time manicure set for an 11 year old.  Although some of the tools are unfamiliar, it serves a purpose.</li>
    <li> love this set..very sharp and a great variety of tools..quality made and a nice carry case also small enough to pack and .nice leather case..well made,would highly recommend this set for the money..</li>
    <li> It arrived yesterday, all instructions were in Chinese, cheaply constructed. barely an adequate set. Would be more careful when purchasing something like that</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my husband as a last minute Christmas gift. He was in search of &#x27;nail clippers that actually cut&#x27;, and I was hesitant to buy this, sight unseen.  Based on the reviews, I took the plunge and he is pleased overall.  There are things in this set that we have no idea what their job is.  Also, some of those mystery tools are loose in their holding places in the case, so when the case is opened, they are close to falling out.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good manicure set at a great price, give this one a try! The case isn&#x27;t too gender-specific, either, so my husband isn&#x27;t uncomfortable owning it!</li>
    <li> very nice product. I ordered it for stocking stuffers and it filled the bill. Anyone could benefit from having this item.</li>
    <li> Does the job and then some.  Some of the pieces my husband had no idea what function they performed so we looked them up and he is now utilizing more than 2 or 3 of the 12 piece set.  Sturdy and durable.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect gift for my fiance&#x27; we travel and he loved this gift. Will use this seller again if opportunity arises</li>
    <li> This set have all the tools you need in a manicure kit</li>
    <li> This set looks very nice, but there are no instructions as to the function and purpose of most of the tools. The clippers and some other tools fit so tight in the hold down straps that one of the straps has already broken after only a few uses. The clippers look like good quality but do not cut very well as they leave a burr that must be filed down on your nails. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I even had to file the scissors down with the nail file to get them to work right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice looking</li>
    <li> No happy with this set.  The case is already falling a part and the clippers are not very sharp and don&#x27;t make a clean cut.</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. There is a reason the whole set is so cheap.</li>
    <li> This is an average manicure kit, cannot complain much as you get what you pay for. Tools are not too sturdy or well built, but good enough for an at home mani/pedi.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I needed clippers, since it is normally what I just use. When I saw the kit I was surprised at all of the tools it had so i bought it, and it hasnt disappointed me yet. Even though I have not used all of the tools on the kit, I always find a use for one. I think it was well worth the money and i like the fact that everything is pretty well organized in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few days now and I&#x27;ve tried using it on myself as well as my daughter. Although cute, I don&#x27;t like these very much. There are some items like the full metal pieces that work but the scissors are hardly working and the nail cutters aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut nails at all! I had even soaked my daughter&#x27;s nails so they would be soft. I do this every time I am going to cut her nails because they are naturally very strong. It didn&#x27;t help at all! I had to switch to an older nail cutter that I had already. It&#x27;s not a lot of money but it&#x27;s still a waste. I&#x27;ve given it at least 2 stars because there are some tools that are decent. Anything with a hinge is useless though.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift.  I was surprised that this weighed so much!  It is a nice heavy set with excellent quality implements.  I&#x27;m going to pick one up for myself!</li>
    <li> great kit in a nice case that latches.  Hard enough case that it will survive the bowls of my giant mom purse.  No more searching the house for nail clippers!!  :)</li>
    <li> I purchased three sets: for daughter, granddaughter, and me.  I have used several pieces of the set and am quite happy with it.  My granddaughter will be away to school so the set fits neatly with her packed items.  She is a manicure/pedicure lover and loves the tools in the set.  She has had sets before that didn&#x27;t quite measure up to her needs.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with nail care kit.  All of the items within the kit work well on my toes and nail.  Would recommend others to purchase.</li>
    <li> cheap set clippers do not work well will not buy again</li>
    <li> Quality is probably slightly sketchy (the clipper handles sometimes bend uncomfortably when used on thick nails) but the price really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Its a great kit for the money and i have thick toenails. Only reason i bought this kit was for the pliers thing it came for and it worked okay for getting rid of ingrown toenails which i suffer from. gave it 4 stars due to the fact that the tweezers couldnt tweeze a piece out of a operation game board without slipping</li>
    <li> No, it&#x27;s obviously not super-high end quality, but it&#x27;s decent quality. The case is pretty nice and the clippers were plenty sharp and did a perfect job. The tweezers also came together flush at the tip making pulling an eyebrow hair, etc very easy. My only very minor complaint is I wish it came with a piece of paper that described each items purpose because I don&#x27;t know what many of the tools are for. But at this price ($6.78 as add-on item through Amazon) it&#x27;s a definite 5-stars in my book. Pretty sure this same exact kit sells all over the internet (with different company names slapped on it, and sometimes different cases) usually for a much higher price.</li>
    <li> Was just as described. Nail clippers are sharp and do the job. Like it so far.</li>
    <li> Finally used this and it is fantastic.  Don&#x27;t know what some of the tools are used for but its a great set.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Very nice manicure set. I could not be happier with this set. Very good quality and beautiful case. I have had many compliments on this set. I am going to buy a few more for gifts this Christmas!</li>
    <li> I needed a kit for ..er.. my wife.. yeah, my wife. The stuff included is dull and made of cheap steel. I mean, what do you expect for a $8 kit? The stuff sorta works but does not feel quality.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t even know what half this stuff is for - I&#x27;ll probably end up using some of these things to fix my washing machine or coffee maker, or maybe even an emergency tracheostomy ... anyway I have bought a few of these kits mainly to get the different sized clippers - and this is by far the best quality for the price that I have seen. The case is really nice, and of course you get all the thingers that come with it besides the clippers. I wouldn&#x27;t put it in your carry on luggage.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he likes it real well. it has everything a man needs for his nail care</li>
    <li> Product came as delivered and on time. It appears to be a good set for the price and the tools are very sharp.</li>
    <li> Not very impressed, the items are misaligned slightly so when you preform a cut they sheer more than clip, leaving uneven nails and hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> Tools are not as sharp as I expected. Nail clippers are thick and not that sharp.</li>
    <li> Great deal for all these tools.  They seem to work very well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a new item and received it in a tapped up package with Styrofoam bits inside the case. Mind you the package never was sent in a Styrofoam package. Obviously used or repackaged with used tools. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> This Nail Care set is very useful, sturdy and economic. It has everything you might need and think of to take care of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it 4 stars is because the case does not close properly. I guess it is the only problem they could not solve by charging such a low price.</li>
    <li> Soooo pretty. The tools work well too. I just love the classy casing. It&#x27;s a steal for the price!</li>
    <li> The case is great, clasp works very well. The instruments look a lot nicer than the photos. ONly had them a few days, will find out within the next few months if the steel quality is good or not. I hope they wont rust, but they look like they wont since the metal appears to be brushed. Brushed low crome steel rusts within 24 hours, in our hihg humidity area of the world</li>
    <li> The build quality is good but it doesn&#x27;t cut like it should. I&#x27;ve used cheap nail clippers that were free and they cut better than these.</li>
    <li> I love this kit. Great for everyone not just beginners. The tweezers cut they don&#x27;t really grab and remove but other than that it&#x27;s wonderful I recommend this item to everyone</li>
    <li> Nice to have if you are into this stuff. Case was in good shape and everything was accounted for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great set, but in the first week, 2 nail clippers broke :/</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.  It has a nail file that is junk, but every other tool is great.</li>
    <li> Great and handy, but the tweezer sucks!</li>
    <li> Very nice to own or give away to friends. Very well made and precision instruments. Buy some now.</li>
    <li> It takes more than 2 weeks to arrive, but it is well worth waiting. All the manicure/pedicure tools in the box are useful！</li>
    <li> Acceptable quality and all the tools you need.  What do you expect for the price?!  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Half of the items are poorly made. Most of them can&#x27;t be used as they aren&#x27;t sharp or thin enough... . I would say it&#x27;s a total waste of my money</li>
    <li> Does the job. Sharp. Still figuring out what all the tools are for...would be nice if it came with instructions :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed by the quality of this set.  The packaging looked tampered with and the tools feel very rough when using them.  I think the clippers are too dull (hard to completely cut the cuticle away) and the included file is completely useless.  The tools are also loosely placed inside so they slip and move around too much. If you&#x27;re looking for a tool set that gets the job done on the first try, this probably isn&#x27;t the set for you and I wish I had spent a little extra money on a better one.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality product you can find, but for the cheap price I didn&#x27;t expect much. Was pleasantly surprised that most of the tools worked fairly well, but it is true that you get what you pay for with this product.  If you just a set like this for a last minute vacation or grab bag gift idea, then this is an okay option.</li>
    <li> Great for the money. I do not know what all the tools are for but the clippers, file and nips are well worth the price of the kit.</li>
    <li> I got the kit for the nail clippers and I&#x27;m very happy with the set. I highly recommend this it</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a new set.  Prices varied so much and they all look similar and this seemed the biggest bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;  Sorely mistaken in my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;  Quality:  The clippers are garbage and are not sharp at all.  They basically bend your nail until it breaks and then you are required to file them down to get rid of the feeling that your nail is out of whack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Price: decent price, just not useful.  Recommend buying different set.&lt;br /&gt;  The place a lot of items in it, not all very useful and most are poorly made, so I do not recommend the buy.</li>
    <li> A nice looking set with a hard cover. It&#x27;s a great item for the price and was speedily delivered.</li>
    <li> This is a Great Item to have, specially for Travelers. Nice, Complete, Compact and Very Useful. I just love it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not really liking the finish, but will be ok.</li>
    <li> everything you might need all in one case</li>
    <li> like the professionals ...great</li>
    <li> This set is cheap.  You will always get what you pay for, but with this set you get a good bit more.  I &#x27;m very happy with the quality of this set, and while I understand some of the other reviews mentioned that the materials where inferior, and that the product didn&#x27;t work, I found this set to be a whole lot of bang for the buck!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap set of grooming equipment.  If only one set of clippers works, its still a good buy.</li>
    <li> Good set other than I have no idea what a lot of the tools are even for... wish thist came with some type of tool identification one. One tool looks like a gaint needle with a loop at the end.... ?! No idea lol</li>
    <li> very cheaply made and thin not what was advertised</li>
    <li> Not the best quality ever but for $6 I&#x27;m not sure what some people are expecting. I read the reviews about the quality before purchasing so when i received them i was pretty rough on them trying them out. I don&#x27;t see any issues with the quality. They are not the best things ever but they get the job done, look nice, come in a nice case, and are cheap.</li>
    <li> very nice for the price so nice my wife took it from me</li>
    <li> love it, very sharp and does great work, or is that me.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality materials. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Meh. Low quality items.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my husband for Christmas, since he is always complaining that everyone steals his finger and toenail clippers, among his other personal implements. The quality of the implements are excellent, well-organized, and easy to keep in one place. Now he can hide his things and doesn&#x27;t have to worry about someone else using them.</li>
    <li> The tools are not very good quality but they do work ok.  The case is really nice and the price is great for what you get.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit, you will want to replace the tweezers with a better pair soon after.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I needed. Many tools to have a excellent nail care!</li>
    <li> The quality and the price of the item is good. Ive been using it for a month now and i dont see any wear and tear in it. This will surely last for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> The price for this product is excellent as the grooming utensils meet all of my expectations and grooming needs. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the 12 piece manicure/ pedicure set.  While I find there are a couple of pieces I do not regularly use, everything is secure in the same place when I want it, no more searching thru drawers.  I especially appreciate the durable hard case.  The only downside is that it could be hard for arthritic hands to get some of the smaller pieces out of and into their spots in the case</li>
    <li> Great for the price, they really are good quality for the price. That being said, there is much better quality out there. Perfect for us because our kids lose them all the time. So cheap enough to just replace. You want quality buy 3 swords.</li>
    <li> Wow! Like a jewelers kit for your manicure and pedicure needs. The aesthetics of the kit is wonderful along with being highly functional.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how nice this set is for the price.  The instruments are not flimsy and are nice and sharp.  There are probably more tools than I need or will ever use.  In fact, there are some oddly shaped ones that I&#x27;m not sure what they are for.  The case is especially nice.</li>
    <li> The case that I received had a lot of tears in it, so the pieces don&#x27;t stay in place very well.  I don&#x27;t really care too much though.. all the utensils are there and they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I like the solid case (as opposed to soft leather cases) and the stainless steel used for the items in the set. Cutting tools are sharp and solid. Should last a good while. Tried each item and each worked fine.</li>
    <li> Save your money. Looks good but leaves a lot to be desired. Highly suggest you buy something else - that saysd made in the USA</li>
    <li> This is a very nice manicore set that includes a nice case and many things I have never heard of!</li>
    <li> I compared about 10 different brands of these kits on Amazon before purchasing. When this arrived, I was shocked to find ot it was actually the &amp;#34;CHEEKY MANIHOLIC&amp;#34; set, not something called &amp;#34;Vanskap&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t matter because I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if that means you should go purchase the MANIHOLIC edition or what.&lt;br /&gt;I have ton of photo&#x27;s to add here so you can see what came with my kit.&lt;br /&gt;All devices are sharp, they cut crisply, and did I mention sharp? Yeah, be careful, but enjoy!</li>
    <li> Excellent tools, and incredible nice price</li>
    <li> Bad quality: all tools are mae of cheap materials and not sharp, cannot use anything from the set. DO NOT BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought 3 of these sets.  We love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you! They&#x27;re great! They&#x27;re sharp and work like professional ones. Finally what I needed. Get these before the company realizes what they&#x27;re selling is actually worth more!! lol</li>
    <li> Very nice kit, it has everything you will need. The price is excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Cheap and great,Shipping is slow</li>
    <li> Nice tools  not so perfect case</li>
    <li> perfect! exactly as described.</li>
    <li> simply put it this is crap!</li>
    <li> VERY poor quality.  Case doesn&#x27;t close properly, and vinyl is sticking out - it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;tucked into&amp;#34; the frame of the case.</li>
    <li> Just received the item. As a lot people mentioned here the material is not of very high quality, but what you also should not expect is to buy Damascus steel for $7. The clippers were very sharp on the first use. Not sure how long they will last, but I think I got a good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great and functional kit, very portable. good for thick nails, not a flimsy set.</li>
    <li> The case looks very nice and there are a multitude of various tools present, but the quality of the clippers (all 4) is unacceptable. They do not provide enough tension to actually &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; the nail, The blades close down too softly, simply cutting into the nail, then you have to pull on the nail to get the cut portion to detach. Not cool. Spend a little more money and get some quality clippers.</li>
    <li> Great set! Easy to pack or carry in one&#x27;s purse.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality and the case it comes in is falling apart and I just opened it. Can&#x27;t expect much for 8 bucks.</li>
    <li> My only gripe is the nail file. It&#x27;s not very good. The other accessories are great though.</li>
    <li> Great produce and a great price</li>
    <li> There is a nice variety of tools in here, but I find the nail clippers (which I use the most) to be a little flimsy. I really have to push down to get my nails to cut and the cut doesn&#x27;t feel clean. They are not as sharp as I would imagine.</li>
    <li> excellent kit for the cost. Love it. Decent quality</li>
    <li> Very quick and just as I expected. Great gift for any man that wish to keep is his grooming on point.</li>
    <li> This is a decent inexpensive nail care set, but the loops that hold each otme in its own place inside the case were torn loose when I opened it, so omly a few stay in place, while others float getting bunched up and preventing the case from closing...</li>
    <li> after reading reviews I thought it would be great quality. It is only okay. It will do the job but nothing spectacular. I know it came from overseas but it took a ridiculously long time to arrive</li>
    <li> The only minor issue was that the clasp on the nail kit is a bit shaky.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but i actually purchased for the cuticle clipper that in my opinion is close to impossible to use with one hand because there is no spring on the cuticle clipper. If you are not purchasing just for that ( as i was) then this is a pretty good value travel set. i haven&#x27;t tested everything out but it is exactly as pictured and is easy to just throw in your bag for your grooming needs.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly high quality set for the price. Did take the estimated 2-4 weeks to deliver, closer to the 4 weeks mark, however I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the tools. Even the case is solidly built. Has everything you need to keep looking good and feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Great set. Have steam cleaned for sanitary purposes. Perfect set for any nail need. Definitely don&#x27;t need to buy anything else ever again. Except for nail files.</li>
    <li> All of these purchases were excellent quality and value</li>
    <li> It is what it is, can&#x27;t expect much for less than $10. Some of the items work properly, some others not much. At least for my basic &amp;#34;man-pedicure&amp;#34; which is cutting my toe nails, is OK. So if you are a dude, should be good enough, as for ladies, I honestly do not know what most of these things are made for... Hehe</li>
    <li> Really only needed like 3 of the things that are in here, but hey, for 5 bucks, not bad. And if your looking to start a career as a manicurist, this is all you&#x27;ll ever need. That, and a new guidance counselor.</li>
    <li> While this is indeed a 12 piece nail care kit, what the title and images of the product fail to show (which I would argue is false advertising), is that the outside &#x27;leather&#x27; of the travel case has the word &amp;#34;Cheeky&amp;#34; written on it in a very feminine-esque handwriting font.  The kit also comes in a pink box with a seductive 1950&#x27;s era woman on the front.  This looked to me like at least a semi-masculine nail clipper set, but boy was I surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the case feels extraordinarily cheap, as to the clippers and scissors, they all work as intended and I can&#x27;t really complain for $8.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and never owned a kit before- I love this thing! For 12 bucks ya sure can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I just received these this morning. Honestly, I don&#x27;t even know what half the things in here do. I got this kit mainly because I wanted nail clippers, a file, and an ear pick at an affordable price. The case itself feels pretty padded. However, the locking mechanism is extremely cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it breaks soon. Otherwise, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase and I have like a dozen new grooming tools I can use in the future if I ever need them.</li>
    <li> Parts are cheaply made. The scraper came dull, but I was able to sharpen it with a stone. The &amp;#34;scissor clippers&amp;#34; are useful along with the blackhead tool, and 1 or 2 other tools, but the nail clippers are dull and leave a rough edge.</li>
    <li> The product is not of a good quality. The cuticle cutters/trimmers and the pushers are blunt and the trimmer in particular is difficult to use and do not operate smoothly.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of stuff in here, so ithe kit&#x27;s usefulness goes beyond just grooming. I&#x27;ve also been able to remove splinters and so on, and the tools are really solid. A good buy, especially if you grab it on sale. Be warned: the case isn&#x27;t as manly in person as it seems in pictures. Haha</li>
    <li> That pretty much sums it up. The case is lovely though. I was tempted not to return it for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> Very Nice for the money ,</li>
    <li> the metal smells bad and the clippers are not study or strong. The case keeps opening up in my purse. Made a nice stocking stuffer and will do in a pinch when I chip a nail out until I get home.</li>
    <li> Good tools. The outer case started to come apart  tho</li>
    <li> Not a bad set, great variety. Some items work better than others but watch out for the metal slivers that seem to be attached to many pieces. Sometimes its hard to close the case but its a good set for home &amp; travel as well as keeping the teenaged girls from stealing your nail care items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swapped out a few things with items I already had. It was a great price, I bought 2, one for me and one for the afore mentioned thief :)</li>
    <li> Much appreciated gift.</li>
    <li> I so love this stuff, good way to clean my nails.</li>
    <li> Overall is cheapest nail set. You will not use all if this. Case is too small for al the tools it contains and is not properly desing because it will not close all th e way. The big nail clippers is too big for the case it would not close. Materials are not quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money here.NO FREE return for bad product.</li>
    <li> I got this for a gift for a friend. He loved it. I&#x27;m thinking about ordering myself one now.</li>
    <li> Like all the tools but case is very difficult to clasp.  I am afraid I am bending the frame or a tool inside, but the case itself is very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail care set for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it! For the price I was very impressed with the number of tools and quality of the carrying case. All of the tools are very sharp and of a good quality. The only complaint I have heard from my husband is that the Cuticle Nippers don&#x27;t line up and cut well and the spring arm doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are both happy with this nail care set.</li>
    <li> love the price, but it was not worth it, they started to rust withing 2 weeks. I did not get them wet, did not leave them wet, left them in the case it came with and when i opened it up, they had started rusting around the edges.</li>
    <li> Can close cheap case and items don&#x27;t stay in their spots</li>
    <li> Great little kit that fits every need with low cost and a very nice place to keep them all organized in.</li>
    <li> Some of the utensils included don&#x27;t fit too well in the case, and the case itself if not quite deep enough to close easily when everything is put back in its place. Not a bad deal for the money, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Lots of good tools here!  Nice case, well made and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to fall apart in your hands.  The tools themselves  are nice and solid and have a nice weight to them.</li>
    <li> Just finished my first manicure. Clippers seemed weak at first because my previous ones were of a heavier material. Clippers worked excellent as did the cuticle remover (really sharp). Case is adorable, although I&#x27;m sure it will fall apart sometime soon (seems cheaply made). All in all I&#x27;d said it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Everything seems to be working, i would say the tweezers arent the best, I did replace them with another I  had.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a luxuriou set!</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Some of the things in the kit look a little scary but the things I&#x27;ve needed to use have worked fine.</li>
    <li> Great kit, but my button on the inside holding a clipper didn&#x27;t work...so I had to rip the leather...happy with the price though and the tools are sharp. The case is very cute!!</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller! No complaints!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. All the items were sharp and points came together very well. Case is not the best quality but for the price it is sufficient.</li>
    <li> I rated this product with 3 stars to place in the middle of the rating range.  When I ordered it my expectations were not very high, but neither was the price, especially for the number of tools provided. For less than $6 I would purchase it again. The case is quite nice and the quality of the tools satisfactory.  It is a good buy and worth the money but don&#x27;t set your expectations too high.</li>
    <li> Other than the casing looking very old, it has all sorts of tools in it.  Tools looked sharp and clean.</li>
    <li> Nail clippers and scissors are a bit dull so longevity of use may be a problem.  Nice case and smileys on the tools.</li>
    <li> I needed a new set of clippers but I bought this because of the price...My only complaint is that I only got one and now they&#x27;re gone. While I don&#x27;t use half of the tools in this kit, the case is fantastic and the clippers (all three pair) are sharp and operate smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toenail clipper that is designed to get into the corner of the nail was something I never used before...but my big toes are quite happy I started using this one. All in all its a good set of tools and I even find myself using the cuticle trimmer too and the lack of hangnails is also a bonus...I do hope this comes back to amazon...I&#x27;d like to buy another kit and put it in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s back! Though for a higher price....I paid about a few bucks less....but I&#x27;m buying a second set anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my husband and myself and we both love them.</li>
    <li> The price was cheep but so is the quality. The nail clippers were so thin that I could not really clip my nail. Even though one gets a lot of items, if the prime reason for buying is to clip your nails, why buy it.</li>
    <li> It was awesome. I liked it because the piece that I clean my nails with has a sharp edge so I can scrape under my nails and clean them nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The ones in the stores have a dull edge and leave dirt under my nails. It was just what I was looking for, and not found in the stores.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, high-quality case and very stylish. Exactly as shown in the publication and all pieces of excellent material. What is not stainless steel if I find other material and hopefully will not rust with use. Shipping very fast and safe</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother so that she wouldn&#x27;t have to risk getting an infection every time she went to the nail salon. There are a lot of tools and she likes it.</li>
    <li> The case is a little flimsy, but all of the tools work very well.</li>
    <li> The large nail clipper has two rusted spots by the head. It look like it was used. Very upset with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This kit is more useful than I thought. I&#x27;m not a nail professional, but these tools are actually very handy when you have stubborn nail issues. No more looking around for random household objects to get the job done...there seems to be a tool for every imaginable problem. There are some tools in here that I don&#x27;t even know what their for, but it&#x27;s nice knowing I have them if I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because the large nail clipper wasn&#x27;t clipping right because it basically had an &amp;#34;overbite&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t match up to the bottom cutter. I was able to fix this for the most part by using pliers to bend the bottom downward, but I still don&#x27;t use them over the small  clippers. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice kit, but I&#x27;m sure a nail professional could pick out better tools elsewhere. For basic home use, these items should be just fine and last a while.</li>
    <li> The products were well packaged and arrived quickly. I am very happy with the products. They were very good quality manicure and pedicure sets</li>
    <li> Everything is a bit too difficult to remove from the case. If they were to remove some of the more redundant tools so everything would fit more comfortably, then this would be a winner. All of the tools themselves are acceptable, but not exceptional</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for the price. Love it!</li>
    <li> received before scheduled time .... that&#x27;s great !!  the clip to open pouch ... iffy</li>
    <li> What even are all these tools for? Everytime I open this I think of it being some torture toolset but I tell you I still find a use for these various tools. Nice manly carry case(for travel of course)</li>
    <li> awesome great kit should sell for much more</li>
    <li> Good as gift items for xmas. I am sure those who receive these items will be happy to have as part of their grooming items.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fits the bill and at a great price.</li>
    <li> great for the price.  clips well, lots of little gadgets.  Fair to average quality.  Love the embossed vinyl case.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect and functional, in good physical condition all the pizzas and good quality covers expectations, very good sales all well recommend</li>
    <li> instead of always going to the nail shop i now have my own kit love it i use it all the time</li>
    <li> cheap ! do not get this. just go to walgreen&#x27;s or cvs they have way better manicure things</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the best quality but will do the job.</li>
    <li> great item fo the price, than you.</li>
    <li> This is very nice- I like that it does not have a name brand on it. The utensils look good and of quality.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price</li>
    <li> After a year I still have this, they work and last really good, extremely happy with this prodcut</li>
    <li> Delivered in time with no damage, product came as described&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything works and feels solid enough to do the job, nothing luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint would be that the case does not close and will not stay &amp;#34;locked&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Has a ton of stuff and good for the price but they are all cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Case is poorly made and the tools ok</li>
    <li> Everything about this set is high quality. The metal is strong, with a nice brushed finish. The case is well made, masculine, and attractive. I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m ordering more for gifts.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you could need. A large variety of tools and clippers for whatever you&#x27;re trying to do</li>
    <li> When I first opened the box, many small parts caught each other and took me a while to open the kit. The blades on nail clippers and and the scissors do not meet each others, which is annoying and does not make a clean cut .</li>
    <li> Great kit! has everything you need inside. recommended for anyone who travels.</li>
    <li> I tend to misplace nail clippers (often!) so this kit keeping them organized and easy to locate is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend because I was sick of looking at the gross tools he was using! MEN! Anyway, this is a great kit and has so many tools in it. Needless to say he said his were fine and he saw this and was amazed at all the cool things! Now, he keeps them clean and in the case! Lifesaver set!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set however I have difficulty removing the instruments from their compartments.  The tools are lightweight but they get the job done</li>
    <li> I just wanted nail clippers, everything else is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive gift but will work well for the purpose I wanted. Gifts for Christmas for the grandkids.who wanted a compact kit.</li>
    <li> My Wife bought this and she lives it. Saving hundreds of dollar by not going to get her nails done every week.</li>
    <li> This is such a good deal....and comes with the sturdy, handy-dandy case as well.  Bought this to send my son off to college...it certainly did not disappoint!</li>
    <li> This kit is very nice. It has all the tools you need to do your nails and then some. We use this on the kids nails and the nice sharp edges make it a quick clip.</li>
    <li> the box its poor quality</li>
    <li> My husband bought this kit for when he is traveling and I have to say, I really want one too... lol it doesn&#x27;t have the cheap bendable tools either so it&#x27;s a great buy and the smileys are a plus... case is a little girly too..</li>
    <li> I bought this set basically for the clippers, good thing it came with the other tools too, but I really just use the clippers and the scissor.&lt;br /&gt;Clippers have a smooth movement when used, and the blade won&#x27;t \\&quot;snap shut\\&quot; but firmly closing with no feedback on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Scissor is good: no gap between blades, and it feels good enough.&lt;br /&gt;The case is handy, and helps you keep all the tools together, instead all spread in your personal care travel bag.</li>
    <li> A little bit hard to get each one out. But it&#x27;s small stuff so it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> The case is complete crap.  It was already falling apart when it arrived so we removed the tools from it and put it in a nice leather shaving kit instead.  The tools seem to be nicely made, sharp and easy to grip but count on finding yourself a new case to hold them in.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this!</li>
    <li> Everything I need in one case perfect. Iy also arrived super quick. That makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp, acceptable quality.</li>
    <li> Great Value, so many tools. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Cheap Chinese nail care set. The cuticle clippers broke immediately. Very cheap material. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. For that price, I can get a decent cuticle clipper. The rest of the set is a joke.</li>
    <li> I purchase this set for a co-worker as a gift and loved it; the following week I brought one for myself.</li>
    <li> Nice case, nice tools. Problem is I don&#x27;t know what to do with half of them and no instructions saying what they are</li>
    <li> Really great quality!</li>
    <li> The case is  poorly made</li>
    <li> Bought for a gift. These items seem very high quality for a very low price. The case is the only problem...doesn&#x27;t seem to latch/unlatch properly, but doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue.</li>
    <li> What a nice set DEFINITELY HIGHLY RECOMMEND, AH DEFINATE YES W/ 2-👍👍&#x27;s Way UP!!!!!!!!! The clippers are really nice n&#x27; sharp cutting nails with great ease &amp; I still can NOT believe The AWEsome Value and Quality for the money-ONLY $5 you&#x27;re not only getting an AWEsome/Special 12-piece set but the case is great too......Can most DEFINITELY see why this AWESOME set is {A BEST-SELLER} 0H HeLL Yeahhh!!!!!!!!!!!! [I&#x27;m DEFINITELY buying more for gifts] But this one was for myself and &amp;#34;WoW&amp;#34; am I ever glad I got it 😊👍👍 thinking seriously about buying more for gifts but another for myself (NOT that I&#x27;m concerned about the set I have breaking as [believe me] each piece is made well it&#x27;s cause it&#x27;s such a great set I want another incase the one I have should ever suddenly grow legs and walk-away (&amp;#34;if you know what I mean&amp;#34;) you see I been in a Nursing Facility the past 2-years and several people has complimented me on my unique manicure set as well as asked to borrow it (I feel their &amp;#34;Personal-Use&amp;#34; no one should be using others after all many here have nail fungus&#x27;, foot &amp; nail infections so No way!!!!!!! Again, {I Highly Recommend} 👍👍😊</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this set! These would make killer stocking stuffers, and are compact enough to fit in a purse. I have one for work, one for home, and one for my weekend bag! This is an excellent quality set, with a collection of very useful tools.</li>
    <li> This is a decent kit, and keeps everything in one place. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very Nice for the price!  I like, so bought more for gifts!</li>
    <li> The items in here have extremely sharp edges.  Also, the case did not close when I received it.  I put this away and never use them.  One of my most disappointing purchases in my Amazon ordering history.</li>
    <li> Very nice! quality is good.</li>
    <li> Takes a long time to ship, but good quality product</li>
    <li> I use it all the time I keep it in my travel bag my only complaint is I don&#x27;t know what all the pieces in it are for.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a manicure set so I can finally tame my claws. While everything in the set functions and serves its purpose, I feel as though it is lacking quality. So far the set has held up. For how long, I do not know.</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s good for traveling and has everything necessary. Only bad thing is that after a while the lock broke but I don&#x27;t really care 😊</li>
    <li> This set has everything a guy could need for nail care and then some. I only use maybe 4-5 of the tools on a regular basis and am very pleased with the quality. There have been some occasions when a friend or family member was over and used this set to take care of some sort of nail issue and they are always impressed by this set.</li>
    <li> Nice Great Fast Delivery</li>
    <li> This is NOT surgical quality stainless steel, its cheap junk from China. But it works as advertised, and all the parts haven&#x27;t fallen apart yet. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> this nail care kit comes in a very nice case, is very well divided and has everything you need to do your nails and more, I like the little touch of the smiley face on the clippers (the three of them).&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent to have a corner nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Being diabetic it is hard to find the right tool to work on my feet. These are awesome! I can handle them very well, they are easily sterilized too. Product also arrived very fast</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. Comes with everything you need. Great product for those who are looking for the full kit to maintain their nails</li>
    <li> I am buying a second set because the product is of high quality and is a complete set that includes every  tool you need for taking care of your nails.</li>
    <li> Comprehensive set for the price, and a great case. There are some things in here that I don&#x27;t know what to do with, and some that scare me. But just because it&#x27;s there doesn&#x27;t mean I have to use it, right? Quality build.</li>
    <li> This was such a great value!  I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it how nice the set would be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many tools at your disposal with this set that make nail care easy, effective, and a pleasure.  A must buy whether you think you need all the tools or not, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, and it may just inspire you to groom your nails more often because the set is so nice; it did for me.</li>
    <li> Not great but worth the inexpensive price</li>
    <li> This manicure kit is perfect for traveling.  It is small and compact but packs all the tools you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart design and high quality tools.</li>
    <li> I bought a set for my husband and myself we love them I&#x27;m always using mine this is the best</li>
    <li> I think, out of all the other manicure/pedicure kits I&#x27;ve searched for on here, this is the best in price and quality. I remember the days before Amazon when a person could expect to pay $20-$30 for this before christmas and maybe on sale but damaged for $10-$15 after. At the time I purchased this? Under $7 with &amp;#34;Add On&amp;#34; for shipping. Totally worth it. I actually even like the case, which I so rarely do for these sorts of things. The selection of tools in here was plentiful as well. I thought the brown plastic and design would be a bit gaudy, but to me it looks tasteful. The tools are nice and sharp! Maybe they won&#x27;t last forever, who knows, but for the price? Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed in the slightest.</li>
    <li> very good item for the price.</li>
    <li> You get what you lay for. Mine came today, shoved in a box with the contents falling out. Some of them are dirty like they&#x27;ve been used. The case they came in is busted and falling apart completely. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband.  It keeps all the pieces organized and includes some hard to find tools for the occasional problem task.</li>
    <li> I bought this seeing that it had everything in it that I needed and came with a case for everything. However when I got it in the mail the cuticle clippers were broken. I have yet to use anything in it, but since it arrived broke, I wouldn&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re made very well.</li>
    <li> Great price. Well constructed tools, not light or flimsy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for a couple of weeks now and it does the job.  Love the case it comes in as well.</li>
    <li> All the right tools you need and good price</li>
    <li> Great set to keep the fingers and toes trimmed and presentable.</li>
    <li> Not sure if my Nephew likes his Christmas gift. I am sure he can get good use from this practical gift daily personal care item.</li>
    <li> Love it !&lt;br /&gt;&amp; its cute (:</li>
    <li> The ones I received were not very sharp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a deal. A lot of pieces.  Don&#x27;t even know what some do.</li>
    <li> Very dull and the ridges on the clippers are not straight</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Many tools to use. The wedge cutter works grate. Seems to be the only item that us solid steel. Everything else is chrome plated and kind of cheep. Worth the price for seldom use. Do not get for a prefession.</li>
    <li> The case is not that great but the tools are top quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this set as a gift for my friend. Once I&#x27;ve got it I was afraid it looks a bit too cheap but she loves it, so I have no reason not to.</li>
    <li> Works great. All of the tools work great, the filer and cuticle remover are fantastic. Really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> One star for showing up. Don&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest bunch of crap I think I&#x27;ve ever seen. I guess you get what you pay for, but to be blunt, I kind of feel like the whole set needs to be washed. I feel like I may get a fungal infection by using them. The case is kind of nice though. We&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;ll hold up.</li>
    <li> Good initial quality, but the large clippers broke at the rivet and the case open/close lock button broke after 4 months.  You get what you pay for.  The tools were very sharp (cuticle trimmer and clippers).  Its worth $9, but you won&#x27;t get a lifetime of use out of this grooming kit.  Good to use for a trip or summer of travel.</li>
    <li> Very nice set for the price, has a lot of implements.</li>
    <li> Mine came torn at the bottom but you can&#x27;t beat the price! Nail kit is great quality. Definitely not the best but for 5 bucks it is great quality.</li>
    <li> Hands down ....... Best kit ive ever purchase . A+ for your money</li>
    <li> Case is hard to keep closed- but for the price the set is fine.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and I&#x27;m scared to used any of them... They look old and rusty! I read all the awesome reviews first and thought the price was great before ordering, but you get what you pay for! This is a JOKE... It has to be... 😄!</li>
    <li> I gave these to my kids for Christmas as a stocking stuffer - they were always taking and losing the clippers/tweezers.  Now they have their own and a place to put each piece where it belongs.</li>
    <li> If you want a manicure set that is rugged enough to last for years, yet crafted to handle the most dainty of cuticles, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have 2 types of clippers to remove the added length of nail that has grown. You have two types of cuticle clippers to take care of the heaviest and finest cuticles. 5 types of cuticles pushers for any possible job necessary. Also a nail file and scissors to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are light and comfortable in the hand, but made of a material that will last for years.&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy and I recommend this kit to all my friends for their nail care needs....</li>
    <li> Well, this picture does not do this item justice.  I thought it was a bit smaller and was a bit surprised when it came and is about the size of two eyeglass cases together.  I&#x27;m not saying it is too big however, as it does hold a lot of tools and fits into my medicine/overnight bag just fine.  I purchased this as a means of having my own tools while traveling.  My spouse hates it when I steal the ones from the house - so now the problem is solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, the tools seem a bit &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; compared to some of the nicer tools in our home that spouse purchased, but I&#x27;m not looking for tools that I can hand down to my decendants - just something that does the job while I&#x27;m on the road.  There are plenty of options to choose from - clippers, files, scissors, and more.  There is no excuse for suffering through a hang nail or anything else while on the road.  Buy this set and you&#x27;ll have all the tools you can ever want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the case is probably the &amp;#34;cheapest&amp;#34; part of this entire package.  It is a bit &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; to close, but some reviews have stated it becomes easier.  The hinge holding it all together seems flimsy, but unless it fails and my tools end up all over my bag, I&#x27;m okay with it.  The tools are secured well enough in the case, so nothing bad should happen in that avenue.  I&#x27;m not certain you&#x27;d want to take this on the plane as part of carry-on, however, as it will likely show up in the metal detector as a case full of miniature weapons.  I&#x27;ll give it a shot though, just to see how it goes.  I am not holding my breath that this kit will last for too many years, but if I get a good 2-3 years out of it - I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
    <li> As a man I&#x27;ve been in need of nail trimming tools I just wish the case would fully close however.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a budget manicure set, not bad for the money but cheaply made comparatively speaking. Item is made from stainless steel which is a plus for sure, and the pieces seem like they will hold together under normal use. Also, the case that comes with it holds everything nicely (except for the cuticle trimmer, which there doesn&#x27;t really seem to be a place for) and is nice and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the kit is DEFINITELY made in China as all of the text on the packaging it comes in is in Chinese (reminds me of something I would pick up in Chinatown). Also, since everything is in Chinese, you can&#x27;t read all of the labels on the box that tell you what every piece is unless of course you can read Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good set for the money but done except an amazing product that is professional quality.</li>
    <li> I should have known better. Although you get a lot for the money the cuticle and nail clippers were junk.</li>
    <li> great nail kit. I got this for my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves it. It has everything you need to do your nails right</li>
    <li> was impressed how sharp and sturdy this manicure set was.</li>
    <li> I love this little kit! It&#x27;s stylish and compact! It&#x27;s a definite necessity especially for someone who likes their nails to be maintained!</li>
    <li> I wish there was an explanation of a couple of these tools, some of them are kind of freaky looking. The nail clippers have smiley faces on them though, kind of cute.</li>
    <li> This is the best grooming set available. All of the tools are well made and everything works great. The clippers especially are great and I always catch my wife using these. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> It took a good 2-3 weeks to arrive, but when it finally did, the GF was pretty happy with it and I was most pleased by the incredibly low price compared to what&#x27;s available at local stores!  Worth the wait.</li>
    <li> eally good in performance and easy to use and to organize with the case ,  valued. I love it. ...</li>
    <li> This is a nice little kit, had all the items in it my wife wanted for a travel set.  Seems to be decent quality not fantastic.  If you are looking for a well stocked reasonably small travel set, this is a very good choice.</li>
    <li> Tempted to give 4 stars because I can tell it isn&#x27;t the BEST QUALITY EVER.  But it is all good quality.  It all works and functions as intended.  But at the price, it really is a great deal for a nice set.  I&#x27;m sure there are some much nicer cuticle nippers which cost $30 alone and I would notice the quality, but that isn&#x27;t worth it to me.  Good choice IMO.</li>
    <li> I took a chance buying this product online. Typically, I like to see what it is I&#x27;m buying before I actually make a purchase.  The picture made the product appear legit; however, when I opened it the entire package was covered with Chinese writing and not one word of English.  I let that go because, unfortunately, everything is made in China these days. The first thing I noticed was that the latch was broken. I examined the utensils and found just by virtue of a visual examination that they were still covered with the pitting marks from the casting and they were crudely &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; which left them looking like I made them in my garage.  I tried the file and it was quite dull which made it ineffective. Next, I tried one of the tools used to clean under the fingernails and it was so thick I could hardly get it under my nail.  Lastly, I tried the nail clipper and it left such a ridge it was sharp on the top of my nail.  This was a complete waste of my American dollars and highly recommend that you do not waste your money buying this product.</li>
    <li> The case is not the best quality, but the tools are great!</li>
    <li> Great kit. Good value</li>
    <li> Would have been nice if these really cut fingernails more than two times. They don&#x27;t line up very well and don&#x27;t cut smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as shown. If you have any doubts about the quality please don&#x27;t. This product has good quality tools everything is well made and the case is really nice as well.</li>
    <li> the tools are great. the toenail and fingernail clippers arent too powerful so it may be a little frustrating when clipping.</li>
    <li> The manicure tools and clippers are sharp and stay sharp</li>
    <li> The tools are of higher quality than the price would lead you to believe. A nice set.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a set foreverandx found this one at a great price. Gave it as a gift for Christmas and I already had complaints about the nail clippers not cutting and now one of the large clippers broke. Will never buy again!</li>
    <li> Nice set and case looks sharp</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think many people would need to travel with this kind of set, but with all the tools in here you can take care of your nails no problem.</li>
    <li> Nice Case, but the clippers are a bit weak, I don&#x27;t have much use for some of the other tools but they do make for a nice set and I am sure for someone who knew what to do with them it would make an even bigger impression, My draw back is with the nail clippers themselves which don&#x27;t look like they will stand the test of time. BUT....they have so far, soooooo im remaining optimistic. good for maintenance I think, but not much else.</li>
    <li> Two of the three items; one pair of scissors and a pair of clippers broke in my hand on the first use</li>
    <li> SMILE! It has all you need and more. Love the happy faces! Best of all the tools are good. I recommend this set!</li>
    <li> I can not say anything positive because I came a different product, incorrect case</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased one in the past and it provides everything you need in a nail kit.  Great quality, I bought two one for myself and one for my family!</li>
    <li> The price is good for this product. They are very duration and nice. Even the containing bag is not very beautiful, its worth buying. 4 stars</li>
    <li> This set is full of a bunch of tools most people don&#x27;t even know how to use. Then, the important ones like the clippers and nail file, are cheap and do not cut properly. I would have rather bought a set with half the pieces that worked twice as well.</li>
    <li> A very good deal for all the items in the case. Very happy with my purchase. Lots of items for such low price.</li>
    <li> As a price-conscious college student, I bought one of these sets. Although it has served me well, I have to bring up a lack of quality with the includes tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me say that all the tools work wonderfully. I find each tool superb at doing its job. However, I think the case and the tools feel very cheap. The cuticle trimmer lever sometimes slides away from under the cuticle trimmer, making sure that you have to stop cleaning your nails to fix the tool. The latch that closes the case feels very loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to be completely honest, I think the outside of the case is a little girly with the design. It&#x27;s something that bothers me a bit, but I don&#x27;t think about it too much.</li>
    <li> surprised that they are as heavy duty as they are..Don&#x27;t know how they will hold up but am very happy so far.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, I was very impressed.  Shipping took longer than I&#x27;m used to since it was not a prime item but well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This nail care kit has a useful variety of clippers and scrapers. It comes in a hansome case that gives it an expensive appearence.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it and plan to purchase more kits as gifts.</li>
    <li> they are ok.. i probably should have went for something a little more expensive, they look nice but when you use them you can feel the cheapness</li>
    <li> I bought this because my husband misplaced my normal go to nail kit. This has a lot of tools and the quality is fine on the tools. The case however has loops to slide the tools in - some are perfect, others are 2-3 times too big so those tools fall out when opening the case. The case also won&#x27;t shut all the way to seal those tools in. It usually just sits on the night stand so it&#x27;s not a huge deal but if you want something to transport you&#x27;d need a new case.</li>
    <li> Love this pack of kit havent used all tools but most are useful and of good quality and best part is it very handy and easy to carry around.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself after my daughter left for college and took her set with her.  (I used to use her set all the time.)  I&#x27;m very happy with this set of manicure tools.  They are built solidly and work well. I also like how the container holds everything in place.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat this set. I don&#x27;t even know what all the tools are for, but the two clippers are sharp, the sissiors work great and the tweezers don&#x27;t feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price. I love it! Now I have to get my mom one because she keeps stealing mine!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes with all of the pieces, but putting it back in is a pain.  I ended up just taking all the pieces out and putting it in another container.  Also, some pieces in the set have disappointed me in terms of quality, but overall, it wasn&#x27;t a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Cheap, 2 pieces have small amount of rust on them. I bought it for a mani/pedi basket for auction and didn&#x27;t use it because it looks used.</li>
    <li> Until now works fine. Have all that you need!</li>
    <li> GREAT KIT!! I love this kit and it&#x27;s versatility! Has pretty much any tool you can think of! :-)</li>
    <li> Everything in the kit works pretty well except the nail clippers. The fingernail and toenail clippers don&#x27;t clip very well anymore. I think I got maybe a half dozen clippings. I don&#x27;t have tough nails either. I mean, my nails are actually so soft that sometimes I&#x27;ll go to open something and my nails will bend back and my nailbed will bruise. These fingernail clippers won&#x27;t clip my nails anymore... well, they&#x27;ll bite into them, with the lever all the way down touching the body of the clippers and it still only bites the nail. In order to clip the nail, I actually have to bend the clippers to snap the nail it&#x27;s bit into off the rest of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the tools work great though. Just the fingernail and toenail clippers (the toenail clippers do the same thing with my toenails, but those are definitely tougher nails than my fingernails).</li>
    <li> Cheap metal material. product came to me with the cheap case already tearing apart. DO NOT BUY. Pay for the real stuffs.</li>
    <li> I love this nail kit. I was really surprised at the quality of the instruments inside of it for the price.</li>
    <li> this is an awesome little kit I have been using it non stop on my manicures and pedicures. Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as I would have liked. However, they get the job done. Will have to see how well they hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months of use they have dulled and no longer clip my nails cleanly.</li>
    <li> It is sturdy and great deal for the price!  The case is nice also.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2. One I kept and one I gave away. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> When the nail slippers it leaves a bit of a rough edge on your nail but a really cute set for a gift</li>
    <li> Great have not used all the tools but its has a nice case</li>
    <li> Metal in clippers and nail file were junk nail file was crude. Nice looking not sharp tools. Would not recommend for use except as emergency tools.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this one. I would not recommend it to others. It is not what I expect. they are a little flimsy</li>
    <li> This is a classic case of you get what you pay for. The clippers are cheap, flimsy and do not work most of the time.</li>
    <li> Good quality, complete - should last for some time.</li>
    <li> inside items are pretty good . but the case fails to close after a few uses, but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Very low quality, not a huge surprise for the price but still a lot worse than expected.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this! Must have!</li>
    <li> Big clipper is not good quality and does not work well.  Sharpness of all cutters could be better.</li>
    <li> People are either fake as F**k or lying which is fake anyway but these are not worth the money gas or other resources to waste on making something that lasts for less than one clip or two. People buy this for the clippers, they suck!!! Overwhelmingly, a lot of people say their clippers suck, eventually. So forget this and move along to the next one, cheap is not always better and who needs all of those tools anyway? Seriously. Its worth a cheap gift for someone you work with or do not really like. FYI HEADS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so pissed off with this. It took FOREVER to arrive, once I opened the package I noticed the big ol&#x27; rip on the side of the case immediately, and it also had more than 2 tools missing. Not worth buying this.</li>
    <li> perfect and professional set</li>
    <li> The one I got, the large clipper was bad and looks used before</li>
    <li> Looks nice, but very cheaply made. Nail clippers broke during their first use!</li>
    <li> The little case was nice &amp; compact which is great because I carry alot of junk anyway, but the clippers inside were not very sharp and the cuticle cutter was dull.  I still use my kit anyway.  Everything else works fine.</li>
    <li> Quality could have been better but the price justifies how it was made</li>
    <li> Great Purchase, Thank You!</li>
    <li> The quality is absolutely horrible.  Do not waste your money.  The tweezers bent during the first use.  The cuticles scissors are not sharp enough to work even for one use.  I didn&#x27;t even bother to try to the nail clippers.  You can tell by the feel of them they are cheap and worthless.</li>
    <li> exactly as described Perfect</li>
    <li> Complete and functional set for all needs</li>
    <li> The nail clippers are not the best quality. But overall very good.</li>
    <li> Epic kit! I love it. Everything works as it should and is very durable and sharp like it should be. I have happy toes!</li>
    <li> Just arrived today and it&#x27;s nicer than I could have expected. It took a really long time to get here however, as I was aware before ordering. Bottom line, if you&#x27;re not in a rush, this is a super nice set to have.</li>
    <li> Set seems very cheap. Clippers are not sharp and the quality of the metal is a rust fest waiting to happen. Bottom line, you pay for what you get. I&#x27;d suggest to pay a littler more for a little less useless tools, for better quality.</li>
    <li> Very Impressed with ti.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made...however for the price, it was fine.</li>
    <li> bought this set as a gift and loved it so I have too get me one</li>
    <li> The tools inside it are quality but the case is already coming apart. it just sits in my bookbag in a small front compartment. it still closes. but the &amp;#34;leather cover&amp;#34; is coming apart at the edge of the closure.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST PRODUCT! Multiple tools were jammed in one &amp;#34;sleeve&amp;#34; when it was made to fit one. The case doesn&#x27;t close because the cuticle clippers don&#x27;t fit. The strap was broken to hold some of the tools. The plastic wrapping for tools were shredded and ripped. It was a cheap product and HORRIBLE! I am so embarrassed to say it was made it China. I bought it as a gift and I was so embarrassed when my bf opened it in front of me. RETURNED!</li>
    <li> good product good price</li>
    <li> serves its purpose for the price but not the best quality.</li>
    <li> Really great set and everything is durable and sleek looking. I really like the idea of having all these items in one case and not having to search my room for anything of it.</li>
    <li> The case fell apart nearly immediately. Now all the tools just fall out. It&#x27;s worthless. I&#x27;m just bummed because I didn&#x27;t get around to returning it until too late, and now I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> All the set pieces are great. The only problem  is the container it comes in. It started to rip after 2 weeks just sitting there.</li>
    <li> Very nice and fashion wallet for this simple yet excellent kit.  I recommend it! Everyone should hav one of these.</li>
    <li> It was obvious from first inspection that the clasp on the hard case would not hold up repeated us; thus returned it for a refund.  The nail equipment in the case looked fine.</li>
    <li> low cost and good quality</li>
    <li> As expected, moderate quality. Mine came unused.</li>
    <li> Cheap and flimsy tweezers! The scissors are a joke! The clippers seem to be ok.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not buying this and spending a bit more for quality tools. These are like play toys.</li>
    <li> SENT THIS TO MY SON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AFTER GIVING IT TO ANOTHER SON FOR STOCKING STUFFER ON CHRISTMAS, HE REALLY WANTED IT HE SAID, &amp;#34;THIS IS EPIC&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great carrying case.  Excellent material.  Sharp and well constructed.  Expensive look and feel for a fraction of the price.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Poor quality, I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time to purchase another manicure set when different pieces from my last one started coming up missing as well I thought no other manicure set could compare. I WAS WRONG!!!! This set is a must have and it cost WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY LESS than my last one. This is by far the best set ever and some of the tools have HAPPY FACES on them!!!!!!!!! Total Wow Factor :)</li>
    <li> Nice set, nice price.</li>
    <li> So many tools for such a great price! I love it!</li>
    <li> I loved all the stuff that came with this and I have had it in my travel case since purchase. I don&#x27;t use all of the items in it, but I do love having them all at my disposal!</li>
    <li> This is a very mediocre set.  Everything you need is &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; but it lacks quality and isn&#x27;t even worth the $8 I spent.  You will see the same sets all over Amazon under multiple different names / slight modifications in # of pieces.  Based on the high ratings I&#x27;m guessing these are falsely reviews.</li>
    <li> it was nice and has a bunch of stuff, I got two more for travel and one for my son</li>
    <li> The pimple popper kind of terrifies me, but all the tools are well made and have given me no problems. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love personal hygiene items that smile at you? My toothbrush could learn some manners from these nail trimmers, and stop staring at me with that cold, mean eye.</li>
    <li> This product has everything I need and then some. Very cheap too. There are a few unnecessary items that I have no idea what they are used for and the case is built a little cheaply. But due to price, I cannot complain.</li>
    <li> Practical and convenient. Everything I need for a mani-pedi is in one very sturdy, compact, attractive carrying case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy; I needed a travel grooming kit. The picture is accurate, but once you have it in hand the case design makes the unit look like a woman&#x27;s clutch. The equipment is decent enough. The value is great. I&#x27;m embarrassed of it when security pulls it out of my travel bag.</li>
    <li> not the best manicure set that i have owned and pretty darn close to being the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are items in the kit that i would never use and the ones that i do... like the nail clippers well they just fall in my hands mid use. so then have to spend time trying to put them back together and i would rather not waste my time.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. Like the case, and the individual tools are very well made.</li>
    <li> It looks much nicer in the picture than it really is. It is cheap and as long as you keep your expectations low it&#x27;ll get the job done. I&#x27;d spend a little more next time and get a higher quality set.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Good price. Worth the price for the tools.</li>
    <li> The kit is generally of excellent quality, feels good, not slippery when hands are wet and generally contains the entire array of manicure implements (and is excellent for model building). The only flaw is the regular size nail clippers are weak and the extension arm collapses all the way to the base without cutting the nail sometimes. The large clippers would cut Shrek&#x27;s toenails.</li>
    <li> Has everything you could possibly ask for in a compact leather case.  All the tools are sturdy and metallic. The pincers work great for plucking hairs. The only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; with this is that there are so  many tools in that little box, it is hard to put it all back in perfectly.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this again that&#x27;s forsure. The quality is cheap and it doesn&#x27;t include a cuticle pusher or trimmer, crucial step in giving a manicure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Expected a bit higher quality.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the money.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made but did the work</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about the product. Due to the low price and I read some bad reviews on the product. I open the product and examine every piece. Each piece is well made and expect a long life at of them. I recommend them to everyone. I would buy the product again. I was prepared to send them back. They are a keeper for sure.</li>
    <li> These are not sharp enough even to trim my cuticles. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the quality of the instruments. I was looking forward to this kit thinking it would be a groomers necessity. Unfortunately the nail clippers and other cutting tools are very dull and do not cut well.</li>
    <li> Nice set. could in close some paper work, To let you know what each tool is for.</li>
    <li> Good for traveling and light manicure.</li>
    <li> Product and Service was Great</li>
    <li> Case is broken, disappointing</li>
    <li> Good deal anything you need in the world On nail</li>
    <li> Clipper are not that sharp</li>
    <li> quick delivery, good case, I haven&#x27;t used all the tools yet but the ones I have used are great</li>
    <li> Very nice set. I don&#x27;t know what I will use some of the pieces for but maybe I will.</li>
    <li> I liked the product even though it took a while to receive the package.  Compare to the price it is bad. Kit&#x27;s items are little thin but I think for personal use it is fine. My kit came alright except a little open area of the vinyl pouch.</li>
    <li> seems to work how it is suppost to, alot of &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; in it that I do not know how to use or what they are for, lol.</li>
    <li> I bought two and was impressed.Kept one for myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a small add-on gift for my husband for Christmas.  He has a big problem with in grown toe nails, and although it wasn&#x27;t the most exciting gift, I thought it would at least be useful.  Well, as it turns out, it was one of his favorite gifts!  He uses it absolutely all the time, and it has every tool one could ever use and more.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> great deal.  Very nice metal case with quality manicure tools.</li>
    <li> I purchased for scissors and nail cutter mainly All looks great, but the scissors and nail cutters doesn&#x27;t do the job. I would not recommend to any.</li>
    <li> not good quality, the scissors fell apart when I first use it.</li>
    <li> Way too many implements for under $7. Very nice case.</li>
    <li> Great, low cost set.  The tools are not cheaply made.  Smiles are weird though, but I think it comes from Japan, so that would probably explain it.</li>
    <li> It looks pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this item more than once. All 12 pieces are perfect and sharp. Product is well made</li>
    <li> Awesome kit to own but the tools are dull. Maybe just the set I received but I returned it.</li>
    <li> The stuff you get in this case is a little cheaply made, but it is useful nonetheless. The tweezers suck.</li>
    <li> Bought for gifts for others but looked of great quality I&#x27;m sure they will be very happy with them</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. The tools are sharp, but they&#x27;re too thick to be practical. This is a waste of money. I had to buy a new nail clipper set. I hope these guys refund me..</li>
    <li> Awesome kit! Quality product for the price!</li>
    <li> Tools all seem to be made for teeny hands -- too short for my normal-sized woman hands to handle with any control.  The cuticle nippers were oddly top-heavy, imprecise and not sharp.  I can&#x27;t imagine using more than 2 or 3 of the tools.  It looked like a good deal on the surface, but the kit has gone into my Goodwill donation box after one attempted use.  The case is cute, though. :-/</li>
    <li> I love this set itcomes with everything you could ever need!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Only bad thing is the case don&#x27;t stay shut and took forever to arrive</li>
    <li> Great deal. Everything a guy probably needs, and more.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, get dull quite fast.</li>
    <li> Flimsy, low quality, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about a year ago, and use it as an everyday kit. The tools and the case are sturdy, and have held up well. The only issue I have had, is that the tools slide out of their holders.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I only use this for the nail clippers, scissors, and the ear wax remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the black head extractor, and it only gave me pain and didn&#x27;t even take out the black head(s)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else is ok! Really good clippers.</li>
    <li> This little set was exactly what I was looking for at a great price. The case has a cute design, and has all the tools I could ever need. The clippers are sharp and do their job well. Everything is kept in its proper place and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about searching for misplaced clippers.</li>
    <li> its ok, pretty good for the price, a good solid 3 stars, maybe 3.5</li>
