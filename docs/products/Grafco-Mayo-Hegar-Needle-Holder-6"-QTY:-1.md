      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>But the sexist joke got me thinking that I really need surgical sutures</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>

      <li>I should have spent the extra $10 on better needle holders.</li>
      <li>I bought this needle holder to practice suturing at home as a medical student interested in surgery.  </li>
      <li>With the traditional you get a criss-cross or diamond pattern, these were just straight across.</li>
      <li>High quality needle holders...used in our orthodontic practice in place of traditional hemostats to apply elastic ligatures and elastic chains.</li>
      <li>Would definitely never use these on a live animal.</li>
      <li>Yes, I know better quality, but this quality is not two or three times more expensive, and at least ten times or more.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
      <li>The ratchet quickly became shoddy after a week of moderate use, popping open at every instance, and the overall quality wasn&#x27;t spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, what were sold to me as Mayo-Hegar needle holders, were in fact not.</li>

<li> Not a very strong grip at the front, could get away with it in a pinch</li>
<li> but they work so well when doing odd jobs where you need to clap something.</li>
<li> I bought what was on sale and that weighed a little.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re a bit small but they do the job.</li>
<li> What a waste!  </li>

<li> very difficult to use.</li>
<li> These scissors are HORRIbLE.  </li>

    <li> These do not handle very well. I should have spent the extra $10 on better needle holders.</li>
    <li> I am a doctor who lives in Belarus. Bought this magazazine 8 varieties of surgical instruments, in an amount from 4 to 10. Total 49 pieces. I bought what was on sale and that weighed a little. Shipping cost is almost 3 times more expensive. To me this product came a month later, he was brought to me from the U.S.. I was pleased with it, good quality for this low price. Yes, I know better quality, but this quality is not two or three times more expensive, and at least ten times or more.&lt;br /&gt;  I would like to have this store had the opportunity of international shipping and delivery cost is not for every instance of a One unit of weight&lt;br /&gt;I advise you to buy a good-quality and practically free.</li>
    <li> I bought this to practice sutures with.  It is functional and would be good for practicing sutures or for those die-hard outdoorsy types who carry sutures in their first aid kits.  This is not a surgical grade item that a surgeon would use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but it seems to be of acceptable quality to use for crafts and sewing. Perhaps if an emergency arises, then &#x27;YOU&#x27; might consider using them for stitches to stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> as a retired surgeon, i was used to using old discarded instruments for minor household chores and precise reloading chores. these instruments are better quality than hardware tools and easier to use.</li>
    <li> Bought these 6\\&quot; needle holders to add to my first aid kit along with a couple packs of suture&#x27;s. Alway out in the woods or on the river and cuts always happen, these are sturdy and will do a great job holding the needle to sew up a wound.</li>
    <li> The ratchet quickly became shoddy after a week of moderate use, popping open at every instance, and the overall quality wasn&#x27;t spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, what were sold to me as Mayo-Hegar needle holders, were in fact not. They were Webster needle holders.</li>
    <li> These scissors are HORRIbLE.  More like PINCHERS.  Why anyone would try to cut PAPER with these things is beyond ME.  Probably made from DIET soda cans from CHINA is my guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My SIMPLE suggestion is to make the edges SHARPER so that at least paper can be cut.</li>
    <li> Item is decent for the cheap price its selling for. It was a good buy for practicing suture patterns. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not what I ordered. This is a hemostat not a needle holder. The teeth on a hemostat can scar a needle causing it to damage flesh which is why a needle holder has NO teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s going to be better than using pliers for suturing , but not by much.  Stainless steel, but really cheap, ill-finished product out of Pakistan.</li>
    <li> good quality, great price</li>
    <li> Fine instrument.  Good enough for basic suturing.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  It does the job it was meant to do.  It also held up well in the autoclave</li>
    <li> have yet to use, but is very sturdy and perfect length. great product for the price. fast shipping and was exactly what I wanted. thanks.</li>
    <li> Bought these to supplement a just-in-case kit I bought to keep around the house for emergencies. I felt we needed a slightly better needle holder and the Grafco pretty good. Haven&#x27;t had any need to use it just yet but am familiar with this type of instrument and these look like they&#x27;ll do the job nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this needle holder to practice suturing at home as a medical student interested in surgery.  The quality is good for the money, but is not comparable to the needle holders used in the OR.  It is similar to the needle holders used in disposable suture kits.  Overall, it works just fine and is was exactly what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Grind marks evident. Electro-polish needed. It works well and will get the job done. It will be placed in my kit.</li>
    <li> What a waste!  After about a week of simply practicing these would not catch anymore and constantly popped open at the most annoying times.  NOT GOOD!</li>
    <li> High quality needle holders...used in our orthodontic practice in place of traditional hemostats to apply elastic ligatures and elastic chains.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered these, I feel like they could have been more descriptive in their wording. These Mayo&#x27;s work well, but the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are not traditional needle holder. With the traditional you get a criss-cross or diamond pattern, these were just straight across. Not preferable in true surgery, but for all intents and purposes when practicing, they work fine.</li>
    <li> I use these for a wide variety of jobs and the hemostats are great and the scissors are fine too.I would highly rec these ppl for anything they.</li>
    <li> Definitely cheap quality but sufficient for practicing tying knots and suture patterns. Would definitely never use these on a live animal.</li>
    <li> Excellent -  Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Used for vet school anatomy lab. They&#x27;re a bit small but they do the job.</li>
    <li> Works great for pushing needles through thick fabric and such items.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, great release, strong grip. Would buy again! I wish they made flat headed ones for suturing.</li>
    <li> very difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Decent Quality. prominent teeth but jaws close precisely.&lt;br /&gt;good mating surfaces.</li>
    <li> I needed these to hold a scalpel for craft protects,  and they are great for my needs. The scalpel fits very securely.</li>
    <li> as advertised, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I know this is a surgical tool used to hold the stitching needle, I&#x27;ve helped sew several wounds in my day but they work so well when doing odd jobs where you need to clap something. My Grandson and me use them when we go fishing to remove the hook. So many uses, great tool.</li>
    <li> Needed for vet purposes on the ranch. Arrived quickly and was just as I expected--and very reasonably priced. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a needle holder. It serves it purpose as I learn to suture.</li>
    <li> Needed to repair some of my kids stuffed animals.  I said men &amp;#34;stitch, not sew&amp;#34;  as a joke.  They are 6 and 5 so they didn&#x27;t get it.  But the sexist joke got me thinking that I really need surgical sutures w/ a curved needle and of course a needle driver.  This one fits the bill perfectly.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and worked as expected.  This purchase was to practice for a PA program that I am attending.</li>
    <li> Not a very strong grip at the front, could get away with it in a pinch but I will be looking for a more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; pair with some more weight and stronger grip on the needle.</li>
    <li> I am an orthopaedic surgeon. I purchased this for my medical student son-in-law to practice suture techniques. It works fine; smooth action, nice click and unclick just as it should. Would not be out of place in any surgical tray for real operations.</li>
    <li> Good quality stainless steel.  It hold up well after use, and cleaning.  I use it to practice my needle work, and stitching.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work, was jammed shut. I had to pay for return shipping; and NEVER GOT MY MONEY BACK. Ripoff. Might has well have set my money on fire.</li>
    <li> Got it to practice suturing. Works great.</li>
    <li> product was as advertised</li>
