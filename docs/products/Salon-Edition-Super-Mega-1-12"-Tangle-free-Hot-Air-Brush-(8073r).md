      <li>I ordered it quickly and it arrived in just 4 days.  </li>
      <li>This shouldn&#x27;t have come apart so quickly</li>

      <li>I was thrilled to find this style and brand on Amazon, as I can no longer find in local stores.</li>

      <li>Rarely used.... as I had my hair restyled</li>
      <li>My stylist is using Conair, one of the older models which I liked very much, but this particular one is not sold anymore.</li>
      <li>Hot air brush is the only thing I use on my hair which is kind of curly.</li>
      <li>It fits my hands very well and does a super job of drying my hair and putting style into it.</li>
      <li>DO NOT buy this item if you expect it to last a respectable amount of time.</li>
      <li>I make do as I do not want to invest in another Hot air brush at this time.</li>
      <li>The first one I bought at a salon 15 years ago.  </li>
      <li>This hot air brush works well.</li>
      <li>air brush quit working the first time I used it</li>
      <li>I am a 20 years old and usually, girls like us don&#x27;t use brushes and it does a great job.</li>
      <li>Although it worked very well for drying, the styling did not work so well.</li>
      <li>Makes styling my hair so much easier</li>
      <li>I suggested they remove the word &#x27;rotating&#x27; from their ad because it&#x27;s very misleading</li>
      <li>Really makes my hair so smooth its like a flat iron and a brush</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers here I found that this brush gives a nice, professional finish to my hair.  </li>
      <li>and it seems as though my hair has a lot more body than with any other dryer I have had.  </li>
      <li>It was a complete waste of money and besides, this product is more expensive than many other very good ones in the market!  </li>
      <li>Takes only minutes to style (I have a short haircut, very fine hair).</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, so I wasn&#x27;t trying to get more out of the product than it should have been capable of (as someone might if they had long, thick hair).</li>
      <li>As it got old, it would often smell hot.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t thank you enough for the quick service.</li>
      <li>I feel the ad is very misleading &amp; would not have purchased it if it was clearly explained.  </li>
      <li>Does a super job of smoothing and styling my hair (thick and fine).</li>
      <li>I began searching for a new one with no luck.  </li>
      <li>( I was ready to pay a little extra for better quality</li>
      <li>It is difficult to find this product and was excited when i was able to find it on amazon, but a product should last much longer than the 75 days that i&#x27;ve had it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually too large as I have a pixie hair cut.</li>
      <li>If you really want this product, same model; I suggest that you buy it elsewhere because if you buy it from this seller and by any chance the product is defective, they will NOT accept returns or give you any refund OR EVEN EXCHANGE IT!!!</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power I would like to use</li>
      <li>An old one I had just quit running</li>
      <li>it is identical to my old one</li>
      <li>Use it nearly every day.</li>
      <li>It still looks brand new, but I could smell the motor dying this morning when i turned the brush on low.</li>
      <li>Resting it against a running fan helps it cool down quickly enough to finish my hair</li>
      <li>Other hair dryers have too much power and send my hair flying every which way, but this one is oomphy enough on the high setting to dry my hair and gentle enough on low to style it.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as I had previously purchased.</li>
      <li>Caucasian, 71 YO female with thin (thyroid condition), fine (genetic) hair just below the ear lobes.  </li>

    <li> Caucasian, 71 YO female with thin (thyroid condition), fine (genetic) hair just below the ear lobes.  Other hair dryers have too much power and send my hair flying every which way, but this one is oomphy enough on the high setting to dry my hair and gentle enough on low to style it.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not for those with thick/long/coarse hair, but it works great for me.  I&#x27;ve waited a long time for this.</li>
    <li> I have had just about every hair dryer/styler brush out there.  This is by far the best.  It dries the hair quite fast, makes the hair smooth and it seems as though my hair has a lot more body than with any other dryer I have had.  I recommend this for everyone.</li>
    <li> The Salon Edition 1-1/2 Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush is wonderful to use when working with thick hair. With the quick release feature, my hair never tangles with the brush. It helps me smooth out my hair with body and bounce. Makes styling my hair so much easier and I always get great compliments on my hair when I style with this hot air brush.

    <li> This hot air brush works well. Takes only minutes to style (I have a short haircut, very fine hair). Heats up quickly, does not get overheated. I had it for about 5 months now. So far happy with it. My stylist is using Conair, one of the older models which I liked very much, but this particular one is not sold anymore. I wonder how Conair would do, because they look very similar, but Conair is cheaper (at least in stores).</li>
    <li> After searching for a hair dryer brush that rotated I thought I had found it, but I did not.  In spite of the ad&#x27;s statement : \\&quot;Rotating vented barrel releases tangle-free curls\\&quot;  this brush does not rotate unless you manually turn it.  I contacted the company that sold it inquiring how to  it to activate rotation &amp; their reply was as follows..... &#x27;Item description states \\&quot;Rotating vented barrel releases tangle-free curls\\&quot;.  If you still have any more questions please let us know.&#x27;  I didn&#x27;t feel this answered my question &amp; thought they misunderstood it.  I called them &amp; &amp; discovered they understood perfectly what I was asking in my email because by phone they immediately informed me the brush doesn&#x27;t rotate, but there is a button to push to untangle hair.  I suggested they remove the word &#x27;rotating&#x27; from their ad because it&#x27;s very misleading &amp; they said that it is put in by Amazon &amp; they have no control over it.  I feel the ad is very misleading &amp; would not have purchased it if it was clearly explained.  Becky</li>
    <li> Love it!  Second time I&#x27;ve ordered.  These like any other eventually wear out and I have to replace.  Otherwise these are perfect hot air brushes.</li>
    <li> Sounds a little rickety and rattling right out of the dirty box... I expect it to break soon, as most of these hot air contraptions do... Sounds like there is something in the fan...</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me and when I got in touch with the customer service, they are not ready to help.  If you really want this product, same model; I suggest that you buy it elsewhere because if you buy it from this seller and by any chance the product is defective, they will NOT accept returns or give you any refund OR EVEN EXCHANGE IT!!!( I was ready to pay a little extra for better quality but I was obviously wrong )  It was a complete waste of money and besides, this product is more expensive than many other very good ones in the market!  Their policy is \\&quot;once you have used it, we do not take it back\\&quot; !!!!  If the buyer does not try to use it, how will she know if it works fine or not??? !!!! BEWARE!    LOL</li>
    <li> Have been using  one of these for years. Always take it on trips. Use it nearly every day. But for some reason the cord has been made longer. Too long for my everyday use at home.&lt;br /&gt;Joyce W.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the new hot air brush. It fits my hands very well and does a super job of drying my hair and putting style into it. It is light and well balanced. My wife says my hair has never looked nicer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item years ago and truly love it.  As it got old, it would often smell hot.  I began searching for a new one with no luck.  Then I went to Amazon and there it was!  I ordered it quickly and it arrived in just 4 days.  I love it...it is identical to my old one and I thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush to style my hair as it dried. Although it worked very well for drying, the styling did not work so well.</li>
    <li> I am a 20 years old and usually, girls like us don&#x27;t use brushes and it does a great job. Really makes my hair so smooth its like a flat iron and a brush</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I gave it a 4 rating, cause  the rotating brush does end of breaking at the base.   Haven&#x27;t figured out how to stop that. But I do love  how big the brush is and how I get a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> I loved the product when I first bought it.  Within two weeks it started making noises like it was skipping, or cutting in and out, and it quit blowing as fast as it originally did.</li>
    <li> I have to return it, after I used it for a month a piece broke off, I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hot air brush is the only thing I use on my hair which is kind of curly. I can straighten it a little and turn curl into body! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this style and brand on Amazon, as I can no longer find in local stores. Exactly as I had previously purchased. Works beautifully!</li>
    <li> although this does not replace my hair dryer (and i don&#x27;t think it is intended to?), it is perfect for styling--either after hair washing...or between washings.  It is the easy, fast way to get my hair into shape on days when i don&#x27;t want to wash it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! for quick fix of hair or using it on semi wet hair it is great as doesn&#x27;t tangle hair. I&#x27;ve used these for yrs and yrs.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite.  I hesitated on the five stars though because these are kinda &amp;#34;touchy&amp;#34;.  If hair gets in the motor and burns it can knock out the motor and it is done.  So after going through 5 of these over the years I am extra careful.  Does a super job of smoothing and styling my hair (thick and fine).</li>
    <li> I have long hair. No tangles.  Easy on the hair. I spend less time on my hair and I finish with a beautiful shine and an easy curl. Will buy another one.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power I would like to use and I have fine hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Great air brush.  Can&#x27;t find this brand anymore.</li>
    <li> Rarely used.... as I had my hair restyled</li>
    <li> This is the second of these I have owned.  The first one I bought at a salon 15 years ago.  It still works, but the cord had developed an irritating short in it.  I hope this one is as long-lasting and performs as well as the other one.</li>
    <li> I love these air brushes.  I have purchased several....for me and my clients.  I wish I could get a discount so I could display them in my salon</li>
    <li> It has no power and does not heat up well.  You should stop selling these things. Total junk. Don&#x27;t sell them</li>
    <li> I love this hair tool. Use it every day!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay, however, I would have preferred two (2) brush rollers. One small and one medium. It&#x27;s actually too large as I have a pixie hair cut. I make do as I do not want to invest in another Hot air brush at this time. I would appreciate this company advising me to the availability of a smaller size brush for this model in the future. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I chose this review because I am so pleased with the item but especially pleased with how quickly I received it.  An old one I had just quit running and I was desperate for the new one.  I can&#x27;t thank you enough for the quick service.</li>
    <li> No packing slip or return instructions included in the package.&lt;br /&gt;The air brush quit working the first time I used it and I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn back on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; ve been able to use it twice in 4 days.  If it continues to be inconsistent I would like to return it and exchange it for the Vidal Sassoon counterpart.</li>
    <li> I used it about 2-3 times and really liked it.  My problem is that I took it on a trip, and the tip came off that holds the brush onto the wand.  It disappeared.  I can&#x27;t get a replacement tip, the packaging was thrown out, and it doesn&#x27;t work without the tip - so it&#x27;s worthless!  This shouldn&#x27;t have come apart so quickly so I&#x27;m not thrilled with the quality. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I have owned this machine or ones like it for years and continue to love the ease of doing my hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that this somewhat expensive hair brush has burnt out in less than 90 days. It is difficult to find this product and was excited when i was able to find it on amazon, but a product should last much longer than the 75 days that i&#x27;ve had it. Very disappointed in this product. It still looks brand new, but I could smell the motor dying this morning when i turned the brush on low. I have very fine hair, so I wasn&#x27;t trying to get more out of the product than it should have been capable of (as someone might if they had long, thick hair). Since I am past the 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with a brand new looking, broke, curling brush. This type of item should have at least a 90 day warranty through the manufacturer, but it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;ll be able to contact them directly. DO NOT buy this item if you expect it to last a respectable amount of time. I wish I could rate this zero stars, but the review makes me put something, so one star it is</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers here I found that this brush gives a nice, professional finish to my hair.  I followed the directions to use it on mostly dry hair but it eventually started to overheat, shutting itself off before I was done. Resting it against a running fan helps it cool down quickly enough to finish my hair but it&#x27;s overheating more frequently now so I assume it&#x27;s just wearing out.  I&#x27;m ordering another one today.</li>
