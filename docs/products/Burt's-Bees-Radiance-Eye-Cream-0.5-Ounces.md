<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do like bur&#x27;ts bees lipbalm so i tried the eye cream. I have dark circles and some fine lines. I tried it but didn&#x27;t really notice any improvements but on the bright side like all burt&#x27;s stuff it&#x27;s all natural and that&#x27;s huge too me. damn chemicals</li>
    <li> it makes me feel happiness~</li>
    <li> It is a nice care for you eye.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve tried  so dar4, leaves  skin super soft and lines are less prominent</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin daily moisturizer, but wanted something with a little spf, so bought the radience line - daily, night and eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product went on tacky and greasy and stayed that way. It never soaked into my skin. I even waited 30 minutes before applying makeup. I used a really good eye shadow primer and withing 10 minutes, my eye shadow was creased and smeared and worn off my eye lids. My face remained tacky to the touch all day. I was so relieved to wash it off. To top it off, there is a strange sour smell to the scent of this product that I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the eye cream and the night moisturizer. The night cream is smoother, less greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky at all. It also smells great, without the sour smell. It absorbs well, making my skin soft, subtle, lightly scented and smooth. I love the night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is even tackier than the daily moisturizer and just slides around on my skin like gel or something. The eye cream smells even more sour, bad enough I noticed it all day, even though I wore perfume. So far the sensitive skin moisturizer does better for making my fine lines less visible. It made wearing eyeshadow impossible, even with eye primer, even without the greasy daily moisturizer. Its like putting slime around my eyes, slime that bever dries. I tried three times, using less and less each time with little difference. Would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mid 30s with oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  I tend to use it all over my face and neck.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works well! I saw a lot of people complaining about the smell but I think it smells great and I feel like I can see a difference after only using it a short time!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very smooth and easy to put on. It does not irritate my eyes nor causes any redness. It makes the skin around your eye extremely soft and well-moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on at night after I shower and once again in the morning before I head out to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 and my skin has gotten really dry, and I have been trying many different types of eye creme over the last few years.  I couldn&#x27;t find an eye creme that would moisture under my eye well enough or they would be really greasy.  This product is great!  It&#x27;s the perfect weight, moistures really well, and the light diffusing elements in it help with my dark circles!  I can&#x27;t tell much difference in wrinkles, but I hadn&#x27;t ever noticed any difference in the past with any anti-aging product anyways.  This creme is inexpensive enough to give it a try, and a little goes a long way so it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use anything else by Burt&#x27;s Bees except for their original lip balm because the peppermint smell and taste is very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this eye cream from some blog I read, and was really skeptical and purchased it from amazon.com as Target sold it for $17.99. I would much rather pay $50 for an eye cream that works rather than a $17.99 that probably doesn&#x27;t work. In other words, I only like paying for quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite dubious about this eye cream, I still wanted to try it out and saw that amazon.com had the best price. 50% into my first jar, I realized that this eye cream is actually very moisturizing and smoothed out my wrinkles. Of course nothing erases them, but even my sister commented that my eyes look much younger. One thing to note about this eye cream is that it does contain fragrance. It is quite heavy in fragrance and even though that&#x27;s supposedly bad, this eye cream really works wonders that I don&#x27;t really care anymore. In fact, the smell is quite pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I&#x27;m in my late 20s and am just starting to get wrinkles for the first time in my life. I use this both in the AM and in the PM, and before that I was using Shiseido Future Solutions eye cream. I believe that one was somewhere between $85-$95 but didn&#x27;t perform nearly as well. I&#x27;m on my third jar now and it has been working consistently well and don&#x27;t see myself looking to try anything else anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I had been ising another brand for years around my eyes. I needed a replacement quickly because was unable to get the normal product.  I really like this.  I do wish it was in a tube not a jar.  I use a q-tip to keep it pure.  Works great in this cold weather.  I notice a huge difference. Really like this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels really great on, and my eye-area has been less and less dry/fragile lately. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Im 29 yr old with 3 babies so I have started getting dark bags under my eyes. I look like I got punched in my eyes. Ive been using this for about 3 weeks and I really havent noticed any difference.  I will say that it is super creamy and soft. It smells lovely and calming.  I will put it on before bed and in the morning I can still feel the cream on and my skin around my eyes are very very moisterized.</li>
    <li> I get this through the Amazon subscribe and save...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no its not for me...really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says this is the best stuff, and likes to use it, but it seems that she could not find it at the local drug stores, simply because they would sell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we have it set up to get some every couple of months, and it seems to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After her telling me what it normally costs in a drug store, I will say that we get it at a substantial savings!</li>
    <li> Great hydrating eye cream. Excellent price for a great product. I have tried many pricey eye creams and this one works better than some of the expensive ones I have used. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried this because my skin is delicate compared to years past.  It is a good choice. It feels just right when I smooth it on.</li>
    <li> I love this eye creme, I have teary eyes too, and it drives me nuts, but I tried using this during the day under my makeup and because it has royal queen bee jelly in it, it&#x27;s a little sticky so it&#x27;s not the best for when you are trying to put on makeup and it settles in the fine lines. I would recommend using the Ageless Eye Creme during the day (not sticky and goes much better under makeup) but I still give it five stars because it does tighten the skin around my eyes and I do see a difference. I alternate between the Radiance Eye Creme and the Ageless Eye Creme. Both are great products and I love the fact that they are natural too so you know that you are getting the best stuff for your buck. I think Burt&#x27;s Bees rocks, I love all their products, they have made my face and eyes look so much better than when I was using Olay products, my acne has been sooooo much better.</li>
    <li> This product will not turn back the clock but will leave your eyes soft and supple without any sting. Also it smells very pleasant.  I wish Burts bees would come up with an  eye cream that diminishes fine lines!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few years. It is the perfect consistency, and it is gentle on my sensitive skin. I only use it at night, because it is too creamy to wear under makeup. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> buy for my wife, she said &amp;#34;that&#x27;s very good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My left eye tears relentlessly so I have to mop it up every 10 minutes or so. The left eye started to look OLD compared to the right eye. I bought this little jar of eye cream and started off only using it on the left eye. Pretty soon the left eye looked YOUNG compared to the right eye. It&#x27;s the first skin care product I&#x27;ve ever bought that I can say positively that it really does work.</li>
    <li> Several products have been reformulated... my skin does not appreciate it... not to mention the new scent is TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi! I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for nearly 18 years -- back when you could only find the product in very specialized health food stores. The first product I used was the Apricot Baby Oil for my then unborn baby. I was hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used products faithfully since then. I encouraged my mother to carry them in her store in NY. I used include them in packages where I made homemade diapers for friends. I couldn&#x27;t think of a more natural product that I trusted impeccably. I have advocated the products to many people and have made many convert! I have often given my co-workers the lip balm for Christmas, and this year... I couldn&#x27;t believe the variety of balms. I even bought a variety pack to share with my children, and other than the peppermint, they may as well be cheap smelling fruity concoctions. I have remained loyal and faithful until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was running low on my Radiance Day Cream, purchased a new jar, the scent, texture and product is NOT the same. I purchased the Radience Eye cream... same thing... The real slap in the face was the Tomato toner which I discovered over 10 years ago... mild enough for my face. I swore by it. I switched from Este Lauder to exclusively Burt&#x27;s. Now it is overwhelming with an isopropyl alcohol scent and burns my skin. I can not tolerate it and have started breaking out from the products. I AM nearly 41... I shouldn&#x27;t be breaking out! Between these three products, I have have thrown away more than $50. Not to mention, jars now have plastic tops?? huh??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to add insult to injury, I learned from a friend that Burt&#x27;s was taken over by Johnson and Johnson. That would explain a lot!! Is Burt&#x27;s Bees no longer the amazing company that started in Raleigh, NC many years ago? I understand that popularity dictated larger production scale... but the recent changes seem more profit based rather than customer satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?! I am currently on the look out for face products that work with my skin as Burt&#x27;s is no longer the answer. Can I mail you back the products for a refund?? I no longer have the receipts... Why would I have kept them anyway? I trusted the product and have NEVER had to return a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you return to the original formulations, and please let me know when you do! I miss what this company stood for and the all natural good for me products.ion.  PLEASE explain the truth to what has happened to my tried and true products?!?!

    <li> It&#x27;s an eye cream.  It moisturizes, yes, but it&#x27;s best used at bed time then washed off first thing in the morning.  It flaked off in clumps under my makeup or even just by itself as the day went on.  I like my eye cream to do it&#x27;s job invisibly not invite attention to my under eye wrinkles.  As for improving my under-eye situation, I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I&#x27;m sure I would have seen worse under eye wrinkles had I not used anything at all of course.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This is my favorite eye cream. I wear pretty heavy eyelid makeup so I need good moisture after my makeup comes off, this cream does the job. It&#x27;s very creamy so a little goes a long way. After buying all kinds of very high priced eye creams, I found the one at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a couple of years now because of the positive reviews online. I really like the product - it hydrates the area under my eyes and blends in really well. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a simple eye cream that isn&#x27;t loaded with nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> Really like it so far; I&#x27;m on medications for acne that make my skin super dry and this has really helped!</li>
    <li> After trying several products to hide/prevent dark circles, this is my favorite. Compared to more expensive products, the price is great.</li>
    <li> Well I was looking for a natural eye cream that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the most expensive products that I can afford. I don&#x27;t really have puffy eyes or swelling so it&#x27;s hard for me to say on that. For me it does burn a tiny bit under my eyes but only for a few seconds. I&#x27;m only 26 and I was looking for something to prevent aging, and to moisturize. I really don&#x27;t notice any difference between using this and not using it on a short term basis. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week. It&#x27;s definitely something I only wear at night as it is semi greasy. I may look into other eye creams after I&#x27;m finished with this one. It seems decent and I would recommend others to try it.</li>
    <li> Love this gentle eye cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started seeing some lines appearing under my eyes so I wanted to start adding an eye cream to my skin care routine. I didn&#x27;t see any changes with this product after two weeks of use. I would normally continue to use the product until it was finished to see if it made a difference over the next couple months expect it has actually dried out my skin more and therefore not worth it. I love other Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one was very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The lid was cracked.  This stuff makes my eyes feel weird, not really all that great.  Sorta stingy on the skin.  I&#x27;m not going to buy it again, but I also recently discovered that Burt&#x27;s Bees isn&#x27;t really very natural anyway.  Guess I&#x27;ll stick to my coconut and olive oils :)</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the most soothing one I&#x27;ve found yet.  I don&#x27;t know that it helps my eyes look any younger, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t make them look worse - like most of the others did due to my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve on my second jar, and each jar literally lasts me for a couple of months, and I&#x27;m still doing well with them and not reacting negatively to the ingredients - which is just Wonderful!!!!  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, except I&#x27;d like to know that my eyes were looking younger for the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Even after the very first night of using this cream, I saw a significant (if not complete) decrease in the dark circles and puffiness of my under eye area. Although the smell is somewhat similar to diaper rash cream, this product is truly wonderful and I will use it as long as they continue to make it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month, exactly as directed to use, and I have seen no difference in my eye area. It does not make a dent in the dark circles, the morning puffiness and definitely doesn&#x27;t add a &amp;#34;queen bee&amp;#34; glow. I will keep using it as directed for another month and will update my review if I start to see results. However, I&#x27;ve used other products in the past and have started to see results by this time, even if mild.</li>
    <li> Good-quality product! I will refer to my friends.</li>
    <li> Not all all-natural products are created equal but this one really does the trick. I use it nightly and my super sensitive skin has never had a reaction to it. Keeps my eye area plump and well-moisturized.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t know how well it does with wrinkles, but it is great for my 20-something skin.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, good product. Skin around eyes move soft, does not cause mascara to smear. Definitely a great product. Works better than Lancôme or Clarins.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. For nearly $20 very disappointing. I remember using this Years ago! I really need it now! And it&#x27;s not the same. It&#x27;s not as thick. I remember the old stuff was thick &amp; a little sticky but not in a bad way at all, it was great. SUPER moisturizing for very dry delicate skin. And it really gave a little glow and highlight too. This stuff is more creamy/opaque looking and thinner consistency less like a thick eye cream and more like a lotion. It soaks in and I don&#x27;t feel like it moisturized as well or lasts as long. Soooooooooo sad that the old good stuff basically no longer exists. I&#x27;m gonna have to search high &amp; low and or get my herbalist balm maker friend to make a new one. My eyes need it :(</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It really does make a difference. The skin around my eyes looks brighter and smoother. I use it with Burt&#x27;s Bees &amp;#34;Intense Hydration Night Creme.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i like the product.  Makes my eyes feel moisturized, and for some reason, i think it is helping with my dark under eye circles, but will update later on if this is actually the case.  I need more time on it to be able to tell for sure.</li>
    <li> good product. good price. not too oily and shiny. so far so good</li>
    <li> the eye cream is Inexpensive and goes on very smoothly. It can&#x27;t  turn back time but it does improve your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> I just started using eye creams about a year ago (when the crows feet really started to show!). I&#x27;ve experimented with several and so far, this is my favorite. Goes on creamy and absorbs fast. A little goes a long way, too. It really seems to diminish my crows feet and makes my eyelids look smoother. The only down side is the way its packaged; I prefer pump bottles or tubes for my skin care products. I think they&#x27;re more sanitary and make the product last longer. Other than that, I love it!  (How &#x27;bout it Burt....put it in a tube for me...?)</li>
    <li> Emollient and smells great. Creamy to the touch and easy to put on eyes.  This is a lovely product. Buy it</li>
    <li> I just tried this product for the first time. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 54, in the last few months, delicate skin under my eyes has looked so thin, dry and super tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst suprise is that lately the pulling has also become VERTICAL pulling of skin right under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with eye cremes in the past is that they either burn, don&#x27;t work for more than a couple of hours and are mostly water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to work in full makeup, 10 hour days, 5 days a week. I agree that this creme is a little sticky. My undereye liner and concealer do not stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give this product a BIG YAY and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying power, hydration, immediate dry skin pulling relaxation results, effective. I won&#x27;t use this during the day on my work days in full makeup but, I will use it every night from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll probably continue to dab one tiny small pat on my crows feet after makeup for daytime, because it does the job of hydrating the dry crows feet and leaves a dewey look that I like, all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also use it on my days off when I use no makeup at all. Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It works very well for puffiness (a problem for me).  I have been using a product from Origins and then tried Oil of Olay.  This product is great and was also cheaper than anything else I&#x27;ve tried :)</li>
    <li> When I first got it, I applied it on eye. It does not help to reduce the lines and wrinkles. I was disappointed and not using anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Few days ago, I was looking for lotion. I found this eye cream again in my cabinet. I applied it on whole face at night.&lt;br /&gt;In the next morning, my face is firm and it is not dry as usual. It is as good as the high-end serum. Then I tried it few more days. The result is constant.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it definitely worth for a try.</li>
    <li> This is non-irritating and leaves the eye area feeling really smooth and soft. I love using this at night or during the day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of on the fence with this product. I&#x27;m sort of stuck between 3 stars and 4 stars so I&#x27;ll just give it a 4. I used this cream and have been for the past 2-3 months every morning and night. That being said, it did take away my dark circles but only slightly. It&#x27;s not a huge noticeable difference that some of the reviewers have mentioned. I decided to give it a 4 because of the quality of the cream itself. It absorbs quickly and the smell is very pleasant and light. It applies well too, not too creamy or oily, just right. I put it on at night as well is in the morning underneath my make up. I will continue to use this product until I find one that provides a more noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this eye cream because of the great reviews, however I&#x27;m disappointed. I used it everyday and sometimes at night, but I didn&#x27;t see any changes.  One thing I really did not like was towards the middle of my day I noticed I had white creases.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second tub of this eye cream.  I love it because it has a low rating on the EWG rating website as far as toxin levels.  I also love how thick of a moisturizer it is.  As women, we know we need to take care of our eyes especially because fine lines are the first sign of aging :-/  I feel this has helped keep me looking young (even tho I&#x27;m only 29 but have the first signs of fine lines) because it leaves such a saturated moisturized feeling.  No bad side effects, so I will continue to use this!</li>
    <li> I was having an issue with the skin around my eyes being try but this product definitely cleared that problem up rather quickly. I use it on my under eye area as well as my lids.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a couple of months, I have to say that I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but this one is lacking.  The cream is not very moisturizing for dry skin (which I have). Also, I must have had too much of the product &amp; got some in my eyes ... they were BURNING!  The product is ok, but I&#x27;m going on to try something different.</li>
    <li> Keeps eye area hydrated, making wrinkles less noticeable. I don&#x27;t know if it makes a huge difference. I had never used eye cream and started using this a couple years ago when I noticed my late 20&#x27;s were not looking so great in the crows feet area. I feel like there has been an improvement overall and it helps me feel like I&#x27;m being proactive. Will continue to use. Also, works well under makeup. I usually give it a couple minutes to dry and then put on my primer.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> This is definitely an interesting product that has an almost immediate effect for both men and women! It&#x27;s really better suited to address dark circles under eyes, not puffiness. As soon as you use it you&#x27;ll see why they used the word \\&quot;radiance\\&quot; in the name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT PAY ATTENTION TO HOW MUCH YOU GET!! Walmart and Walgreens have it priced at about $18 for 2 ounces, this is .5 ounces for about $10 so it costs about twice as much on Amazon as it does at your local retailer.</li>
    <li> I had a facial about 2 weeks ago and was told I was starting to show \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; around my eyes. The woman said it wasn&#x27;t a big deal now but would be in about 10 years. I did a search on Amazon to find the best eye cream. Burt&#x27;s appeared to have good reviews so I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been VERY pleased with the results. I used to wake up in the morning looking like a fish. The eye cream has taken all the puffiness away. I&#x27;m not sure about the fine lines because I really couldn&#x27;t see anything then but assume because it has helped reduce my puffiness it is working on those fine lines. I guess time (ie 10 years) will help.</li>
    <li> I believe I have hit the jackpot with the creamy, soothing formula and would recommend it to first time buyers anytime!  S. P.</li>
    <li> The skin is very comfortable with a taste like the real thing, can feel moisture,The skin is very comfortable with a taste like the real thing, can feel moisture,</li>
    <li> Excellent price on amazon!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s for my mom, who found this one time on sale at a pharmacy type store. she got it out of need but ended up loving it more than all the other eye creams she&#x27;s tried.&lt;br /&gt;so... here&#x27;s for round two.&lt;br /&gt;she uses very little, but nearly daily, and it lasted her almost  a year.</li>
    <li> I was a regular Nivea user until the thick, greasy formula started to give my eyelids serious irritation. Thinking that Burt&#x27;s Bees would be the answer, I chose this. It is not any different, and the thick formula, although doing its job of quality moisturizing, still is too heavy and causes irritation on my eyelids. I do not recommend for anyone who has easily irritated skin; I should have gotten the sensitive formula.</li>
    <li> My number one criteria has to be: am I allergic to the ingredients or smell? Clearly you don&#x27;t want something you are allergic to right next to you eyes. I am not allergic to any thing in this sweet smelling eye cream :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, but I wish it was a bit more rich. It doesn&#x27;t sink in super fast; I don&#x27;t want to rub it in so I just let it fade in. I may in fact be at an age where I should use something more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, but as eye creams are expensive I can&#x27;t afford to spend what it takes to try many others at the risk of having a nice smelling paperweight.</li>
    <li> I remember others commenting on the scent, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad...a little odd, but not overwhelming and it does go away after a short time.  Overall I like it!</li>
    <li> Works great on dark circles for a Caucasian.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t improve the appearance of my under eyes at all. Mine are very dark, because I have dark brown skin. I don&#x27;t know if that has to do with it. I used the entire thing because it is a nice moisturizer and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in puffiness or dark circles after using for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Friends say with a very moist, effective mitigation eye skin wrinkles, worth having, but also has some effect on the dark circles</li>
    <li> A few years back I found myself rubbing my eyes excessively due to a weird itchy feeling probably brought on by general tiredness and dry climate.  Eyedrops did not work for me, so I experimented with a few eye creams until I settled on this one.  The product does have a distinctive smell, but it does not last upon application. The cream goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t shine as much as other creams do.  Within a day I was no longer rubbing my eyes and I appeared more energetic to my peers and coworkers.  After a few weeks I noticed how taught my skin felt, and the fine lines that appeared directly under my lower eyelid were greatly reduced -- although I must point out that bags under my eyes were not noticeably different, which was another reason why I shopped around for eye creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the cream once in the morning on both eyes and it easily lasts the whole day.  I need a new jar about every five months.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it feels and smells good but I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it actually does anything.  Feels a bit like the Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes.  My under eye area at least has not become worse for using this.</li>
    <li> This is ok,  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes which is good but it is a bit pricey and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in the skin above or under my eyes</li>
    <li> Good for keeping the skin underneath the eye soft but not so much for lightening dark circles.</li>
    <li> My eyes definitely look brighter.  :)  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Makes my skin feel soft and renewed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Royal Jelly Eye Cream for about month now, using it morning and at night. However, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be making a difference. Even though I&#x27;m almost 30 and don&#x27;t have too many fine lines, I feel like this cream has somehow made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance the texture of the cream seems light/airy and smells pretty nice, but after patting it around my eyes it doesn&#x27;t spread as evenly. It&#x27;s not emollient enough, nor is it hydrating. In fact, I feel like my under-eye area is even more dry after using this product. I will definitely not be repurchasing this eye cream.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this eye cream it would sting my eye area and make my eyes tear up all night. The second time I bought it, I think the formula changed because it smells the same but no longer makes my eyes sting. Overall it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing. I still have dry patches at the corners of my eyes. It&#x27;s a bit pricey and I dislike how you have to dip your finger in the pot - not very clean. I&#x27;ve been disappointed with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this was no different.</li>
    <li> i only had this product for a week, but i can tell its working. So far im very happy with the results. it gives my skin a fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> It sinks in and has no odor and it&#x27;s natural so that&#x27;s all good like that but I don&#x27;t think it does much for wrinkles. It somewhat moisturizes but the effects are not lasting. It&#x27;s good for an in between eye cream, like when you don&#x27;t want a strong cream every day.</li>
    <li> this product is very light, it smells really good but isn&#x27;t too overly oily! Does it help reduce dark eye circle? Not sure. But it&#x27;s very good moisturiser</li>
    <li> I love this product. It helped with the fine lines and keeping it moisturized without being greasy. I use it after every face wash. I like the fact that its all natural, too. Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> very moist. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many of Burt&#x27;s Bees products but never the eye cream; it smells heavenly and is very moisturizing without feeling heavy. A lot goes a long way but when it&#x27;s gone I will buy this product again :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second eye cream and I love it. The texture is thick and the smell... you have to get used to though works really well. I&#x27;m still in my 20s and bought this for my dark and puffy eye circles.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product. I still have it. It seems to work great, but it gives me weepy eyes, even when I am sure it is clear from the eye opening. I am really sad this is not working for me.</li>
    <li> For the price, a wonderful eye cream to use at mornings pre-makeup and at night before sleeping. A great value.</li>
    <li> It works, really works.  You have to keep on top of this in order to see results; I was faithful for the first little bottle; a little application on the puffy areas goes a long way.  I have to order more now!</li>
    <li> I May 28, 2014 to purchase, goods mailed to me as 0201101, I think it has exceeded shelf life, and I&#x27;m not sure if he could also use the</li>
    <li> Works great.  Smell is no problem.  Goes on smooth and stays on.  I use it morning and night.  Only took away a star because I dropped this in the sink, from about 6 inches, not long after buying and the lid cracked. Can&#x27;t take it on overnight trips now.  The lid stays on enough to keep the product for drying out but for the price, wish the packaging was a big stronger.</li>
    <li> It smells great and leave the skin under my eyes smooth but doesn&#x27;t do much else for them.</li>
    <li> NIce product.  Has softened my eye wrinkles some, but not a lot. I was hopeful it would help with the bags under my eyes, but it has not.  I will continue to use it though, as I do like the softness it has given me around the eyes and between my eyebrows.  Thanks….</li>
    <li> I have only used this for about two weeks so far and can already see a positive difference in puffiness and darkness under my eyes. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have already noticed under my eyes becoming brighter and natural color coming back after a week of using.</li>
    <li> Works and just a little go a long way. Love Burt&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> Read good reviews about it but have yet to try it. Hopefully, it&#x27;ll help my tired eyes!</li>
    <li> Though I have been using an eye cream both morning and night, after applying under-eye concealer, I could always see fine lines appearing quickly. I thought the issue was that I needed a better concealer, but after trying a couple different brands with no improvement, I thought I was just stuck with looking older because of noticeable fine lines. HOWEVER, after using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream, there is a HUGE improvement! Under-eye concealer no longer settles into my fine lines, and I look more awake and the dark circles are less noticeable. I love the price of this product, as many eye creams are easily $50 or more. Great product!</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Feels silky absorbs quickly and your under eye look so hydrated</li>
    <li> i got this for puffiness under my eyes.  i didn&#x27;t notice much difference, but it definitely smoothed out my wrinkles/crows feet. i usually just use at night.</li>
    <li> I bought this eye cream because of all good reviews I&#x27;ve read here.&lt;br /&gt;My expectations were good. Once I started to use it I barely could breath due to such bad smell it has , something like smoke or I don&#x27;t know how to explain. Other people around me could feel that bad smell coming from my face as we&#x27;ll, wich was so weird! I had to explain to them &amp;#34; Sorry, this bad smell is coming from my face because I&#x27;m trying to use a new product...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;If it worked would be fine but actually it doesn&#x27;t! Just let my skin little smooth but to do so I can use another ( much better) cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for about a week now and I already see results!! Smells good and is very creamy. I will buy again for sure!!! Love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian in my mid twenties. I don&#x27;t have any deep set wrinkles yet but I have slight dark circles around my eyes. I used this cream before bed and in the morning. I noticed that it helped my eyes look less tired but not much beyond that (in terms of prevention and anti-aging). I really didn&#x27;t notice any improvements but I do like the product for slightly helping with sunken dark circles. I guess it is good for its price.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as more expensive products but my skin has no adverse reaction to it and the under-eye area remains moist and supple for the most part.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any real difference with under eye dark circles. I liked the fact of the royal jelly ingredient. I may still use to moisturize under the eye due to the royal jelly. It does smell like bandaids, its ok.</li>
    <li> I try to buy this cream, my skin feels just right have no adverse reactions and most under-eye area moist and supple.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised.Have been using for one week and so far am satisfied.Feels great going on,only using at night and not really as a moisturizer under makeup</li>
    <li> I have been using this Burt&#x27;s Bees Eye Cream under my dark circles for about three weeks. The results weren&#x27;t fantastic. I did see a slight difference, but not enough to amaze me. If you have really bad under eye (dark circles, eye bags, eye wrinkles), this is not for you. Other than that.. it&#x27;s not too greasy, smells good, and makes your skin feel good.</li>
    <li> good pruduct my mom like it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have hereditary dark circles and always get comments about looking rough or tired. This product actually works in getting rid of dark circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> love the smell and it is good nighttime cream</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye cream for many years, and have always loved it!!  I have very sensitive skin and wear contacts, and this eye cream does not affect either (greasy creams sometimes get into my eyes, causing issues with my contacts).  This eye cream is light, yet very moisturizing, and the little jar lasts me about six months (applied once per day), making it an excellent value.  I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t miss with any Burt&#x27;s Bees product.... goes on smooth, and won&#x27;t irritate... it won&#x27;t make your wrinkles go away or anything (you&#x27;ll need a Retinol for that)... but this adds nice moisture, especially b4 bed.</li>
    <li> This protects the eye area and helps reduce the circles.  Gentle on the skin, too.</li>
    <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream better than the face cream.  It seemed to melt in faster and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.. I&#x27;m not sure it is improving my wrinkles, but it is moisturizing my under eye skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but was disappointed that this didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer to tackle this specifically, you may have better luck with another product.</li>
    <li> I received the eye cream yesterday and when I opened the bag I found that the bottle cap was broken. That was terrible.</li>
    <li> Tried using this product for a week, it made the circles under my eye appear even more pronounced. Stopped using. I&#x27;m a guy in my 30s.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year and the smell of the cream has diminished. It smells kind of burnt at this point, and I still haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my eyes. The cream doesn&#x27;t really stay on either, it&#x27;s more watery substance.</li>
    <li> Great on the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> This is my first eye cream ever. I have to say that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results of this eye cream. I&#x27;ve always been a Burt&#x27;s Bees fan and believe in their products, but this Radiance Eye Cream is probably my favorite, most effective product from Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on around my eye area after I take a shower and at night before I go to sleep. The reason I don&#x27;t put this on in the morning is that it leaves a sticky, oily-looking residue underneath my eyes, which is something I don&#x27;t want people to see when I go out to start my day. So I put this on at night, so that during the night, my skin can fully absorb the cream. The morning after application, my skin has no oiliness or shininess. What&#x27;s amazing is that my skin also looks more puffy, that is, not sunken down into my dark circles and lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest that sometimes I forget to use this Radiance Eye Cream every single night. But when I do use it, I see the results quickly. I have no doubt that if I used this every single night, I would see a drastic improvement in my wrinkles and skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the packaging, the jar is made out of glass and the lid is made out of plastic. I dropped it once when I was traveling and the lid cracked, but the jar stayed intact. Thankfully, I found another lid that fit the jar perfectly, so that the cream wouldn&#x27;t dry up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to note that the smell of this cream isn&#x27;t pleasant, but it&#x27;s also not unpleasant. It smells sort of like cardboard to me. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that much though.</li>
    <li> I am in my thirties and just starting using some eye creams. I have sensitive, dry/combo skin. This cream just doesn&#x27;t absorb well at all. I am sure it does some good but I have a hard time spreading it comfortably like I normally can with other creams I use on my face.</li>
    <li> I tried it for about 2 weeks- nada.  I am an eye cream junkie &amp; this did not make the cut. Smelled nice though.</li>
    <li> I have had black circles for as long as i can remember, and im only 25. Ive noticed a dramatic difference within days. I normally will not spend this much money on a beauty product, but i needed something new and was offered super saver shipping. I will get this again once my 2.5 ounces runs out. Im not sure if i can live without it.</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees because of the natural ingredients. This is superb, thick and creamy. It is priced much less than retail stores.</li>
    <li> It OK, I will keep using it until it gone however I will not repurchases. The smell is very nice but when on your face the product become very liquid and somehow always gets in my eyes!</li>
    <li> This is an o.k. eye cream.  My eyes are dry at the end of the day.  It smell bad--maybe old.</li>
    <li> I use the Radiance Eye Cream during the day. What I like about this product is that my mascara doesn&#x27;t run or smudge and it keeps my lower eye area soft till evening.</li>
    <li> its good if ur looking for hydrating eye cream and moisturizing but didn&#x27;t notice that different in treating dark circles or fine lines tighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can be use in morning time under the makeup okay</li>
    <li> Nice product that I have used for years. Good for people with sensitivity around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is:&lt;br /&gt;- very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- light weight&lt;br /&gt;- a great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> What a great product! AND it is almost twice the price at Target &amp;Walmart. Great deal</li>
    <li> so well,better than lancome</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy eye cream. Too soon to notice any wrinkle improvements, but will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees is a good company and this product does the job. It is light and smooth on the skin but feels like it is hydrating. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Meh, don&#x27;t notice any change. Will probably switch back to aveeno.</li>
    <li> This cream works on very fine lines and it is an awesome primer underneath my concealer.</li>
    <li> I recently began to use this eye cream.  The cream is somewhat sticky and tacky, which isn&#x27;t bad for an eye cream, except if it is not rubbed into the eye area properly there tends to be a residue.  The smell of the product is not really bad however it is not the most pleasant smell either.  It is similar to the \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; smell some creams have.&lt;br /&gt;  The cream is not cheap, however it is not as expensive as some eye creams can be.  But for the price, I think it should have met expectations.  It is true, as some reviewers have alluded to, that some products in the Burts Bees line have changed.  I don&#x27;t know for sure if this one has.  Also for reference, the Royal Jelly ingredient is not near the top of the ingredient list.  Not that it should be necessarily, but for reference.  I have used other products from this company and been pleased, but this product was not one of the great ones.&lt;br /&gt;  There are other eye creams from Burts Bees which I haven&#x27;t tried yet.  If I do, I&#x27;ll try to review them.</li>
    <li> Radiance is my new favorite. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month,  and it works for me. Its light texture absorbs guickly and has a pleasant scent.  I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work, waste of money</li>
    <li> good in nourishment, only a small portion can moist your eyes whole day</li>
    <li> Love it! I can see the difference</li>
    <li> I thought it was very good. It had a lotion smell but was not offensive. I was really broken out from the holidays and dry skin - and it helped to heal things up and re-moisturize. I would recommend it. I went through it way too fast!</li>
    <li> I must say I was skeptical that an eye cream this reasonably priced would work, but, boy was I wrong!  From the first time I used it, it went on effortlessly and easily and kept my eye area moist all day long.  I&#x27;m 65 so the area around my eyes has gotten thinner and drier as the years have gone by, but this cream really hydrates!  I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> My eyelids and the surrounding skin lately has been suffering minor eczema inflammation and been treating it with all sorts of moisturizing agents, mainly organic oil i.e. jojoba, rosehip, grapeseed and olive oil and some have helped.  It&#x27;s been several weeks now and the skin around my eye is still superiorly red and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much added research on the best eye cream (at a very reasonable price) I bought this on Amazon relying my faith on the previews reviews of the buyers and they did not disappoint.  This eyecream if fragrance free - LOVE IT - not oily and easily absorbed - LOVE IT - and I believe finally helped my eye heal and now, I religiously put it on daily before all the makeup and so far, has quenched my dry skin.  A DEFINITE good/smart buy!</li>
    <li> Burts Bees Eye Creme is overrated. For the money one could buy a good moisturizer and be just as well off. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Other eye creams I have tried seemed to irritate my eyes, even if I was careful not to get it too close to my eyelids. This cream is very &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and it has made a difference for me.  It also has a nice, subtle scent.  Will def get more!</li>
    <li> This cream is light and soft; moisturizing...it&#x27;s not for tightening or removing fine lines; although they will look better or even disappear with this moisturizer...those other creams can hurt the sensitive skin around the eye...I like it very much!</li>
    <li> It is fine for Pennsylvania winter. But really think it is just normal rich eye cream. Do justice to its price though.</li>
    <li> I have bought several different eye creams and so far I absolutely love this one the best. It makes the skin under the eyes so soft and smooth. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I am a 22 y/o female, noticed I was getting some dark circles and a few fine lines around the eyes, but mostly bought this for the dark circles. After using this product for almost a month, i have noticed a lightening of the skin under my eyes, and the lines have faded a small bit as well. As purely  a moisturizer, i like the scent of it and the fact that its not too greasy, and I wear it under make-up in the morning and again at night before bead. overall, i like what it&#x27;s done so far, but don&#x27;t expect anything too dramatic. I would buy this again, but it is a little pricey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now been using this product about 4 months, and I am addicted! Even thought I am regularly well-rested, I was having some trouble with dark circles. Originally gave it a 4/5. Changed my rating to 5/5 because it&#x27;s lasted much longer than I expected, only 1/2 done with it now, and the dark circles have completely vanished. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, although I wish it were a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOOK FLAWLESS TODAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM KILLIN IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY KILLIN THE SKIN CARE GAME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE YOU BURT.  LOVE YOU BEES.</li>
    <li> A lot of people have been complaining about the smell, so when I ordered it, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  However, I actually kind of like the smell.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it smells mildly fruity, and I don&#x27;t really notice it after its been on for a couple of minutes.  As to how the product works, I don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference.  I&#x27;m only 27 though, and my eyes were in pretty good shape to begin with.  I mainly started using it as preventative care.</li>
    <li> Heard so much about how great their products were, but very disappointed after using them.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes nicely and is non-irritating. Not sure of the line-erasing benefits.</li>
    <li> After using this product for about a week, I developed some raised red itchy patches around my eyes. I can use these products on my face, lips, and body, but my eyes are too sensitive for the honey or bee pollen ingredient. So, just a heads up for anyone who might have a similar allergy.</li>
    <li> i will not buy burt&#x27;s bees cometics again ,unuseful greasy</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price, same results as Lancome and Obagi eye creams for a third of the price.</li>
    <li> Over the past year I have begun reading the labels of products that I put on my skin the same as I do the foods that I eat.  It was alarming to learn so many of the beauty products on the market have questionable and dangerous additives.  So I have turn to Burts Bees products as being more natural and safer.  I love the consistency of this eye cream...works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now because I have a problem with puffiness. I know that it will take some time to diminish the wrinkles etc but I expected to see the puffiness/bags reduced. Well it&#x27;s been a week and this cream has made absolutely no difference with my bags. It moisturizes nicely but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ll be trying something else.</li>
    <li> Anything Burt&#x27;s Bees is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks, and I am very happy with it.  It is not too heavy whether it has improved the appearance of my eyes, I like to think so  and that makes me happy.  I will buy it again</li>
    <li> Fragrance was too strong and I did not like it at all.  Very disappointed.  They should make an unscented product.</li>
    <li> Winter is hard on the skin in my high dry climate.  Burt&#x27;s Bees always comes through with great products and value.  I love the feel of this deeply moisturizing cream under my eyes.  Update:  Under eye puffiness has almost completely resolved over about six months of steady use.  Genetics was playing a big part in my eye bags as my diet is great and I exercise regularly.  Genetics has been vanquished thanks to this lovely little jar of night cream.  Thanks Amazon and big thanks to Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> My eyes are normally OK and I just ignore them.  Sometimes they get super dry and itchy, which is when I tend to use eye cream.  This product has an odd smell, but I kind of like it.  I don&#x27;t know if it helps me though.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product.  In a very few days I saw a big difference in the wrinkles under my eyes.  The skin was smoother and firmer.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
    <li> I was using ARC day and night cream. When I ran out of my day cream, I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Radiance Eye Cream to see how it measured up to the ARC which was like 3 times as much. I am thrilled with the consistency as well as how well it hydrates my eyes. It&#x27;s very light and quickly absorbed so I do not need to rub the delicate skin surrounding my eyes. I would recommend this for any age group.</li>
    <li> Very good and i will buy it again</li>
    <li> I still have this product a little goes a long way and I had this far about a year maybe...maybe not that long but if used on a consistent basis there will be great results not oily or won&#x27;t leave a residue either</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing without being greasy, but this did not help any with my eye puffieness and dark circles. If you want an eye moisturizer, just use your face moisturizer on your eye area and save some money.</li>
    <li> Best.eye cream. ever.  ADORE this stuff and think it&#x27;s an amazing bargain!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great little cream , smells so good and so far work like a hidratant&lt;br /&gt;dont feel any bad effect , buy more for sure , come on time</li>
    <li> Just hitting 30, I&#x27;ve become slightly obsessive with staving off the aging process through preventative products.  While this does not have retinol or any other stuff like that, I will say that it definitely is a great moisturizing eye cream!  It&#x27;s a little strongly scented but nothing that will make you retch or your eyes burn.  I use it nightly when cleansing my face before bed as the formula is a bit greasy and kind of wreaks havoc on eye makeup if you use it during the day and have to put makeup on.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half and I will say that it has definitely brightened up my eye area.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles (yet) or super dark under eye circles/bags but my eyes look healthier and, well, more radiant than they have in the past few years.  Definitely a good eye cream and a better price than local drugstores.  If you&#x27;re looking for a basic low end nightly eye cream, this is definitely a good purchase to supplement your beauty regimen with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye cream hack - use your ring finger to apply the cream as for most people, the ring finger is the least used on your hand therefore keeping the pad more smooth which means less pulling on the gentle eye area!</li>
    <li> Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
    <li> This product smells good and feels good under my eyes.  I noticed my dark circles brightened in less than a week.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed my husband or my son&#x27;s eyes got more radiance but they use it everyday. I like the natural ingredients i this Burt&#x27;s Bees eye creme.  It is at least not made with harmful stuff and I feel safe for my kid and husband to use it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many high and low end eye creams and nothing is special out there. they all feel good, but nothing dramatic, and sometimes i get milia (little white bumps) on my eye lids from applying 2-3x a day. I decided to try this product after running out of my $65 eye creme. I started using Burt&#x27;s in mid December 2012, and I started noticing a difference about 2 weeks ago (late Jan 2013).... So in about 6 weeks I saw improvement.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been thinking, it&#x27;s time to review, I am really, really, loving this eye creme. it feels light, and fresh when applied. No strong scents, just natural. This paired with MyChelle vitamin C serum (LOVE) and Mychelle deep repair creme has been working great. I am 29 and have light, olive toned skin btw... The best regime I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;-major reduction of dark circles (due to Italian genes)&lt;br /&gt;-creases smoothed out&lt;br /&gt;-bright, toned, younger looking eye area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s crazy how much better and younger I look with a better eye area. I stopped wearing under eye concealer and barely wear mascara anymore, because I really want to accentuate my (new) youthful eyes. I know you&#x27;re probably rolling your eyes thinking, come on lady, but man, once you find your ideal creme, you really want to share it with the world and encourage everyone else to try it because it feels good to look good.... it&#x27;s a beautiful thing.</li>
    <li> Best dark circles results ever. Feels great as an hydratating eyecream also, and smells amazing. Will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> kinda weird smell, made my skin feel hydrated, but I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference over time.</li>
    <li> The eye cream works good. It helps reduce the wrinkles under eyes and keep eyes look fresh. I don&#x27;t have too much requirement for eye cream, so cannot comment more on others aspects. And I also like its more natural ingredients, which make me feel safe to use.</li>
    <li> If you are, or think you might be, allergic to bees, DO NOT use this.  The ingredients in the Royal Jelly, which is listed as an ingredient of this product, is made with Bee FECES (POOP) as well as Bee POLLEN.  Not safe stuff for many of us.  BEWARE!!! Sadly, this product does not even taut a disclaimer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old college student, prone to the occasional late night and early morning. As a result of two years practicing unhealthy sleep habits, I developed characteristic dark circles under my eyes. I ordered this eye cream in the hopes of it being able to address the problem, and it has done so marvelously. I apply it randomly, whenever I remember to, and after 2-3 weeks of use every day, every other day, sometimes every 3rd day (random, like I said) I have noticeably less darkness under my eyes and every intention of continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good work Burt&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I waited to write a review until I had been using this product for a couple of weeks.  I am in my 60&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve been using more expensive eye serums until I decided to try this product.  I really love it.  Very light.  Absorbs quickly.  It truly helps minimize lines around my eyes.  I also rub some into my &amp;#34;frown line&amp;#34; to soften it.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable for my eyes. One of the few eye creams I love so far. It definately worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been seriously researching eye cream. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that&#x27;s not super expensive but that works great. I use this in the morning and at night. I find that it doesn&#x27;t dry (and I have patience, I&#x27;ll wait about 2 hours before applying make up) but it makes under my eyes look white and almost dirty b/c the make-up builds up in the cream. And I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and I notice no change at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help hide / improve my dark circles.  After using this product for several months, I have not noticed any improvement.  Disappointing for what is normally a reliable brand.</li>
    <li> As someone who is constantly sleep-deprived, and who also deals with bad allergy-related sinus inflammation, I am in a constant battle with the bags under my eyes. In the past, my weapon of choice was Kiehl&#x27;s Eye Alert, a magical combination of Vitamin E and caffeine that is extremely effective. Eye Alert, however, is $21.50 for a .5 oz tube, plus shipping if you don&#x27;t happen to live conveniently neat a Kiehl&#x27;s store (which I do, sort of, but it&#x27;s out of the way). Currently I&#x27;m in law school (see: sleep-deprived), and am looking to save wherever I can, so I figured I&#x27;d give this stuff a shot at half the price of Eye Alert. From a pure cost-effectiveness standpoint, it succeeds. It is about half the price, but works more than half as well. Given a steady income, I&#x27;d splurge on the Eye Alert, which is much more effective (and that .5 oz tube lasts quite awhile). In the meantime, though, this is a fine substitute.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a very pleasant honey scent, and comes in a small glass jar. It is very rich-- too rich for my skin. Also, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the jar since repeatedly dipping my fingers into the product seems unhygienic.</li>
    <li> I really like this as a night cream, but don&#x27;t use it in the morning.  It is a little too thick for me to want to put makeup on over it (might be because I am always running late and don&#x27;t have time to let it absorb).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of eye creams. This one is okay for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months, and its only about a quarter gone. It&#x27;s moisturizing enough, and has never made me break out even though I use it morning and evening. (I have combo/oily skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I see a difference in my dark circles? Nope. But I didn&#x27;t expect to, because my dark circles are hereditary and the only thing that takes care of those is a good concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 24 but I have some teeny fine lines from sun exposure and from working at a computer all day. As far as I can tell there is no change in my fine lines, and they are extremely fine. If you have deep wrinkles skip this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on how this works for puffiness because I don&#x27;t have puffiness to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a warning, it smells freakin weird you guys, I can&#x27;t even describe it. The packaging is pretty lame, but functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I say skip it, but if all you need is some moisture it&#x27;s a decent cream for a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to highly perfumed things. (I almost never wear perfume and have to keep dryer sheets in a plastic bag so they&#x27;re closed off). So the smell of the cream is a little too strong for me. But I like the coolness on the skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I notice a big difference in terms of &amp;#34;radiance&amp;#34; around my eyes, but I haven&#x27;t tossed it yet. ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I see a bit of a difference. It seems more like it puffs it out a little bit? But my dark circles definitely seem brighter and I feel my face seems more youthful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a week now. I was confused with a mix of good and bad reviews about this product but decided to buy it. Overall I like burt&#x27;s bees as a brand. But after applying the cream underneath my eyes my skin felt burning. Not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way. Too bad it&#x27;s hard to get a sample of this cream to try out furt before committing to a full size tube.</li>
    <li> I have been using for three weeks now and i like it. I apply morning and night and a little goes a long way. It moisturizes very well, great for winter in the east coast</li>
    <li> I like this stuff but it is a bit pricey for how much of it there is, and after reading some reviews of how Burt&#x27;s Bees ingredients have changed, I decided to opt for a more natural alternative and started using a bee friendly eye and face cream.</li>
    <li> I recently puchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye cream for my puffy eyes. I also have dark circles under them. I started using it right away and I noticed how great my eyes looked after one week! I only use a little under each eye and the results were amazing. The dark cicles are improving and no more puffiness. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees:)</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream. It smells good and it&#x27;s easy to use. Compared with other eye creams, it&#x27;s cheaper but I do not see much difference in quality.</li>
    <li> The consistency is weird, which I assume is because of the royal jelly. It needs to be worked into the skin, gentle patting will not suffice. I use it at night and I will be using this up but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase :(</li>
    <li> I find this is not near enough moisture for the under eye area, and it just seems to dry it out more. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles thankfully but my skin is too dry for this stuff. A great eye area moisturizer is philosophy hope in a tube eye and lip cream, which is really moisturizing and I regret trying to save money by choosing another product instead of that one. I think for people with oily skin this would be a good product though but def not for dry skin and I imagine older mature skin would not benefit from this either.</li>
    <li> I am still using this eye cream and find it really keeps the skin around my eyes smooth and soft. It does not burn like other creams do and I use it around my whole eye area. Burt&#x27;s Bees makes only good products!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. It was delicious.</li>
    <li> Even though I really love most of the Burt&#x27;s Bees product line, I couldn&#x27;t give this product a good rating because despite using it really faithfully I didn&#x27;t notice any change/improvement as far as the look of my eyes goes (I was particularly hoping for some benefit as far as dark circles under the eyes are concerned).  It&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work what so ever.  I didn&#x27;t see any changes even though I followed the directions faithfully.  Not ever buying this again.</li>
    <li> I used this treatment in the morning before getting dressed for work. I am not sure at this time if it is helping or not with dark circles under my eyes, but work associates have commented about my dark circles are not as bad. Will continue to use and will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> in my opinon this is the best eye cream I have purchased/feels good , smooth, cool, creamy not sticky and helps diminish the look of fine lines-for all ages I would think tho I am a senior.</li>
    <li> Generally, I love Burt&#x27;s Bee products. Based on the ravings reviews here, I have decided to give this cream a try. I have clogged tear ducts in both of my eyes and non-stop eye tearing is an ordeal I have to get used to. I was looking for an excellent eye cream to help with the drying skin under my eyes. I found out that a couple of reviewers had a similar issue and decided to give this product a try. After using it for about two weeks now, I have to say that the condition of my skin not only has not improved, but got worse. I see some vertical creases and puffiness in the under-eye skin now that I have not seen before. Oh yes, it also irritates the eye if it gets there. Needless to say, I am very upset and am stopping using this cream for my under eye skin. I am going back to using retinol based eye creams.</li>
    <li> This eye cream feels really good on the skin yet is not thick or eye-watering like some creams I&#x27;ve tried. It is a very clean feeling product.</li>
    <li> Not too bad for the price ,I will give it three statrs ,i sued it for 2 months ,no big deal!</li>
    <li> For those of you with sensitive noses - BE WARE! I have no idea why they thought that this product needed such a strong smell, it&#x27;s not even a good smell. It overpowers even my therapy grade chamomile oil (which smells so strongly I can&#x27;t use it in the morning). I have recently converted to using products I have made myself for my skin regimen because the all-natural way of doing things has really helped my skin, but this also means that everything I use contains no perfumes other than the smells coming from essential oils. To me, the smell coming from this product is so strong that it&#x27;s unacceptable. Just opening the container in a small room is too much, much less using it on my face and smelling it for the remainder of the day. I may use this before bed, but I will not be using it in the morning - it smells like the cloying scent of an older woman who wears too much powdery, floral perfume and leaves a cloud of smell in their wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the product FEELS nice, despite the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether the product works or not I have no idea, I haven&#x27;t been wearing it for more than 1 miserable hour.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, I love this stuff. I tend to have mild allergy eyes that make other creams seep, then burn, then totally run more--if you get my drift. I use this under eye makeup and it never burns or irritates. I also use it at night and it is not goopy like some other eye creams I have tried. Bonus--it is inexpensive compared to so many things out there.</li>
    <li> Most facial products (eye creams specifically) smell bad to me, but this smells great. Goes on easily so you are not pulling your eye skin. It absorbs quickly. There is absolutely no oily feel to it at all when it sinks in. Maybe it is a good thing, I don&#x27;t know, but I can&#x27;t tell I put anything on after 3-4 minutes. I kind of wish there was just a little oil to it. I love being able to add a natural product to my routine when I can.&lt;br /&gt;I am 31, do not have any eye lines or wrinkles yet. Hopefully this will work for prevention.</li>
    <li> Havent seen any improvement on my fine lines :( im only half way through the container, so hopefullu by the time im done ill see something</li>
    <li> Overall I like the cream. I can tell a little bit of a difference and have only been using it about a week. Under my eyes definitely feels way more moisturized but the cream has a weird fishy smell to it that I don&#x27;t like. Because of this I only wear it at night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have dark bags under my eyes. This product has not helped lighten the dark circles or tighten the bags under my eyes. However, I have seasonal allergies that cause my eyes to itch. So I&#x27;m constantly rubbing my eye area. This cream helps soothe the damage from the constant rubbing. I would purchase this product again but only during allergy season.</li>
    <li> Very good, happy shopping experience, I am very satisfied, give 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mum and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is lower than the list price in China.</li>
    <li> Great product, however 1/4 of the lid was broken in shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my brother&#x27;s girlfriend. she likes very much and though this product helping her eyes&#x27; skin to be better than before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little on the more expensive side of things that I usually purchase, however it is worth it.  I began seeing change in about a week and am still using it.</li>
    <li> My wife keeps asking me to buy it for her and she has used it for years. She is a believer in Burt&#x27;s Products.</li>
    <li> It smelled great and seemed to decrease the bags under my eyes.  But, that was because they were puffy and swollen.  I was allergic to it so passed it on to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like the product and feel that it has really moisturized the area around my eyes noticeably. I would probably buy again even though it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
    <li> I thought burt&#x27;s bees would always give great products, but this eye cream is not. I don&#x27;t think it is absorbed by my skin at all. My eyes lips still feel dry after applying it. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I needed something hydrating for my under eye area, and this gets the job done. I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for 3 months and I can see and feel the difference. Even though I don&#x27;t suffer from dark circles or wrinkles, this product has brightened and firmed my under eyes. This area is also very smooth and soft to the touch. The best thing is, I still have half a jar of this stuff left! I recommend this to anyone in need of a gentle, hydrating, and firming eye cream.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  No eye irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about three weeks, day and night now. I have seen no improvement in my dark circles, if anything they look worse. I&#x27;m giving this cream 2 stars because it does moisturize nicely without any tugging which I like, but it hasn&#x27;t served the purpose I expected it to. I will not be purchasing another jar.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream that I have used in a long time. Lasts forever too. One small dab and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok, it&#x27;s moisturizing but that&#x27;s about it. I went back to the traditional olive oil and like that much more.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any significant difference after using the product. But, the eye area feel more soft and delicate though. However, I&#x27;ll probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again after finishing the first bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells good. It is smooth but a little sticky. I feel like my skin never absorb it, it just stick on my skin...probably only for me.</li>
    <li> not exactly what i accept it, it make my eyes itchy!</li>
    <li> This was my first time getting eye cream and it has become a regular part of my skin care. I would recommend this for any other guys out there looking for an eye cream and would say it makes a great difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a good light feel to it, no aroma, and it moisturizes the skin under my eyes incredibly well. I use it twice a day and have noticed the skin under my eyes is firmer and the dark circles are less pronounced. Has got me looking into other Burt&#x27;s Bees products for sure.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream under my eyes and above them for dry scaly skin. Not doing anything for the appearance at all. Does help them stay less dry. Very gentle and does not irritate your eyes.</li>
    <li> nice but not good as another brand one, but the price is good.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;m 22 and mostly got this for dark sunken circles under my eyes (genetics) but also fine lines which I probablly caused by wearing concealer, eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc everyday since I was 15 or so. I&#x27;ve been applying this at night and using this for 2 weeks now and am noticing a big difference. I look much more awake and the circles and fine lines have improved alot. My skin where I apply it is more plump so the wrinkles have filled and my eyes no longer look severely bruised. I feel content without makeup on for once! Very happy, but find this a bit expensive for a small container so hopefully it lasts me awhile...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: People who complain about the greasiness are partly right but it soaks in after a minute or two even when I use it in the morning I have no problem using makeup after it soaks in and I have no problem with the makeup smearing. Also I find the smell pleasant..</li>
    <li> I tried this eye cream for the first time recently and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Nice moisturizing without being greasy and it does not irritate my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this again!  Nice price point as well.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I give this a try. I love the light fresh smell as well. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and I am very sensitive to smells. I just love it. So far, it&#x27;s been 1 week and my eye area feels more tight and just looks brighter overall. This morning, I woke up, looked at myself in the mirror and noticed how &amp;#34;wide-eye&amp;#34; I look, I think it is because of this cream. So happy :D</li>
    <li> This made my under eye bags worse. I used the intense hydration burt&#x27;s bee and really like it, but it wasn&#x27;t make much a difference so I decided to bump it up and use the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; burt&#x27;s bee eye product. I was hoping it was just the first time, but after applying this under my eyes twice a day for 2 weeks it made my under eyes way worse. I know that this a personal experience but it didn&#x27;t feel right and it made my eyes poofy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**CAUTION** if it doesn&#x27;t feel right the first time, you should return it.</li>
    <li> burned my skin a little and didn&#x27;t really make a difference in the black circles.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream that works that is also under 20 dollars. It is moisturizing and brightens the under-eye area. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about six months. So far I don&#x27;t see any new wrinkles. It has a special odor, but I like it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve noticed a change in my under eye puffiness and dark circles. this product helps improve the appearance of tired, puffy eyes. def. worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;no complaints.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any change while using this product twice a day for over two months.</li>
    <li> The best for reducing puffiness. I am 51 and people think I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s!!! I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for the past 10 years...love it!</li>
    <li> Just bought, and only used a week but  love results so far. I have tried many,many eye creams all prices and am really happy with this one. I turned 50 this year and am really trying to postpone the aging process. I wear this on my lid and under eye, after applying i give it about 30mins to soak in before makeup and i have no problem under makeup.my eyes are softer and dewy and brighter. Will continue to buy.my only reason i did not give 5 stars is i would reserve that for the holy grail of products that would make you look 20 again, and i do not believe there is such a product. But it does make my eyes appear younger and feel great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and have noticed an imporvement in the bags and darkness under my eyes. Also love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for something to help with my terrible dark circles for years. Of course, nothing worked. I managed to bump into this product, someone recommended it to me, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It was cheaper and less painful than getting injections under my eyes. Within literally five minutes of applying the product, I looked alive for the first time in years. They&#x27;re not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; of course, but the difference is such that I don&#x27;t really even feel the need to use concealer anymore. I&#x27;ll be getting this religiously from now on as long as it keeps working.</li>
    <li> love this one coz my eye areas look better and smoother. ah, my mom still dont know about this stuff. some will be gifted to her this month :)</li>
    <li> After using this product for about 2 weeks, I noticed that my skin was getting dry under my eye. Then I noticed that it was actually getting darker under my eye. I did feel a burning sensation when applying but thought it was normal.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try because my eyes were dark, puffy, and irritated. It&#x27;s very soothing and I didn&#x27;t have any bad reactions to it. The area around my eyes is now much softer. While the dark circles haven&#x27;t totally disappeared, I would say they&#x27;ve been reduced by about 70%. I like this cream and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and have definitely seen improvement in the appearance of fine lines. It&#x27;s inexpensive and produces results. Plus, Burt&#x27;s is a good eco-minded company. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
