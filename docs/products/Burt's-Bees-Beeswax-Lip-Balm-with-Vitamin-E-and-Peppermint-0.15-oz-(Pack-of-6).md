<li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot that can be said about lip balm, but this stuff just works really, really well.</li>
<li> I live in Iowa where the winters are bitter.</li>
<li> When shipped, in actuality, it is only one single tube.</li>
<li> So everything got painfully dry and cracked.</li>
<li> I received an empty box.  </li>
<li> No one had opened it, it was shipped empty.  </li>
<li> I wear this underneath lip gloss, lip stick and even other tinted lip balms.  </li>
<li> You can feel the cooling sensation and it is availble and wal-mart and other stores like that.</li>
<li> What an odd gift?  </li>
<li> My chapped lips get repaired and protected them without mistreatment from harsh chemicals.&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of lip balm in general, this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t taste awful.</li>
<li> Very disappointed as this is my favorite, I gave them away and got some from store.</li>
<li> However it is usually one of those after the fact things.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, goes on without feeling sticky or thick, and lasts.</li>
<li> Be wary if you are ordering this product from this seller.</li>
<li> /&gt;And the formula is not greasy or &#x27;suffocating&#x27; on the skin.</li>

    <li> great coverage for lips. nice and smooth and men and women can use.. it tingles lightly.. great product</li>
    <li> I received an empty box.  No one had opened it, it was shipped empty.  Don&#x27;t deal with this company!!!</li>
    <li> Beeswax lip balm is the best option for me and my dry lips.  Burt&#x27;s also happens to the best, most consistent products. it works very well in the winter and coats evenly.</li>
    <li> Probably the best chapstick in the world! Healing and soothing! We keep a stick in the car, house, purse, office!</li>
    <li> Getting more sensitive to products as I&#x27;ve gotten older, this product has been a godsend. My chapped lips get repaired and protected them without mistreatment from harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm in this stick immediately will quench your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the formula is not greasy or &#x27;suffocating&#x27; on the skin. It&#x27;s coolness feels just like you&#x27;ve eaten a particularly good after-dinner mint. Yum!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a stocking stuffer cuz my wife loves it and can&#x27;t own enough of it. I also ordered this because it stated that it was a 6 pack. Well, I received the package in the mail, and to my surprise there was only 1 tube in the package. Be wary if you are ordering this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> This product states that it is a pck of 6. It even states that the product weight is 1.3 ounces total, which would be .15 X 6. When shipped, in actuality, it is only one single tube. Go hastings states that it is a data error, but makes no changes to the listing title, or information on the product. Total rip off!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot that can be said about lip balm, but this stuff just works really, really well. I really love all their beeswax based products because they work without feeling like you&#x27;re leaving peroxide on everything your lips touch.</li>
    <li> I think this product was beside a lavendar product cause the peppermint ain&#x27;t there. Very disappointed as this is my favorite, I gave them away and got some from store.</li>
    <li> I really love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.  Bought it for all my children as one of their stocking stuffers at Christmas.  They all love it and look forward to a new tube every year in their stockings.</li>
    <li> Best thing on the market!!! It saves my lips every winter!! The sweet taste is the best thing about it!</li>
    <li> What an odd gift?  Grandpa got big smiles for this gift.  All 6 are middle school to college age. .</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products for many years and they never disappoint.  This particular purchase was a bargain, everything arrived perfectly in order and we are enjoying using them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm junkie, and this is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and even though I&#x27;ve liked some other brands, nothing matches Burt&#x27;s Bees. It&#x27;s moisturizing, goes on without feeling sticky or thick, and lasts. It fixes my amazingly chapped lips, even in harsh weather. The mintiness is refreshing and soothing. I also like that it&#x27;s all-natural, since I use a lot of chapstick and want to minimize chemical intake where I can.   I&#x27;ve also tried the other flavors, and while they&#x27;re generally good, nothing beats the original. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I wear this underneath lip gloss, lip stick and even other tinted lip balms.  It&#x27;s refreshing and not too minty.  It stays on for a while and I only need to re-apply after I&#x27;ve eaten, brushed my teeth, or drank.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it was when they were independent and it has remained so even after that were purchased by a conglomerate. Its a very good product.</li>
    <li> It is Burt&#x27;s Bees original.  What more can you really say about the best &#x27;natural&#x27; lip balm available on the market?</li>
    <li> I know I should be using this as a preventative. However it is usually one of those after the fact things. This animal will not rip your lips off if they are sensitive. It also does not smell like you have been kissing a koala.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Burts Bees. it tingles, it works and it is the only chap stick I will use. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of lip balm in general, this is the first one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t taste awful.</li>
    <li> I live in Iowa where the winters are bitter. Expecially this year it got to -40 with 35mph wind gusts! BRRR! So everything got painfully dry and cracked. This is a lip saver! You can feel the cooling sensation and it is availble and wal-mart and other stores like that. You MUST try!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I enjoy using it.  It is natural and healthy.</li>
