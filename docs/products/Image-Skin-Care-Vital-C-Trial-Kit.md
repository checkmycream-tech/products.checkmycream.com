<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great to take on trips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 always looking for a way to look better. I saw this product on Amazon I gave it a try and I just love it. Everybody tells me that I look younger. I can see a difference in my lines. It did not make them go away but it did give me a look that I get complemented on all the time. I bought more.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Image Vital C cleanser before, so decided to try the other Vital C products. They work great!</li>
    <li> This is a trial and so far the immediate difference I noted was with the cleanser. Oh my!! It leaves your face truly hydrated and soft- I have dry skin (age 60). I think the other products will take some time but in four days, my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had a reaction.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This trial has enough for about 2 weeks.  The smell is wonderful, citrus. My skin is left soft and I&#x27;ve already noticed some of my fine lines has diminished. Since using this trial, I have purchased some of the products in full sizes.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect way for me to try this skincare line. I am now using the entire line. I absolutely love it. I saw a difference with my skin after just a week of use and the trial kit lasted for quite a while.</li>
    <li> yes it came quickly. a little smaller than i expected. but i am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I broke out really badly the first week.  I did not see any change in the very fine lines in my forehead.  I do not think the product really helps with wrinkles.  Then again,maybe I did not use long enough to see any changes.  As I said before though, I broke out very badly and couldn&#x27;t keep using it. Maybe, it might be good as a moisturizer to skin less greasy than mine.</li>
    <li> I loved the trial kit so much, I decided to order the full size product.</li>
    <li> I too started breaking out on one side of my face after getting an IUD. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;ve experienced minimal breakouts. I&#x27;m excited to see what this product does for me long term! An added bonus is that it smells great!</li>
    <li> All product sucked all around. Every tube felt and smelled like the exact same as all the others in the package- nothing was moisturizing, or felt great texture wise. Unimpressed with this line to say the least, and would not waste me money again</li>
    <li> Product recommended for sensitive, dry skin. Ecellent for home care after micros  or peels! Fresh citrus scent, instantly moisturizes skin and easy to carry. All items are in little jars and the box comes with morning and evening instructions for application. Great way to sample the product line.</li>
    <li> Too small for the amount charged! In other words a rip off. They won the battle to get my money. However I will not use any of these products. They don&#x27;t give you enough to see results...and I paid  a kafir amount of money for the trail.</li>
    <li> The experience was wonderful.  My skin looked great after the facial.  The consultant was quite knowledgeable and gave great advice.  The only downside was the location....a little unusual.</li>
    <li> Some of the products were not sealed, causing them to leak out and all over the inside of the package. The ones that did still have the seal on were very poor. I wouldn&#x27;t even trust that these are the real Image products. The Vital C moisturizer was not included in the kit, and instead was one of the Sun moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Face feels clean and soft.</li>
    <li> too little of the product to really tell, but it did not really address any of the skin problems I am currently having.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and I need a product that provides firming qualities and moisturizing.  I certainly would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> An opportunity to try several products  before buying large sizes.  Also, the small containers have worked really well for travel.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smell of product.</li>
    <li> Use these products for past few years and they work.  I am 62, no work done, people think I am 48!  So yes very happy.  I use the trials for short vacations.</li>
    <li> Love the results and I plan to order again on Amazon.  I have used these products for over a year, but was paying more.</li>
    <li> So happy I was able to buy a sample kit! LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have now purchased the whole sizes and am so happy. My skin is clear, fresh, and smooth. MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I like these travel size products very much. I didn&#x27;t need to carry the big bulky ones with me when I traveled. Image Skin Care products are very good.</li>
    <li> Great products, but sort of a rip off for the small size..</li>
    <li> not soo great  smells good</li>
    <li> This is one of Image&#x27;s best product lines. I absolutely love the serum. I had very dehydrated skin and this is the only product line that has worked for me. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this trial set! I might buy the full size of the night treatment</li>
    <li> This cost a lot for sampling the items they are trying to sell.</li>
    <li> Love the Image skin care line, but the big bottles are a pain to take with you when traveling, so this is a great alternative.  Think I will order a few more!</li>
    <li> Great way to try all of the products</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong,I&#x27;m hooked I tell everyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this stuff so far! I have crazy sensitive skin that turns red or reacts at the drop of a hat. I can&#x27;t say that it has completely cured all the redness, but I think it has helped considerably and I&#x27;ll definitely take that! A facialist recommended it to me last time I had a chemical peel done - she said she loves it for her skin so I decided to try it. I like it so much I&#x27;ll definitely order the full size containers (rather than just the sample sizes). It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and I think it&#x27;s actually making it better.</li>
    <li> Product was so small I will only get one sample out of the container.</li>
    <li> If you want to convince yourself that Image products are terrific, purchase this trial kit and see the improvement in your skin.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the Image Vital C line; however, it is tailored more for dry/normal skin and I&#x27;m combination/oily.  All in all I like the skin care line.</li>
    <li> I love Image skin care and cannot always afford to get all the products..so this was an awesome way of trying it all without the expense.  AND these little guys are great for travel too :)</li>
    <li> The picture does not represent what was sent to me. I would have liked to have what I thought I was buying.The product itself is what I expected as I have used them before, this was for travel purposes. for this reason it gets one star based on misrepresentation of the product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive but well worth it! Vitamin C ROCKS!</li>
    <li> best skin care product available....trial kit great to start to see if you like and also to take when traveling! I will use IMAGE products for the rest of my life....good for your skin and my skin shows it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product in travel size portions. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this little trial kit plan on getting another for my mother to try as well! Love it feels great on my face and the scent is so refreshing!</li>
    <li> Love all these products and have been using them for a couple of years now</li>
    <li> my daughter is an eshetician, she recommened the vital C products.&lt;br /&gt;the trial kit is a great sample kit to try the products, great size for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I like the vital C and have used it for years but these trial sizes are in tubes and are very small. I believe you need to have enough product to use for one month in order to see any type of change. Sadly, these tubes amount to those give away samples that you get free. I can say I love the Vital C but would not buy this trial pack, especially for the price, picture is deceiving.</li>
    <li> I love these products, so bought the trial kit for our adult girls as Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Best products I&#x27;ve ever used!  I have extremely sensitive skin and can use these products with no reaction.  My face glows and is so smooth now!</li>
    <li> I tried the Ageless, Vita-C, and Ormedic kits-- each for 1 week to see which products I wanted to buy in full size.  Ageless: my favorite is he masque-- nice and exfoliating.  The face wash is OK- hard to get a lather.  The serum and cream make my skin feel good, but they don&#x27;t smell great.  Overall, I did notice a difference after a week.  Ormedic: my least favorite products.  They all seemed too gentle and my skin didn&#x27;t feel clean or tight after using.  Maybe this is intended for people with sensitive skin.  The tinted SPF is came with is ridiculously dark.  Why is this is a trial pack?  Vita-C: my favorite pack-- all the items smell wonderful.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight but has a nice youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;All the products arrived quickly and were in good shape (each from a different vendor.  Approx 2 weeks use at least per pack.&lt;br /&gt;So for my 40 yr old, still oily and acne-prone, but tired and aging skin, I will probably go with the Vita-C products and use the Ageless masque 2x/week to exfoliate.</li>
    <li> The products are all wonderful. They make your skin feel nice and help moisturize the skin. This was a wonderful purchase to try all six items before investing in the bigger size. Yes I loved them all.</li>
    <li> The price was very good, but later on I was told that only licensed estheticians and dermatologists can sell Image products, so I&#x27;m not sure if this was the real deal or what? The products didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as one I purchased from esthetician. Also, they samples are very small and do not last very long and made me break out. Vitamin C products can do that to some people (I researched this).</li>
    <li> Smells bad, I think it is an old cream.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it, I bought the ageless line before and love it this one really look like old cream.</li>
    <li> I feel like the product was maybe past it&#x27;s &amp;#34;best buy&amp;#34; date because the same items I purchased from my salon were fresher smelling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of this product so I gave it 4 stars.  It&#x27;s my 1st time to order it through Amazon though.  The photo is inaccurate because this is not the product that was shipped.  The product is actually a square box with 5 round containers.  The silver container (from the Ageless line) is not part of this product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product line. I purchased the trial kit so I could try out all the products and see what ones I liked.  I was very excited when I received the product and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it that night.  I opened up the box and some of the pots of product had opened and leaked out everywhere.  There isn&#x27;t much product in each pot to begin with so I was very disappointed.  Other than that, the product is great and my skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to buy something to carry with me in my 3 oz. and under ziplock bag for travel.  It was perfect! It&#x27;s also wonderful for my old lady face and smells awesome too.  :)</li>
    <li> Great for travel and a great way to try out this line. My favorite is the serum and I have the full size. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have used these products in the past and I love them!  I wanted this set for some upcoming travelling.  The product I got are even better than the product pictured, instead of the tubs of product I received small tubes which are even easier/more convenient to use!  With an expiration date of 07/2016, I will use it up way before it &#x27;goes bad&#x27;.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Containers are very small and not reusable like the original packaging</li>
    <li> Love this product! Buy it several times a year when I get ready for a trip.</li>
    <li> I liked the product because I went to have a facial  done on my 51st birthday and this is want they used. What I donot appreciate is that the company shows 6 items that you should receive I only received 5. I read a previous review and the same exact thing happen to another customer. I feel that Amazon is allowing Lifemed to mislead this customer with this product and is not fair.Also the jars that I received 2 of them were not full what&#x27;s up with that. I am a 1st time buyer and might be a last time buyer. Product is good smells good</li>
    <li> I sent this product back due to the fact that one of the samples looked as if it had already been opened.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my weekend Las Vegas trip!  Love this product and now I won&#x27;t have to be without it over a long holiday weeken</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this before buying &amp; after trying I am buying! I&#x27;m in love with these products &amp; they are by far the best Vitamin C skincare products I have ever used. The Vital C Cleanser is also so beautiful &amp; creamy &amp; so perfect for dry dehydrated skin with the bonus is knowing all the vitamin c is helping too. Thanks absolutely love it &amp; rate it very highly.</li>
    <li> very good product. gentle maintenance for everyday.  perfect for travel and able to continue good skin care while away.  reasonable price especially if you buy multiple boxes.</li>
    <li> Loved the travel size so I could try this product for the first time. Product  absorbs  nicely in your skin for good hydration.</li>
    <li> Love this line!  I prefer the old trial packaging (4oz plastic jars) to the plastic mini bottles which to me, wastes the amount you get out of it.</li>
    <li> I did not like the Vital C at all. The only one out of the kit I really like was the silver label one which is the Ageless line.&lt;br /&gt;The vital C to me is a bit sticky / tacky like it has sticky juice in it or something.  I wanted to love it but I am only going&lt;br /&gt;to stick with the Ageless.&lt;br /&gt;So that you know, I have the full size Vital C serum, eye cream, face wash, and moisurizer. The Vital C moisturizer and&lt;br /&gt;Serum makes me break out around my temples (I&#x27;m in my late thirties!!!) and makes my skin peel around my mouth and&lt;br /&gt;chin. I wanted the Vital C moisturizer to hydrate at night but when I wake up it is all flaky and I am broke out. Bummer!&lt;br /&gt;The Ageless does make me peel a little but that is expected I think but at least it doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
    <li> I use several products from the Image Vital C line.  I have sensitive skin and it can sometimes be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, is non-greasy, etc.  This line of products really works for me.  The price was right on this set and it was a good way to try more items.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip, because I wanted small travel sizes.  I wish I had gotten the regular sizes, because these are very small and I do not think they will last the 2 weeks.  The product is good and I do think I will try the larger sizes.  Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> I received my order in perfect condition!  Love Image Skin Care Products.  Needed a travel kit enough skin care for a week.  Trial kit supplied the perfect size and weight for flying.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Not Image Skin Care&#x27;s best product, but a good way to try and discover that it want not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great gives my skin a nice glow</li>
    <li> I used to buy this from my esthetician but I purchase it on amazon now. I buy the large jar but bought this travel kit to try other products. I was very pleased with the product and the seller.</li>
