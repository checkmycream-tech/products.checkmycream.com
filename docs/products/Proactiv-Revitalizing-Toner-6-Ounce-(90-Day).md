      <li>I love this product but in Nov 2014 it was $15.99 for 8oz</li>
      <li>Love it have been using this product for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the products you can buy at the drug store and none of them work as well as Proactiv.  </li>
      <li>Love this product along with the face wash and repair lotion.</li>
      <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
      <li>I love the proactiv products and this toner is even more awesome in the big size!</li>
      <li>LOVE this product along with the face wash and repair lotion.</li>
      <li>glad I discovered</li>
      <li>I love this toner.  </li>
      <li>more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Perfect for that person with hormonal acne such as us women over 40!</li>
      <li>More is not always better.</li>
      <li>More is not always better.</li>
      <li>It is better, AND cheaper.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>and then the skin will be fine.</li>
      <li>PRICE COULD BE BETTER, PRODUCT IS SUPER</li>
      <li>This was the best price for such a large bottle.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s face it, Proactiv isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
      <li>Also, works wonders to smooth my skin and even-out tone.  </li>
      <li>If you can afford it (because it definitely isn&#x27;t cheap)</li>
      <li>It is also alcohol free.</li>
      <li>A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used to be on Proactiv auto-ship for all three products (wash, toner, and lotion) but the wash wasn&#x27;t anything special and the lotion was too harsh; however, the toner is awesome.  </li>
      <li>As I am sure many readers are aware, glycolic acid is a main ingredient in many anti-aging products from L&#x27;Oreal to Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
      <li>For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting for!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Proactive user for years and was so excited to see it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found much cheaper drugstore products that work much better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
      <li>Love this--cannot live w/out it!</li>
      <li>This is the best toner for cleansing facial care that removes impurities such as blackheads , clogged pores or makeup from the skin.</li>
      <li>I also find it reasonably mild.  </li>
      <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really helps my skin to radiate!!</li>
      <li>exactly!</li>
      <li>I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I was told that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.</li>
      <li>it arrived fast and works well afetr usiung the face scrub from proactive as well or better a loofa spunge to make sure ur face doesnt have any residue left on it.</li>
      <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
      <li>my personal opinion, one of the reasons the Proactiv line is so successful is that it uses proven ingredients like glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide in a lower concentration than many other products.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks for sending my product so quickly.  </li>
      <li>WE LIKE IT VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what it suggested it would be.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not much more than OK.</li>
      <li>I love the product and will definitely buy again through Amazon.</li>
      <li>So, now I use Proactiv consistently, and have for years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
      <li>and overall I am pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>This product helps keep my face clean and clear!</li>
      <li>See you at pimples and wrinkles!would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this review is of Proactiv&#x27;s toner, I would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
      <li>It is ok, but does not really help, after many uses, lets admit it guys and girls we need to fix our inner</li>
      <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
      <li>Ive used this many years and havent had any problems with breakouts or dry skin concerns.</li>
      <li>However, they are too strong given my recent addition of Retin-A into my regimen.  </li>
      <li>The only downside is that it takes a couple weeks to see a huge difference</li>
      <li>I took it with me to a REAL Proactiv vendor in my mall</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now and love it.</li>
    <li> my 12 year old started breaking out, and this helped a ton....did it get rid of all, no..but really cut down  80 percent with all three steps..this is one of the steps.  I wished they had this when I was young.</li>
    <li> Used to be on Proactiv auto-ship for all three products (wash, toner, and lotion) but the wash wasn&#x27;t anything special and the lotion was too harsh; however, the toner is awesome.  No alcohol and never dries out my skin.  Also, works wonders to smooth my skin and even-out tone.  I realize that the level of AHA in the product is not very high, but it works for me just the same.  Having the ability to not only buy the toner by itself, but buy it in a 6oz size (at a great price)is great.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv products for the past 6 years and have been completely satsified with all their products. Highly recommend this wonderful product and you can&#x27;t beat the competitive pricing offered by this seller. Have placed several different orders with this Seller and each time the product has arrived faster than quoted! Highly recommend this seller...Very satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> This product is the only toner that doesnt severly burn my skin so thumbs up for this baby!</li>
    <li> This was the best price for such a large bottle.  Shipped quickly, and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> I love the proactiv products and this toner is even more awesome in the big size!</li>
    <li> Proactiv solution is the only acne solution that has worked for me. As cliche as it sounds, I have tried almost everything on the market and nothing has worked as well.  The only downside is that it takes a couple weeks to see a huge difference but when it starts working, it really works.  Not only does it clear up acne, but it prevents it as well.</li>
    <li> This toner is the best! Non irritating and non drying. It keeps pimples at bay!</li>
    <li> My review begins with me buying the entire line of Proactiv to combat the onset of adult acne I got when I turned 28 years of age. Because I have sensitive skin, the Proactiv Clearing lotion was way to harsh and ended up chemically burning my skin like a sunburn. So after that unfortunate experience, I stopped using the lotion and decided just to use the toner after washing my face to see if it would help at all, and it really did! It is just right for getting off any leftover make-up or residue left on your face from the cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out either, like most toner&#x27;s can, it is indeed revitalizing and will be the only toner I ever use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Proactive user for years and was so excited to see it&#x27;s available on Amazon. It&#x27;s cheaper purchasing it through Amazon than purchasing it directly from Proactiv! I love the product and will definitely buy again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best toner for cleansing facial care that removes impurities such as blackheads , clogged pores or makeup from the skin. Ive used this many years and havent had any problems with breakouts or dry skin concerns.</li>
    <li> Love it have been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> I had never had acne growing up. Around 30-31 years old, I started to have adult acne. I tried everything out there for years. Finally, I gave this a try. Thank Goodness, because it is the only thing that cured it. I use the regular proactive wash and toner. I don&#x27;t have any acne issues now.</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome shipping.</li>
    <li> Use it daily to keep my skin in check. Not sure what exactly this is supposed to do, but my skin feels tighter yet moisturizer after using it.</li>
    <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
    <li> Helps my granddaughter</li>
    <li> PRICE COULD BE BETTER, PRODUCT IS SUPER</li>
    <li> no matter the price, i have to get this stuff. i&#x27;ve tried two other toners.  they just don&#x27;t work.  wish i could find it cheaper. :(</li>
    <li> I love this toner.  In the winter it makes my face a bit dry, so I just use it on my problem areas.  This bottle lasts me a long time.  Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> This toner is cleansing, soothing, and works great at helping control my acne.  I&#x27;m 40, and still have acne, and as I&#x27;ve gotten older my oily skin is a bit dryer, and this doesn&#x27;t dry me out. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really helps my skin to radiate!! See my face!!</li>
    <li> Love this--cannot live w/out it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv cleanser and toner for 13 years - after watching the infomercials for a few years.  Even at 60 years old, a blemish will pop up; but not for long.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending my product so quickly.  I love  Proactive and it works!</li>
    <li> It is ok, but does not really help, after many uses, lets admit it guys and girls we need to fix our inner and then the skin will be fine.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. Some parts are oily and some parts are dry. In my regimen I need to address breakout control AND anti-aging. You may only think of this Proactiv product for acne but it is also for anti-aging (even though it is not marketed that way).  The main active ingredient is glycolic acid, an AHA (Alpha hydroxy acid), which exfoliates the top layer of your skin and helps unclog your pores. Glycolic acid goes under the upper layers of skin and destroys the &#x60;glue&#x27; which holds dead skin to the surface. The result is a smoother skin surface, smaller pores and less breakouts. As I am sure many readers are aware, glycolic acid is a main ingredient in many anti-aging products from L&#x27;Oreal to Peter Thomas Roth. This active ingredient isn&#x27;t only for acne, its a very important active ingredient to have in your anti-aging regimen as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal opinion, one of the reasons the Proactiv line is so successful is that it uses proven ingredients like glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide in a lower concentration than many other products. Glycolic acid can be found in strengths of 3%-15% normally. The Proactiv toner is a 5% solution. It also contains witch hazel and aloe vera. It is also alcohol free. I also find it reasonably mild.  If you do not use any glycolic products I think incorporating this into your regimen even just once a day will make a difference. I also love the Somme Institute transport pads. I used to use those daily and I loved them. However, they are too strong given my recent addition of Retin-A into my regimen.  They are also significantly more expensive. The Mario Badescu glycolic toner is also good but I find this one to be more effective.  I usually use it in the morning after washing.  I use my Mario Badescu cucumber cleansing lotion as my night toner/astringent. I do not want to mix my Retin-A with glycolic acid so I use a different morning and nighttime toner/astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this review is of Proactiv&#x27;s toner, I would also note that I think their repairing treatment is good for a similar reason: it only has 2.5% of benzoyl peroxide. Brands like Clean&amp;Clear and Stridex and even Neutrogena put much higher levels of Benzoly Peroxide in their products and often concentrations of 5% and 10% are too drying and irritating. More is not always better. A lower level concentration more regularly is a better and more effective solution with some active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

    <li> Size shown, it is bigger in person I was surprised it is also the real deal..the thing I always hated about having to buy from the manufacturer is you couldnt piece out what you wanted you had to re purchase entire kit...what a waste when I have a bizzilion of the other pieces of the trio already !&lt;br /&gt;So glad I discovered this seller will use again!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product along with the face wash and repair lotion. The size is perfect, it seems the toner goes quickest. Perfect for that person with hormonal acne such as us women over 40! This seller is excellent and you should have no reservations oredering from him. There are others selling the same product that are cons, READ feedback before ordering from another seller. Clear skin is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  This is just a staple of my products that I use on my face.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I got it as soon as possible, they did an awful great job in sending this item out and got it record time</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the Proactiv Revitalizing Toner and this merchant has the 6 oz. toner which helps us keep a good amount on hand.</li>
    <li> Always a great Product.  I highly recommend anything ProActiv makes.</li>
    <li> This is the same as ordering directly from Proactiv, it&#x27;s just cheaper and easier to get. I like ordering through here.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help with my acne and, after it bleached out all my sheets and Tshirts, I didn&#x27;t want to run the risk of putting that stuff in my face.</li>
    <li> My kids using everyday and&lt;br /&gt;Help a lot .</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, and received it sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> love proactive. not just for teenagers. I&#x27;m 58 and my pores have never looked this small. my skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 3-step Proactiv system for over a year now and overall I am pleased with the results.  It takes a couple of months to start working so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get immediate results.  It doesn&#x27;t entirely prevent acne either, it just drastically reduces the frequency of getting acne.  I&#x27;ve tried most of the products you can buy at the drug store and none of them work as well as Proactiv.  If you can afford it (because it definitely isn&#x27;t cheap) I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good price for a huge sized Revitalizing Toner.  Will buy from the same seller again but won&#x27;t need a refill of toner again for a long time.</li>
    <li> What can I say? My face and I love this toner!!</li>
    <li> I do feel like this helped to clean my face, but it wasn&#x27;t quite so &#x27;WOW&#x27; as other Proactiv products. I&#x27;ve found much cheaper drugstore products that work much better. It&#x27;s OK, but not much more than OK.</li>
    <li> I love this product but in Nov 2014 it was $15.99 for 8oz and now it is $34.95 for 6oz!</li>
    <li> I seem to go through this faster than I do any of the other steps. But it works great. It dries my face out a bit but a little lotion every now and again clears it right up.</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. This is the only Proactiv product I&#x27;ve tried but it will be a repurchase for me.</li>
    <li> I love Proactiv, I&#x27;ve used it for years and have amazing skin. It is WAY cheaper to order it off of Amazon than buying it in the packs that they send you. Plus I always use Steps 1 and 2 way before I use Step 3 so it just makes sense to order them separately.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Always consistent and with step 1 and 3 my face is always flawless!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as expected. I already use this product and don&#x27;t doubt it will work just as great!</li>
    <li> Like to use this but way overpriced.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> HELOO&lt;br /&gt; WE LIKE IT VERY MUCH. IT WORKS WELL, SO THATS THE THE WHY WE MADE SECOND ORDER.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Love it,used it for a couple of years. Recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> Bottle looks different than the one I received directly from Proactiv. I called Proactiv and they said it must be a fake! DO NOT ORDER!!!</li>
    <li> i like the product. it arrived fast and works well afetr usiung the face scrub from proactive as well or better a loofa spunge to make sure ur face doesnt have any residue left on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Proactiv system for about 3 years now. My skin has never looked better. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I ordered Proactiv Toner through this seller. The product I received was FAKE. It was not the REAL Proactiv Toner. I took it with me to a REAL Proactiv vendor in my mall and she told me it was FAKE, to stop using it and be sure to return it. It didn&#x27;t even have the same ingredients and the bottle was different. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. I still get acne, but I&#x27;m not using the whole system. I just ordered the whole 3 step system, hope it works.</li>
    <li> This is what I expected and arrived on time. It was exactly what it suggested it would be. no surprises here.</li>
    <li> The wife loves Proactiv Products, they work for her.</li>
    <li> My brother loves it! Great for acne Prone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for several years now and I love it! I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I was told that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy. The Proactiv commercials claim that you will see results in 2 weeks. For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting for! Over the years I have tried, on one or two occasions, using other products, such as the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion), always with disastrous results. Let&#x27;s face it, Proactiv isn&#x27;t cheap. But, you know the saying you get what you pay for...exactly! So, now I use Proactiv consistently, and have for years. It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it. This toner is effective without being harsh. It leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean.  I seem to use up the toner, much faster than I do the cleanser and face cream, so I like to keep an extra bottle around for when I need it. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good toner, but wow, is it expensive.I guess people will pay for a name brand. After some research, I started using the skingenixx anti aging toner [[ASIN:B00VS7WQ8I Skingenixx Anti-Aging Facial Toner with Vitamin C, Glycolic Acid and Aloe Vera]] for half the price. It is better, AND cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love proactiv toner! I&#x27;ve used this for probably 15 years and still haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well as this. I have oily skin, and prone to the occasional zits. This product helps keep my face clean and clear!</li>
    <li> works wonders, especially if you use the whole kit together. cleanser, this and repairing lotion. just love using a toner!</li>
    <li> Love this product along with the face wash and repair lotion. The size is perfect, it seems the toner goes quickest.</li>
