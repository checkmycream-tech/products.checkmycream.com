      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love this product, because it smells soooo good</li>
      <li>It also smells nice.</li>
      <li>Most leave in conditioners do a basic job, but this one gives you a great smell and also excellent application.</li>
      <li>The castor oil has produced the best results so far!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It should smell rich and delicious - not faint.</li>
      <li>I have used many leave in conditioners.</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the scoop - I LOVE the product, but not from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Not as pleasant as the real thing, but still gets the knots out!</li>
      <li>Both myself and my beautiful 3 yr old daughter love this.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>It smells fantastic too.</li>
      <li>That being said, the (real) product is amazing.</li>
      <li>First, and probably most important, the smell of the product is awesome...second, and obviously the most important, it does the job of a good leave in conditioner and</li>
      <li>Today I bought this spray excited about the product.</li>
      <li>Love amazon, I really like this on my hair</li>
      <li>I switched to Great Clips leave in spray which was half the price.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so greasy right now</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s pretty steep of a price.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it is a knock off because the smell is not the same as when I buy it at a salon or an authorized dealer store.</li>
      <li>It would be great for damaged hair and extremely thick hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d avoided buying it online and always bought from the salon for this exact reason.</li>
      <li>So when I spray the ends it gives my hair a soft young healthy look.</li>
      <li>third, it&#x27;s a pump spray is unique from others which makes it a dream to apply.</li>
      <li>I have dry ,fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>quality not the same as store bought, packaging/logo different from authentic s factor products</li>
      <li>What I got did not have the same strong papaya smell (it smelled watered down) and did not work on my hair the way the original product does.</li>
      <li>This spray is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or greasy, and helps with the tangles.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I live in humid Houston, and moisture in your hair is your chance at survival.</li>
      <li>This product left my hair feeling much dryer making it more evident that it appears to be a watered down version of the actual leave-in spray.</li>
      <li>This is a great leave in product for curly dry hair, it helps tame the especially in humid cities like Houston</li>
      <li>But if I spray this and wait a few minutes, it combs through easily.</li>
      <li>on the ends only so I don&#x27;t weigh down the top of my hair.</li>
      <li>so if I spray the top It gives my hair a flat weighed down look.</li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair and it was too moisturizing for me.</li>
      <li>No tangles and my hair is soft, glowing, shiny and voluminous.</li>
      <li>Gets rid of most of the ridiculous tangles I always get on the nape of my neck.</li>
      <li>Really helps my dry hair!</li>
      <li>Typically the product leaves my hair feeling very moisturized and soft.</li>

    <li> Excellent hair product!</li>
    <li> I love the smell! Gets rid of most of the ridiculous tangles I always get on the nape of my neck. However, it&#x27;s pretty steep of a price. I switched to Great Clips leave in spray which was half the price. Now I&#x27;m just conditioning my hair with castor oil every so often. The castor oil has produced the best results so far! No tangles and my hair is soft, glowing, shiny and voluminous. I never look back.</li>
    <li> First, and probably most important, the smell of the product is awesome...second, and obviously the most important, it does the job of a good leave in conditioner and third, it&#x27;s a pump spray is unique from others which makes it a dream to apply. Most leave in conditioners do a basic job, but this one gives you a great smell and also excellent application.</li>
    <li> I love this product, because it smells soooo good and it cares for your hair. apply after hair washing before blow drying.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I spray it on my wet hair.. on the ends only so I don&#x27;t weigh down the top of my hair. My hair is long..it goes to the middle of my back. so if I spray the top It gives my hair a flat weighed down look. So when I spray the ends it gives my hair a soft young healthy look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years. When my hair is long, it gets very tangled when wet. But if I spray this and wait a few minutes, it combs through easily. It also smells nice. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> quality not the same as store bought, packaging/logo different from authentic s factor products</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. It smells good but thats about it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  Hard to find in a salon, so I order on line.  I have fine hair that tangles easily.  This spray is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or greasy, and helps with the tangles.</li>
    <li> The best for hydrating your hair.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop - I LOVE the product, but not from Amazon. I agree with other reviewers the scent is different. I would try to buy locally at a local salon or ULTA store. It should smell rich and delicious - not faint. That being said, the (real) product is amazing. I live in humid Houston, and moisture in your hair is your chance at survival. I put this on after a shower, and toss it in my pool bag (I think letting the heat help it penetrate into the hair is an added bonus). My husband compliments the smell too, so win-win-win!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. Pretty sure it is a knock off because the smell is not the same as when I buy it at a salon or an authorized dealer store. Not as pleasant as the real thing, but still gets the knots out!</li>
    <li> I love this product.Ive been using it for 6 years.I have dry ,fine curly hair.It doesnt weigh my hair down ,at all.It smells fantastic too.</li>
    <li> Great product. I would shop again. Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Both myself and my beautiful 3 yr old daughter love this.  It&#x27;s a great after bath detangler for her and smells delicious too!!!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and it was too moisturizing for me. It would be great for damaged hair and extremely thick hair</li>
    <li> Makes your hair shiny!</li>
    <li> Today I bought this spray excited about the product. It smells great. I sprayed it into my damp, almost wet hair and blow dried. My hair feels so greasy right now I can&#x27;t handle it! I will def. be returning this tomorrow. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!  Really helps my dry hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in product for curly dry hair, it helps tame the especially in humid cities like Houston</li>
    <li> I love this product! I should have bought more than one! It takes all of the knots out of my hair!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this appears not to actually be Tigi S-factor Papaya Leave-in Spray. I&#x27;ve been using the product for years. I&#x27;d avoided buying it online and always bought from the salon for this exact reason. This time, to save a few bucks and time I purchased online. What I got did not have the same strong papaya smell (it smelled watered down) and did not work on my hair the way the original product does. Typically the product leaves my hair feeling very moisturized and soft. This product left my hair feeling much dryer making it more evident that it appears to be a watered down version of the actual leave-in spray. Also the bottling was different (not the bottle pictured) and the labeling on the bottle was faded, making it appear to be a copy. Truly disappointed. Ran to the salon and bought the actual spray today.</li>
    <li> I have used many leave in conditioners. This is by far the best. As a bonus it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Love amazon, I really like this on my hair</li>
