### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The feel and the shape, is just perfect!</li>
      <li>and if it was not for the burnt edges it would be a awesome wig.</li>
      <li>The front is impressive.</li>
      <li>A wonderful wig, just did not look good on me.</li>
      <li>Great wigs for the price.  </li>
      <li>Great color, but way shorter than imagined.</li>
      <li>great and fashionable</li>
      <li>It takes someone with a thinner face, and it would look great.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT, and it was perfect out of the package.</li>
      <li>Again this is a good style and color for me.</li>
      <li>The style is very cute though</li>
      <li>Its even better then my own hair!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I would not use this as my own hair.</li>
      <li>Love love love it great value for the money .</li>
      <li>the quality will be suitable for my mannequin to display clothing.</li>
      <li>Not too happy right now.</li>
      <li>I just love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the color and fit!</li>
      <li>I love this wig.</li>
      <li>You get way you pay for people. :)</li>
      <li>I wish it came in more colors, I would buy more.</li>
      <li>I receive so many compliments on this</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the seller for their great customer service.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny and more!  </li>
      <li>and it really looked good.</li>
      <li>I have a smaller head so the smaller cap style/tighter fit works great for me and while others complain of the &amp;#34;one size cap&amp;#34; it is perfect for me!</li>
      <li>The seller was fantastic in allowing me a credit for this wig, as the order was supposed to be deleted, and was processed by mistake.</li>
      <li>I think it is unacceptable, even if it is free, and coming from China ( which I suspect).&lt;br /&gt;Having a note, that you can get the item on Dec 02 with expedited shipping.  </li>
      <li>One of the straps does tend to come out of it&#x27;s seat, but for me that doesn&#x27;t affect fit.</li>
      <li>So for that price it can be here in 4 days from China?&lt;br /&gt;The free shipping</li>
      <li>I wish there would be additional photos available on the listing of this wig.</li>
      <li>Looks cheap.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Let&#x60;s hope this wig is adorable and useable in real life.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I love the cut and style of the wig and was made very well.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and it arrived much sooner than expected.</li>
      <li>I have a large head and it fits just fine.</li>
      <li>Not bad, color is really nice and it does take some styling to get it to look right on each individual.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable and looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>As we all know lots of the sellers are able to provide great photos, and the quality of the sold item can be way behind.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly worth the value.  </li>
      <li>Even more surprised when I put it on</li>
      <li>but it just didn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
      <li>Was not totally satisfied, the inside adjustments to fit scalp are not of good</li>
      <li>Very sweet, natural wig.</li>
      <li>More Gray than Blonde.</li>
      <li>but this by far my favorite especially because of the fit.</li>
      <li>most wigs need minor adjustments anyway, so not a problem at all.</li>
      <li>Seller was fine but product is definitely not anything I would ever wear.</li>
      <li>Very nive wig.  </li>
      <li>Thank you soooo much</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, but on this purchase I got a little more.  </li>
      <li>Here is why it is only 2 right now:&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expected to wait so long with free shipping, especially when the wig was so cheap, so when it came in a couple weeks I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>The style of the wig is so natural looking as well as the color!  </li>
      <li>The burnt edges poke out and there is no way to smooth them down.</li>
      <li>The color is right on, as pictured, and the size I found to be average, not small or large, as others have stated.</li>
      <li>The center top of the wig, where the hair stylistically comes out is very strange...</li>
      <li>Personally, I took a razor to it and feathered it a little more in the front and on the bangs.  </li>
      <li>Bangs are much too long; colour not as photographed.</li>
      <li>Wow this is short!</li>
      <li>BTW shipping was much quicker then expected.</li>
      <li>The Color is a little darker then expected but its something I can live with, I read other reviews on how cheap this was, and i totally disagree!</li>
      <li>Extremely small not the right color</li>
</ol>

<li> Extremely small not the right color</li>
<li> It looks like it has dark highlights which was what I wanted, but the wig was blonde and no dark highlights at all.</li>
<li> Has a few thin areas, make sure you check yourself before leaving the house.</li>
<li> Received it 2 weeks earlier expected.</li>
<li> Took way too long and nothing like I expected.</li>
<li> I only gave this one star because I couldn&#x27;t do anything less.  </li>
<li> The only downside is the bangs needed to be trimmed just a little as they poked me in the eyes...</li>

<li> Got what I expected.  </li>
<li> Not what I expected.  </li>
<li> Dark in color no instructions for wear or care</li>
<li> I have a very small head, so the wig is a little big on me..but other than that</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to like it yet.</li>
<li> I usually wear it parted to the side.  </li>
<li> (it is Nov.28 late night)Price almost 23 $s.</li>

<li> Very poor quality.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also very thin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very unhappy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very nive wig.  Comfortable and looks like real hair.</li>
    <li> I love the cut and style of the wig and was made very well. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star was because of the color. It looks like it has dark highlights which was what I wanted, but the wig was blonde and no dark highlights at all.</li>
    <li> Very sweet, natural wig.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, but on this purchase I got a little more.  Not bad, color is really nice and it does take some styling to get it to look right on each individual.  Personally, I took a razor to it and feathered it a little more in the front and on the bangs.  I usually wear it parted to the side.  I&#x27;ve had hair stylists who complimented the color and cut tell me that they would never have known it was a wig if I didn&#x27;t tell them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great price for this item.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I might change the number of  stars on this item later.Here is why it is only 2 right now:&lt;br /&gt;1.Reading the provided answers to customer&#x60;s questions,it is a nonsense.Either the Seller( w/all respect) does not speak the  language well to answer, or doesn&#x60;t want to answer to the questions.&lt;br /&gt;2. I wish there would be additional photos available on the listing of this wig.I think the look of multiple angles is crucial for customers to see.The front is impressive.But  will see, when  it gets here.As we all know lots of the sellers are able to provide great photos, and the quality of the sold item can be way behind.Let&#x60;s hope this wig is adorable and useable in real life.&lt;br /&gt;3. I just ordered this item.During check out I noticed the shipping dates- over 3-5 weeks.I think it is unacceptable, even if it is free, and coming from China ( which I suspect).&lt;br /&gt;Having a note, that you can get the item on Dec 02 with expedited shipping.  (it is Nov.28 late night)Price almost 23 $s.So for that price it can be here in 4 days from China?&lt;br /&gt;The free shipping is between Dec 25-Jan 13.Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it will  get here earlier and the quality will be suitable for my mannequin to display clothing.</li>
    <li> Love the color and fit! Thank you soooo much</li>
    <li> Nothing like the photo! Looks too wiggy!</li>
    <li> Great wigs for the price.  Mine looks just like the one pictured.  Also, received it before expected delivery date.</li>
    <li> A wonderful wig, just did not look good on me. It takes someone with a thinner face, and it would look great. The seller was fantastic in allowing me a credit for this wig, as the order was supposed to be deleted, and was processed by mistake. (I had ordered a different one)  I highly recommend the seller for their great customer service. Shipping is quicker than stated, as well. The color is right on, as pictured, and the size I found to be average, not small or large, as others have stated.</li>
    <li> Bangs are much too long; colour not as photographed.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  More Gray than Blonde. Also, it sheds.</li>
    <li> Was not totally satisfied, the inside adjustments to fit scalp are not of good</li>
    <li> I like it but it just didn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. The color is beautiful and it arrived much sooner than expected. I have a large head and it fits just fine. The only downside is the bangs needed to be trimmed just a little as they poked me in the eyes...most wigs need minor adjustments anyway, so not a problem at all. One of the straps does tend to come out of it&#x27;s seat, but for me that doesn&#x27;t affect fit. I wish it came in more colors, I would buy more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit. I asked for a return label but did not receive it as yet. Not too happy right now.</li>
    <li> Extremely small not the right color I&#x27;m very unhappy</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed where the part down the middle is the hair is matted and looks like a rats bed or nest. I don&#x27;t give it any stars. I bought it for my sister after her brain surgery. Thank u for helping me make her feel even worse.</li>
    <li> Love love love it great value for the money . Was a lot lighter in color than it looked in the picture</li>
    <li> The Color is a little darker then expected but its something I can live with, I read other reviews on how cheap this was, and i totally disagree! This is the bomb! The feel and the shape, is just perfect! Its even better then my own hair! LOVE IT, and it was perfect out of the package. BTW shipping was much quicker then expected. Received it 2 weeks earlier expected. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly worth the value.  Lets see if it stands up against wear.</li>
    <li> Wow this is short! It&#x27;s also very thin. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to like it yet. Great color, but way shorter than imagined. Not a &amp;#34;bob.&amp;#34; The center top of the wig, where the hair stylistically comes out is very strange...looks knotted, matted, can see through it. Looks cheap. This one may have to serve only as costume wig...if I want to look like a boy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for Halloween.  Got what I expected.  I would not use this as my own hair.</li>
    <li> great and fashionable</li>
    <li> Worth every penny and more!  The style of the wig is so natural looking as well as the color!  I have a very small head, so the wig is a little big on me..but other than that I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was also a lot quicker than they say.  I expected to wait so long with free shipping, especially when the wig was so cheap, so when it came in a couple weeks I was pleasantly surprised.  Even more surprised when I put it on and it really looked good.</li>
    <li> It can pass in public, aftr being cut into this style. Has a few thin areas, make sure you check yourself before leaving the house.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t do anything to it to make it suit me.What you see is what you get</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. They have used a picture of the Noriko Reese and there is no comparison. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Took way too long and nothing like I expected. Dark in color no instructions for wear or care</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Reese for the past 3 years and it is always my go to. I&#x27;ve worn a few other brands and styles but this by far my favorite especially because of the fit. I have a smaller head so the smaller cap style/tighter fit works great for me and while others complain of the &amp;#34;one size cap&amp;#34; it is perfect for me! I receive so many compliments on this and I always wear the creamy toffee which compliments my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This wig is horrible. The burnt edges poke out and there is no way to smooth them down. The style is very cute though and if it was not for the burnt edges it would be a awesome wig. You get way you pay for people. :)</li>
    <li> Looked like a fake mop and I threw it away</li>
    <li> I only gave this one star because I couldn&#x27;t do anything less.  This is the worst wig I have ever purchased.  &amp;#34;Hair&amp;#34; was falling out of it before I got it unpacked.  Seller was fine but product is definitely not anything I would ever wear.</li>
    <li> Again this is a good style and color for me.</li>
</ol>
