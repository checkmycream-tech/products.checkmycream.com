    <li> I have been using this blush for probably more than 20 years!  The great part is that I use it as an eye shadow / blush combo.  the only annoying thing is that the middle compartment always empties first and I&#x27;m left with the outsides, which I try to use, but end up throwing out.  For the life of me I don&#x27;t know how this happens because I use a large blush brush to sweep it and always try to keep it even.  It&#x27;s called, collectively, sophisticated sable....and I haven&#x27;t found anything I like individually, and not for a lack of trying!  Oh well.....I am happy that I was able to buy a few of them at good prices on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with high expectations. I am a honey tone and did not want something too overbearing, but there is no color unless I apply it really heavily. A little disappointed.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this same product for several years.  Unlike many, I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in quality which I appreciate.</li>

    <li> This product does not live up to what I expect in Cover Girl. Its very cakey. The colors do not show up on you as they do in the package.</li>
    <li> I first started using this 3 yrs ago. I was without luggage and stuck overnight. My MAC blush was in my luggage. My parents were 2 hrs from me so they can to meet me and I&#x27;d asked them to pickup a few things. My mom got this at the drug store and I love it! It gives a natural looking warm glow and shimmer.</li>
    <li> This cover Gril product is excellent. The colors and quality are perfect. And we receive it on time. It make me feels grate.</li>
    <li> A great bkush palette.</li>
    <li> Works well! Made in USA. Nice colors. Wish Bronzer was more brownish. Stays on. Ooooo oooooo oooooo ooooo ooooo oooo</li>
