### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy to say that when I contacted Remington they promised to send me a replaceable Foil.</li>
      <li>The readout of remaining time is a nice touch, but the readout isn&#x27;t very accurate.  </li>
      <li>but I am trying to get better with it and give it time</li>
      <li>Overall I am satisfied with the product - no shaver is perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>It does the job, but it takes more work than some of the others.</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>At best, this razor is only adequate.  </li>
      <li>I can easily get a week on a charge with this razor.</li>
      <li>The Norelco was FAR quieter, more comfortable and more effective- without the razor burn.</li>
      <li>However, technology has advanced beyond this</li>
      <li>Foil gave a smooth shave if you could stand the noise.</li>
      <li>a cheap line of products  </li>
      <li>If you want a clean, close, and comfortable shave each and every day</li>
      <li>and it really didn&#x27;t do any better than rinsing with water and using the brush.</li>
      <li>It does an adequate, but noisy job.</li>
      <li>this one is ok it takes some getting use to to get as close of a shave as my older one did</li>
      <li>so far it is just ok</li>
      <li>This Remington has given me the cleanest and most comfortable shave of the numerous electric razors I have used.  </li>
      <li>I think the pivoting head is a positive and useful innovation.  </li>
      <li>Why do you keep changing equipment when the old one works fine?</li>
      <li>When the \\&quot;Lo\\&quot; message came on shortly after \\&quot;10\\&quot; minutes appeared on the display, I was able to shave, morning and night, for four days before charging was required.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind, you&#x27;ll likely be using your razor for many years.</li>
      <li>The first model I purchased DID.</li>
      <li>Even if a bit more expensive, the Norelco is a far better value and more comfortable.</li>
      <li>But not expecting much since it hasn&#x27;t functioned as well when I first purchased it 2 yrs ago.</li>
      <li>Functions slightly different (pivoting heads) but once used to it was fine.</li>
      <li>Works for over a week when fully charged so very convenient for travel.</li>
      <li>It really makes enjoying a nice shave in the morning difficult.</li>
      <li>and I think you can get more bang for your buck with some of the other options out there.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to run an electric appliance for several hours to clean something that rinses off.</li>
      <li>We have been searching for triple foil electric shavers and most were so outrageously expensive and this one is perfect and does the same as the expensive ones and the price is even better.</li>
      <li>This shaver gives a decent shave but it&#x27;s the loudest electric razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I have highly recommended the F7790 to all my family and friends.  </li>
      <li>I am ordering new blades for this one to see if that would help.</li>
      <li>The cleaning station runs for a few hours and makes a humming sound the whole time.</li>
      <li>I always need to go back and clean up several spots with the trimmer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave that my old Remington MS3-1700 does.  </li>
      <li>like the LCD gauge that tells how much time is left on the charge.</li>
      <li>, the Remington is my least favorite.</li>
      <li>There is too much \\&quot;curve\\&quot; in the shaver, making it necessary to turn the shaver around, or resposition</li>
      <li>woeked fine for about a week then blades seemed to dull with a maeginal shave.,.</li>
      <li>When the foil recently perforated, and while waiting for the new blades and foil to arrive, I got out my 29 year old (!)</li>
      <li>It does NOT shaver anywhere near as close to a regular razor as remington often advertises.</li>
      <li>Is a few dollars saved worth the compromise?</li>
      <li>The pivot seems a little loose for my liking and has a cheap feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had a Remington 2 foil razor for a very long time it was so old they would not suppy parts anymore</li>

<li> I have had a Remington 2 foil razor for a very long time it was so old they would not suppy parts anymore</li>
<li> Sometimes the 3 foil head shavers leave long hairs, but you can go back and cut those every once in a while with the trimmer.  </li>
<li> The sound is comparable to hair cutting shears at an old barber shop.</li>
<li> I do not know the long term effects or if I will shock myself one morning.&lt;br</li>
<li> After using the new Foil Razor for about 3 weeks I discovered that one of the foils had a small hole in it .</li>

<li> Not that much has changed over the years - this shaver may be a little heavier and louder than past models.  </li>
<li> This shaver&#x27;s speed seemed a little slow at first, but speeded up after a couple recharges.  </li>
<li> so I bought this one because I had previously bought a Norelco rotary rechargeable it lasted about 1 year so back to Remington</li>
<li> In hindsight, I would absolutely NOT purchase this razor again.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t scratch his face up like other electric razors he has tried.</li>
<li> It came with some other tools (the reason I wanted it) and a cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is quite sturdy yet it is not too heavy.</li>
<li> The razor has a flex head, which I personally find unnecessary.  </li>
<li> I used the cleaning solution that came with the razor for a few weeks</li>
<li> I must shave twice daily to avoid uncomfortable evening stubble that I did not experience when using the MS3.  </li>
<li> But not sure if I would purchase it again.</li>
<li> The shaver is awkward to hold when shaving the opposite side of your face, under the cheekbone.  </li>
<li> Sad to say, but this piece of crap isn&#x27;t worth the effort it would take to blow it to hades.</li>
<li> razor came with a cleaning station that uses an expensive cleaning solution.</li>
<li> The trimmer was difficult to operated.</li>
<li> A disappointment.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> Seems noisier than 3300 triple header I replaced. Functions slightly different (pivoting heads) but once used to it was fine.</li>
    <li> It is ok. But not sure if I would purchase it again. It does NOT shaver anywhere near as close to a regular razor as remington often advertises. The first model I purchased DID. That was years ago. But this one leaves a lot to be desired. A disappointment.  Wish I had the earlier model. I am ordering new blades for this one to see if that would help. But not expecting much since it hasn&#x27;t functioned as well when I first purchased it 2 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors on and off for about 15 years. I received this one as a Christmas gift because it was the one I asked for. It came with some other tools (the reason I wanted it) and a cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of four electric razors I have tried, the Remington is my least favorite. It does the job, but it takes more work than some of the others. I always need to go back and clean up several spots with the trimmer. My face needs to be really dry in order for it to work. If it is still moist from the shower, the razor does not glide properly. I have experimented with shaving cream and it seems to work. I do not know the long term effects or if I will shock myself one morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the LCD gauge that tells how much time is left on the charge. I can easily get a week on a charge with this razor. If you do forget to charge it, the razor will run with the charger attached. The body of the razor is larger than others I have tried and feels somewhat clunky in my hand. The pivot seems a little loose for my liking and has a cheap feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor came with a cleaning station that uses an expensive cleaning solution. I used the cleaning solution that came with the razor for a few weeks and it really didn&#x27;t do any better than rinsing with water and using the brush. The cleaning station runs for a few hours and makes a humming sound the whole time. I don&#x27;t need to run an electric appliance for several hours to clean something that rinses off. I put the cleaning station in the cabinet and now just use the cord to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wasn&#x27;t used to using my electric in the shower or having the option to use shaving cream, I might like this razor. However, technology has advanced beyond this and I think you can get more bang for your buck with some of the other options out there.</li>
    <li> I have had a Remington 2 foil razor for a very long time it was so old they would not suppy parts anymore so I bought this one because I had previously bought a Norelco rotary rechargeable it lasted about 1 year so back to Remington this one is ok it takes some getting use to to get as close of a shave as my older one did but I am trying to get better with it and give it time so far it is just ok</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a decent shave but it&#x27;s the loudest electric razor I&#x27;ve used. It really makes enjoying a nice shave in the morning difficult. The sound is comparable to hair cutting shears at an old barber shop. The quality of the housing and overall look and feel are lacking with this shaver. I would recommend a Panasonic or Braun to anyone looking for a well built and quieter electric razor.</li>
    <li> At best, this razor is only adequate.  It doesn&#x27;t give the close shave that my old Remington MS3-1700 does.  I must shave twice daily to avoid uncomfortable evening stubble that I did not experience when using the MS3.  Only reason I bought this razor is because the MS3 battery died, and I can&#x27;t find a replacement battery or instructions on how to replace the battery.  I will probably exercise  Remington&#x27;s 30 day return guarantee.  The razor has a flex head, which I personally find unnecessary.  A gimmick that some folks may find desirable.  The readout of remaining time is a nice touch, but the readout isn&#x27;t very accurate.  When the \\&quot;Lo\\&quot; message came on shortly after \\&quot;10\\&quot; minutes appeared on the display, I was able to shave, morning and night, for four days before charging was required.  The shaver is awkward to hold when shaving the opposite side of your face, under the cheekbone.  There is too much \\&quot;curve\\&quot; in the shaver, making it necessary to turn the shaver around, or resposition the grip shave your \\&quot;off side\\&quot;.  There is one undeniable strength - the battery.  At ~3 minutes per shave, the charge lasted for 11 days.  You may want to consider alternatives to purchasing this shaver.</li>
    <li> The F7790 either meets or exceeds every expectation that was presented on Amazon.  This Remington has given me the cleanest and most comfortable shave of the numerous electric razors I have used.  If you want a clean, close, and comfortable shave each and every day the Remington F7790 is the razor you should use.  I have highly recommended the F7790 to all my family and friends.  Remington is the number 1 electric razor.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington 3 head shavers for 40+ years.  I like the shavers with 3 foil heads because I think they cut faster than the ones with two foil heads and an intercept blade.  Sometimes the 3 foil head shavers leave long hairs, but you can go back and cut those every once in a while with the trimmer.  Not that much has changed over the years - this shaver may be a little heavier and louder than past models.  I think the pivoting head is a positive and useful innovation.  This shaver&#x27;s speed seemed a little slow at first, but speeded up after a couple recharges.  Overall I am satisfied with the product - no shaver is perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. It doesn&#x27;t scratch his face up like other electric razors he has tried.</li>
    <li> wish i could return it do not cut well and irritate my skin and i dont like it yours truly  ANDRÉ NANTEL</li>
    <li> Sad to say, but this piece of crap isn&#x27;t worth the effort it would take to blow it to hades. My opinion. You asked. I  told you.</li>
    <li> Foil gave a smooth shave if you could stand the noise. The trimmer was difficult to operated.Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Works for over a week when fully charged so very convenient for travel. It is quite sturdy yet it is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> After using the new Foil Razor for about 3 weeks I discovered that one of the foils had a small hole in it . I am happy to say that when I contacted Remington they promised to send me a replaceable Foil.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get used to this shaver. Why do you keep changing equipment when the old one works fine?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about 1 1/2 years. It does an adequate, but noisy job. When the foil recently perforated, and while waiting for the new blades and foil to arrive, I got out my 29 year old (!) Norelco Rotatract razor. After about 10-15 seconds, it became incredibly obvious that the Remington razor pales in comparison. The Norelco was FAR quieter, more comfortable and more effective- without the razor burn. In hindsight, I would absolutely NOT purchase this razor again. Even if a bit more expensive, the Norelco is a far better value and more comfortable. Keep in mind, you&#x27;ll likely be using your razor for many years. Is a few dollars saved worth the compromise? I doubt it.</li>
    <li> woeked fine for about a week then blades seemed to dull with a maeginal shave.,. trimmer only fair....remmington a cheap line of products  you get wghat you pay for</li>
    <li> We have been searching for triple foil electric shavers and most were so outrageously expensive and this one is perfect and does the same as the expensive ones and the price is even better.</li>
