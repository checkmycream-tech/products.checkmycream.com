      <li>This product is mostly for adults, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
      <li>okay:</li>
      <li>Packaging could have been better because the tube was squashed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Pleased with product and price</li>
      <li>Have been using for many years.</li>
      <li>this really does work great.</li>
      <li>I was given this a tube of Gel-Kam by a friend who somehow had way more than he needed.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the purchase.  </li>
      <li>and best of all, my kids constant stream of cavities was practically stopped in their tracks by this product.  </li>
      <li>and it showed signs of reduced sensitivity significantly!  </li>
      <li>good product, fast shipping,</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s flavorful and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Why are most tooth care products so sweet tasting?</li>
      <li>That is why ingesting fluoride through water or fluoride pills is important and NOT a scam.</li>
      <li>My sensitivity went away after the first use and got better each use after.</li>
      <li>but the level of fluoride is significantly lower than I was using from the dentist office.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve tried all else and have not been successful, I would definitely recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>The 0.4% fluoride ion content is much higher than regular toothpaste (0.15%), making it a great product for those prone to cavitites.</li>
      <li>This product was for my husband who has to use it as ordered by a Dr.  Very pricey in my estimation but was able to get it cheaper here.</li>
      <li>As always quick shipping.  </li>
      <li>thanks!!</li>
      <li>Now they are rare.</li>
      <li>I cuntinue to use Gel Kam because of it&#x27;s success record.</li>
      <li>But worth it.</li>
      <li>: Package came quickly and exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Your body cannot function without skin right?</li>
      <li>If you did not have skin you would immediately get an infection because there is no flesh to protect you right?</li>
      <li>And when her baby teeth fall out, the new teeth will be strong and cavity-free.</li>
      <li>Maybe try it first</li>
      <li>So I am back to using it again and enjoying Ice Tea again.  </li>
      <li>It actually dissipated the pain and sensitivity and put me in a more tolerable zone.  </li>
      <li>first I used it twice a day -</li>
      <li>have been using it for 20 years and since it is difficult to find in stores, it is great that I can easily purchase it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>and I still have all my teeth which is rather unusual for what my mouth has been through.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise I tried Gel-Kam and used it as directed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had issues with my teeth and thanks to Gel-Kam</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like this lite berry taste and smell....</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>I used the product as directed and after awhile started to notice my teeth turning a light yellow with some brown.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>The stuff works and it works fast.</li>
      <li>so my mouth felt kind of gross and as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed it at all.  </li>
      <li>This high-concentration Stannous Flouride gel helps restore enamel to my teeth that were worn down by bruxism; I coat my appliance with it before I put it in my mouth at bedtime, and my teeth look much better (dentyne no longer shows).</li>
      <li>To: T. Grata,  The purpose of ingesting fluoride is not only to strengthen the enamel on your teeth but to make sure that the enamel on your teeth developes properly before it erupts through the tissue.</li>
      <li>My gums are very sensitive and this Gel-Kam really helps a lot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon, and so reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>I use this because I have sensitive teeth and this works really, really well for me.  </li>
      <li>We now use it for our 2-year old as a preventative and will continue to do so when our 7-month old gets their first teeth.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, after a few attempts I was able to figure out a way to brush the gel onto my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I was having upper right quadrant pain until I used Gel-Kam.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this to me for a very sensitive and exposed wisdom tooth root.  </li>
      <li>The only thing to note is that upon using it the first time, when you put the gel over your sensitive teeth it will sting a bit.</li>
      <li>Most of the product sinks down into your bristles almost instantly so you have to start brushing quickly.  </li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this for sensitive gums/teeth after one day the pain was gone.at</li>
      <li>SLS creates the foaming action in toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>This product is for those with sensitive or problem teeth.</li>
      <li>This really help me big time.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>Why not offer an adult flavor?</li>
      <li>I used to have frequent cavities.  </li>
      <li>So far I have had the product for 1.5 weeks and have noticed no difference in my tooth decay.  </li>
      <li>I am extremely sensitive by nature,</li>
      <li>The gel itself is a bit watery; if you don&#x27;t move quickly after adding it to your toothbrush it can dribble down the sides and all over your sink/counters.</li>
      <li>Used Gel-Kam twice a day for 5 days and the tooth is back to normal.</li>
      <li>Most people don&#x27;t notice Hypoplasia till it is too late and by then your tooth just looks like it has a big cavity on it!  </li>

<ol>
    <li> I had a molar that got very sensitive to cold. Used Gel-Kam twice a day for 5 days and the tooth is back to normal. Have been using for many years.Saved an expensive trip to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Product is as described.  Packaging could have been better because the tube was squashed.</li>
    <li> As always quick shipping.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years.</li>
    <li> great product...I have used the heavy mint flavor in the past....I really like this lite berry taste and smell....wish it were easier to pick up at the drugstore!!  --It&#x27;s always the mint, or the pharmacist orders it and has no choice--but mint!!  thanks!!</li>
    <li> Pleased with product and price</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me for a very sensitive and exposed wisdom tooth root.  It just took one application and I was hooked!  It actually dissipated the pain and sensitivity and put me in a more tolerable zone.  Now, 10 years later, I still reach for Gel Kam whenever I have a sensitivity issue with my teeth and gums.  I am extremely sensitive by nature, hence my motto -- some people say, \\&quot;No pain, no gain\\&quot; but not me, I say, \\&quot;No Pain - NO PAIN!!\\&quot; And this product helps keep me pain free and smiling!  Which is very important to me and my outlook.  Bravo Gel Kam!!  It&#x27;s hard to find locally, so I&#x27;m glad to find it here on Amazon, and so reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Just really good stuff.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for sensitive gums/teeth after one day the pain was gone.at first I used it twice a day - now I use it once in the AM as a preventive.Its a little expensive - But worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps me from getting cavities.</li>
    <li> it seems to work and its got a ok taste</li>
    <li> This product was for my husband who has to use it as ordered by a Dr.  Very pricey in my estimation but was able to get it cheaper here.</li>
    <li> I bought this cause My dentist was going to prescribe it long story she thought it had some iodine in it that I am allergic to but it doesn&#x27;t so I ordered it myself.</li>
    <li> To: T. Grata,  The purpose of ingesting fluoride is not only to strengthen the enamel on your teeth but to make sure that the enamel on your teeth developes properly before it erupts through the tissue. If you don&#x27;t have fluoride in your system while your teeth are developeing it is very common for children to have teeth erupt with hypoplasia which is the underdevelopement of enamel. It is like being born with out flesh. Your body cannot function without skin right? If you did not have skin you would immediately get an infection because there is no flesh to protect you right? Your tooth needs enamel and if it does not have enamel on it the dentin (the yellow substance underneath the enamel) is exposed and the tooth will immediately begin to form a cavity, and no tooth brushing or topical flouride treatment can stop it. That is why ingesting fluoride through water or fluoride pills is important and NOT a scam. Most people don&#x27;t notice Hypoplasia till it is too late and by then your tooth just looks like it has a big cavity on it!  On to reviewing. This product works great!:o) Both my son and I use it!:o)</li>
    <li> Very good to use weekly per dentist</li>
    <li> Just what we needed. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Not like the old flouride paste I have found on here before, horrible taste.</li>
    <li> This high-concentration Stannous Flouride gel helps restore enamel to my teeth that were worn down by bruxism; I coat my appliance with it before I put it in my mouth at bedtime, and my teeth look much better (dentyne no longer shows). My dentist is pleased, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been the miracle cure for my rapid tooth decay.  I used to have frequent cavities.  Now they are rare.</li>
    <li> This gel is GREAT! Not only does it prevent cavities, it prevents tooth sensitivity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 20 years and since it is difficult to find in stores, it is great that I can easily purchase it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great experience....hard to find in stores always have to order</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended, and I think it works great. I have felt such an improvement in my teeth after using for over a month. The product is a thin gel, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue brushing it over my teeth like other people have mentioned in their reviews.</li>
    <li> I was having upper right quadrant pain until I used Gel-Kam. I still have an appointment with my dentist but at least now I don&#x27;t have to take lots of pain medication until the appoitment.</li>
    <li> I have something called &amp;#34;Burning Tongue Syndrome&amp;#34;. 98% of dental products have mint or some type of mint flavor.  It burns my mouth like acid.  I also have a reaction to SLS -an ingredient in 98% of dental products.  SLS creates the foaming action in toothpaste.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that has neither.  I had gone to every store in the area and read the labels of every product.  All had one or the other.  The berry is perfect !  Zero burning.  Even my dentist with 20 years experience has no recommendations for me.  But after hours of researching the web, I found this product.  Thank goodness.</li>
    <li> A pediatric dentist that I took my daughter to recommended Gel-Kam for all my kids.  They love the flavor- and best of all, my kids constant stream of cavities was practically stopped in their tracks by this product.  This fluoride applied to the teeth once a day is extremely effective. After brushing your teeth, apply a small amount to your toothbrush and brush it on your teeth.  Spit out the excess, but don&#x27;t rinse with water. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive teeth and I use this every night three weeks before a dental cleaning.  It really helps with the painful sensitivity to the metal contact.</li>
    <li> It works!  Had a crown put in because one of my fillings were to big to be redone and after the procedure, a little part of my root was exposed which caused sensitivity.  Tried over the counter toothpastes that are geared toward tooth sensitivity and also prescription ones with no avail over a one year period.  Used this for one month along with Sensodyne/Pronamel and it showed signs of reduced sensitivity significantly!  If you&#x27;ve tried all else and have not been successful, I would definitely recommend this product.  Maybe try it first so you can save yourself the pain and discomfort.</li>
    <li> been using the product for years...</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Hate this flavor, too sweet. Why should a decay preventative taste like pie filling? What happened to cinnamon? It was a good alternative to mint, which is boring. Why are most tooth care products so sweet tasting? This product is mostly for adults, isn&#x27;t it? Why not offer an adult flavor?</li>
    <li> We were recommended to use this product to help with our son&#x27;s teeth to ensure they were protected. Used it for the past two years and it&#x27;s helped a ton.</li>
    <li> good product, fast shipping,</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I&#x27;m so happy that they make a fruit and berry flavor.  I don&#x27;t like mint.  This is a really good alternative.  My gums are very sensitive and this Gel-Kam really helps a lot.  My gums hardly ever hurt.</li>
    <li> this really does work great. my son has been using it for about 2 months and i have already noticed a difference</li>
    <li> I highly reommend using Gel-Kam at least once a day.  My dentist recommended me using this product and since I have been using it (for over 4 years) no cavities and great check-ups.</li>
    <li> The stannous flouride in this product reduces sensitivity to hot/cold without the gum numbing effect of K2NO3 in other toothpastes (I can eat Pizza without unknowingly burning my mouth). With Amazon I avoided asking and having to explain this product is kept &amp;#34;behind the counter&amp;#34; and the finding out they only have mint.</li>
    <li> My family member has enamel issues with their teeth. Instead of costly treatments at the dentist I invested in this product. It&#x27;s gel it&#x27;s flavorful and easy to use. Sure saves money too. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product is for those with sensitive or problem teeth. Use before bed each night. Works wonders helping to save teeth and elimited pain.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My sensitivity went away after the first use and got better each use after. I finalyl had a cavity-free check-up! I thought it was a bit pricey for a Colgate product....howeverw/ no dental insurance this product saved me over $100 on NOT having cavities &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works just as it should.</li>
    <li> My oldest child needed extra protection for her teeth and they have done the trick. And when her baby teeth fall out, the new teeth will be strong and cavity-free. We now use it for our 2-year old as a preventative and will continue to do so when our 7-month old gets their first teeth. Perfect for your needs whether its to save the teeth or act as a preventative.</li>
    <li> The 0.4% fluoride ion content is much higher than regular toothpaste (0.15%), making it a great product for those prone to cavitites. This is a good product for anyone wanting a stronger cavity fighting alternative for home use.</li>
    <li> I received the product in less than two days as promised.  It is quite difficult to get all of the product you place of the toothbrush into your mouth due to the watered down texture.  Most of the product sinks down into your bristles almost instantly so you have to start brushing quickly.  Nonetheless, after a few attempts I was able to figure out a way to brush the gel onto my teeth.  I currently have tooth decay on my lower left molar and lower left wisdom teeth.  I decided to use the product because my wife told me that the fluoride can eliminate the decay (and costly doctor&#x27;s office visits) and because of the several reviews that edified this point.  So far I have had the product for 1.5 weeks and have noticed no difference in my tooth decay.  I am hoping that by the time this tune is used up I will see some results.</li>
    <li> Purchased this online about a month ago because my dentist recommended that I supplement my brushing routine with a fluoride gel. After brushing, I shake the water off of my toothbrush and add some of the Gel-Kam.  I brush it on, leave it on for a minute or so, then spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: Package came quickly and exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The okay: The gel itself is a bit watery; if you don&#x27;t move quickly after adding it to your toothbrush it can dribble down the sides and all over your sink/counters. As far as taste, I find the berry flavor mildly unpleasant.  After awhile I started to ignore it, but for me it was like brushing my teeth, and then drinking a berry smoothie afterwards.  The gel sticks to your teeth so my mouth felt kind of gross and as if I hadn&#x27;t brushed it at all.  The berry flavor didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: It stained my teeth!! I used the product as directed and after awhile started to notice my teeth turning a light yellow with some brown.  Did some research online and found that stannous fluoride is known to stain teeth! That would&#x27;ve been helpful to know beforehand.  Allegedly it&#x27;s not permanent and will come off with some major brushing/scaling, but it&#x27;s extremely unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview: Great seller, but I would not recommend this product as it stains your teeth and does not taste good.</li>
    <li> My pharmacy no longer carries this product so I was thrilled to get it on line!  I have used Gel-Kam for many years with great success.</li>
    <li> I am a throat cancer survivor and due to the radiation treatments have no enamel left on my teeth. My dentist suggested I use Gel-Kam in my mouth guards every night for about half hr. to help prevent tooth breakdown. It has been 7 yrs and I still have all my teeth which is rather unusual for what my mouth has been through. I am very happy with the results and believe it is due in a good part to my using the Gel-Kam.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but the level of fluoride is significantly lower than I was using from the dentist office.  I probably won&#x27;t buy again, I was just trying to save some money.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, but since some reviewers mentioned price I will point out it can be ordered cheaper from pharmacy. Ordered mine from Target for about $12.</li>
    <li> I was given this a tube of Gel-Kam by a friend who somehow had way more than he needed. I was skeptical of why one would use this product if there were no existing dental products. Much to my surprise I tried Gel-Kam and used it as directed and I could notice a difference in sensitivity to some things that had given me a bit of a tingle before when I ate them and now that is no longer the case. The stuff works and it works fast. I&#x27;ve never had issues with my teeth and thanks to Gel-Kam I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be visiting the dentist for anything but cleaning for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and a dentist told me that whatever I was doing to keep it up as my teeth are good.</li>
    <li> .I have been using Gel Kam for at least five years and have found that it enhances dental health and reduces csvities by nightly use.I cuntinue to use Gel Kam because of it&#x27;s success record.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the purchase.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this in stores like COSTCO or Wal-mart so it is required for me since my surgery. THXS,</li>
    <li> I use this because I have sensitive teeth and this works really, really well for me.  I have found that if I dry my toothbrush with a paper towel after I brush with the regular tooth paste and before I put the Gel-Kam on the brush, that the Gel-Kam stays on the toothbrush long enough to get it in my mouth without it running off into the sink.  I stopped using this a while back and my teeth became sensitive to cold again.  So I am back to using it again and enjoying Ice Tea again.  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> I do prefer the flavor of cinnamon</li>
    <li> like most the reviewers on here, I also had a great experiences while using this. I notice i had a decreased sensitivity, actually almost none now after using it consistently for 1 week/once a day. Now I don&#x27;t have to use it as much because there is almost none to very little sensitivity where my fillings are for my cavities . The only thing to note is that upon using it the first time, when you put the gel over your sensitive teeth it will sting a bit. I am not sure if its just a temperature of the cold gel or is it the product working its a magic, but once you get through that initial quick shock your good (it feel like having something very cold touch your sensitive teeth, it doesn&#x27;t last long tho).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a go if your having trouble with eating cold/hot stuff because of sensitivity. This really help me big time.</li>
    <li> Gel-Kam does work as advertised. Brushing it on teeth applies fluoride to strengthen the enamel. Unfortunately it is not as effective as Prevident. Its 0.4% concentration is weak in comparison to Prevident&#x27;s 1.1%.</li>
