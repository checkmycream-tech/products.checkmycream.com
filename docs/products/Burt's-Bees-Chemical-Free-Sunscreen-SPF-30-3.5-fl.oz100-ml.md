### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smells great</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen!!</li>
      <li>Honestly some people make it seem like it&#x27;s vaseline or marshmellow cream!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I thought it worked very well on my very fair skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, and one more note</li>
      <li>I actually got this tube for $7 on sale from $9 or so at CVS, and I thought \\&quot;Awesome!</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this product unless you really enjoy ruining your week and getting burned!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I LOVE almost all Burt&#x27;s Bees products...</li>
      <li>Since this is sunscreen, the item will most probably not be finished before the expiration date.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s natural which is great.</li>
      <li>We can still enjoy the outdoors.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s bees sucked me in with their natural facade, but this type of reflecting sunscreen isn&#x27;t actually good for you.</li>
      <li>Still, no other manufacturer has come up with a better chemical free formula yet, and I&#x27;m sure that if there is more consumer demand, they will keep working on improving the texture to compete in the marketplace.  </li>
      <li>I was happy to see a sunscreen that did not have the harmful chemicals like most other sunscreens.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
      <li>I got this after using their lip balm and liking the fact that it stayed better than normal lip balm.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even cheaper than the more toxic stuff I used to use, new sunscreen: found!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I am out most of the day, am fair-skinned and live in Texas.</li>
      <li>(I think), excited to use it for the first time.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really give an accurate idea of how it works as a sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The strongest version available is 30, whereas I really would prefer to buy 45 SPF.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using chemical sunblocks 3-4 years ago, and I gradually became more sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
      <li>, the quality is worth the price, but at $14 a bottle</li>
      <li>People say it comes off with water; I rarely go to the pool and there is no beach</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t burn easily, so it works fine for me, but my paler skined husband ended up with a pretty red face.</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen I know of that is both cruelty free and chemical free.  </li>
      <li>This is more like just a facial sunscreen.</li>
      <li>My excitement died at the first application.</li>
      <li>If applied on face rub it with your hands first than apply to face</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a daily sunscreen for your face.</li>
      <li>We bought this product last season and used it during spring break in cancun, making sure it hadn&#x27;t expired.</li>
      <li>Maybe I was sweating because it was hot out but either way, this sunscreen did not work for me.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a more natural sunscreen than the usual chemical-laden kind and picked this up at WalMart</li>
      <li>It has a smell, but I think it&#x27;s better than the more common sunscreen smell.</li>
      <li>The item meets expectations and as long as it is in-date we hope to be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t rub in completely and leaves your skin white, and bunches up and rubs off very easily.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 2 yr old , first time used it, washed right off</li>
      <li>And it has a distinct yellowish pigment, so you have to be more vigilant than usual about rubbing it in right, but I could deal with that if it worked for me...</li>
      <li>, i went to apply some \\&quot;Vaseline 100% natural aloe vera gel\\&quot; someone had for me and took a close look at the label and it reads in large font \\&quot;aloe fresh moisturizing\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It feels really filmy on the skin.</li>
      <li>Only 1 tube available and shipping</li>
      <li>Do not buy this for your whole body or to go out to the beach/pool etc.</li>
      <li>The sun has very damaging effects still.</li>
      <li>I really would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>I normally really like burt&#x27;s bees products</li>
      <li>I use Banana Boat sunscreen for my whole body</li>
      <li>and I am in so much pain from being sunburned.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m back to using the regular toxic drug store kind.</li>
      <li>washing off with water.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a decent sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Item was bought well after main season.</li>
      <li>and then large letters \\&quot;100% natural aloe vera</li>
      <li>Better a little bit of thickness than burnt skin.</li>
      <li>Will it sit on your skin and keep you from a burn when properly applied AND reapplied after water fun?  </li>
      <li>but once we finish this tube, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a new sunscreen, because this one isn&#x27;t doing it for us.</li>
      <li>It rubbed off on to most of the other things that I touched, including my bathing suit, which was white, and now stained.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll just mix some with a little coconut oil to see if it will rub in better.</li>
      <li>sensitive items on-line is not knowing how much time is left to the expiration date.</li>
      <li>It is NOT meant to rub in completely.  </li>
      <li>Burts Bees sunscreen is more expensive because of the ingredients used, but it smells terrific and I enjoy having it against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still think after 3-4 years of using this product, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.</li>
      <li>At least the smell was okay.</li>
      <li>but WOW</li>
      <li>problem is that it seems to entirely rub off on your clothing, the arm rest of your chair, or anything else your body touches, which leaves not only more cleaning for you to do, but less sun protection.</li>
      <li>But other reviews are right.</li>
      <li>I didnt even cover my whole back, just my shoulders and face, though i did end up getting a sunburn across my back and guess what, THERE&#x27;S IS NO VISIBLE LINE BETWEEN WHERE THE SUNBLOCK WAS APPLIED AND THE UNPROTECTED SKIN.</li>
      <li>Most sunscreens have chemicals in them that are endocrine disruptors and are not healthy for long term use.  </li>
      <li>and I even use it on my face under bare minerals makeup.</li>
      <li>I can still smell the old chemical sunblock on the necklines of shirts that have been laundered multiple times in those 3-4 years since I stopped using it.  </li>
      <li>As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really even work.</li>
      <li>It left a white residue on my skin, so I could clearly see where i applied the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I was in the water the entire time, and apparently, it isn&#x27;t waterproof (I just assumed it was because else what is the point of wearing sunscreen).&lt;br</li>

<li> I went to the beach yesterday, applied the lotion very generously to the upper half of my body before i left-- the lotion was chunky and did resemble eraser left-overs like other comments mentioned.  </li>
<li> I was not impressed at all, leaves a pasty white film and easily wipes off.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get burned, but I wasn&#x27;t outside that long</li>
<li> I do have to reapply often and it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>

<li> Will it compare with sleek soak-in sunscreens with 6 different active ingredients?  </li>
<li> The two times I used it I ended up diluting it with water so that I could use a thinner (less white, less filmy) layer, but I did that when just doing yardwork outside the house where no one could see me, since you still get a bit of that white look.</li>
<li> Well, it must have because after using this i got a 3rd degree sunburn after only being out in the sun for a few hours.</li>
<li> After only about an hour really standing directly in the sun, we left the beach both badly burned.</li>
<li> At the rate it is being used about half will be left by the time expiration date is reached.</li>
<li> When it gets wet, it comes off in a whitish-colored liquid.  </li>
<li> Amazon was one of the few places that still carried the product, in fact, we bought the last one.</li>
<li> It goes on THICK and WHITE.</li>
<li> This is watered down aloe vera juice re-gelled with a bunch of chemicals and fragrances.</li>
<li> a whitish color after you have it on for a little while -- even after you try to wash it off!  </li>
<li> He had a really bad reaction to Neutrogena baby pure sunscreen.</li>
<li> I use very little and pat it onto my face reducing the stickyness and have no problem applying my foundation etc.  </li>
<li> It was a little thick.</li>
<li> The lotion goes on very thick, and never really quite rubs in, leaving a chalky layer of white/purple.</li>
<li> It really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
<li> I usually like Burts Bees products</li>
<li> and unfortunately I applied it while in public.</li>
<li> It also smells pretty weird and is expensive.  </li>
<li> Not sure in what conditions someone would be wearing sunscreen and not sweating?</li>
<li> Those first three ingredients are crap, they dont do anything.</li>
<li> Disappointing product especially for the price.</li>
<li> THIS SUCKS.</li>
<li> It tends to be a bit thick and sticky, and makes my complexion look a shade lighter after I put it on.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes, this is white on the skin.  It is NOT meant to rub in completely.  It sets on the skin as a barrier to the sun.  Most sunscreens have chemicals in them that are endocrine disruptors and are not healthy for long term use.  They also soak into the skin, but this one does not have those side effects.  This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause my son&#x27;s skin to blister and swell.  I don&#x27;t know what we would do without it.  I am disappointed to read all these bad reviews.  This sunscreen does what it is intended to do.  Will it compare with sleek soak-in sunscreens with 6 different active ingredients?  No. Will it sit on your skin and keep you from a burn when properly applied AND reapplied after water fun?  Yes.</li>
    <li> After applications,  you can&#x27;t even put foundation on, your skin and the cream rub off like an eraser.....AVOID THIS !!!</li>
    <li> I got this after using their lip balm and liking the fact that it stayed better than normal lip balm. This stuff feels the same way, like its not coming off, and you would hope so consider it costs $20 a tube retail. Well, it must have because after using this i got a 3rd degree sunburn after only being out in the sun for a few hours. I didnt even cover my whole back, just my shoulders and face, though i did end up getting a sunburn across my back and guess what, THERE&#x27;S IS NO VISIBLE LINE BETWEEN WHERE THE SUNBLOCK WAS APPLIED AND THE UNPROTECTED SKIN. Nothing, i might as well put on a $20 bottle of hempseed oil. Oh wait, i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one more note, i went to apply some \\&quot;Vaseline 100% natural aloe vera gel\\&quot; someone had for me and took a close look at the label and it reads in large font \\&quot;aloe fresh moisturizing\\&quot; and then tiny letters \\&quot;daily body gel with\\&quot; and then large letters \\&quot;100% natural aloe vera gel\\&quot;. Looking closer at the ingredients (ingredients being posted in order of largest-smallest quantity): water, pentylene glycol, glycerin, aloe vera leaf juice\\&quot;. Those first three ingredients are crap, they dont do anything. This is watered down aloe vera juice re-gelled with a bunch of chemicals and fragrances. Unilever (owner of the vaseline trademark), like Burts Bee&#x27;s, used deception to push diluted overpriced crap and in doing so endangered the health of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any packaged product that uses: (all)natural, holistic, organic, chemical-free, unprocessed, hypo-allergenic, green, eco-friendly, sustainable, and so forth should be regarded with extreme suspicion.</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle of this and it is unusable. Won&#x27;t rub in completely and leaves your skin white, and bunches up and rubs off very easily. Disappointing product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on yellow then turns your skin a whitish color after you have it on for a little while -- even after you try to wash it off!  It also smells pretty weird and is expensive.  Don&#x27;t bother with this.  I threw mine out</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I know of that is both cruelty free and chemical free.  There are several other cruelty-free brands on the market, but they stink of chemicals.  If you are used to commercial sunblocks, you might be used to the chemical odor and not notice it.  I stopped using chemical sunblocks 3-4 years ago, and I gradually became more sensitive to fragrances.  I can still smell the old chemical sunblock on the necklines of shirts that have been laundered multiple times in those 3-4 years since I stopped using it.  Burts Bees sunscreen is more expensive because of the ingredients used, but it smells terrific and I enjoy having it against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, there are a couple of disadvantages.  The strongest version available is 30, whereas I really would prefer to buy 45 SPF.  The texture also needs some work.  It tends to be a bit thick and sticky, and makes my complexion look a shade lighter after I put it on.  When it gets wet, it comes off in a whitish-colored liquid.  This is a disadvantage because chemical sunblocks damage coral reefs, so if I ever have a chance to dive coral reefs, I won&#x27;t have a waterproof sunblock to wear while I&#x27;m doing it.  Still, no other manufacturer has come up with a better chemical free formula yet, and I&#x27;m sure that if there is more consumer demand, they will keep working on improving the texture to compete in the marketplace.  Also the price tends to be higher, again because there is a fairly small consumer demand and not a lot of competition making this type of product.  I still think after 3-4 years of using this product, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 2 yr old , first time used it, washed right off--It is not waterproof. 2nd time put it on her for  a 2hour park outing and she was burned in only 70 deg weather! Not to mention it got all over clothing and car! Horrible product</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!! I&#x27;m a redhead and I absolutely hate putting on sunscreen. It&#x27;s always greasy, smells awful or doesn&#x27;t last long. Not this stuff! It smells great and I even use it on my face under bare minerals makeup. I&#x27;m going to slather this stuff on daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is $13 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> This is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible to be a bad sunscreen but WOW THIS SUCKS. when you apply it it&#x27;s disgusting... It balls up and you have chunks of this stuff all over. Makes you look and feel gross. Like I couldn&#x27;t wait to shower and unfortunately I applied it while in public. Burt&#x27;s bees sucked me in with their natural facade, but this type of reflecting sunscreen isn&#x27;t actually good for you. The sun has very damaging effects still. Overall stay away from this product!</li>
    <li> After reading a bunch of bad reviews I decided to write one. It really isn&#x27;t that bad. This is more like just a facial sunscreen. It&#x27;s not that sticky. Honestly some people make it seem like it&#x27;s vaseline or marshmellow cream! It&#x27;s not going to have the same protection as chemically stronger sunscreens. Do not buy this for your whole body or to go out to the beach/pool etc. It&#x27;s more of a daily sunscreen for your face. My mom has a lot of sunspots on her face so I always use sunscreen before applying makeup as well as reapplying when needed throughout the day. I use very little and pat it onto my face reducing the stickyness and have no problem applying my foundation etc.  I haven&#x27;t gotten burned. I am out most of the day, am fair-skinned and live in Texas. I use Banana Boat sunscreen for my whole body but I use this sunscreen for my face. People say it comes off with water; I rarely go to the pool and there is no beach nearby so I have no problem with it washing off with water.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a decent sunscreen. It&#x27;s natural which is great. It has no paraben, phthalates or petrochemicals. Apply a generous amount. If applied on face rub it with your hands first than apply to face so it&#x27;s not too sticky.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice before giving up on it. I was looking for a more natural sunscreen than the usual chemical-laden kind and picked this up at WalMart (I think), excited to use it for the first time. My excitement died at the first application. It goes on THICK and WHITE. It feels really filmy on the skin. They realllllly need to work on the formula. At least the smell was okay. The two times I used it I ended up diluting it with water so that I could use a thinner (less white, less filmy) layer, but I did that when just doing yardwork outside the house where no one could see me, since you still get a bit of that white look. I didn&#x27;t get burned, but I wasn&#x27;t outside that long so I can&#x27;t really give an accurate idea of how it works as a sunscreen. So I&#x27;m back to using the regular toxic drug store kind. I definitely won&#x27;t buy this again unless they revamp the formula so that it actually absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t make you look like a ghost.</li>
    <li> This product was discontinued by Burt&#x27;s Bees two years ago.  It does not meet FDA sunscreen guidelines and is expired. Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> This product was terrible. I usually like Burts Bees products, the quality is worth the price, but at $14 a bottle I really would not recommend this product to anyone. The lotion goes on very thick, and never really quite rubs in, leaving a chalky layer of white/purple. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really even work. It rubbed off on to most of the other things that I touched, including my bathing suit, which was white, and now stained.</li>
    <li> I just used it,and ended looking like a tomato. I was in the water the entire time, and apparently, it isn&#x27;t waterproof (I just assumed it was because else what is the point of wearing sunscreen).&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it was like I wasn&#x27;t using sunscreen at all. so I&#x27;m paying for being dazzled by \\&quot;chemical free.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Off to buy chemical loaded sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I normally really like burt&#x27;s bees products so it&#x27;s disappointing to have to write this review...but the fact is i am sunburnt BAD! I went to the beach yesterday, applied the lotion very generously to the upper half of my body before i left-- the lotion was chunky and did resemble eraser left-overs like other comments mentioned.  It left a white residue on my skin, so I could clearly see where i applied the sunscreen.  After two hours at the beach I reapplied the lotion.  I got home and I am in so much pain from being sunburned.  I hate putting the chemical crap on my skin, but I also know that the damage of a sunburn is much worse.  Maybe I was sweating because it was hot out but either way, this sunscreen did not work for me.  Not sure in what conditions someone would be wearing sunscreen and not sweating?</li>
    <li> I actually got this tube for $7 on sale from $9 or so at CVS, and I thought \\&quot;Awesome! It&#x27;s even cheaper than the more toxic stuff I used to use, new sunscreen: found!\\&quot; It has a smell, but I think it&#x27;s better than the more common sunscreen smell. And it has a distinct yellowish pigment, so you have to be more vigilant than usual about rubbing it in right, but I could deal with that if it worked for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it seems to entirely rub off on your clothing, the arm rest of your chair, or anything else your body touches, which leaves not only more cleaning for you to do, but less sun protection. I don&#x27;t burn easily, so it works fine for me, but my paler skined husband ended up with a pretty red face. While he didn&#x27;t burn like he would have without any sunscreen, neither was he as protected as you&#x27;d expect from an SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I LOVE almost all Burt&#x27;s Bees products... but once we finish this tube, I&#x27;m on the hunt for a new sunscreen, because this one isn&#x27;t doing it for us.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that works for my baby. He had a really bad reaction to Neutrogena baby pure sunscreen. Thank goodness for this sunscreen that was the only one that helped him not get burnt and flare up in his face. We can still enjoy the outdoors. I do have to reapply often and it&#x27;s pretty thick but I don&#x27;t care it&#x27;s totally worth it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed at all, leaves a pasty white film and easily wipes off. Had to purchased something else while on my vacation.</li>
    <li> We bought this product last season and used it during spring break in cancun, making sure it hadn&#x27;t expired. My dad had only applied this on his back, using something else on the rest of his body. I applied this all over my body, especially my back because that is where I burn the worst. After only about an hour really standing directly in the sun, we left the beach both badly burned. I wouldn&#x27;t use this product unless you really enjoy ruining your week and getting burned!</li>
    <li> I was happy to see a sunscreen that did not have the harmful chemicals like most other sunscreens. I thought it worked very well on my very fair skin. But other reviews are right. It was a little thick. Next time I&#x27;ll just mix some with a little coconut oil to see if it will rub in better. Better a little bit of thickness than burnt skin.</li>
    <li> Item was bought well after main season. Only 1 tube available and shipping was the same price as item. Amazon was one of the few places that still carried the product, in fact, we bought the last one. Expiration date is only about 8 months from receipt of item. Since this is sunscreen, the item will most probably not be finished before the expiration date. One problem with purchasing time sensitive items on-line is not knowing how much time is left to the expiration date. The item meets expectations and as long as it is in-date we hope to be satisfied. At the rate it is being used about half will be left by the time expiration date is reached.</li>
