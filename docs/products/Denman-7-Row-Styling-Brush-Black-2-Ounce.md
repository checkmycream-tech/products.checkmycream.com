      <li>thank you so much!</li>
      <li>It gets my hair smooth and leaves a beautiful curl pattern behind!</li>
      <li>I own 2 other denman brushes and wanted to replace them.  </li>
      <li>I just started weaving my hair and my normal hair brushes just were NOT cutting it.</li>
      <li>This brush really helps with shingling.</li>
      <li>It also seems to be very durable.</li>
      <li>Thanks for including a \\&quot;thank</li>
      <li>I really like the fact that I can modify the brush by removing a couple of the rows of teeth.</li>

      <li>you are a hairdresser and have clients with thick hair, this will be a good brush.</li>
      <li>This one is not any different works just like the original.</li>

      <li>Once you get use to a Denman their is no other brush needed.</li>
      <li>My last Denman brush was over 40 years old and used every day.</li>
      <li>Turns out, it really helps me style my hair, and I have the most impossible hair, very thick, with a mind of its own.  </li>
      <li>I bought this brush for myself awhile back and this one as a gift for my cousin who recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are stiff rubber which works well on my hair when it is worn natural as well as when I press it for a straight look.  </li>
      <li>The Denman brush helps clump my curls together, so I get beautiful thick spirals, instead of random curls that go in anywhich direction.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have use this brush on my half wigs, weaves, natural hair and I have yet to have a complaint!!</li>
    <li> Love the fact it keeps the static away.  I brush my hair before I shower and I don&#x27;t have the tub stop up due to excessive hair in drain.</li>
    <li> The title says it all! It gets my hair smooth and leaves a beautiful curl pattern behind! Just what I needed for my wash and go!</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my natural hair. It smooths my hair and takes care of wet tangles, sturdy, and durable.</li>
    <li> This is so finely made and the weight is great the bristles are so comfortable. I couldn&#x27;t see using any other brand.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the brush, it is very thing it advertised.  I received it in the time specified.</li>
    <li> Wanted to let you know that I absolutely LOVE my Denman Brush! I appreciate all the reviews as part of my research to ascertain whether or not I would be a making a mistake. This was definitely a \\&quot;thumbs up\\&quot;! In addition, I really liked the secure packaging. Thanks for including a \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; on the invoice. (I appreciate the small things.) The personal touch in this impersonal age!.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to help detangle my hair. The brush works well an I hope it will last me years. I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Its great for detangling/styling my 4a natural hair! This brush does not tug or pull my hair! It is very sturdy and easy to clean! This is an great quality brush that will last for years!</li>
    <li> I have natural 3C hair that is thick and medium length (collarbone length when straightened, chin length curled).  The Denman brush helps clump my curls together, so I get beautiful thick spirals, instead of random curls that go in anywhich direction.  I&#x27;m often asked if I do twist outs, but it is really just a wash and go, which just show how nicely the curls are clumping together.  My only complaint is that after several months of use, the outside rows are starting to bend outwards.  But the price isn&#x27;t bad, so I may just keep replacing the brush so that the original structure of the rows is maintained.</li>
    <li> I have been buying 8 row Denman brushes from my barber for 20 years.  She quit carrying them.  My choices on amazon were a 7 and a 9.  The 7 is harder? stiffer? than those old 8&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t like it. My wife doesn&#x27;t use the type so it&lt;br /&gt;s off to Saint Vincent de Paul.  I recognize this is a personal choice and others may love it.  I guess now I have to try the 9 and hope that it is the softer one that I so like.</li>
    <li> I have used Denman brushes for many years and really love them.  I ordered 2 this time so I could have one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> After hearing all the rave about the Denman Brush I decided to get one for myself. I didnt expect it to be anything special but when I tell you that this brush detangled my big kinky curly hair so well that I didnt even take my normal 1hr to do it. The quality of this brush is so sturdy that I know it will last a long time. Im thinking about purchasing another one just because.</li>
    <li> This company makes the best brushes...  I had to buy this one because my daughter keeps taking my other one!  &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> My shipment was &#x27;lost&#x27; by the post office and Venice Beauty was great and getting me the tracking information I needed to verify the shipment in a timely manner. When I finally received the Denman it was packaged well, new and has been performing to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Denman brush now for over 6 years. I had the original classic. This one is not any different works just like the original. I even bought a another one for my children being that they love to use it too.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for creating different styles, is not harsh on my hair either. It also seems to be very durable.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It was a bit big for my hair but I realize as my hair grows it suits me just fine. I have been natural for 10 months and I have very thick 4b hair. This brush really helps with shingling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of denman products and this brush is no exception! I usually use this brush AFTER I detangle with my denman paddle brush. I would not recommend this brush for detangling (def get the paddle brush for that...) but this brush does a great job of gathering for updos or elongating strands for a blow out.</li>
    <li> Received on time.  This Denman brush is a great quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Denman brushes for many years and they last&lt;br /&gt;a very long time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this brush, but my hairdresser recommended it. Turns out, it really helps me style my hair, and I have the most impossible hair, very thick, with a mind of its own.  With its hard plastic &amp;#34;bristles,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a little harsh on my scalp, but it does the job fast.  Good price, too.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to clean, removable bristles...all at a great cost! thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have been using Denman forever. I have my own 9-row Denman but I bought this for my young daughter whose hair is quite thick. This one is light weight but it has rubberized pad so it styles her hair real easy and well. No tangles. I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Really a good brush.  Should last forever</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Great shipping etc.</li>
    <li> If this brush stayed in place and didnt slide apart I would give it a high rating. It define my curls well,but it comes apart too much</li>
    <li> I find this brush to be the best brush I have ever used. It brushes out the tangles easier than any other brush I have ever used. My hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in it because of how it was made and the bristles don&#x27;t scratch or scrape my scalp. I recommend this brush to everyone!</li>
    <li> I own 2 other denman brushes and wanted to replace them.  None of the beauty supply stores here in Massachusetts and in New York (where I frequently travel) carry them, so I went to Amazon.  The brush is great!  The bristles are stiff rubber which works well on my hair when it is worn natural as well as when I press it for a straight look.  It is especially good for wrapping at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing, I prefer the fuller sized brush but the 7-row is especially light-weight and works great when wrapping.</li>
    <li> This Brush is  very good scalp simulator, I love how it feels on my hair,would recommend to friends. the 9 row would  do well on my friends hair because of the length.</li>
    <li> I love denman i was using denman all since i was in hs and it last a long time  ilove it</li>
    <li> This brush is quality made and is a great size for tucking into my purse. I do think it would work best with longer hair. My hair is short so the bristols are a bit rough on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have used Denman brushes for over 25 years now and you just can not beat the craftsmanship and the feel on your hair and scalp when using this brush.</li>
    <li> Does its job, but the bristles are long &amp; pointy and hard on my scalp. I have very fine hair and this brush is better suited to medium or coarse texture hair, or fine hair with high density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a hairdresser and have clients with thick hair, this will be a good brush.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I highly recommend it to others. I really like the fact that I can modify the brush by removing a couple of the rows of teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, I&#x27;m still trying to figure out why i hadn&#x27;t purchased this brush way before now. I can actually detangle my hair without pulling half of it out. It&#x27;s amazing to see the difference in how much hair comes out between washes. every time I use the brush less hair comes out than the time before. I am looking forward to having a healthier mane with the use of this brush.</li>
    <li> I give this item 5 stars because it is solidly built and sturdy. It fits perfectly in my hands and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first hair brush ever. I&#x27;m 25, male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using this brush to scratch my head also... it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item to Men who want a low cost hair brush that is durable.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush for any hair that gets tangled easily. I have very thick natural black hair....some would probably type it as a 4C. This brush helps me de-tangle my hair after washing and I have even used it to blow out my hair. I&#x27;m considering getting the other Denman brushes to add to my collection</li>
    <li> All I&#x27;ve ever used. My last Denman brush was over 40 years old and used every day. I gave it to my son. After that many years it was showing wear with the teeth and the rubber. Once you get use to a Denman their is no other brush needed.</li>
    <li> I had one of these brushes many years ago and I had not been able to locate another one in stores.  So glad I found it here on Amazon.  This brush feel great on the scalp and there is no static electricity after brushing.</li>
    <li> I just started weaving my hair and my normal hair brushes just were NOT cutting it. This brush untangles the hair with minimum effort. I love this brush - couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a bday gift for my BFF&#x27;s 14 yo daughter. She has long beautiful blonde hair and I knew she&#x27;d love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my own Denman for about  5 years now. It is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had and I also have med. long thick hair.</li>
    <li> I prefer to finger comb my afro hair, but, on occasion, I use my afro comb and Denman brush whilst deep conditioning my hair. I love my Denman brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for myself awhile back and this one as a gift for my cousin who recently transitioned from relaxed to natural hair.  This brush is amazing.  It combs through thick hair, without pulling and is excellent for detangling.  This is a MUST HAVE for naturals.</li>
