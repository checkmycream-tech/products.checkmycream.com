<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to add this brush to my collection for a couple years now.  Recently I&#x27;ve really gotten into highlighters and decided to finally purchase.  I&#x27;m sad to say that I am not impressed.  It barely picks up any product at all.  I&#x27;ve used it with both my NARS Dual Intensity blush in Frenzy and all my MAC highlighters and meh.  It works better with my MAC highlighters but still no.  There&#x27;s a similar brush in the Real Techniques basic brush kit (the one that comes with holder) and it works WAY better and you get four brushes for less than this one.</li>
    <li> Perfect,  decent brushes are worth the extra $</li>
    <li> This is a great highlighter brush. I do love Sigma Brushes. Depends on what you like in a brush I suppose.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for highlighting I love it, I like all the sigma brushes, they are more shipper. compare to MAC or Sephora</li>
    <li> I love this brush!!! I use it for so many diffrent things blush, conturing and hightlighting I would say this brushes is a MUST have!!!! I will be checking out more Sigma brushes!!</li>
    <li> Great brush for contour powder</li>
    <li> The F35 brush is great for precise application. I use this brush for both highlighting and contouring; it applies bronzer perfectly under my cheek bones and on the sides of my nose, as well as a highlighting shade on the bridge of my nose and the tops of my cheek bones. Really good quality as well</li>
    <li> No issues with this highlighter brush!  Does the job and is easy to control the amount of product I&#x27;m using with light changes in hand pressure.  Overall, Sigma makes great brushes - soft, well-made, and haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding.</li>
    <li> First let me say I love these brushes but some of them shed.  I ordered the F-05 small contour, F-20 Large powder brush, and the F-35 tapered highlighter and they all shed like crazy.  I contacted Sigma and they immediately sent me out replacements no questions asked. Unfortunately these shed too. I have washed them several times with baby shampoo and even conditioned them to see if this helped but still shed like crazy.  I&#x27;m so sad because I have the eye brushes and the F80,F82 and F84 and they are all fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005OZZO5W Sigma Large Powder - F20]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005OZW3ZG Sigma Small Contour - F05]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005P0M69I Sigma Tapered Highlighter - F35]]</li>
    <li> great for adding highlighter to cheekbones, soft tapered bristles do all the work for you!</li>
    <li> Great brush for highlighting!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after seeing its review on a beauty blog.  I needed a brush for my highlighting powder and this brush is nicely tapered and small enough to precisely apply my highlighter.  Comparable to other high-end brushes that I have used in the past but half the price which makes me a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I use it to apply highlighter.  It is the perfect size and I like to use the sides of the brush to highlight my cheeks and the tip to highlight the bridge of my nose and cupid&#x27;s bow.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this brush. I have other sigma brushes which are great but this one sheds like crazy. It leaves little black fibers all over my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful product</li>
    <li> Great brush contemplating getting more :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Sigma! This brush is so great. It applies highlighter very well. Amazing quality.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for powder &amp; highlight!</li>
    <li> Works so perfectly setting concealer w/powder in under eye area...also use as highlighter brush</li>
    <li> This is a really great brush. It&#x27;s meant to be used as a highlighting brush but I use this for a lot of different things, like contouring, setting my under eye concealer, and even a blending brush. I had no shedding with the F35.</li>
    <li> PERFECT BRUSH TO HIGHLIGHT WITH OR SET UNDER EYE CONCEALER. new holy Grail! I use it everyday -- yes I&#x27;ve washed it and it holds up beautifully. Shade stays, bristles stay, brush stays amazing. I can&#x27;t get enough</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really used highlighters that much before I bought this brush, but I can&#x27;t imagine not having it in my make up bag now. It goes on so smoothly and the brush doesn&#x27;t hold too much of it, so it never looks too much. Really big fan on Sigma.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use with powder highlighter, it has the perfect tapered top shape for your cheekbones. The bristles are soft enough but at the same time very dense, the bristles don&#x27;t irritate or sting my face.   This brush is made of synthetic bristles. My first impression of it was that it was so soft! I love how it feels on my face.  I have washed it once and found that it didn&#x27;t shed at all and it stayed in its original shape. I didn&#x27;t have a brush that was a good size for applying a highlight on my cheekbones but this applies it exactly where I want it to and can also be used to contour the hollows of your cheeks percisely.  I would give this brush an A PLUS!!!. I like brushes that have a multi purpose.    [[ASIN:B005P0M69I Sigma Beauty Tapered Highlighter - F35]</li>
    <li> Love, love, love for applying powder to my under eye area. Deffinately worth the splurge.</li>
    <li> This is by favorite highlighting brush! Works GREAT! Gets the areas I highlight just right. Its the perfect shape and the brush is as soft as m MAC brushes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Sigma&#x27;s tapered end brushes, this one applies highlighter and/or bronzer seamlessly. The bristles are so soft and after being washed, I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding. You could also use this one to apply powder right around the eyes &amp; nose without looking cakey or putting on too much. I recommend Sigma&#x27;s Dry N Shape for cleaning and drying brushes, does it quick &amp; brushes maintain shape. I love this brush so much, I&#x27;m going back for the Tapered Face Brush!! Thanks Sigma for your quick &amp; terrific service!!!</li>
    <li> Favorite brush for face highlighter!</li>
    <li> This is another one of Sigma&#x27;s great brushes. I use this for contouring, highlighting and blush occasionally. The bristles are smooth and don&#x27;t fall out. I love it.</li>
    <li> This brush works amazingly with MAC Shaping Powder Pro in EMPHASIZE!  It also makes a wonderful contouring brush.  With blush and bronzer.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like on the photo. Much smaller and thiner then on the photo. I&#x27;m not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> great for setting my concealer and highlighting..... I love this brush! can&#x27;t wait to buy more sigma brushes......a must have in your makeup kit!</li>
    <li> To me it didn&#x27;t seem like a real sigma brush. Not so soft and bristles kind of come out.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! As a makeup artist it is perfect for contouring and highlighting! Its perfectly tapered and enables precise shading for the nose and cheekbones. I will be purchasing a few more for my kit!&lt;br /&gt;THANKSS</li>
    <li> This brush is great! The bristles are super soft and pick up just the right amount of product (essential so you don&#x27;t look like a disco ball or end up having to press too hard into your expensive highlighter). The price is great and the quality is great. The handle is also very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this for highlighting powder and I am so happy with it&#x27;s performance. Picks and holds powder well and with the tapered end you can get into smaller, direct areas, as well as wider areas of your face. Perfect for what I wanted, no loose brush hairs and I use it daily. I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised! Love sigma brushes!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this brand of makeup brush. Every brush I have purchased by SIGMA has been well made and half the price (or even less) than MAC brushes. You will love this brush!</li>
    <li> Love the quality and multipurpose use</li>
    <li> This brush is great for creating a highlight on the top of the cheekbone. It picks up color very well and the brush is extremely soft. I love this brand.</li>
    <li> Love this brush... use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Love it… I have a small face, great size for my powder highlighter!</li>
    <li> I purchased from a third party seller, Aveyou Boutique. I thought since it was through Amazon it would be reputable- NOPE. I received a poor quality brush that had ANOTHER BRAND NAME on the opposite side of the handle to the one that said &amp;#34;Sigma.&amp;#34; The ferrule is a completely different color to my other Sigma brushes as is the color of the lettering on the handle. Seller also refuses to accept returns- because they sell terrible quality fakes. Do not buy from this seller!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush, better then expected!</li>
    <li> This works really well for my under eye area.  Doesn&#x27;t put on too much product but leaves just enough for a nice finish.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite highlight brush. The shape of it makes it so easy to pick up product and apply it exactly where I want, and the bristles are nice and soft and feel good on my face. After about five months, the shape of the brush has changed slightly - the tip is a little less pointy. I would assume this is from washings. It still works well though.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome for highlighting! It is perfect for the UOP of the cheekbones and it grabs and hols product really well!</li>
    <li> Sigma does it again! This brush is such excellent quality. It is perfect for applying a light setting powder underneath the eye. It sets it perfectly without having to worry about applying too much. It fits in that area around the eye just right. You can use it with such a delicate touch and it&#x27;s unbelievably soft.</li>
    <li> i like it.love it. It is very soft. Also i like the gift that it was coming with the order</li>
    <li> Great for highlighting! I used my powder highlighter and it works great. I am very happy with this sigma purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  Super soft and just the perfect size!</li>
    <li> Got it pretty fast, and love it! Applies my highlight quick and easy. Sigma really does make amazing brushes!!  Definitely going to add more to my collection⏏ :)</li>
    <li> The only disappointing this is I thought it would be bigger but whatever, it feels great on my skin and perfect to highlight with</li>
    <li> The Sigma F35 Tapered Highlighter Brush makes it easy and quick to apply highlighting powder and cream products. The bristles are soft  and give a streak-free result.  I have not experienced brush shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the F35 and recommend it to other buyers looking for high quality makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent makeup tools. I use them everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this tapered highlighter brush. No problems with shedding either. I owned it now for a couple months.</li>
    <li> This brush works great for highlighting it really picks up so much powder with just a tap.i love it!! It&#x27;s also so easy to clean</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent for applying concealer setting powder or any under the eye product. The tapered shape of this brush is perfect! It&#x27;s VERY well constructed and it&#x27;s soft where it needs to be and it&#x27;s structured at the tip that makes it perfect for concealer and highlighting! I have not had any problem with shedding or bristles falling out and I use this brush DAILY!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best brushes. They are so soft, best quality I&#x27;ve seen so far. Love.</li>
    <li> This is a great highlight brush, soft bristles, but grabs a nice amount of product. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Perfect for concealer. Love it</li>
    <li> This brush makes me feel luxurious. The hairs that make up the brush glide effortlessly over my skin. This is the perfect tool for highlighting and making me feel beautiful!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a nice brush but I would not call it a must-have brush. To me, it&#x27;s more of a luxury brush. It&#x27;s nice for setting powder but I think you could find a brush at the drug store that would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use for the highlighter in my Anastasia Contour Pallette however I felt it wasnt the right brush for highlighting. I have been using it for blush and I love it! I do not like to apply a ton of blush and this helps me apply it precisely but also can blend it with the brush as well.</li>
    <li> I have 3 or 4 Sigma brushes in my collection and this one has about a million uses. Number one, as a highlighter. Number two, as a powder setter. Number three, as an overtop eye shadow fall out brush. The list goes on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m picking up a back up, sometime soon because I LOVE this brush so much!</li>
    <li> I am sold on sigma !!! This is my first and WONT BE MY LAST !  awesome awesome brush and I am a conissuer on make up brushes!  I am soooo glad I took a chance and ordered ! I didn&#x27;t know anything about sigma brushes but I kept seeing y&#x27;all&#x27;s brushes when I was ordering other makeup brushes on amazon so I read some reviews and was curious and finally broke down and decided , &amp;#34;ok, I&#x27;ll try it &amp;#34; And I am very happy I did !!!!</li>
    <li> I like this brush a lot.  I did think it was going to be the larger brush, however.  The brush I got is very useful in highlighting which I like!</li>
    <li> Looking for the PERFECT highlighter brush, buy this one and you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these one for my professional kit and one for my personal use. I use to use the fan brush for highlighting but this brush works waaaay better and it does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s like the one from the sigma website. it seems smaller than the ones I see on youtube. But it is very soft and does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> This brush was a great buy, price was good, great size &amp; it washes great!  I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I use it to set my undereye concealer rather than for a highlight, but it is perfect.  The size and shape fit great under the eye and help to keep my concealer from creasing.  I strongly recommend trying this brush out for the under eye area.  This brush is soft, high quality, and the perfect shape!</li>
    <li> Best under eye setting brush ever invented</li>
    <li> I love my sigma F35 is just perfect for highlighting,It&#x27;s so soft just right and for the price even better!</li>
    <li> It is NOT a fake. I purchased from Sigma Beauty. That last review, &amp;&amp; to whoever wrote that is full of it. It&#x27;s a great brush. Especially for setting, and maybe highlighting</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for my highlighting and concealer blending! Luv it,  thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s just as good if not better than the higher end more expensive brushes.  The tapered angle allows you to get close under the eye for the perfect blend.</li>
    <li> Great brush to apply powder on concealer (that will avoid creasing ) and/or to apply highlighting powder on cheekbones ...</li>
    <li> Soft, multi use for highlighter, setting powder. Doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> One of favorite brushes for highlight s</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> Good quality product, but I find the bristles to be very soft, so I prefer to use my fingers for highlighting.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. The perfect tool for applying my setting powder over my undereye highlighter. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love the shape of this brush but the bristles leave something to be desired.</li>
    <li> This brush was a gift in my Christmas stocking. It is the perfect size for highlighting or for any close work.&lt;br /&gt;I use YSL,Highlighter. I put a small mount on the brush, tap under my eyes,mand I taper the highlight to either side of my hares. I also brush some under my nose and over my lip.,I also have some Harris on my chin, so I use the highlighter on my chin,and ldtbitvdry. Then I apply my makeup. The highlight gives me a great little glow under my eyes and tapers toward the nose, it gives the allusion of my nose being smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I will also use the taper brush for a small definition under my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 01-31-15</li>
    <li> perfect for contouring and highlighting your cheeks this is my second one to buy.</li>
    <li> Great brush, very versatile, at a great price</li>
    <li> Esta Brocha es ideal para aplicar los iluminadores o para aplicar el polvo suelto en ciertas zonas como la nariz , debajo de la boca , sin tener que da&amp;ntilde;ar tu blush o bronzer</li>
    <li> With this brush you don&#x27;t need anything else to highlight every part of you face you want to!! The result its just amazing!</li>
    <li> Excellent for detailing powder under the eyes.  It&#x27;s quite small though for contouring the cheek bones.</li>
    <li> I keep buying Sigma, brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC. Need a Sigma store in Phoenix...</li>
    <li> I loooooove this brush, I wish amazon sold more of their brushes. This is well made and holds just the right amount of product, blending it into my skin well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because I don&#x27;t use this brush for its exact function. I apply besame&#x27; highlighting powder with this brush right under the eyes, and it works great!</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t fall apart. Use it a lot.</li>
    <li> Perfect for highlighting! Picks up and deposits the perfect amount of product for a gorgeous finish. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I love sigma brushes! So high end but for a considerably low price! must have! Great highlighter brush for your every day kit!</li>
    <li> Perfect brush for many different things blush, highlighting and contouring, also great for setting under eye concealer, Really good quality as well</li>
    <li> I love this brush for highlighting &amp; contouring! It does a fantastic job of just gliding over my face. The hair is so soft &amp; gentle, just like the rest of the Sigma range. I&#x27;m actually considering buying the Tapered Face brush, I love the precision it has for a medium size brush. Very happy that this brush is apart of my kit!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my wife which  works as a make-up master and she was very satisfied to use sigma brushes</li>
    <li> love this to add highlight to face</li>
    <li> This brush is great ! It does a great job to contour your cheeks and you can use it to apply your highlight&lt;br /&gt;it is VERY similar to MAC 138 - this brush is very affordable so far very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I like it :)</li>
    <li> Perfect highlighting brush</li>
    <li> Tried many &amp; this is the best highlighter brush. Adds perfect amount of product on cheekbones, nose, T-zone &amp; chin. Sigma brushes  in general are really the best.</li>
    <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is 100% the real deal. It&#x27;s very soft, has very little fallout of hairs and applies powders and highlighters beautifully. I use this brush every time I apply my makeup, it&#x27;s become a staple on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigma brushes are fantastic and very much worth the price (and its quite a value for the quality). I have several Sigma brushes that I have brought directly from the website and this brush is EXACTLY the same in all aspects. It is definitely a real Sigma brush, no need to worry about fakes here.</li>
    <li> I swear by Sigma brushes and have been extremely happy purchasing them through Amazon.  They are high-quality, soft, and dependable brushes.  Not only do they pick up makeup products well and distribute the product evenly throughout the face, the brushes never end up falling off everywhere.  This tapered brush is perfect for powder around the creases of your face (I set my foundation and concealer with loose powder and this brush around my nose and eyes).  It is also good for highlighting cheeks as the name says.  Highly recommend this product as well as all Sigma brushes.  They are great quality and they will last you years so they are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> FAKE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of Sigma brushes that I bought throughout the years from Sigma&#x27;s website.  Since I was ordering other things from Amazon I thought I would go ahead a purchase the brush from Amazon instead....mistake!!!  Its fake.  Sigma brushes are not made in China.  They are all made in USA!!  I&#x27;m very upset that people try to copy and get credit and paid for fake items.  Its disgusting.  Don&#x27;t fall for it like I did.  You can tell the difference in the quality from the FAKE from the REAL Sigma brushes.  This FAKE one is much more lightweight and just feels cheap.</li>
    <li> I really like the sigma brush line. This brush is one of my favorites... Easy and soft to use, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Love!! I used to use a fan style brush to highlight. this is the only brush I will use for highlighting now!!</li>
    <li> This brush is great quality at an amazing price.  Will recommend this product, and similar products to everyone!  Will be purchasing similar products immediately!</li>
    <li> I have never had any complaints about sigma products have bought like 8 brushes from them and they are quickly becoming my favorites! I already want to order more!</li>
    <li> It a must have. To Blush or highlighter is the best Brush ever. Recomend to all, it is really good.</li>
    <li> After beign dissapointed by the Sigma Kabuki brush I was pleased this this one!! It is pefect for what it says, highlighting:) The tapered brush allows you to have that glow exactly where you want with ease and precision!</li>
    <li> I love it! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> love the service and product&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s changed my life!!!</li>
    <li> I own many sigma brushes now and have loved all of them, but this one is THE best one I&#x27;ve purchased! loooove it so much</li>
    <li> I really love this brush! It is very good quality and extremely soft! It&#x27;s perfect for either highliter or blush! I will definitly be making more purchases!</li>
    <li> i love how this brush is pointed at the top! it applies my highlight perfectly on the highs of my cheek bones. I&#x27;ve used a fan brush to highlight before but nothing compares to this brush. I love using it with my mac mineralized skin finishes.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!! I use it to set my concealer powder works great for that and also can use for applying highlighter on my cheek bones.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be bigger and fluffier.  I kept it anyway.  Sigma brushes are good for the price.</li>
    <li> This Sigma brush makes me feel like a pro. I use it for my highlighting and face contouring it works like a dream. Sigma puts all brushes to shame. Will be getting a ton of them.</li>
    <li> The brush is very high quality. I have found many uses for this shape. I highly recommend this brush to my friends. It was delivered exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> This my first Sigma brush and I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality. It&#x27;s just as good as, if not better than my Mac brushes for a much better price point!</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best, hands down</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, highlighter and a good under eye powder setting brush.</li>
    <li> So soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. Perfect for applying makeup under the eye/around the nose.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Good for setting under eyes. Well made and will recommend it to a friend. It only gets 4 stars cause it&#x27;s pricey I have the bdellium 944 the same brush just by bdellium which is the same great quality just better priced. I find sigma to be over priced.</li>
    <li> works well with powder skin finish or highlighter. blends well and does not leave a caky effect, defined but blended look.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  This brush is one of my favorites!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush! The shape, the size, the softness and medium density make it perfect for blush or highlighter. So far, it is holding it&#x27;s shape, even after repeated uses and cleaning. (I clean my brushes every time I use them.) And it doesn&#x27;t shed. A BIG plus, in my book.</li>
    <li> i love my sigma brushes and just had to add this one to my collection. very soft and applies my highlight perfect</li>
    <li> So soft - I love this blush it helps bring my make up together. As it is tapered it is easy to guide it around your face especially around your eye area. The brush allows the right amount of product to be used.</li>
    <li> FAKE BRUSH. I&#x27;m not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> the brush is great ! I have only had shedding problems every once in a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product. The bristles are soft they do not loosen or break even after a long time of use.</li>
    <li> i really like the shape of this brush.  I use it for my hightlighter as well as my blush brush.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are the best. This one makes highlighting (powder) super easy.</li>
    <li> excellent product, recommend their use without problems sending or transaction</li>
    <li> shred a looooooooooooot  ,, you have to remove lots of shredded hair from your face each time you use it</li>
    <li> I love this Sigma brush!&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles, and no worries of any stray hairs left on your face (like you can get from a lot of lesser quality products).&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is a more affordable alternative to a MAC brush.&lt;br /&gt;The item was delivered within a week of placing the order, and was well packaged. I highly recommend this particular Sigma brush and the seller.</li>
    <li> The feel of the brush is very firm and the bristles are very soft while picking up the makeup product great</li>
    <li> Love this brush it gets into small areas</li>
    <li> Love this brush. ETAILZ is the best seller. Authentic and great quality</li>
    <li> Perfect size and density for setting under eyes for me.</li>
    <li> Have used many make up brushes throughout the years - these are the best I&#x27;ve ever found. Have purchased several and highly recommend. A little more expensive than some but you get what you pay for. I use for both powder and liquid foundations and they are excellent for both.</li>
    <li> they are of great quality. You can tell just by holding the brush in your hand that it&#x27;s a well made brush. They feel very sturdy and are comparable to higher end brushes.</li>
