      <li>My kids love the scent</li>

      <li>It smells good and is high quality.</li>
      <li>Amazon usually has the best price, and I buy the 2-pack which saves even more.</li>
      <li>I heard that they sell the refill size and since the family liked it so much</li>
      <li>Very worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love the clean, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Use it at home and office and is in our subscribe and save account we love it so much, as do guests/customers--we tell them to go to Amazon and get some!</li>
      <li>We are all enjoying washing our hands;)</li>
      <li>The scent is a lively and minty, and it tingles nicely when washing our hands.  </li>
      <li>Gets my gardener&#x27;s hands really clean.  </li>
      <li>and I use is easy enough, and this nicely scented soap makes our hands feel tingly clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not only suitable for hands - I use it as my daily face wash, and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not harsh, smells nice, and washes off clean, yet gentle on hands.  </li>
      <li>not in a good way but with the peppermint it actually smells really yummy!</li>
      <li>You can either use an old one from product you already have, or you can buy a nice large (about 12 oz) glass foaming hand soap dispenser at one of those box stores that sells bath products.</li>
      <li>I got this with my new SIMPLEHUMAN sensor and it really smells good plus it leaves your hands feeling soft and clean without the soapy feeling.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and natural antibacterial qualities.</li>
      <li>I love that it uses natural ingredients and is certified by the Non-GMO Project.  </li>
      <li>Enountered this while staying in someone&#x27;s home and was glad to see it available here in larger amount!  </li>
      <li>Also, the price is right, so will continue to buy EO&#x27;s Hand Soap</li>
      <li>It is great for handwashing but not a very good scent for the shower.</li>
      <li>It lasts long because you only need a little, and I love the mint scent the best.</li>
      <li>This soap has a smell that can be enjoyed equally by both girly-girls and manly men.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually using this soap for the shower, I love it.</li>
      <li>I good hooked on Tea Tree soap from another brand, but this is more available and a little less money.</li>
      <li>However, that being said the smell of this soap is extraordinary and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>None of them left my skin in as good a condition as this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree hand soap, so I went back to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does a good job with very little amount of the product needed to do the job.</li>
      <li>Tea tree oil can smell pretty intense and</li>
      <li>It does not dry my skin out like many face washes do (even those that are marketed as being gentle on sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin as much as other soap.</li>
      <li>I really wanted shower soap (not hand) but purchased this product anyway.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the Tea tree oil is really killing any bacteria</li>
      <li>Not over-perfumed like many other hand soaps.  </li>
      <li>The only problem I have had is that the bottles leak during shipping, but Amazon was quick to offer a refund.</li>
      <li>The soap seems to be less drying and considering I live in a dry climate, that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>It has essential oils and not artificial  fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Considering the expense of this soap, I&#x27;d like to see more natural ingredients and less chemicals like SLS.</li>
      <li>But alas, my standard foaming hand soap is out of stock and this product smells so great that I am planning to turn it into foaming hand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for one day, so it&#x27;s probably not fair to give it a rating yet at all, BUT it smells so good and</li>
      <li>Feel I am getting natural products while providing&lt;br /&gt;anti-bacterial properties as well.  </li>
      <li>a negative with so many hand soap products.  </li>
      <li>I have been searching for a natural liquid hand soap for quite some time and discovered this one at a fancy B and B</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I am really writing this \\&quot;review\\&quot; is because I actually made an error when purchasing this from Amazon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is sensitive to chemicals and fragrances.</li>
      <li>I was looking for natural soap in a refill size container.</li>
      <li>skin is pretty sensitive as well as breakout-prone, and is \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; with an oily t-zone and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cheeks (which become dry cheeks in the winter), but the EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap has not caused any adverse reactions to my skin.  </li>
      <li>, you need to use less of it because it works so well, and it only contains friendly natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>few months ago, I wondered if my facial skin would do any better if I returned to using a liquid soap that was specifically branded as a \\&quot;face wash\\&quot;, so I tried several that were recommended by the customer reviewers on makeupalley, skinstore, sephora, and the like, as well as recommended by the skincare/cosmetics expert Paula Begoun on her beautypedia website.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;FYI, most stores only carry a few of the items/\\&quot;flavors\\&quot; made by EO, but their entire range of products is described on (and sold via)</li>
      <li>, I love and regularly use a few varieties of the EO shower gels and bubble bath formulas (on my body skin only) --</li>
      <li>It is the only way to convey to these companies that WE ARE NOT STUPID, MINDLESS CONSUMERS.</li>
      <li>Never with the nasty smelling petro-fragrances and petro-preservatives called parabens—Great stuff, smell great, affordable, and worth every penny in toxicity exposure savings.</li>
      <li>The only other soap that I like as much is Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Geranium, which leaves the gentlemen visiting my bathroom feeling a bit too flowery.</li>

<li> don&#x27;t know if the tea tree oil in this product is killing any acne bacteria and therefore reducing facial breakouts, but I think it might be helping me a little in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I use this soap at all the sinks in my house.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been my go-to hand soap for about six years. It has a nice rich lather and rinses clean. Tea tree oil can smell pretty intense and not in a good way but with the peppermint it actually smells really yummy! I don&#x27;t know if the Tea tree oil is really killing any bacteria but I don&#x27;t care, I love this soap. The only other soap that I like as much is Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Geranium, which leaves the gentlemen visiting my bathroom feeling a bit too flowery. This soap has a smell that can be enjoyed equally by both girly-girls and manly men.</li>
    <li> Not harsh, smells nice, and washes off clean, yet gentle on hands.  I like this minty scent.    I can&#x27;t go back to supermarket brands anymore.  My hands have been spoiled.</li>
    <li> I was looking for natural soap in a refill size container. I really wanted shower soap (not hand) but purchased this product anyway. It is great for handwashing but not a very good scent for the shower.</li>
    <li> We use this to refill automatic soap dispensers in both the bathroom and the kitchen.  It doesn&#x27;t clog the dispensers and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great product - I have been using it for years.  The scent isn&#x27;t too strong - which is something I like, and it does a good job of washing your hands without drying them out.  Buying the refill size is a nice money saver.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and quality of this hand soap.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it cleans my hands without using harsh chemicals or fragrances. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave behind any soap residue nor dry out my hands. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is sensitive to chemicals and fragrances.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this soap. It&#x27;s appropriate for a any household location and is very tough on greasy hands. I like the packaging and LOVE the unisex scent. It is a little drying but I still gauge this as a top-tier product!</li>
    <li> I use to this hand soap to refill soap dispensers in the kitchen and the bathrooms.  The scent is a lively and minty, and it tingles nicely when washing our hands.  I don&#x27;t use hand-soaps labelled as antibacterial, or containing Triclosan, because I have read that they can increase the level of antibiotic resistance in bacterial species. I&#x27;ve also read that Triclosan may increase problems for those with immune hypersensitivity disorders such asthma and allergies.  If you read labels carefully, it&#x27;s alarming to find that Triclosan has been incorporated into all sorts of products beyond soap, such as mattresses, toothbrushes, kitchen cutting boards, even pencils etc. etc. etc.  Ugh....  Anyway, keeping it out the soap my kids and I use is easy enough, and this nicely scented soap makes our hands feel tingly clean.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product and the fact that its ingredients are organic. A little goes a long way. The only problem I have had is that the bottles leak during shipping, but Amazon was quick to offer a refund. They need to be shipped in a sealed plastic, tight package and alone, so as not to mess up your entire order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using this soap for the shower, I love it. It smells good and is high quality. I recommend it if you might have allergies as I do to many chemicals. It comes in several varieties but I picked peppermint because it&#x27;s my favorite. This is the refill size but I noticed that has snap-up lid on the cap. You could just keep buying this bottle if you didn&#x27;t mind having a 32 oz. bottle of liquid next to your sink or in the shower, etc.</li>
    <li> I was buying the regular size of this product in the grocery stores.  I heard that they sell the refill size and since the family liked it so much I bought it for better economy of scale.  Love it and so does my nose (smells fabulous).</li>
    <li> Great item for the price.  It does a good job with very little amount of the product needed to do the job.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and natural antibacterial qualities.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  It has a clean, refreshing fragrance that does not linger.  It has essential oils and not artificial  fragrance.  It does a great job in washing your hands.</li>
    <li> EO is one of the few companies that seems to be committed to nontoxic products. They also have an inexpensive line called Everyone. ...Never with the nasty smelling petro-fragrances and petro-preservatives called parabens—Great stuff, smell great, affordable, and worth every penny in toxicity exposure savings.</li>
    <li> Considering the expense of this soap, I&#x27;d like to see more natural ingredients and less chemicals like SLS. However, that being said the smell of this soap is extraordinary and I highly recommend it. The soap seems to be less drying and considering I live in a dry climate, that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> Seemed a little pricey but you don&#x27;t need but a drop at a time and it seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> These are the PROS about EO Peppermint and Tea Tree Oil Hand Soap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The wonderful holiday-type, refreshing scent… great addition to the Christmas season!&lt;br /&gt;2.  I like the idea of using essential oils for our personal care, and tea tree oil is great!&lt;br /&gt;3.  This is not drying to our skin, and my daughter with eczema has had not problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;4.  About the same cost as B&amp;BW and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it… it is great!</li>
    <li> I could go on and on about the benefits of this stuff. I good hooked on Tea Tree soap from another brand, but this is more available and a little less money.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  the smell, the price, the refill size to just squeeze into my dispenser AND it does get your hands clean!  Use it at home and office and is in our subscribe and save account we love it so much, as do guests/customers--we tell them to go to Amazon and get some!</li>
    <li> This smells so great and fresh. I&#x27;m using it at the kitchen sink for good. The peppermint smell is not overbearing or fake smelling.</li>
    <li> We are using it in our &amp;#34;foaming soap&amp;#34; containers so should last a long time as it only needs 10% of the regular soap to 90% water.  My kids love the scent and I do too!  We are all enjoying washing our hands;)</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a natural liquid hand soap for quite some time and discovered this one at a fancy B and B we stayed at for our honeymoon. A lot of people don&#x27;t realize that many soaps labeled \\&quot;anti-bacterial\\&quot; contain triclosan, most of which gets washed down the drain and back into the environment which is a bad thing (very bad depending on your point of view) and those soaps also generally feel harsh on my skin. Soap IS already anti-bacterial, so I just wanted less chemicals in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to have discovered EO soap. It smells great, is easy on skin (can wash many times a day and not dry out), you need to use less of it because it works so well, and it only contains friendly natural ingredients. We do the Amazon subscription thing for this item set for once every 6 months. It&#x27;s a worthwhile investment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for one day, so it&#x27;s probably not fair to give it a rating yet at all, BUT it smells so good and the one time I used it, it was a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am really writing this \\&quot;review\\&quot; is because I actually made an error when purchasing this from Amazon and now I&#x27;m inspired. The error was that this is not FOAMING hand soap. I have done this before with another brand and returned the product when I discovered the error. But alas, my standard foaming hand soap is out of stock and this product smells so great that I am planning to turn it into foaming hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up how to do this and it is quite simple. You need a foaming hand soap dispenser. You can either use an old one from product you already have, or you can buy a nice large (about 12 oz) glass foaming hand soap dispenser at one of those box stores that sells bath products. That is what I have. Make sure it&#x27;s a FOAMING dispenser. You put about 1 T of liquid soap in the dispenser and fill the rest with water. I used about 1.5 T because my dispenser is larger than the commercial store brands. Warm water works best. Put the lid on and shake it. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will come back and update the review when I have more experience, but this looks like an amazing way to get good product and save money as well.</li>
    <li> Enountered this while staying in someone&#x27;s home and was glad to see it available here in larger amount!  Takes me back to vacation everytime!</li>
    <li> Gets my gardener&#x27;s hands really clean.  I love the clean, fresh scent.  Not over-perfumed like many other hand soaps.  I use it in the kitchen as well as at the bathroom sinks.  I like the refillable size so that I can re-use pump bottles.  I love that it uses natural ingredients and is certified by the Non-GMO Project.  I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand soap by EO for over 2 yrs. now. It lasts long because you only need a little, and I love the mint scent the best. Fresh, clean smell, good for your skin and the environment! Amazon usually has the best price, and I buy the 2-pack which saves even more. The only issue I had with this last order, was that one of the bottles had leaked all over the other items in the box! The bottle has a press-to-open top, and it must have bumped against something in transit which opened the top. I have previously had them come shrink wrapped, which seems to work well, with no spills.</li>
    <li> I use this soap at all the sinks in my house.  It smells so good but not overpowering.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  Although pricey, it is thick enough that small amounts go a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap - I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not only suitable for hands - I use it as my daily face wash, and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the tea tree oil in this product is killing any acne bacteria and therefore reducing facial breakouts, but I think it might be helping me a little in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I wondered if my facial skin would do any better if I returned to using a liquid soap that was specifically branded as a \\&quot;face wash\\&quot;, so I tried several that were recommended by the customer reviewers on makeupalley, skinstore, sephora, and the like, as well as recommended by the skincare/cosmetics expert Paula Begoun on her beautypedia website.  None of them left my skin in as good a condition as this EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree hand soap, so I went back to using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty sensitive as well as breakout-prone, and is \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot; with an oily t-zone and \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cheeks (which become dry cheeks in the winter), but the EO Peppermint &amp; Tea Tree soap has not caused any adverse reactions to my skin.  It does not dry my skin out like many face washes do (even those that are marketed as being gentle on sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some organic soaps, this soap is quite sudsy, and one bottle lasts a long time (if you can get the hang of pressing down on the pump only partially, so just the amount you need comes out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Also, I love and regularly use a few varieties of the EO shower gels and bubble bath formulas (on my body skin only) -- for example, the Eucalyptus is lovely and warming in cooler weather, and the Tangerine Vanilla (I think it&#x27;s called) is nice in warmer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not have a favorable impression of their hand / body lotions, though (too oily and didn&#x27;t absorb well for me), and their peppermint sanitizing spray caused a rash on the backs of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, most stores only carry a few of the items/\\&quot;flavors\\&quot; made by EO, but their entire range of products is described on (and sold via) the manufacturer&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> This is one of those companies that touts itself as all natural, but they simply substituted phenoxyethanol for parabens as a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read about phenoxyethanol on the Enviornmental Working Group&#x27;s extremely helpful website, SkinDeep.org. There are a lot of companies who sucker customers (like me--I thought this soap was going to be all \\&quot;natural\\&quot;) by what they put on their label, but we have to be very careful, because a lot of them are still using UNSAFE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ ALL LABELS  CAREFULLY!! It is the only way to convey to these companies that WE ARE NOT STUPID, MINDLESS CONSUMERS.</li>
    <li> It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin as much as other soap. The scent is not too strong and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I got this with my new SIMPLEHUMAN sensor and it really smells good plus it leaves your hands feeling soft and clean without the soapy feeling.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very worth the price.</li>
    <li> Bought it before at health food store.  Now I order from Amazon.  Feel I am getting natural products while providing&lt;br /&gt;anti-bacterial properties as well.  Like the smell of the hand soap &amp; I don&#x27;t feel it drys my skin out, which I feel&lt;br /&gt;is a negative with so many hand soap products.  Also, the price is right, so will continue to buy EO&#x27;s Hand Soap&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon.</li>
