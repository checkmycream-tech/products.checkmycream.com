### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wish it would&#x27;ve came with an applicator puff or something, but this is a perfect powder for setting my BB cream and concealer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>This works excellent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned</li>
      <li>Very Good.</li>
      <li>Very nice pressed powder.</li>
      <li>Very nice pressed powder at a very nice price.</li>
      <li>There is quite a bit of powder that gets kicked up when I use it, but this is a really good value powder.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the shipping and the product itself.</li>
      <li>I did not break out and the price on this is just amazing.</li>
      <li>I have always liked this pressed powder for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear liquid foundation.  </li>
      <li>Keeps face from getting noticeably oily throughout the day with a nice shimmery glow that lasts.</li>
      <li>Liked how after application product gives a matte finish on skin.</li>
      <li>This compact came in great condition, exactly what I ordered!</li>
      <li>The pressed kind makes it really easy to control how much coverage I need, which is great for someone with combination dry/oily skin like me.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on more NYC products</li>
      <li>I love the Physicians</li>
      <li>Nothing works better for me</li>
      <li>Love this item</li>
      <li>Good quality and gentle on skin.</li>
      <li>This one made me look like Caspar the Friendly ghost so unless that&#x27;s a look you&#x27;re going for, I would day avoid this one.</li>
      <li>Very lihht on my face in love with it</li>
      <li>I love this so much.</li>
      <li>I put this on over mousse foundation and no one ever knows I&#x27;m wearing a full face of makeup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This powder gives a good flat look for those who don&#x27;t like a shiny face.  </li>
      <li>I use it both to set my concealer and as a quick mattifying touch up during the day.</li>
      <li>It goes a bit quickly  though.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say this is probably good for fair skinned people, dry or not, but maybe get a different shade if you&#x27;re a warmer gal like myself.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that if I&#x27;m wearing it over a medium or full coverage foundation that it does tend to look noticeable or slightly cakey over the top of it if you use a heavier hand, so just make sure that you tap off any excess powder and lightly dust it over your face.</li>
      <li>I am a caramel beige with warm undertones (yellow undertones)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still significantly more inexpensive than other brands, though, so despite the cheap packaging, the powder is completely worth it.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Took some time to get here, since I live in the Caribbean, but other than that, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I certainly hope the company didn&#x27;t stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very pale/fair skin</li>
      <li>Well, I have a light/medium complexion, and this was very ashy on me, and did not blend in well.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say much about the quality of this powder because the &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; is not translucent</li>
      <li>Leaves a fresh natural finish.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this and really like it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It used to come with a full round mirror in the lid, which was perfect for touch-ups on the go, and the larger round applicator was much easier to use and lasted longer.</li>
      <li>I bought this as just a basic translucent powder and overall I am pretty pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Translucent powder, my new fave!</li>
      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s pressed, because the loose kind tends to make a big mess whenever I try to use it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Since I mentioned it to my friends all of them have their own, especially since I&#x27;m starting to make beauty related videos and freelance from time to time.</li>
      <li>I just bought this today because it had decent reviews on other sites and it was pretty cheap and at my local CVS.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s usually really cheap in comparison to other brands.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; works well if you want your face to look its natural coloring.</li>
      <li>She is not a heavy sweater though.</li>
      <li>Though after several hours, it does cake up, but that&#x27;s because I apply it throughout the day to get rid of shiny spots because I have really oily skin.</li>
      <li>I have begun to use it a little more regularly to set the areas where I put my concealer, and it sets my makeup nicely as long as I don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>With most other brands, their lightest color is not light at all</li>
      <li>Every other brand I have tried (Revlon, Cover Girl, Maybelline, you name it) ends up making me look yellow or tan, but this is a true pale powder that enhances ivory skin.</li>

    <li> This compact came in great condition, exactly what I ordered! Took some time to get here, since I live in the Caribbean, but other than that, I am very satisfied with my purchase. And I was a bit skeptical about whether or not the powder would have a grey cast on my face (even though it is translucent, as I&#x27;m dark-skinned, i thought it wouldn&#x27;t blend) but it blends so well! Translucent powder, my new fave!</li>
    <li> Very Good. Recomended!!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very lihht on my face in love with it</li>
    <li> I have been using this same type of powder for almost the last ten years. Nothing works better for me and it&#x27;s usually really cheap in comparison to other brands. I have very pale/fair skin and I like to keep it that way. Every other brand I have tried (Revlon, Cover Girl, Maybelline, you name it) ends up making me look yellow or tan, but this is a true pale powder that enhances ivory skin. I put this on over mousse foundation and no one ever knows I&#x27;m wearing a full face of makeup. I also love that it&#x27;s pressed, because the loose kind tends to make a big mess whenever I try to use it. The pressed kind makes it really easy to control how much coverage I need, which is great for someone with combination dry/oily skin like me. My only complaint is that NYC has changed the design of the packaging to include a half-moon applicator sponge and a half mirror. It used to come with a full round mirror in the lid, which was perfect for touch-ups on the go, and the larger round applicator was much easier to use and lasted longer. It&#x27;s still significantly more inexpensive than other brands, though, so despite the cheap packaging, the powder is completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this pressed powder for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear liquid foundation.  But I can&#x27;t find it in the store any longer so I looked on Amazon. I certainly hope the company didn&#x27;t stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder gives a good flat look for those who don&#x27;t like a shiny face.  I have combination skin and have not had any problems with this company&#x27;s makeup or breakouts, rashes or dry flakiness because of it.  The &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; works well if you want your face to look its natural coloring. At least it did for me and I have difficult to match skin that is olive toned.</li>
    <li> NYC makeup is getting hard to find in stores. Love this item</li>
    <li> If you have really pale skin, I found that the translucent is the only color that does not make your face look a lot darker than your neck/ rest of your body. It&#x27;s great! Though after several hours, it does cake up, but that&#x27;s because I apply it throughout the day to get rid of shiny spots because I have really oily skin.I apply it over porcelain Avon foundation, and it works well. With most other brands, their lightest color is not light at all and it makes your face look orange, if you do have pale skin that is! So I do recommend this!</li>
    <li> Wish it would&#x27;ve came with an applicator puff or something, but this is a perfect powder for setting my BB cream and concealer. 😊</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenager daughter who is prone to shine. This replaced the ELF powder that did not work well for her. This works excellent it sets her makeup as well. She can run a few miles and have no issues with shine. She is not a heavy sweater though. She does have oily skin and only reapplies midday.</li>
    <li> Liked how after application product gives a matte finish on skin. Also lasts for quite a while and does not diminish with perspiration.</li>
    <li> I bought this as just a basic translucent powder and overall I am pretty pleased with it. I have noticed that if I&#x27;m wearing it over a medium or full coverage foundation that it does tend to look noticeable or slightly cakey over the top of it if you use a heavier hand, so just make sure that you tap off any excess powder and lightly dust it over your face. I have begun to use it a little more regularly to set the areas where I put my concealer, and it sets my makeup nicely as long as I don&#x27;t use too much. I would likely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> Good quality and gentle on skin.</li>
    <li> I love this so much. I actually use this to set my under eye concealer and a little goes a long way. I am caramel colored and it does not leave that nasty caked on white look that many translucent powders leave. Sometimes I don&#x27;t Even put on concealer, I just put a little under my eyes over my foundation and it instantly looks brightened, but in a natural way. I did not break out and the price on this is just amazing. Since I mentioned it to my friends all of them have their own, especially since I&#x27;m starting to make beauty related videos and freelance from time to time. I would suggest this to my younger clients since they always ask for my opinion. Can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on more NYC products</li>
    <li> Very nice pressed powder at a very nice price. I often use expensive brands. I decided to try this and really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Covers enough, but is translucent. Leaves a fresh natural finish.  It goes a bit quickly  though. It&#x27;s a thin compact.</li>
    <li> I just bought this today because it had decent reviews on other sites and it was pretty cheap and at my local CVS. I like how it worked on my t-zone and my cheeks, but anywhere on your face that is prone to dryness will look cakey and white. On my chin where I&#x27;m usually dry, you could it was clumped up a bit on the dry spots, and my nose, which was also dry, was all white on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this is probably good for fair skinned people, dry or not, but maybe get a different shade if you&#x27;re a warmer gal like myself.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say much about the quality of this powder because the &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; is not translucent so I can&#x27;t wear it. It&#x27;s very white. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of powders labeled as translucent, and you couldn&#x27;t see any color on my face, which is the point. This one made me look like Caspar the Friendly ghost so unless that&#x27;s a look you&#x27;re going for, I would day avoid this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this due to reviews I read on here that this compact powder had worked for darker skinned gals.  Well, I have a light/medium complexion, and this was very ashy on me, and did not blend in well.  I love the Physicians Formula CoverToxTen 50 compact powder.  I will not purchase this one again.  I gave it 2 stars because I think this would work on other gals.</li>
    <li> Very nice pressed powder. I use it both to set my concealer and as a quick mattifying touch up during the day. There is quite a bit of powder that gets kicked up when I use it, but this is a really good value powder.</li>
    <li> This product does the trick! I was very pleased with the shipping and the product itself. Highly recommended. Keeps face from getting noticeably oily throughout the day with a nice shimmery glow that lasts.</li>
    <li> I have t-combition skin, oily nose forehead,chin and dry cheeks, This powder helped to set my foundation and the translucent color help ,  . I am a olive tone skintone woman and don&#x27;t looked chalky with this product. I am a caramel beige with warm undertones (yellow undertones)</li>
