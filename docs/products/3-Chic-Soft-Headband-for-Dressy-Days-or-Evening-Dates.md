      <li>Love these headbands.</li>
      <li>these headbands fit very comfortably and don&#x27;t slide around.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>Granted this is only on one of them so far, but it was the one I liked the best and wore the most.</li>

      <li>I bought them for my daughter and I will have to sew them to make them fit as they are huge.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a good thing that I have a sewing machine and will try to sew it back.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the more I wear the other two, the more they&#x27;ll get destroyed as well.</li>
      <li>Gave these as a gift and they were very appreciated.</li>
      <li>The first time I wore one, it broke.  </li>
      <li>As a result, each of the three headbands lasted almost exactly two days each before falling apart at where it was glued together.</li>
      <li>These headbands are really large.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have a large head and these are gigantic.</li>
      <li>My Niece (age 7) really likes them.</li>
      <li>I expected better quality given the pice I paid for this</li>
      <li>and my 4C hair maybe too much for the headbands.</li>
      <li>The threads started pulling causing the head band to bunch up, I snipped the threads and tried to smooth everything out - but it still looks messy.</li>
      <li>The very major downside is that the construction is so below expectation.</li>
      <li>The are quality made and arrived on time, and I have absolutely no regrets buying these at all!</li>

<li> They are a little to loose, but i like them</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> These bands are for women with small heads and less coarser hair.</li>
<li> However, in just two months (over a small fro), the ends holding the ends to the lace as pulling apart.</li>
<li> My Afro is small</li>
<li> Unfortunately, my head.....</li>
<li> The lace design on the headband and can go with almost anything for office attire and formal casual.</li>
<li> They can be worn with dressier items, but also casual.</li>
<li> Really disappointing.</li>
<li> Horribly disappointed...</li>
<li> Very bad craftsmanship on these headbands resulted in them falling apart after two uses.  </li>

    <li> the part that goes on top of your head is just too wide...for me</li>

    <li> Very Happy with Se;;er and Product</li>
    <li> Slips on my hair, but it&#x27;s very pretty otherwise and well made</li>
    <li> These headbands are really large. I feel like I have a large head and these are gigantic. I bought them for my daughter and I will have to sew them to make them fit as they are huge.</li>
    <li> The lace design on the headband and can go with almost anything for office attire and formal casual. However, in just two months (over a small fro), the ends holding the ends to the lace as pulling apart. The ends are attached with a glue and no threading for an extra hold. I wore the white one once and the brown twice and the ends need to be repaired. Adding threading to hold.</li>
    <li> I put on one of these headbands and it came unglued and fell into my lap maybe 30 minutes later. These are made very cheaply. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> They are a little to loose, but i like them</li>
    <li> These headbands are very much handmade and could be easily made with some elastic and ribbon. I am going to use them as a pattern to make my own.</li>

    <li> Love these headbands. Only glitch is that it does come apart. I had to sew mine in place. Otherwise excellent for wearing for any occasion</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and I use the black and copper colored ones all the time. I have a tiny little head so they are slightly big on me, but that&#x27;s not usual for me. The are quality made and arrived on time, and I have absolutely no regrets buying these at all!</li>
    <li> The first time I wore one, it broke.  It&#x27;s a good thing that I have a sewing machine and will try to sew it back.  The elastic in the back shoiuld be sewed to the material and not pasted.</li>
    <li> Horribly disappointed... I tried each one  and they broke after only being on my head for 20 minutes. The white lace one lasted longer, but overall, this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sister and I, these look great with any color hair, but they really pop with red and auburn hair. these headbands fit very comfortably and don&#x27;t slide around.&lt;br /&gt;A worthwhile purchase!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fairly flimsy. The threads started pulling causing the head band to bunch up, I snipped the threads and tried to smooth everything out - but it still looks messy. Then after dealing with that, the glue holding the head band to the elastic broke and I had to sew it back together. Granted this is only on one of them so far, but it was the one I liked the best and wore the most. I&#x27;m guessing that the more I wear the other two, the more they&#x27;ll get destroyed as well.</li>
    <li> love these!  They fit great for me!</li>
    <li> These are very pretty and fun to wear</li>
    <li> These headbands are really nice looking, which is a plus. The very major downside is that the construction is so below expectation. The elastic bands are glued together, instead of being sewn. As a result, each of the three headbands lasted almost exactly two days each before falling apart at where it was glued together. Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> Cute but the second time I tried to wear the white the elastic snapped and broke.</li>
    <li> Very bad craftsmanship on these headbands resulted in them falling apart after two uses.  The material is hot-glued into the elastic part instead being sewn in.</li>
    <li> Love the look of the headbands.They are beautiful.  Unfortunately, my head..... and my 4C hair maybe too much for the headbands. One of them just popped while I was wearing it and I just bought the pack. My Afro is small so I am not sure how much longer I can wear the others without them meeting the same fate. I do not trust their durability so I often carry and an extra headband with me. These bands are for women with small heads and less coarser hair.</li>
    <li> I thought these were too pretty to be functional, but I was wrong. I was very happy with this purchase, it was a good gift for my friend.</li>
    <li> the lace one breaks easily but the other two are great stay in head do not slip!  ware to work</li>
    <li> Cheaply constructed. It arrived damaged. I expected better quality given the pice I paid for this</li>
    <li> I am in the midst of growing my hair out and these are nicely printed and good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> They can be worn with dressier items, but also casual. They go with most of my outfits and stay in place.</li>
