      <li>I travel a decent amount for work and bought these bottle to use instead of buying travel products on an ongoing basis - I can use my favorite products and reduce my costs!  </li>
      <li>At first it was okay.</li>
      <li>These were super cheap and work alright.</li>
      <li>Great item just as expected</li>
      <li>I only had 1 leak on my journey and it was because I didn&#x27;t secure the top good enough.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m looking for more substantial bottles that will stand the rigors of my frequent traveling.</li>
      <li>Very easy to fill or empty and clean and reuse.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are on the soft side and easy to squeeze.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too easy to leave them slightly open and then have them \\&quot;leak,\\&quot; and they don&#x27;t function nearly as well as bottles made of softer, more flexible plastic.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>These plastic bottles are exactly as they are described.</li>
      <li>Bag seems pretty sturdy.  </li>
      <li>exactly TSA regulation.</li>
      <li>I love the different colors.  </li>
      <li>I thought that the top would be different.</li>
      <li>Lids seem to be pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>I double bag with Zip Lock to be safe anyway.</li>
      <li>They are a really nice size for shampoo/conditioner, as well as mouthwash and other toiletries.  </li>
      <li>My first set is a couple of years old and are still working fine, even with everyday use, so I have purchased an extra set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding others who aren&#x27;t happy with the size, the TSA website does specify 3.4 oz.</li>
      <li>though I&#x27;ve only dropped them a couple times, and haven&#x27;t tossed them around in a bag or taken them into a low-pressure environment like an airplane at altitude), but the bottle&#x27;s contents easily fill up the inside of the cap.</li>
      <li>These shipped really fast as I needed them fast.</li>
      <li>thank-you for your fast service</li>
      <li>I suppose a year is a reasonable expectation for something this inexpensive, but they&#x27;re going into the recycling bin</li>
      <li>I always take it when hiking - very convenient.</li>
      <li>Nice packaging, color coded, bought for travel to carry various personal cremes etc.</li>
      <li>Second they were in clear bottles for easy inspection.</li>
      <li>For comparison, two bottles from older sets did not leak.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because the designer COULD have chosen to add a small amount of plastic in the mold to more forcibly keep the lever closed - with a snap.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I wish the plastic was a little more flexible, so it is easier to squeeze the liquids out of.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave review</li>
      <li>did the squeeze test, and they do pp right open, but, I them took some scotch tape and</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because I live in Denver &amp; go from sea-level to altitude, but I&#x27;ve permanently got shampoo all over my zip-lock bags...</li>
      <li>The bottles are a little on the cheap side, which is why I didn&#x27;t give five stars.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll go with the soft bottles.</li>
      <li>I was about to leave on a Jetplane, not knowing when Ill be back again- honest...</li>
      <li>/&gt;After first misadventure in luggage, I now carry them unto plane (so no crushing), double-bagged (no leaks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They went through international security with no problems and the soft plastic seems like it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Personally, if you travel, you know you need to pack anything like this tight, otherwise, you have a huge mess-</li>

<li> /&gt;Regarding leaking, I&#x27;ve had a couple of leaks due to overfilling and placement, but not enough to make me stop using them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am glad I ordered the bottles, even though I was hesitative initially because of other&#x27;s comment on it is little hard to squeeze the bottle. The bottles are on the soft side and easy to squeeze. Plus the volume is sufficient to hold enough shampoo/conditioner/shower gel for a week trip. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> One leaked on my flight from Dulles to Heathrow and two leaked on the return trip. For comparison, two bottles from older sets did not leak.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these when we camp or travel. They are a really nice size for shampoo/conditioner, as well as mouthwash and other toiletries.  There&#x27;s room enough for us to travel 3 or 4 days.  Very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I received these bottles and was disappointed at their quality. I know they are travel items but they are so think and brittle that I fear my product in them will end up all over my suitcase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too easy to leave them slightly open and then have them \\&quot;leak,\\&quot; and they don&#x27;t function nearly as well as bottles made of softer, more flexible plastic.  I&#x27;m replacing them.</li>
    <li> The soft&#x27;n Style Travel Bottle is perfect for my DIY hair setting lotion.</li>
    <li> These shipped really fast as I needed them fast. They went through international security with no problems and the soft plastic seems like it will last a long time. The plastic zipper bag container is nice too in case one leaks which they did not.</li>
    <li> I have not used these travel bottles yet, but they seem like they will do the trick. I like that they are larger bottles and not those tiny ones.</li>
    <li> Great item just as expected</li>
    <li> The bottles are a little on the cheap side, which is why I didn&#x27;t give five stars. But, they don&#x27;t leak (as of yet) and they do a good job of holding my stuff, so they serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Very poor product, plan on having them doused in shampoo, face wash, or whatever you fill them with when you unpack them from your bag.</li>
    <li> overjoyed exceded my expectations great for short trips and airport safe have bougt more for my family thank-you for your fast service</li>
    <li> These plastic bottles are exactly as they are described. They are exactly what I was looking for. I love them.</li>
    <li> These bottles serves its purpose for what I need it for. Holds shampoo, lotion and body wash very good. Fit perfectly in my travel case.</li>
    <li> I have used these to transport my face care regimen (soap &amp; lotion) and always seem to wind up with leaks of the product in my bag (especially with the soap). Otherwise, they are okay for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the sized of the bottles but when I put cologne in one it leaked out. It should be used for thick&lt;br /&gt;lotions or shampoos</li>
    <li> I wanted these just to put my hair oils in. I&#x27;m not traveling with them, it&#x27;s just home use and I&#x27;m continually having to wipe up oil from under them.</li>
    <li> I used these bottles for shampoo, conditioner, and bath soap while I was on my vacation to Italy. They were fantastic! First of all for their size, they were perfect. Second they were in clear bottles for easy inspection. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Color coded, plenty of product, fits in a zip lock bag for travel screening at the airport.  I love traveling light!</li>
    <li> They leak. They are light weight, but the plastic is so thin that it sometimes creases when squeezed.</li>
    <li> I wanted some of these small bottles to put stuff in for my gym gag.  No leaks, and the different colors help you know what you put into them.  Happy shampooer here...</li>
    <li> Nice packaging, color coded, bought for travel to carry various personal cremes etc. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but looks leak proof.</li>
    <li> I travel a decent amount for work and bought these bottle to use instead of buying travel products on an ongoing basis - I can use my favorite products and reduce my costs!  Good quality!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling. Lids seem to be pretty sturdy. I only had 1 leak on my journey and it was because I didn&#x27;t secure the top good enough. Totally recommend these.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perfect for traveling!  They don&#x27;t spill!</li>
    <li> great deal I will be back to order more from this seller&lt;br /&gt;I use this item to make homemade facial tonic&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;this is the best price I have come across&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and its 3.4 oz which is allowed for travel!!</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these. My first set is a couple of years old and are still working fine, even with everyday use, so I have purchased an extra set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding others who aren&#x27;t happy with the size, the TSA website does specify 3.4 oz. is acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding leaking, I&#x27;ve had a couple of leaks due to overfilling and placement, but not enough to make me stop using them. I double bag with Zip Lock to be safe anyway.No worries.</li>
    <li> I like this set. It is not big and not too small. I always take it when hiking - very convenient.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, after using these bottles on a recent trip, all of the bottles leaked their contents.  Fortunately, I had each of them inside a ziplock baggie, so no damage done.  But they went in the trash can upon my return home.  They were garbage.  I hope others had a better experience, but I can&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling - one for cream/lotion, shampoo, conditioner, and/or rinse or toothpaste, or keep one as a spare. Very easy to fill or empty and clean and reuse.  Giving a four only because one became brittle.  Still using the other ones.</li>
    <li> Love the size and the colors! exactly TSA regulation. Bag seems pretty sturdy.  Only issue I have with the bottles are that they are a bit stiff. I wish the plastic was a little more flexible, so it is easier to squeeze the liquids out of.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect travel size. It is a great idea even if you purchase a large quality of liquid products and to downsize.  I love the different colors.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I got these because I needed something I could take through TSA. These were super cheap and work alright. They are the perfect size for TSA requirements. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that sometimes the lids seem to pop themselves open. Although it doesn&#x27;t happen too often.</li>
    <li> I travel often for work and purchased these thinking they would be a good way to bring my bathroom liquids, but had them thrown away by TSA</li>
    <li> Lever opening leaks - doesn&#x27;t stay fully closed. I suppose a year is a reasonable expectation for something this inexpensive, but they&#x27;re going into the recycling bin and I&#x27;m looking for more substantial bottles that will stand the rigors of my frequent traveling. My year includes about 28 trips, though, so if you travel much less frequently - they might last proportionately longer. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because the designer COULD have chosen to add a small amount of plastic in the mold to more forcibly keep the lever closed - with a snap. But they opted for the easier open design and so it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I was about to leave on a Jetplane, not knowing when Ill be back again- honest... USA to India... I noticed some people comments on the popping open of the lids etc.  Personally, if you travel, you know you need to pack anything like this tight, otherwise, you have a huge mess- so, if you didnt think to squeeze them to see how leak proof they are, come one now, one star?&lt;br /&gt;I did the squeeze test, and they do pp right open, but, I them took some scotch tape and just one strip secured the top to the sides.  No issues at all after that. So, after you buy this, get some scotch (generic brand) tape and you should be good. They made it 17 hrs in the air, and through Indira Gandhi Airport security and customs OK...</li>
    <li> These work well for me, I don&#x27;t have an issue with them. I was disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t a flip top cap, but a part of it is raised and product comes out. That didn&#x27;t work with my intention of how I wanted to use it, but that&#x27;s my own negligence and not fault of the product itself. You can see if you look closely at the picture, though there is no textual indication how it dispenses.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use in my small shower. I wanted to put shampoo and Dr. Bronners liquid soap in them, and they work well in that use. Unfortunately, the caps are not sealed internally. They haven&#x27;t leaked anything outside (though I&#x27;ve only dropped them a couple times, and haven&#x27;t tossed them around in a bag or taken them into a low-pressure environment like an airplane at altitude), but the bottle&#x27;s contents easily fill up the inside of the cap. Not a big deal on the shampoo, but as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap dries, it forms a solid soap! If I use bar soap for a few days and neglect the Bronners, I have to clear out the hardened soap from the cap so it&#x27;ll flow again.</li>
    <li> These are great for two people.  Strong plastic, easy to clean when you&#x27;re done.  Bag actually prevents leaks on inside from leaking out of bag. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Breezed right thru TSA checkpoints with these, also good quality bottles.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave review but I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. I took the bottles on one trip and they fell apart.</li>
    <li> Nice size travel bottles with pop tops.</li>
    <li> Pass. Leaks if they aren&#x27;t standing up (which defeats the purpose of buying travel bottles).</li>
    <li> Fantastic buy!! Great item, very durable, works well, and perfect for traveling. Definitely a must-have, well with the money. I swim a lot and use this for it, works exteremy well. Excellent buy!!!</li>
    <li> Did it&#x27;s job and were perfect size. The bag they came in ripped easily and that was upsetting but for the price these were perfect.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re screw of caps, so they weren&#x27;t what I was expecting.....</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t leak, the labels I made on my label maker stayed on--good value.</li>
    <li> these travel bottles *always* leak.  when shopping for a travel bottle it needs to meet two criteria, #1 smaller size (which this is) and no leakage (which this does not accomplish) so these bottles are pretty worthless unless you want to double an triple bag them and then be prepared to wash and clean out the bags from shampoo/lotion/etc upon arrival at your destination.</li>
    <li> These bottles leak all over when you fly a lot... Maybe that&#x27;s because I live in Denver &amp; go from sea-level to altitude, but I&#x27;ve permanently got shampoo all over my zip-lock bags... Going back to the drawing board for a non-leaky container.  Don&#x27;t buy if it&#x27;s for flights.</li>
    <li> The bottles served their purpose but weren&#x27;t the greatest.  One of them leaked and made a mess of everything else in the plastic bag.  But, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> as a massage therapist i use these for holding different types of oils for my clients, and the colors are just a bonus</li>
    <li> Well, the product came on time. The packaging was good. I did not like the top of the bottle. I thought that the top would be different.</li>
    <li> i thought this was a flip top container, guess i should have paid a bit more attention to description but services it purpose.</li>
    <li> I have to use unscented oil and brought it to a massage therapist in this bottle and she wanted one (I gave it to her). So inexpensive. It has a flip top, which another massage therapist didn&#x27;t like. So you should know that. But they are sturdy to me and I love the colors.</li>
    <li> Bottle are not soft, just plain travel bottles like you would find in any dollar store. Next time I&#x27;ll go with the soft bottles.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and cheaper than the chain stores. They are also made of a better quality plastic than I have used before.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect travel size set and works for the various liquids I need stored!  The lid seals well (no leaks).  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> At first it was okay. But then one cracked and another one was leaking from the top.</li>
    <li> Over priced for these. Made cheap. Should be .99 cents</li>
    <li> Seal on these is not the greatest, erring on side of convenience, versus leak-proof design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first misadventure in luggage, I now carry them unto plane (so no crushing), double-bagged (no leaks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are a snick over-sized (if filled to brim, closer to 4 oz.) so a vigilant TSA inspector is within regulations to toss them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you allow air-space (do not fill to top), you can successfully argue that you have 3oz. or less :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion for designers: For next re-design, drop size down, and concentrate on improving the cap to minimize leaks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low cost helped boost star count...</li>
    <li> These bottles look good and are easy to fill and squeeze out of. However, all four leaked the first time I attempted to travel with any of them, which makes them pretty useless. They can&#x27;t be turned on their sides at all.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds the 3 oz limit on traveling.  I can&#x27;t use them.  My fault for not noticing the 3.4 oz size in the description.</li>
    <li> I use these to carry my homeade DIY beauty products, then the other two I am not using I have saved for travel. I don&#x27;t have a problem like others where they won&#x27;t close and they don&#x27;t leak. They are not the world&#x27;s greatest bottles but they do exactly what they are supposed to do and at a really small price.</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for -- as described.</li>
