      <li>Lemongrass is a favorite scent of mine.</li>
      <li>My students love the smell.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I like the way Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s clean day counter top spray smells, but don&#x27;t like the price, so I found a pin on pinterest that shows how to make your own</li>
      <li>Great bug repellant, but it is very strong so only use a drop.</li>
      <li>I can still smell the strong lemongrass odor when I pick up the bottle</li>
      <li>Was wondering what the great smell was next to me in Yoga.  </li>
      <li>I also make a light air freshener by using about 1/4 cup distilled water, 6 drops of lemongrass &amp; 10 drops of [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>

      <li>Smells so good and allows me to clean my house naturally</li>
      <li>B009Q9PBW8 Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Room Freshener Lemon Verbena -- 8 fl oz,pack of 2]] for this).  </li>
      <li>It has a clean scent.  </li>
      <li>There are several great books on aromatherapy available here that can teach you more about the uses of essential oils.  </li>
      <li>My friend is a loyal doTerra customer, and we swapped one day.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
      <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
      <li>The box it was in was huge for this tiny bottle of essential oil--I am sure bouncing around in the box helped with the leaking bottle, but it was also not sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s return policy is: For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>Seems to be worth the money.</li>
      <li>Lemongrass is so fresh.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased a few more oils from this company since this and love them all</li>
      <li>Very reasonable price for this.  </li>
      <li>Lemongrass is a great \\&quot;reviver;\\&quot; if you find your mind a little lagging (or tired) during a taxing project, a whiff or two of lemongrass is a great, peaceful, \\&quot;waker-upper.\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>Hey, when you need something to smell crisp and lemony, this is your go, go, go, go to stuff.</li>
      <li>I LOVE is lemongrass essential oil by Aura Cacia!  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite uses is a very simple one:  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of Aura Cacia&#x27;s Essential Oils &amp; this is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite smells for personal use and for use in my homemade household cleaners too!</li>
      <li>It will be good to use a few drops in a potpourri mix, though, and that is where it will eventually be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells vibrant and fresh.</li>
      <li>I truly like real lemongrass in Thai food</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.  </li>
      <li>Have since purchased several bottles of my own, one to keep in the bag with my yoga mat and several for the house.  </li>
      <li>I just recently became familiar with aura cacia oils.</li>
      <li>It makes it much harder for me to open and really doesn&#x27;t seal effectively.  </li>
      <li>But you know when you purchase a cheap brand or get a&lt;br /&gt;hold of some low quality oil how you pretty much know it soon as you open the top and inhale that first time or at the very least at the first burn or diffusion.</li>
      <li>I ordered a bunch for my home and for my classroom of high school boys.  </li>
      <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!</li>
      <li>This Essential Oil smells exactly how I imagined it would be.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and occasionally dab a little on my hair and clothes.  </li>
      <li>Clear fragrance, not too overpowering</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it I really don&#x27;t care for it as a frangrance.  </li>
      <li>you only need 1-2 drops and the whole room will smell like lemon.</li>
      <li>Scents are a vital part of our primitive selves and science is showing just how impactful the mind/body connection can be.  </li>
      <li>No fault of this product, but that is my personal feeling about this particular oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You owe it to yourself to learn a little about these powerful substances.    </li>
      <li>/&gt;The &amp;#34;childproof&amp;#34; cap is somewhat loose and part of the oil leaked out in transit, which is no great loss since it turned out to be not among my favorite essences.  </li>
      <li>Scent seems like a luxury, but there are few pleasures that cost so little, do no harm, and are calorie free.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the smell of lemongrass. This is a brand I trust.</li>
    <li> Great value, will work perfectly for all of my aromatherapy needs.</li>
    <li> Clear fragrance, not too overpowering</li>
    <li> I got a bottle for my friend as a gift and one for me.  She was delighted and uses it in a diffuser while teaching yoga.  I love the scent and occasionally dab a little on my hair and clothes.  I&#x27;ve received compliments from others for it&#x27;s wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with any of the Aura Cacia essential oils to date.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  It has a clean scent.  Great for cleaning and insect repelling.</li>
    <li> Fruit flys hate it. Great bug repellant, but it is very strong so only use a drop.</li>
    <li> I think this is going to be a good one. Only used it yesterday. But you know when you purchase a cheap brand or get a&lt;br /&gt;hold of some low quality oil how you pretty much know it soon as you open the top and inhale that first time or at the very least at the first burn or diffusion. This has passed both occurrences. Smells great. Just like Lemongrass:) Will buy again.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite smells for personal use and for use in my homemade household cleaners too!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the oil and I use it mostly at night to give comfort to achy knees and my cold feet to help me fall asleep.</li>
    <li> By using Lemongrass oil, my Triglycerides dropped 70 points in 3 months.  I am unable to take any cholesterol medication due to allergies and that is when I decided to try the Lemongrass oil that a friend told me about.  It actually improved my kidney function also.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My friend is a loyal doTerra customer, and we swapped one day. She could not tell a difference, and the price is so much better! Smells fantastic and works like a charm! I want to add that I am not dissing doTerra- this brand happens to work just as well for me (and my friend).</li>
    <li> This oil has a strongly concentrated true lemongrass smell. If that were the only criteria it would get 5 stars.  I truly like real lemongrass in Thai food and this definitely has that odor - in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because it I really don&#x27;t care for it as a frangrance.  I prefer a &amp;#34;tree lemon&amp;#34; odor which I feel is lighter and fresher.  No fault of this product, but that is my personal feeling about this particular oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the oil intending to use it in homemade body butter (thick moisturizer cream) but it will not work for me for that purpose.  It will be good to use a few drops in a potpourri mix, though, and that is where it will eventually be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;childproof&amp;#34; cap is somewhat loose and part of the oil leaked out in transit, which is no great loss since it turned out to be not among my favorite essences.  I see no reason for putting this type of cap on an essential oil bottle. It makes it much harder for me to open and really doesn&#x27;t seal effectively.  I can still smell the strong lemongrass odor when I pick up the bottle so it is quite possible that the cap is defective.</li>
    <li> Love this brand, the oil is amazing! Definetely recommend it!</li>
    <li> It smells great. I have not made anything yet with it. I plan on using it for my bug spray. Seems to be worth the money. I would buy again...</li>
    <li> I LOVE is lemongrass essential oil by Aura Cacia!  I love the way it smells and love the longevity of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great as a moisturizer and also great as a cleaning solution.  I have also put it in a diffuser and it smelt wonderful!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bunch for my home and for my classroom of high school boys.  My students love the smell.</li>
    <li> Hey, when you need something to smell crisp and lemony, this is your go, go, go, go to stuff. Period.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. For all the beekeepers buying, I lured a swarm in with this.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and allows me to clean my house naturally and it smell so nice.</li>
    <li> Smell is amazing, sweet &amp; lemony, very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Was wondering what the great smell was next to me in Yoga.  The woman next to me had a little bottle of this and graciously offered to let me put a few drops on the front of my yoga mat.  Have since purchased several bottles of my own, one to keep in the bag with my yoga mat and several for the house.  The scent is truly uplifting but calming.  I rotate this with my other two current favorites (Chill Pill and Grapefruit) in my diffuser.  I have also mixed with water in a spray bottle.  I spray my sitting cushion and throw. Very reasonable price for this.  Scent seems like a luxury, but there are few pleasures that cost so little, do no harm, and are calorie free.</li>
    <li> The essential oil was not sealed and leaked into the box. The box it was in was huge for this tiny bottle of essential oil--I am sure bouncing around in the box helped with the leaking bottle, but it was also not sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s return policy is: For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE! If you purchase this item and it is shipped as the bottle I received was shipped, it will leak and you cannot return it</li>
    <li> Smells vibrant and fresh. This oil is VERY strong though, I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; you only need 1-2 drops and the whole room will smell like lemon.</li>
    <li> Great quality oil! I have purchased a few more oils from this company since this and love them all</li>
    <li> Not my favorite scent</li>
    <li> Lemongrass is so fresh.  Great.</li>
    <li> I just recently became familiar with aura cacia oils.I decided to check out a small organic food store where i live and came across them there.I purchased the geranium oil and loved it.Its extremely potent smelling, so i decided to look up aura cacia oils here on amazon to compare prices, being that im already happy with the quality of Aura Cacia.I ordered this lemon grass oil for what i feel is an excellent price, and as i expected im very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.  I should have ordered the lemon instead.  Also, the bottle was leaky and there was oil all over it.</li>
    <li> Use it sparingly, it&#x27;s very strong</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Long lasting oil. Smells great!</li>
    <li> This smells so good! I use it in cleaning and it uplifts my mood just by smelling it. Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works for what I needed.  Arrived quickly and packed well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like the way Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s clean day counter top spray smells, but don&#x27;t like the price, so I found a pin on pinterest that shows how to make your own and you put this oil in it. It smells fantastic. I put some in my wax burner and the whole house smells awesome. There&#x27;s lots you can do with this oil!</li>
    <li> Lemongrass is a favorite scent of mine. This Essential Oil smells exactly how I imagined it would be. The price is reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of Aura Cacia&#x27;s Essential Oils &amp; this is one of my favorites. Lemongrass is a great \\&quot;reviver;\\&quot; if you find your mind a little lagging (or tired) during a taxing project, a whiff or two of lemongrass is a great, peaceful, \\&quot;waker-upper.\\&quot;    There are several great books on aromatherapy available here that can teach you more about the uses of essential oils.  And no, this isn&#x27;t just a form of \\&quot;woo woo\\&quot; medicine; scientific studies are proving the connection between brain activity and essential oils interacting via the limbic system.  Scents are a vital part of our primitive selves and science is showing just how impactful the mind/body connection can be.  You owe it to yourself to learn a little about these powerful substances.    One of my favorite uses is a very simple one:  tear a cotton ball in two, add about 4 drops of essential oil, lay it in front of your vacuum cleaner &amp; \\&quot;vaccum it up.\\&quot;  You&#x27;ll have the pleasant scent of lemongrass wafting through the room in no time &amp; it makes vaccuuming the floor much more pleasant.    I also make a light air freshener by using about 1/4 cup distilled water, 6 drops of lemongrass &amp; 10 drops of [[ASIN:B0002JIU0Q Aura Cacia Essential Oil, Uplifting Bergamot, 0.5 fluid ounce]] bergamot in a small spray bottle (I repurpose an empty, cleaned, Mrs. Meyers air freshener bottle [[ASIN:B009Q9PBW8 Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Clean Day Room Freshener Lemon Verbena -- 8 fl oz,pack of 2]] for this).  Shake well &amp; about 2 sprays give a wonderful, light fragrance to a room.  Works great &amp; the quality of Aura Cacia oils has, in my experience, proven to be excellent.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality I have ever purchased.  I use it for soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought oils from this company as long as I can remember and have never been unhappy.  The quality is very good and long-lasting.  I use them for aromatherapy and balms.</li>
