    <li> I really love the sent of this new cologne:  spicy but fresh...like a cross between Armani Aqua di Gio and Obsession for Men.  I would give it five stars based on the scent alone but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Even so, it is relatively inexpensive and a great smell.  Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> Wonderful product. I don&#x27;t know who made it. To me it&#x27;s not a top name cologne or a top brand... note that this is a steal. Great sent. The ladies will love it on your man. I believe though the price can be more affordable.</li>
