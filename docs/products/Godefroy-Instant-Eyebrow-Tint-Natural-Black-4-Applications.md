      <li>The results were spectacular!!!</li>
      <li>I read all the directions, and made sure to put a coating of vaseline, using a q-tip,  around my brows on all the skin I did not want tinted (this dye will stain!!!).  </li>
      <li>With trepidation, I tried this product and it worked beautifully.  </li>

      <li>This product is great if you don&#x27;t have much eyebrow hair and are going to a beach/pool party  or a dancing night out and don&#x27;t want your eyebrow makeup to wash or sweat away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for a photo op, a date, party, job interview when you forget to get your brows done.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Godefroys has not faded at all for 3 weeks no matter how many times I wash my face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>She is satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>The tint is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to clean up as you go along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and the Natural Black color worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I have never colored my own hair and felt my eyebrows were graying a bit too much.  </li>
      <li>I bought this tint because I wanted the illusion of full, solid, beautiful brows without having to draw them on every time I go out.</li>
      <li>Quick, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I can report that I am NOT blind :-)</li>
      <li>Instructions were simple,easy to do,worked as described, cover work area to  prevent  staining areas,it has been several days and still looks good.</li>
      <li>The results are very natural looking not the anime cartoon brows you see on many women.</li>
      <li>The color did not make them darker or lighter, but just right.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and almost mess free.</li>
      <li>I mixed the solution according the the instructions and using a table top magnifying mirror, applied it to one brow.</li>
      <li>Follow instructions exactly.</li>
      <li>I accidentally left it on for 5 minutes (lost track of time) instead of the 2-3 minutes recommended and still love the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>So just about 2 weeks of joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one whole color capsule and squeezed out 9 drops of developer.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>when i recieved it, i sent it back got full refund and ordered another one.</li>
      <li>As you get older, your eyebrows get thinner.  </li>
      <li>So easy to use and does the job extremely well.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the 5 minutes it takes to complete the entire process.</li>
      <li>and it has not faded out to any marked degree.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product, but will need to look for a different brand.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because the product only gives you four servings for this high price!!</li>
      <li>My skin is one of the darker shades of brown, so I left the Natural Black tint on for about 10 minutes (more than twice as long as the recommended time of 4 minutes).</li>
      <li>It did not last six weeks, but approximately three weeks, but that is still great because I did not have to hide the gray everyday like normal.  </li>
      <li>My brows looked solid and very natural.</li>
      <li>right after I washed the eyebrow tint off and every time I&#x27;m about to wash my face, and the tint lasted on my skin a bit less than a week.</li>
      <li>Now that my brows have grown in, I no longer need the eyebrow tint, so I passed the product on to an older relative who uses it to color her white brows.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a thin make up brush (the one you would use to apply lipstick) instead of the sticks which gave me more control over the application process</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only con is very slight irritation, which I&#x27;m sure is because I left it on too long.</li>
      <li>and I ended up using just 1/4 of a capsule for full thick brows.</li>
      <li>I color my hair a soft black color, 2 shades darker than my natural color.  </li>

<li> I applied [[ASIN:B000VV1ZMU Model in a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer - 0.5 Oz]]</li>
<li> I bought the soft black.  </li>
<li> It lasts for a quite long time, it has been two weeks since I used it, it still has color.</li>
<li> You can use just half a capsule and make your supply last twice as long.</li>
<li> At first I was afraid it was too dark, but when finish it was very natural.  </li>
<li> Last few applications I had</li>
<li> I timed the application just as the chart said - 3 minutes and wiped off with a wet makeup remover pad</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t really last longer than a few days.  </li>
<li> It is not great if you are going on a week long vacation and expect it to last the entire time.</li>
<li> I must warn NOT to touch this dye to any other part of your skin</li>
<li> I applied vaseline around my brows but not super close.  </li>
<li> /&gt;I paid a salon $30 to do this the first time since I was afraid of blinding myself and the gray hairs lost their color after about a week and a half.  </li>
<li> I did notice fine bumps in my brows at the hair base but they were gone in about an hour.</li>
<li> When using the product, be careful it is hard to get off it if it gets on your hand or face.</li>
<li> The tint lasts on her brows for a few weeks.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t have to use pencils or powders everyday.  </li>
<li> On day 3 my brows were back to their thin appearance.</li>
<li> There are little capsules and a small activator bottle with a toothpick.</li>
<li> so it would not go past the eyebrow.</li>
<li> Not sure why this product states that it lasts for 6 weeks.</li>
<li> In the past I&#x27;ve always used hair dye on my eyebrows, but it always faded within 2 weeks.</li>
<li> Be careful not to make too thick or too thin.  </li>
<li> It was hard to use.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really thick</li>
<li> I am not an artist so the coverage was not a perfect brow shape, and I was wrorried about the skin staining.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really last longer than a few days.  Also, if left on longer than 3 minutes it starts to burn a bit.  Last few applications I had, I broke out in my eyebrows.  I really wanted to like this product, but will need to look for a different brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this tint because I wanted the illusion of full, solid, beautiful brows without having to draw them on every time I go out. My skin is one of the darker shades of brown, so I left the Natural Black tint on for about 10 minutes (more than twice as long as the recommended time of 4 minutes). I was very happy with the finished look. My brows looked solid and very natural. I applied [[ASIN:B000VV1ZMU Model in a Bottle Long Lasting Eyebrow Sealer - 0.5 Oz]] right after I washed the eyebrow tint off and every time I&#x27;m about to wash my face, and the tint lasted on my skin a bit less than a week. I plan to continue purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2014 Update: Now that my brows have grown in, I no longer need the eyebrow tint, so I passed the product on to an older relative who uses it to color her white brows. She is satisfied with the product. The tint lasts on her brows for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Update 1/16/14: I applied this 1/6/14 and with standard workouts/washings/lotions the grays started losing color  1/16/14 (10 days). This is with close-up inspection, and so I&#x27;d give it another week before they become visible to others. So just about 2 weeks of joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one whole color capsule and squeezed out 9 drops of developer. I applied vaseline around my brows but not super close.  I mixed the solution according the the instructions and using a table top magnifying mirror, applied it to one brow. I am not an artist so the coverage was not a perfect brow shape, and I was wrorried about the skin staining. However, after 3 minutes the NON-gray hairs were darkened, my skin was not stained but the gray hairs had not been colored.  Part of the problem is that the gray hairs stick up out of the dye on the brow. So using the flat angled side of the stick I got a bunch of the mixture and put it exclusively on the gray hairs and gave it a total of 3 additional minutes (I wiped off and reapplied at 1 minute intervals). They all colored. I did notice fine bumps in my brows at the hair base but they were gone in about an hour. I figured it was probably from the repeated wiping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid a salon $30 to do this the first time since I was afraid of blinding myself and the gray hairs lost their color after about a week and a half.  Now I can now do this myself. In addition to regular skin care and sweating, I swim twice a week. I will let you know how it lasts since it has only been 4 days on the plus side I can report that I am NOT blind :-)</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Quick, easy to use.  I color my hair a soft black color, 2 shades darker than my natural color.  This is perfect to match my hair color so I don&#x27;t have to use pencils or powders everyday.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and the Natural Black color worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick and I don&#x27;t like or at all I tried it 2 times but it was still the same thing &amp;#34;never again &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I accidentally left it on for 5 minutes (lost track of time) instead of the 2-3 minutes recommended and still love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a thin make up brush (the one you would use to apply lipstick) instead of the sticks which gave me more control over the application process and I ended up using just 1/4 of a capsule for full thick brows. Be sure to clean up as you go along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color looks totally natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is very slight irritation, which I&#x27;m sure is because I left it on too long.</li>
    <li> The application was simple. There are little capsules and a small activator bottle with a toothpick. The tint didn&#x27;t last a week. I left on the solution longer than specified. On day 3 my brows were back to their thin appearance. Guess a stronger solution would work best. It&#x27;s ok for a photo op, a date, party, job interview when you forget to get your brows done. The results are very natural looking not the anime cartoon brows you see on many women.</li>
    <li> this packaged was damaged when i recieved it, i sent it back got full refund and ordered another one. works great</li>
    <li> I have never colored my own hair and felt my eyebrows were graying a bit too much.  With trepidation, I tried this product and it worked beautifully.  I am a Mediterranean brunette, and this color was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> The tint is easy to use.  At first I was afraid it was too dark, but when finish it was very natural.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, everybody noticed the change in my brows and LOVED it! I will definitely buy this item again. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the product only gives you four servings for this high price!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The color did not make them darker or lighter, but just right.  It did not stain my skin neither, and I did place the vaseline around the brow so it would not go past the eyebrow. It did not last six weeks, but approximately three weeks, but that is still great because I did not have to hide the gray everyday like normal.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this product states that it lasts for 6 weeks. I have used it several times now and it really only last for about 2 to 3 days!!! I thought it was just me, but one of my friends tried it and had the same result. This product is great if you don&#x27;t have much eyebrow hair and are going to a beach/pool party  or a dancing night out and don&#x27;t want your eyebrow makeup to wash or sweat away. It is not great if you are going on a week long vacation and expect it to last the entire time.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  As 70/30 silver/black I bought this to reclaim the intensity I once had in my brows which had faded with age.  I bought the soft black.  I read all the directions, and made sure to put a coating of vaseline, using a q-tip,  around my brows on all the skin I did not want tinted (this dye will stain!!!).  It says to dilute 50/50 the color powder with the cream developer.  Be careful not to make too thick or too thin.  I made mine the texture of yogurt.  I timed the application just as the chart said - 3 minutes and wiped off with a wet makeup remover pad (a paper towel would work just as well).  The results were spectacular!!! I am very pleased.  I must warn NOT to touch this dye to any other part of your skin (I inadvertently touched my cheek with the remover pad, and it stained).  Pick the right color, follow directions, it&#x27;s a marvelous product.  Yes, I&#x27;ll buy this product again.  It says results last about 6 weeks.  I have not determined that as yet.  But if it lasts a month, I&#x27;ll be happy. Update:  It&#x27;s been 4 weeks and it has not faded out to any marked degree.  Well worth the 5 minutes it takes to complete the entire process.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always used hair dye on my eyebrows, but it always faded within 2 weeks. Godefroys has not faded at all for 3 weeks no matter how many times I wash my face. It&#x27;s very easy to use and almost mess free. I will be buying it again, thank you Godefroy for making a product that works!</li>
    <li> It is nice to have everything you need in one box but I did not get great results.  I would not buy again.  It was hard to use.  I will shop around for a different brand.  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This product works almost instantly when I applied on my eyebrow, and it saves lot time to make up using eye pencils. It lasts for a quite long time, it has been two weeks since I used it, it still has color. When using the product, be careful it is hard to get off it if it gets on your hand or face.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  So easy to use and does the job extremely well.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  As you get older, your eyebrows get thinner.  You can use just half a capsule and make your supply last twice as long.</li>
    <li> Instructions were simple,easy to do,worked as described, cover work area to  prevent  staining areas,it has been several days and still looks good.Follow instructions exactly.I will purchase again.</li>
