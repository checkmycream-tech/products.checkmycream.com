<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ooh love this one! It sexy and feminine. Soft and subtle fruit under tones.</li>
    <li> Love smell but got fake one</li>
    <li> It turns out not to be the scent I was seeking, so I have a lot of product the scent of which is not exactly what I wanted. I was trying to find the real thing that was  &amp;#34; &#x27;Christian Audigier by Ed Hardy&#x27; &amp;#34;. I was using a spray I bought at Walgreen&#x27;s under the label &amp;#34;In Style Designer Mist - An Impression of Christian Audigier by Ed Hardy&amp;#34;. I thought it was worth a try, but it is not what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> great price for this !!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a bargain price. Bought it for my mom&#x27;s mother&#x27;s day gift and she was so happy. Recommend it</li>
    <li> very light but pleasant fruity smell. This size for the dollar amount was very good also. Would purchase again soon.</li>
    <li> My most favorite perfume! Came on time, smells great, and wasn&#x27;t tampered or damaged! Not sure why some people are saying its fake....mine was the real deal!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Wish the cost was lower though. It is a good birthday gift.</li>
    <li> The best smelling perfume</li>
    <li> I have been buying this same bottle for YEARS.. for what I now know is WAY OVERPRICED AT THE MALL! this is the best deal I have ever seen on this brand. When I saw the price, I assumed it was for the medium bottle I usually buy In the store. When it arrived it was the largest bottle I&#x27;ve ever seen! Don&#x27;t look elsewhere, you found your new favorite perfume. Click the buy button. Do it :) hahaha</li>
    <li> excellent value and excellent product!</li>
    <li> My wide absolutely loves this perfume...and I love it on her...my irrational favorite out of all of her perfumes. bought it for christmas and she loves it</li>
    <li> smells amazing.i just got it today ! i&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume everywhere but it was to expensive. i&#x27;m glad i found it here :) yayy</li>
    <li> Loooove. Smells exactly how I remember</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone else, so I can&#x27;t comment on anything other than it looks nice and arrived on time.  It looks exactly like the one in the stores, so I&#x27;m sure its perfect.</li>
    <li> This bottle has lasted me for a year now, and I absolutely LOVE the smell. I get so many compliments on a daily basis on my perfume. I have definitely found my new smell!!!</li>
    <li> reasonable price, fast shipping ... wonderful product .. a gift I gave the my wife liked so much !!</li>
    <li> Again I was very pleased with my purchase and I received it so quick.  My daughter was very surprised when she got this as a stocking stuffer she has wanted this for a while and of course mom came through for her.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I have come across in awhile. Distinctive scent. Not to strong, but holds its own.</li>
    <li> Good price. My wife has enjoyed it for a long time!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different colognes and perfumes and I love the clean, feminine scent of Ed Hardy. It&#x27;s now my signature fragrance. :-)</li>
    <li> I switch between this and sergio ferragamo incanto dream. a great scent for the fall, to me. it is not strong, but has a very very sweet scent. i love it, i get a lot of compliments from it, but it will fade after a few hours or less. invest in the lotion too. overall satisfied. no complaints from me!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes ever! Nice fragrance, not overpowering. I get compliments whenever I wear it. This and Gucci Premiere are my favorite scents but this is much more affordable! This bottle goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> It got to me so fast with free shipping. The product was worth the money. It&#x27;s great thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> My dad bought me this a few years ago and I love it! The fragrance is strong and it stays with you all day.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this perfume. I&#x27;m constantly getting compliments on how great I smell :-) the price for the size of the bottle is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this perfume.  Sometimes she goes a little crazy when spraying it all the time but she likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Received item promptly.  It was placed at same time with two other items.  This was the first item I received.  My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item as a Xmas gift for my girlfriend. It was at her request . She really like this spray. It&#x27;s smells really good too. Lasts awhile. Looked at purchasing this item at the mall due to time constraints however couldn&#x27;t bare to spend the $75 they ask for the same size bottle . I checked amazon and they had it for about half the price. I love amazon . Unbeatable price and quIck shipping . Got it just in time to wrap and put under tree.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite item</li>
    <li> Not much to say other then delivery was fast and it smells soooo good!! Love it &amp;lt;3&amp;lt;3 and I&#x27;ll probably purchase another one when this one runs out! Haha</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my girlfriend. This product smells amazing, and as always an easy and painless purchase through Amazon. I would recommend this fragrance, only problem is you may not want to take her out. ;)</li>
    <li> Amazing fragrance! Last a long time!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this perfume, also good price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the advertising on the bottle</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle I have bought.  I got a bottle last year for Christmas and I am just crazy about the scent.  I have tested other Ed Hardy perfume, but this is my absolute favorite.  Amazon had the best pricing on this item.</li>
    <li> The product came fast and it was wrapped so that had bubble wrap all the way around and bubble wrap in the top and bottom the box... Extremely happy would do business again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It is my absolutely favorite and it stays with me throughout the day.  It is a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this awhile ago, but this is the best price I have seen for this perfume. It is so worth my money! It&#x27;s also Good quality. Doesn&#x27;t smell old like it sat on the shelf forever.</li>
    <li> This smells great for day or night!  Not too heavy and it lasts all day.  Great value for the product as well.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE this purfume!  Excellent price and the scent lasts all day and night.  Shipped on time and was delivered sooner then predicted.  Smells almost sweet like fruit like Eternity.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like Eternity, but similarly sweet.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s fruity and fresh but not something a preteen would wear. This scent goes with every outfit, and every occasion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife as she has been wanting it for some time and needless to say I am a hero today.  She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This is not the licensed product. It does not spray in a mist. It does not remotely smell like the original and it barely smells. The bottle cover doesn&#x27;t even fit, every time you pick it up....it falls to the counter, floor, or your foot. This was a complete waste of money and I am terribly disappointed. So far, I cannot find anyway to be refunded either. I bought through amazon once before and I got the real deal on this product. This time.....a complete fraud.</li>
    <li> Just received my Ed Hardy Perfume, of course it is as expected.&lt;br /&gt;I received it a day early~ very pleased with the shipping time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with the price, purchased the 3.5 bottle for only $37. (dollars), here the 1.6 sells for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more items from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> If you like sweet scents, you&#x27;ll love this perfume!  I&#x27;ve always liked/worn only expensive perfumes, the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot;, starting with Chanel No. 5, which I wore all thru high school.  Normally, I prefer/wear floral perfumes.  This year I started looking for a new perfume, been wearing Chloe Narcisis for so many years, time for something different.  I recently went to a department store in our local mall to try all the Ed Hardy perfumes.  Truth is, it was the colorful bottles/packaging that attracted me to that line.  After sampling the entire Ed Hardy line, I chose the Ed Hardy for Women, which is the original scent (I think).  It&#x27;s fruity and floral at the same time, quite sweet but not in a \\&quot;cheap perfume for kids\\&quot; way.  I&#x27;ll wear it for day or night, year round.  The scent does die down after about 30 minutes.  I mix a little of the perfume with unscented body lotion, and apply that first, then I use 2 sprays of the perfume straight from the bottle on myself.  The scent does last longer that way.  My second choice was the Ed Hardy Hearts and Daggers, which is more sweet, like Sweet Tarts and flowers combined.  Might purchase a bottle of that soon, too.  Either way, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the prices here on Amazon.  Half the price of dept. stores, and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff , very fresh and sweet smelling . despite what others say it doesnt fade after wearing it ,other people can still smell it even when you cant.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement to the empty bottle (Purchased from a department store) my wife had recently gone through...  This arrived in what appeared to be authentic packaging, sealed etc..  Opened the package and the bottle differs in appearance and smell to the bottle my wife already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missing \\&quot;By Christian Audigier\\&quot; under the Ed Hardy script..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells different than the perfume in the other bottle.  Still smells good and rather than hassle with returning and opened beauty product (If you&#x27;ve purchased brand name beauty products from Amazon before you know what this is like) we will keep this bottle..  Just probably won&#x27;t purchase from Amazon for this product again.</li>
    <li> I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK U GUYS FOR THE WARNINGS, I WAS GOING PURCHASE .BUT,THX TO MY AMAZON BUDDIES I AM NOT !!!! NOT GETTING MY MONEY SELLING FAKES</li>
    <li> I received the perfume faster than I what they told me which was A+ in my book! But when I tried on the perfume, it didn&#x27;t smell exactly the same as the true Ed Hardy perfume that I buy in the retail store. I will accept this error as my own. I didn&#x27;t realize Amazon accepts perfume that may not be the authentic. When I read the information on the perfume, I didn&#x27;t see anywhere on the website that the perfume was not the actual Ed Hardy perfume that I so love. I was a little disappointed. But instead of returning it back, I gave it as a gift to a neighbor&#x27;s daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I will just go back to buying the real perfume at my local retail beauty store.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful light scent</li>
    <li> I saw this perfume at a Department Store for it&#x27;s full price and fell in love with it immediately. But it was too expensive so I was contemplating it until I saw Amazon selling it for 45% off!! I grabbed it up quickly and don&#x27;t regret it. I love the scent and so do my friends. In fact three of them bought it after I did because they too fell in love with it. Thanks Amazon for awesome prices and free shipping!</li>
    <li> I Purchased this for my wife. The deal I got on Amazon, and from the Seller was just as good as the smell of this perfume. THEY ARE BOTH AWESOME!!!!! This is Ed Hardy&#x27;s sexiest perfume ever!</li>
    <li> I bought the gift set of this perfume last week and it quickly became one of my new favorite scents.I like perfumes with a slight musk or woodsy smell and usually prefer fruity to floral.This perfume is just that! Not too girly but has a touch of sweetness,unlike any of my other scents.It also lasts all day and I have received many compliments!If you are looking to try a new perfume I definately reccomend this!</li>
    <li> Just want to let people know that this is a real thing. After reading the reviews I went to Target and took a picture of the product they sell. It doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;By Christian Audigier&amp;#34; on the box or on the bottle and they wouldn&#x27;t sell the fake stuff would they. Take a look at the picture I took at the store.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I smelled this at work and had to ask the woman what it was so I could buy for the girlfriend.  She likes it and I like it... What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled it, i thought it was amazing. After spraying it, it smelled completely different in an awful way. The ONLY thing that smells good from this Ed Hardy brand of perfume is the body wash and shimmer lotion. The perfume is not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> once again i got this for my daughter she loves ed hardy you will not get this item either in a store for this price true to size  she loves it ...will definetly purchase  more from this seller  happy happy</li>
    <li> this perfume is great i ordered it for my granddaughter and i even think it smells amazing and she is in 7th grade all of her friends love it. it last a long time on her too. its just amazing</li>
    <li> Always get compliments with this perfume, starting off with, &amp;#34;Ohhh you smell good!!&amp;#34;  Its not too strong but lasts. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife liked it. Not loved it. More for the younger crowd.</li>
    <li> My duaghter and I love this perfume</li>
    <li> Love it, quick shipping good price.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my wife, both of us enjoy the fragrance. It is a very large bottle for the price. Tough to beat!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume - fast shipping, and I love it! Been wearing it for years, even though the Ed Hardy craze is OUT I still love this perfume!</li>
    <li> got the item on time no wait no worries!! very nice! it was there when said it would be. and it was the right product not a fake. im very pleased!</li>
    <li> I received the item as expected and love it..  Will do business in the future.</li>
    <li> Wow - this bottle is huge! It came within a week and for only 30 bucks, it is a steal! Thanks!</li>
    <li> the best perfume ans cost effective</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; scent!  Smells amazing and long-lasting. Get complimented everyday for it from people of all ages. The smell is a light fruit-candy smell. If you like those smells, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was buying this at Macys&#x27; and paying 80.00.  I came online and found it for half the price!  I will not buy it at Macy&#x27;s again.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite perfume! Smells so beautiful not too strong or too light, perfect size!!</li>
    <li> The bottle was much larger than I expected for the cost. It smells amazing, I purchased this as a gift and got one for myself also. Arrived quickly and was packaged nicely.</li>
    <li> Good price, good perfume. Arrived quickly, packaged well &amp; even came with free samples of other scents. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the scent already bought another after I ran out!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I have to admit I am a little embarrassed about buying anything ed hardy because it is not my style at all, but it does smell really good!</li>
    <li> Love the perfume. Great smell.</li>
    <li> Such a great price for the amount ! Smells AMAZING.everyone always asks me what perfume I wear because it smells so good</li>
    <li> It was good, deliver was faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Floral yet fruity... I feel like it&#x27;s the perfect midpoint between those teeny-bopper fruits and the older-woman floral. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells good but not the original</li>
    <li> I got this for my birthday from a dear friend. I saw it was purchased in my wishlist and was VERY EXCITED. This has ALWAYS been my fav. smell so OBVIOUSLY I know what it smells like. Considering I know this smell very well I can assure you this is not authentic. I think the package is real buuttt.... what&#x27;s inside isn&#x27;t. It smells great, but isn&#x27;t the authentic smell. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it smells AMAZING but it is not the authentic smell. It is pretty close but if you want the real thing... this isn&#x27;t it. :( I am pretty much on trying to buy authentic items on here because everything I got for my birthday is FAKE. Fake belt, fake perfume, fake purse, FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAAAKKKEEEEEE. I wouldn&#x27;t mind it being fake buuttt I don&#x27;t like being tricked. Also it ticks me off paying a lot of money just because of the fact it&#x27;s authentic and then it isn&#x27;t.  GRAAHHHHHHHHH, screw you counterfeiters!!! GTFO... Please (:!</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time for my wife and she loves it. She wears it everyday to work and everyone compliments her on it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Its relatively cheap and it smells amazing! The bottle is a decent size as well so its definitely worth the money. The smell lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> The fastest shipping i have ever expirenced i just ordered this yesterday lol!! It smells amazing i was skeptical because people said it was fake and not to but im really glad i did ITS REAL and worth every penny its smells like heaven! I will be shopping with this seller again 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife, she seems very satisfied with them. Product does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> it came nicely packaged. when it said it would come and the perfume is just how i remembered it! one of the best smelling perfumes out there!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume couple weeks ago..before ran out (as i wear his perfume all the time..for last 3+years)...this bottle i purchased smells like rubbing alcohol....no good..&amp; i buy off Amazon all the time...dont buy from these guys!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume on Sunday through my Amazon Prime membership.  What a great deal...it retails for $75.  Free shipping and no tax as I had it shipped to hubbys ofice out of state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is so pretty and cool at the same time and this fragrance is light and lovely!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and you will be happy or make someone happy for the holidays!!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling perfume in the world!!!  I got a sample from a high-end store and fell in love with it immediately.  As a matter of fact, when my daughter was visiting from Chicago, she took it from me and said she liked it better than a much more expensive perfume that she had at home.</li>
    <li> Great price and love the smell!</li>
    <li> This a huge bottle for a cheap price!!! I love this fragrance!! It smells so good I bought myself a bottle and asked for another one for a christmas gift so I won&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wears this perfume and it smells wonderful.  I would recommend this to any lady to wear this! You won&#x27;t regret your purchase &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Sprays out a bit too quickly. Came on time and packaged nicely. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Received many compliments on this perfume...it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
    <li> Extremely great value for the price. I have been wearing this fragrance for years &amp; it is unheard of to purchase this size bottle @ this price!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Going to order more at this phenomenal price! Never going to use EBay again for my fragrance purchases!</li>
    <li> Smells great, and I have been using it for years.  Love the price point it is at and never had an issue.  It may not smell like the original I don&#x27;t even remember.  I get complimented ALL the time about how good I smell.  Consider that a win!</li>
    <li> I have always loved, and still will love this product!!! I will continue to purchase this fragrance for the right  price;)</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time when I have this on! This is my absolute favorite perfume and it is worth every penny. A must have!</li>
    <li> This is NOT THE PERFUME. This is a SPRAY. What that means is is smells like a watered down, less quality version of the perfume you smell in the department stores. I genuinely do not think it is worth the money when the scent lasts less than an hour. The GREAT news is, Amazon has amazing customer service and fixed the issue immediately. This body spray is going in my trash can.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Get components on it all the time and even had someone else order it also! Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> 5 STARS Had some before had to get more cause it smells. Real good arrived on time</li>
    <li> Looked all over for this and found it here for a great price...and got it quickly!  It was a great gift.</li>
    <li> I have worn this a couple of years. I have found that it&#x27;s cheaper ordering on the internet. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Slow shipping&lt;br /&gt;Perfume was leaked and spilt all in package</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scent. Most people are surprised when I tell them what it is, but they go out and get it. :)</li>
    <li> This was the fastest shipping ever! The best price ever!! Best quality ever!! I Love this fragrance and so now I&#x27;m buying another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume. My nose is finicky when it comes to most scents (thanks to many months of morning sickness), but this perfume works well for me. This bottle is a replacement for one that is almost empty.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume years ago from my aunt and was obsessed, I ran out of it and decided to buy this off amazon I was a little nervous buying a larger product for a lower price but it smells the exact same, and I compared it to my other empty bottle and everything is the exact same, packaging, scent, sticker is the same I am solo glad I bought this product!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this people compliment me on the aroma.  Even at the end of the day I&#x27;ll have someone say something about how good I smell.  It keeps me coming back.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and it&#x27;s a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this for a very long time, but of course, necessities come first. I waited patiently for that extra dollar. Worth the wait. Smelled just like I remembered, the artwork was awesome. Maan, the whole 10 minutes I had with it, was..was..was...depressing. My niece wanted to see, jerked it off the table, and there it went. Hit perfect on the floor. Maan, cleaning it up and tossing in the trash was..was..was.. even more depressing. Maan, no telling when I&#x27;ll have the extra dollar. Hey, 10 minutes I&#x27;ll never forget.</li>
    <li> i was very happy with this product. the price was great for the size of the perfume. i will order this again</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and it&#x27;s the only one I use . I get compliments all the time . The price is great and I have recommended this to others as well !!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deal anywhere for this product! I absolutely love it! I will never buy it at the store again, only online!</li>
    <li> This product was a gift and the person who received it really liked it.  I was happy with the product as well.</li>
    <li> Love Ed Hardy fragrances, shoes, bags, etc.  I am asked what scent I am wearing quite a bit and when people say it&#x27;s such a nice, pleasing scent and ask the name and I tell them Ed Hardy Love Kills, they love it even more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance!!! I has a wonderful fruity fragrance like a delicious tropical drink with a very light musk undertone. It is great for day or night. If you want to feel sexy,flirty and feminine it is a must!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited about my Ed Hardy perfume! I was worried about ordering online, but everything was new and in original packaging. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase because I couldn&#x27;t find this good of a deal in stores and this is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It fits me perfectly. Some perfumes lose their scent after just a bit. This one is amazing.</li>
    <li> It was my first time buying the perfume and I love the smell of it.I really do recommend it you.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume. It smells very nice and is much cheaper than buying in stores. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love it! Exactly how it was described :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the perfume, but when I took the cover off of the bottle, the spray nozzle broke off.  Now I can not put the lid on for travel.</li>
    <li> WEARING THIS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL SEXY ITS GREAT AND LAST ALL DAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU LAYER WITH LOTION AND SHOWER GEL , HERES A EXTRA TIP AFTER YOU WASH RIGHT OUT OF THE SHOWER WHEN YOUR SKIN IS STILL MOIST PUT SOME VASELINE IN YOUR HAND AND THE LOTION AND RUB IT INTO YOUR SKIN THE SMELL LAST LONGER AND YOUR SKIN IS MOISTEN ALL DAYU LONG TRUST ME</li>
    <li> Of course it&#x27;s the real thing!  I saved so much money.  Only one problem... I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT MORE THEN ONE!!!</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume which is no longer sold in department stores (I used to buy it at Macy&#x27;s for $75 for 3 oz bottle) The price is such a deal, you can get 4 for the price they use to be sold for!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this perfume for christmas. This was a perfect smell. It is not overly strong. Needless to say, she loved it!</li>
    <li> The bottle it dynamic. It comes in a box and then in a bottle. The fragrance is unique. I would recommend this product to my friends and will be purchasing this product and other related products in the future. The price was right and free shipping awesome!</li>
    <li> every time i wear this i get so many compliments, and it does last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, I get compliments on it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast, and the product was brand new and unopened as listed!</li>
    <li> From the first moment I sprayed this scent, I fell in love and have been ever since. Everywhere I go, I am constantly complimented on my pleasant scent. Plus the bottle is huge! I paid the same price or more for only half of the amount of perfume I received from Amazon. I am in love with all Ed Hardy scents and would recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> DELICIOUS!!  Smells AMAZING, FRUITY!  It was sealed and 100% AUTHENTIC because I&#x27;ve had this one before!  Love everything about my purchase - product, price, delivery time, and condition at arrival!!</li>
    <li> Perfect scent. Not to strong and not too light. Stays on all day. I love this item and buy it all the time. Love Ed Hardy.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever. Period. EVERYONE compliments me when I wear this scent. It&#x27;s just -- GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I have always liked this perfume. I absolutely loved even more for the deal I got on it. Definitley a great buy.</li>
    <li> Came in time that was expected already was pleased with product so this purches was a refill to replace the one she had already consumed. This bottle size lasted here one year.</li>
    <li> YOU ALL READY NO A AT NO QUESTION ASK LAST LONG AND THE BOTTLE IS BIG LAST FOR A WHILE THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Was sooooo disappointed!!!! As you will notice it does not say Christian Audigier under Ed Hardy. .. This is a knock off!! Smells really bad after you spray it on and it sits awhile on you:-( guess I&#x27;ll pay the $75.00 for the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; stuff:-)</li>
    <li> VERY disappointed! This is nothing more than a bottle of water. I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years, and this is NOT a legitimate bottle of Ed Hardy.  There is no scent.  This is a fake.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Hope they never stop making this. Definitely one of my favorite scents,  and I have a lot :)</li>
    <li> Love this product, smells great every time.</li>
    <li> Wife love the perfume ran out had to get more</li>
    <li> Love the scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  I get it for her once a year and it usually lasts the full year</li>
    <li> I love ed hardy perfumes they all smell so good and this one is no exception! It is big and a good price you definately can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> The perfume is a fresh and floral scent that instantly appealed to me. It&#x27;s not overpowering but it&#x27;s strong enough to last a while, especially with two sprays. The 3.4 oz size is a better value, and if you really like the scent and want it to last, this is the size to get. The bottle is a little on the heavy side, not great for carrying around. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfume is great quality and great price. I am excited that I was able to find this quality of perfume for such a great price!</li>
    <li> I was happy with shipping, delivery and product. This smells like heaven. Ladies buy yourself a treat. One spray makes me feel beautiful even at my worst.</li>
    <li> I have reason to believe this perfume is not authentic. Firstly, the packaging doesn&#x27;t resemble the packaging for a typical 3.4 oz bottle on the Ed Hardy site. I had a sample of this perfume from Sephora and loved the fruity sweet smell and how it lasted all day. Unfortunately, this perfume smells murky/musky, not sweet and fruity. It only lasts about half an hour. I am fairly certain this is not an authentic product and I&#x27;m not impressed with ThePerfumeSpot.</li>
    <li> This is good perfume, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it great. It looks legitimate, but it doesn&#x27;t have quite the same smell as the Ed Hardy you get from Macy&#x27;s. The Macy&#x27;s perfume smells better. This smells a bit watered down.</li>
    <li> This is my All time favorite scent n guys go crazzzzy over it!!! Lots of compliments with this it&#x27;s a Winner!!!!</li>
    <li> Fake, I fell for it as well. It is completely fake. I have a smaller bottle of the genuine one and they smell very different :(</li>
    <li> Her favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> NOT THE REAL DEAL!  LASTS 15 MINUTES AND GONE!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s designer perfume reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter-in-law- she had picked it out for a Christmas gift. It is a great fragrance. I can see why she likes it.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the bottle was at least a third gone and the box smelled like perfume when you opened by back door where the UPS man left the box. The squirter shoots out a large amount as opposed to a mist. Love the smell, but probably wont&#x27; reorder from this seller.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife, and she loves it!! Nice value.</li>
    <li> This is such a nice clean scent.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on how good I smell when I wear this!!!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter loves this!</li>
    <li> Love it great price!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been pleasing me for YEARS... It is a stand by and go to fragrance for normal everyday.  The bottle is made of a very thick glass, not easily breakable.. THANK GOD.. and the aerosol tip has never failed. It is made of a higher grade material to last through the entire bottle.  This fragrance is light and subtle.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent. nice and simple and perfect for the price. this is the third time ive order this perfume and they were quick to deliever it to me!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend. She was so excited when she opened it, she already had another bottle but was running out.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She had it on her wish list so it was easy to please</li>
    <li> This was an amazing price.  I love this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to work perfume. Yes, I separate my personal life from my secular life so much so that I have different scents for each. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and it smells wonderful-not overpowering, just right.</li>
    <li> The scent of this perfume is great. Very sweet, almost like candy! It&#x27;s light enough to wear for daily events, as well. I also really love the bottle and the design. Not a bad purchase!</li>
    <li> Thought the product was excellent- the bottle was beautiful and I love the smell and the price was excellent also</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have bought anything from Ed Hardy. This smells so pretty and feminine.  You don&#x27;t have to put a lot on as the fragrance lingers.  Beautiful!</li>
    <li> This smells so good, and is easily $10 cheaper than in stores. I got it within two days and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
    <li> another winner from my husband! love this smell.</li>
    <li> I adore ed hardy perfume very well wrapped arrived on time. thanks</li>
    <li> My 30 ish daughter loves the scent and so does her boy friend. I know she will love this gift again.</li>
    <li> As she is a Ed Hardy lover, I am pleased , very soft smell and not overpowering. and priced right. very fast delivery and the bonus I too love the smell.</li>
    <li> It has a light, fruity smell, but the scent does last pretty well. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who likes a perfume that&#x27;s noticeable, but isn&#x27;t too assuming.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  Tried other Ed Hardy scents but I keep going back to this one!!  I used Michael Kors as well but I get more comments with this Ed Hardy one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery and packaged very neatly for mailing!  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume, it smells great. I have always loved ed hardy perfumes but this one is the one. Not to strong of a smell, it&#x27;s just about right. I specially liked the price i got it for. Running low, buying this again.</li>
    <li> i look and order ed hardy by Christina aguiler when i receive this shipment it said ed hardy only this is not the real perfume ishould get a refund cant even small the fragance water</li>
    <li> Package came in on time, rapped in it&#x27;s special box and smells great. For an amazing price, I am satisfied.:)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.  Even my mom likes it.  I get complemented on it all the time.  And, I love the fact that it is cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great light smell, I have seen some reviews where the perfume seemed watered down but this was fine.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Love it.</li>
    <li> plz man dont aske for comments.that was good its enough for u guyes&lt;br /&gt;..............nkkguhoiiugyugykhuyguii,.goo to hell.what is this.i dont have time</li>
    <li> I brought Ed hardy from Amazon . I don&#x27;t thing this is the real thing because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last at all and I can&#x27;t return it purchase in the past from other merchant very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Very decently priced. Lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Always a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> Same as store and a fraction of the cost.  Same fragrance as you would buy there, even in the box.  Will buy again in about a year when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I sampled this fragrance when I was looking for Hearts and daggers , I loved it so much I ordered it along with the Hearts and daggers.</li>
    <li> Beat macy&#x27;s price by half and came just in time for christmas. It is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I used to be IN LOVE with this scent. I first bought this when I was 16 and I&#x27;m 20 now. This is definitely more of a teen scent for the warmer seasons. It is extremely fruity, it gives me the biggest headache now. Maybe its because I got so used to the smell it got annoying or maybe its me, my preferences probably changed over time. A lot comes in the bottle and it lasts a really long time. I recommend this for the younger crowd or someone that loves fruity scents !!</li>
    <li> Great deal and I love this scent!!This is my favorite scent. I get so many compliments. The price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my 30 something daughter-in-law who had never used it before but she loved it!</li>
    <li> I had two very happy and surprised teenage Daughters Christmas Morning. Fast shipping. And correct product ensured a pleasant surprise gift from &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m a very happy and loyal, maybe to a flaw, Amazon shopper. Thank you</li>
    <li> I got to treat myself for once and I LOVE this fragrance.  Waited longer then anticipated for this one, but other then that, its fantastic!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this for christmas two years ago and I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume and I wa expecting a small bottle and this is huge!</li>
    <li> shipped quickly, it was a gift and my 20 something year old daughter loved it</li>
    <li> great deal  quick shipping</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely manner. I was nervous thinking it may not be what I buy at the store, but it was exactly the same and love it even more than before because it was like half the price!! Happy and will purchase from here again!!!</li>
    <li> Smelt this scent on a co worker and just had to have it. Its a lot cheaper then the price in the store saved 20.00</li>
    <li> Price was great, smell was great but seemed to not stick with me like previous Ed Hardy products have done</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time. Long lasting and a great price. I wish it cost just a little bit cheaper, but well worth the money. I have bought this over and over again and never get tired of it.</li>
    <li> hearts and dagger better</li>
    <li> ONE OF MY FAVORITES, I WEAR IT ALL THE TIME</li>
    <li> The only perfume I wear.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has this perfume and I really love how it smells. She got hers for full retail price of $75 so I was really excited to find it for way less. I read other reviews saying that the product was a fake, didn&#x27;t smell the same, knock off, etc. but I went ahead and gave it a shot. The product I received looks just like my friends right down to the details of the pictures, the only thing that&#x27;s different, though, is that my product does not have the signature &amp;#34;by Christian Audigier&amp;#34; underneath the Ed Hardy label like hers does which means it is not the real thing. Also it says right on the box &amp;#34;Dist. New Wave Fragrances&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t what hers says. There&#x27;s also a slight difference in the smell, but overall it is really similar and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I&#x27;m going to keep it and use it since I spent the money on it, but if you&#x27;re looking for the real legit product, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loved it!! I will be ordering more of this for her in the future</li>
    <li> yea so this thing is a knock off but for the price could you really be surprised?? any way it smells great knock off or not and i would definately buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I Love it.  It is my favorite.  Spicy yet soft with fruit undertones.  A scent everyone would love.  Great for all year .</li>
    <li> Present for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this.  was a gift</li>
    <li> Excellent price. Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> It is Lovely! I always loved the scent &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price. It arrived quickly too!</li>
    <li> If you purchase this size anywhere else, it costs double the amount, so getting it off Amazon is definitely the way to go. Such a great scent too, i love it!!!</li>
    <li> True Ed Hardy... How can you not love it when you are paying well below retail for the same product.</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this perfume as a surprise, and I loved the scent! I will forever be an Ed Hardy fan. - wife</li>
    <li> I will admit this used to be one of my favorites... but now there&#x27;s nothing special about it because almost everysingle person I walk by is wearing it. A year ago I might have rated this one 5 stars but I can&#x27;t now because I&#x27;ve discovered a scent similar to this one but BETTER and newer called Hawaiian Princess by Honolulu perfume Co. Its still light sweet and feminine but there&#x27;s something about it that&#x27;s addicting</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars because I love the smell. The price was amazing. I have bought this product in the past from department stores. I went in looking for it again and the store no longer carried it. I was glad, because buying it from amazon saved me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Yum!! I love this perfume! It is my most favorite perfume and it was a GREAT price for the size! Best price I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Thanks!  My daughter got me hooked on this perfume.  Now it&#x27;s all I use, but it&#x27;s too expensive n the stores.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She likes it a lot.  Smell really good on her.  .She wears it every day.  I&#x27;m the man.</li>
    <li> This is a yearly must for my daughter in law so decided to purchase every Christmas. The younger generation loves it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wears this and this is by far the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen it online! You can smell this in person at kohls.</li>
    <li> I love the sent, but it is not a long lasting sent. It&#x27;s very light. Great for everyday wear.  Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My sisters a big fan of this perfume so I decided to buy it for her, of course she loves it. Its a pretty big size for the price and its beautifully made!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly what I ordered, the same wonderful fragrance I&#x27;ve loved for a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas, shes been put of it for a while now. I was a little skeptical d buying it online but when It arrived and I smelled it, it was exactly what I was expecting. The price was so much better then at a department store too.</li>
    <li> Love love it it,it it it it it it it it it .do not want to rate anymore. This,is,ridiculous,to have,to headline and,so many words</li>
    <li> Great service and awesome product</li>
    <li> I previously bought the fragrance from the EdHardy store &amp; ran out &amp; was looking for a cheaper option. The packaging is the exact same &amp; costs MUCH less. The only thing I may complain about is the scent. It seems a bit off, I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but maybe its just me looking for a flaw!</li>
    <li> I had a mini sample of this before and I loved it and when I ran out I had to get some more. I saw this online for about half of what I could find it in the stores for and it&#x27;s a huge bottle! I love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for someone; however the package was lost! I was very disappointed, but the seller was phenomenal.....Very helpful and my item was replaced! As for the perfume my friend loves it she said she gets lots of compliments and her hubby loves it! She also said the scent lasts for a pretty long time so that&#x27;s definitely a plus! It was indeed a great buy!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells amazing and I cannot get enough of it. An addicting, light, slightly fruity scent. That being said I have purchased over 15 bottle of different perfumes off amazon that are shipped and AND sold by amazon and none of them have been fakes until this questionable one. The first bottle I received did not say By Christian Audigier on the cylindrical box it came in (just like the photo). However I noticed that trying to open and get the top off the actual bottle was very difficult and when I finally got it off the top of the perfume bottle had a strange sprayer. Instead of the full spray cap on all perfumes the sprayer was glued onto the top of the glass opening instead of of the screw on. After a bit of use the glued on top broke off as the cap was so difficult to get off. I contacted amazon and they kindly sent me another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one also did not say By Christian Audigier on the box HOWEVER the sprayer was the correct perfume sprayer and the lid was easy to get off as it should have been. The perfume smells wonderful (not like alcohol like many knock offs) and lasts for about 6 hours. I believe that even though the box is different this is indeed authentic perfume. I was recently in Macy&#x27;s when I noticed that their Ed Hardy perfume also did NOT have By Christian Audigier on the box so I am thinking that this is just a different or newer printing of the box. The point being that amazon may have fakes in their inventory (never experienced that before this but I would almost never buy from a third party, stick with amazon for brand name items) so do check over your bottle of perfume and the sprayer to ensure yours is authentic.</li>
    <li> I thought it was the real deal and UPON opening the bottle, Could tell at first glace that it is a KNOCK OFF!! No designer signature and missing labels. AND to make it WORST, it doesn&#x27;t small like the real thing. I been wearing this perfume for years, I know my Ed Hardy.... and it smells like a cheap family dollar perfume, mostly alcohol and water.</li>
    <li> Everyone compliments me on the scent. And I&#x27;m not a heavy user. It&#x27;s just a very nice clean smell with a hint of sexy.&lt;br /&gt;Gotta love it!!!</li>
    <li> Delivery was very fast! I love this scent..I always been a fan of Ed Hardy perfume...I recommend this perfume to woman who like sweet flowery scents</li>
    <li> The 3.4 oz bottle was a good deal for the $32 price range. However, I cannot be 100% sure if the perfume was authentic Ed Hardy, as the bottom was stamped with a sticker typically seen on all Ed Hardy perfumes, but read \\&quot;NEW WAVE FRAGRANCES LLC\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;FT. LAUDERDALE FL, 39312 USA\\&quot;. This made me a lil apprehensive about the authenticy. It smelled authebtic but perfumes are easy to replicate once you know the main ingredients. Not sure if Ed Hardy has contracts w/ private companies for wholesale as this appears??!</li>
    <li> saw it at target, way to much. Got it here better price. Looked the smell, and other people too. Last all day and then some. will buy some more for me and my daughter</li>
    <li> this products don&#x27;t smell like the original ED hardy from Macy&#x27;s. the smell goes away very fast, you almost have to spray it on ever min. Not very happy</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this perfume, last week. I tested it and sprayed it on my t-shirt, scent lasted for less than hour. After several hours you trying to smell the t-shirt and scent disappeared.  I wanted to return it, but when I went to process a return I was informed that it cannot be returned, because of a flammable item. So, this item can be shipped to me without any problem but cannot be shipped back?! Why, was I notified at the time of purchase that this is a final sale???  I would like to received my money back..</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.  I was nervous it was going to be a knockoff but it wasn&#x27;t.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I already have this sent, Bought at a outlet. I Order two of these one to replace my bottle and a second to give to my niece for a present. She always says how she loves the one I have one, Now I&#x27;m disappointing, It doesn&#x27;t have Christian Audigier On it nor dose it smell the same. Since I can&#x27;t return it. I have to give her this that doesn&#x27;t smell nearly the same. I rather spend the extra money then order this again.. The return Policy SUCKS! The glass bottle doesn&#x27;t have the logo either.. I&#x27;m so pissed about this..</li>
    <li> This is the second time I order this product. It lasts all day and I get complimented a lot.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter in law, she loves this perfume!</li>
    <li> My daughter love it.would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and she loved it. It smells great. I think that it was a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Item came just as I expected and within 3 days. Very satisfied. Much better than paying $75 at department stores.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure that I was going to like it since I had not tested this perfume. But it was better than I had expected!  Guys love it on me!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff, quite inexpensive for the largest size. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I use this perfume each and every day and I absolutely love the smell! I get compliments all the time on the scent and will never switch to a different scent unless they quit making this amazing perfume!(:</li>
    <li> Just as advertised .. no complaints here.</li>
    <li> I like this brand and it last from the time I get up till I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Kohls does sell this brand if anyone wants to know.</li>
    <li> I noticed when I had added two of the same items into my cart that the packaging shown varied. I did a little bit of research and found that this perfume is made by Elizabeth Arden Designer house (previously New Wave Fragrances). So watch for products that carry this tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Arden acquires New Wave Fragrances brands&lt;br /&gt;[...] &gt; News &gt; Consumer GoodsShareJun 1, 2012 - ... and True Religion fragrance brands which form part of New. ... the France-based luxury goods company recently made several acquisitions ...</li>
    <li> So i bought this for my GF and she said she really likes it.. i even like it one her, when shes around me it smells really capturing.</li>
    <li> Initially bought this as a gift for sister in law. Decided to keep it instead for myself and absolutely love it. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i  really  like it !!  gaved  it as  a  X mas  gift !!  Daughter  liked  it !  it  came  in  a nice  package !  like  the  smell !</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so good!  I receive so many compliments when I wear this!  This perfume has become of one of my favorites!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell original.Dont waist your money.</li>
    <li> Perfect..My favorite!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my daughter on her birthday. She was using the fake imitation brands for many years. I decided to buy her the original fragrance. The case and the bottle are very nice. The price was reasonable and lower than at the stores. The original scent is so fruity and refreshing. My daughter loves it. I would definitely recommend it to other females....</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this item was actually THE REAL SCENT given the lower price. Thank you very much! I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this spray, it smells so good, and a little goes a long way. I will need more soon and will purchase from the same seller if possible.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent EVER!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the real thing or not.  However, it smells wonderful and is way cheaper than department stores.  This is my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> The first time I purchased this product was from Macy&#x27;s, but we all know that it can be expensive so I found it on amazon for a way better price. I love this fragrance and it always brings compliments. I would definitely buy this product again. I have used this product for years now and I just love the fruity smell it has.</li>
    <li> It came when it was suppose to and it was exactly what I was expecting. Its so much better than spending almost $100 at Macy&#x27;s for the exact same item.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I purchased. Not even the same smell.  The fragrance lasts for 15 minutes max.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance. It has a light, sweet scent and I always get compliments on this fragrance.</li>
    <li> The price at the mall was almost triple this price! It even arrived a day earlier than expected. I get many compliments in how well I smell when I where this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Ed Hardy from local retail stores and this particular bottle the fragrance does not last as long as what I have purchased in the stores . Frustrating to have a favorite product that just seems like goes away after about twenty minutes. And no one comments on the fragrance like they did when i was wearing the store bought fragrance.</li>
    <li> I loved it. The first order didnt come, but i was very impressed with how the company sustoner service handled it. I recieved my perfume withing less then a week. It smells great and i am very happy. Will be ordering another one soon.</li>
    <li> I also read some negative reviews &amp; decided to order anyhow. I thought if it&#x27;s super light, I&#x27;ll just use it for an after bath splash. I don&#x27;t think the scent lasts more than a few hours, but even some expensive perfumes have the same staying power. The bottle is huge!!! So there&#x27;s plenty to reapply as you see fit. This is my 3rd bottle of &#x27;Hearts &amp; Daggers&#x27; &amp; it smells the same to me. Feminine &amp; Sexy!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It smells amazing and it stays with you all day. I have gotten so many compliments from wearing it.</li>
    <li> my favorite cologne at a great price</li>
    <li> One of my most favorite perfumes to wear.  its not overbearing but its not something that just wears off in an hour or less.  Now my mother in law and sister in law are addicted.</li>
    <li> I forgot how much i love this smell. It comes in a nice tube that you can throw in your book bag.</li>
    <li> i think this is not the real thing, if it is it does not stay with you like my old cologne did.  not happy with this at all.</li>
    <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ It. 👍 #Thanks_Amazon</li>
    <li> Great purchase!  The real thing!!!  Smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this paticular parfum! It smells great and for the price, you can&#x27;t do better!!! Again best parfum ever!</li>
    <li> I ordered this even though I had read the review stating that it might not be the real thing. I went on the fact that the picture contained the \\&quot;by Christian Audigier.\\&quot; The bottle I received did NOT have that line and is manufactured by New Wave Fragrances (and has NO reference to Christian Audigier). I called Amazon to complain and was told that there is no guarantee that if I ordered another bottle it would be any different. They were kind enough to issue me a refund, and since there are no returns on liquids, I do get to keep the bottle. It just irritates me that something sold and shipped from Amazon would be a knock-off.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for years and ordered it from Amazon this time because of the price.  It is a knock off!!  The bottle does not even say &amp;#34;by Christian Audigier&amp;#34; on it.  And I still have my old bottle and compared the two.... the bottle I ordered from here is a lot cheaper and, like I said, does not have the full name on it.  And it does NOT smell anything alike.  It has a much cheaper and more &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; like smell to it and almost immediately fades.  It&#x27;s horrible.  And there is no way to return it because it is classified as a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; or something like that.  I am VERY disappointed.  Do not order this from Amazon. I should have read the other reviews that said this happened to them too.</li>
    <li> I orsdered this for an xmas gift. It came when scheduled and was cheaper than i would have been able to get it elsewhere</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this product before off amazon as a refill cause it was cheaper online and i loved it the bottle said by Christian and everything. I purchased this again a little more expensive but i still bought it, i was so upset when i got this one it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real thing that&#x27;s what gave it away. I then took a look at the bottle it didn&#x27;t say by Christian anywhere on the bottle its made from new wave fragrances so if you see any perfume from them its a knock off..i wasted 40 bucks not worth my time to call and complain though. Just keep your eyes open :)</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance &amp; love the price!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance, it is my absolute favorite next to 273. I will order me some more as soon as my bottle gets more. I think I use this everyday, and I have lots of other ones, but I always chose this.</li>
