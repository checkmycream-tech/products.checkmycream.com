      <li>Love this!!</li>
      <li>Despite it&#x27;s smell (not a problem for me) it is very effective in loosening the plaque, and followup shampooing with P &amp; S Shampoo finishes the job nicely!  </li>

      <li>so went years without it, but had med that took care of ,most of my plaque psoriasis.....</li>
      <li>Most shampoos have a preservative called methylisothyazolinone which causes a rash and flakiness.  </li>

      <li>Once in the bluest of moons I need a little more power to get rid of the flakiness.  </li>
      <li>What P&amp;S liquid does is soften and clear the scales.</li>
      <li>The next night before applying again I&#x27;ll try to remove as much of the soft scales as I can and then re-apply.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s messy, and it requires a system to get everything done properly (to my liking), but I&#x27;ve not found a better way</li>
      <li>After five different prescription meds, my third dermatologist suggested P &amp; S liquid as part of a first step to clear my inverse psoriasis .</li>
      <li>Apparently this is an old remedy.  </li>
      <li>True, it is a bit messy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works but, not like DermaSmoothe&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again</li>
    <li> I cannot believe a dermatologist charges $32.00 for a product that is basically mineral oil plus food coloring! I returned it when I read the ingredients and bought a bottle of mineral oil for$2.99. Psoriasis is a heartbreaking condition-to take advantage of someone&#x27;s misery and sell them this snake oil is a sin.</li>
    <li> This solution not only helps condition the scalp, it helps with the flaking and scaling of the scalp. I also use the P&amp;s shampoo twice a week. The combination of the two soothes my seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s messy. It&#x27;s a pain to apply and a pain to remove... but it really does help. There is no cure for psoriasis. What P&amp;S liquid does is soften and clear the scales. It also makes my scalp itch a lot less.</li>
    <li> After five different prescription meds, my third dermatologist suggested P &amp; S liquid as part of a first step to clear my inverse psoriasis . It worked! Also have to use P &amp; S shampoo to remove liquid the next a.m.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time for Plaque Psoriasis</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  It softens and gets rid of the flakiness of my scalp from Psoriasis, and allows topical medications to penetrate/work better. You must get the shampoo with it to wash it out completely, and have your hair looking good to go.  It is messy and the smell is ok, though a bit strong.  It washes out of clothes/sheets/towels easily.</li>
    <li> Ihad used P&amp;S for a few years, having thick plaque psoriasis all over and bad in my hair....was becoming bald...But once I started P&amp;S the plaque left and hair grew back.....Then The supplier didn;t make it anymore...so went years without it, but had med that took care of ,most of my plaque psoriasis.....But was diagnosed with breast cancer, had to get off the Enbrel and my body, of course, reacted and back to heavy scaling in my head....Luckily I found Bakers P&amp;S again....I have been using it for 4 weeks now, have noticed my hair is falling out some with it, but could be my hed scaling so fast....But when I use it, I KNOW eventually it will work...Once I start chemo, this week, I know I will become bald, but pray the liquid will get rid of the scaling and then I can look like Kojak with a shiny bald head~!~~</li>
    <li> Love this!! I have scalp psoriasis and this help remove the dry patches. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell but it works. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is easy to apply with eyedropper, shower cap at night, and shampoo in the morning.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> The oil seems to working on my chronic psorisis/</li>
    <li> This stuff is smelly and so very oily.  But it works when you leave it in long enough. I had very thick psoriasis plaque and it did work to clear it so the other medicines can reach the scalp, but it is messy and a lot of work.  Plan for time to shampoo at least 5 times after using it.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis of the scalp  By using this product twice a week before shampooing   the scalp, the flaking is totally under control.  One should sleep with the product on   with a shower cap which is its only drawback.  But another plus I have noticed is that  I have fewer facial breakouts.</li>
    <li> Messy but very effective for battling scalp psoriasis.</li>
    <li> P&amp;S liquid works very well on the heavy scaling on my scalp due to psoriasis and is less expensive than the prescription  product I hdd been using</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past 20 years and have had great results. It will not lighten the color of your skin as some prescription creams I have used along my hairline and doesn&#x27;t jack up your immune system as some injections can.      True, it is a bit messy. I always rub it in before bedtime and wash it out in the morning and typically do this for 2 or 3 days before needing a haircut. The next night before applying again I&#x27;ll try to remove as much of the soft scales as I can and then re-apply. Tedious and annoying, but what other SAFE &amp; EFFECTIVE choices do you have?</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughters scalp condition.  It worked better than the prescriptions she&#x27;s used!  I see no flakes in her hair.  Extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> It breaks up the plaque on my scalp - don&#x27;t like wearing shower cap and all that and smell isn&#x27;t great but it does whqt it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Cleared my granddaughters scalp up in just a few days. We will continue using this each time it returns. Very good product.</li>
    <li> After years of treatment for scalp psorisas, many different products, and seeing four different Dermatologists, P &amp; S Liquid  has helped more than anything prescribed to date.  Despite it&#x27;s smell (not a problem for me) it is very effective in loosening the plaque, and followup shampooing with P &amp; S Shampoo finishes the job nicely!  My Dermatologist prescribed Betamethasone Dipropionate Lotion for use after the P &amp; S treatment for trouble spots.  Very happy with results.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist to remove thick flaky patches on my child&#x27;s scalp due to psoriasis.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other reviewers mentioned (my child actually liked the smell!).  Will continue to use once a week to keep flakiness in check.</li>
    <li> I only had to apply twice.</li>
    <li> messy to use, would not purchase again and only had relief for one day</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my son on advice from dermatologist.  Worked perfectly! Follow doctors recommendations, not bottle instructions.</li>
    <li> Was a bit messy to use.Could use a tip on it to apply. Seemed to help get rid of the build up tho,</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my dermatitis, including corticosteriod liquid which makes me dizzy.  Apparently this is an old remedy.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; your scalp, but it does soften the scales so you can massage them off.  Also the big surprise is, my hair looks great!  I don&#x27;t mind washing my hair more often because it&#x27;s soft and mangeable after using this product and leaving it on for several hours.  Overnight I will try after I get some shower caps.  I will purchase more of this product.</li>
    <li> Used this product over 40 years ago and it worked well.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good now.  It has a fragrance and coloring now which I would prefer not to have.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product it relieves my scalp problem due tp psoriasis.I had been using a prescription cream &amp; it was no longer working &amp; i had used this oil before br recommendation of my dermatologist as an alternative.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis.  I do use the P &amp; S shampoo as recommended by my dermatologist years ago.  Most shampoos have a preservative called methylisothyazolinone which causes a rash and flakiness.  Once in the bluest of moons I need a little more power to get rid of the flakiness.  I rubbed this into my scalp and the next day I saw an improvement.  Haven&#x27;t had to use it since but still rely on the shampoo more often than not.  I keep the oil on standby.</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Can&#x27;t stay too long with out it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best place to get it. My pharmacy never has it.&lt;br /&gt;This is also the best price too! Thanks</li>
    <li> I use this quite often.  It&#x27;s messy, and it requires a system to get everything done properly (to my liking), but I&#x27;ve not found a better way and so a loyal customer I stay!</li>
    <li> I got the product quickly and all in tact!</li>
