      <li>it&#x27;s a very pretty color BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
      <li>Go s on smooth drys fast leaves a pretty shine won&#x27;t chip off</li>
      <li>I really thought it would be a great pop of bright pink over any color, however it turns out i can only use this on colors that are almost white!</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t really stamp as good as the other ones that I bought.  </li>
      <li>I wish Konad would get real and lower their prices!</li>

      <li>but its pretty to use as an all over nail color</li>

      <li>Bottle is one ml more than regular Konad polishes, as its from the princess collection.</li>
      <li>Pretty bummed, because I don&#x27;t regularly use super light polishes.</li>
      <li>Pretty color works very well with my nail stamping kit.</li>

      <li>so I didn&#x27;t spend so much</li>
      <li>Definitely not going to buy it again, nothing special about this nail</li>
      <li>It looks cute on her (9 yrs old) and shows the black stamp very well.</li>
      <li>The color is amazing, and it&#x27;s great to have for nail art, but I&#x27;m afraid to play around with it because its pricey and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll last all that long.</li>
      <li>The pink is true to the picture.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not stamp as the nail polish is not thick enough.</li>
      <li>It goes with the stamping kit made by Konad so if you are looking for new colors for your kit, I totally recommend this one.</li>

<li> this is a really pretty shade of pink, but i have had a hard time getting it to show up when using it with stamps.</li>
<li> and i even received it five days earlier than expected ..</li>

<li> it is way too thick and is made only for design uses.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if i just got a bad batch or bottle of this, but i was so excited for this color.</li>
<li> I threw it in the trash a waste of money.</li>
<li> DO NOT use this polish a base polish (to coat your whole nail without design)</li>
<li> the polish is still very thin so still having a little problems when stamping, cheaper</li>
<li> It was a a bit disappointing that I couldn&#x27;t do a pink print over a a purple or black base.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if i just got a bad batch or bottle of this, but i was so excited for this color. I really thought it would be a great pop of bright pink over any color, however it turns out i can only use this on colors that are almost white! Pretty bummed, because I don&#x27;t regularly use super light polishes.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. This is for the Konad Nail Stamping Art/Kit.  This is not a regular polish and it cannot be used as a regular polish. It goes with the stamping kit made by Konad so if you are looking for new colors for your kit, I totally recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I think Konad is amazing.  This polish is a grand color that I just adore.  It adds a nice touch to almost any nail.  This is to be used as a polish for Konad image plates only.  DO NOT use this polish a base polish (to coat your whole nail without design) it is way too thick and is made only for design uses.</li>
    <li> Color is pretty in bottle. I do like the Pueen colors better. More opaque</li>
    <li> The color is amazing, and it&#x27;s great to have for nail art, but I&#x27;m afraid to play around with it because its pricey and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll last all that long. Regardless, it&#x27;s pretty, it works, and I&#x27;m just too poor to waste polish like this, haha.</li>
    <li> i got it a year ago...it doesn&#x27;t show up on some nail polishes but looks great on white...its ok i guess.</li>
    <li> This color is awesome and I was really looking forward to getting it. It looks really pretty with light color bases but it doesn&#x27;t show up at all against darker colors. It was a a bit disappointing that I couldn&#x27;t do a pink print over a a purple or black base. I only use it over white really and it&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
    <li> The pink is true to the picture. The size of bottle is fair also. Note that this is a polish designed for stamping plate nail art, it is not intended for use as just a polish.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit spendy for a nail art only polish. I wish Konad would get real and lower their prices!</li>
    <li> Awesome pink color! Shows well on white or black. Very pearlecent and sparkly. Bottle is one ml more than regular Konad polishes, as its from the princess collection.</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL!!! I love all of Konad&#x27;s items! They are great to use and fun eye catching colors! I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> The polish is to shear and it don&#x27;t work for stamping. I threw it in the trash a waste of money.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It was so light and I use it for stamping on my nails.  I can&#x27;t give it a double coat so it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I received this product way sooner than I expected, which is awesome! It is also true to the color in the picture. I am very pleased with the product and cannot wait to try it on my new stamps that should be here tomorrow!</li>
    <li> Love this bright pink Konad polish works great with my stamps and stays in place and dries quickly</li>
    <li> Pretty color works very well with my nail stamping kit. A super fun bright and cheery color. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great stamping - Konad rocks</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a very pretty color BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT the polish is still very thin so still having a little problems when stamping, cheaper i got regular polish and thicken it up</li>
    <li> I finally got my order from this seller in the mail and its an Awesome product and i even received it five days earlier than expected .. And very reliable seller I would def buy more stuff from this seller. I was nervous so I didn&#x27;t spend so much but now that I know for sure ill have some shopping to do lol thank you!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color and it does look like Salley Hansen&#x27;s Twisted Pink. It goes on nicely. It appears to be a similar color to my stamper so I can&#x27;t see the image on the stamper before I put it on my nails. This color appears to be the same as shown in the picture and it came packaged in an envelope with minimum buble wrap, but it was in tact.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use.But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear. The colors are great.</li>
    <li> wish the color was brighter</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered this color to go along with her konad starter kit. It looks cute on her (9 yrs old) and shows the black stamp very well. It dries quickly even on the non stamped nail. I have worn it twice myself.</li>
    <li> this is a really pretty shade of pink, but i have had a hard time getting it to show up when using it with stamps. i feel like its not quite opaque enough....? but its pretty to use as an all over nail color</li>
    <li> Product is as good as it gets.love the color works good will buy again when i run out! Happy stamping.</li>
    <li> Great color, easy and fast.  Gives me a variety of colors for nail stamping.  Their kits and supplies are great!</li>
    <li> Go s on smooth drys fast leaves a pretty shine won&#x27;t chip off last a long tineand i live pink and red and clear and blue</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really stamp as good as the other ones that I bought.  I bought the white one and that stamped a lot better.</li>
    <li> Definitely not going to buy it again, nothing special about this nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stamp as the nail polish is not thick enough.</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
