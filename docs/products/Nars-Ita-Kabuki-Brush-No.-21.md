      <li>Works better than any brush for contouring.</li>
      <li>I really love this &#x27;NARS Ita Kabuki Brush No. 21</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>All if the dupes work ok</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m probably thinking I need another just to be on safe side.</li>
      <li>Thought it would work better</li>
      <li>Benefit&#x27;s brush bristles are set wider (more flared out)</li>
      <li>i just love how my bronzer looks after i am done after using this brush</li>
      <li>The flat head gives you the perfect line to begin the contouring of your cheek.</li>
      <li>I can say that i&#x27;m pretty good with makeup but contouring</li>
      <li>I realized just how special this brush is!</li>
      <li>ALSO, I have this brush, and I think it&#x27;s fine, but I honestly prefer the MAC 163 (think that&#x27;s the right one)&amp; I&#x27;m not one to buy a lot of MAC brushes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
      <li>Its shape makes it easy to hold and worj with on your face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to work with, and you get a lot of color payoff when contouring.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll see just how easy it is.</li>
      <li>I read reviews how dense the brush is but thought it&#x27;d be great for contouring, but my thoughts on it is if you were using creams to sculpt (flat and very dense) this brush would be good</li>
      <li>This brush makes contouring so easy well worth every penny and more.</li>
      <li>Before I got this one I always liked to use a large angled brush, it worked well, but this NARS brush is now</li>
      <li>The application is smooth and blends wells.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anybody who thinks that bronzer and contouring is important for your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>but none are near as good as this one.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the price, since it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get right!</li>
      <li>This brush is half the price of the MAC brush and works just as good!</li>
      <li>I had heard so much about this brush and looked forward, but it is just okay, not as great as expected.  </li>
      <li>The shape of the brush makes for easy and fast bronzing and contouring on your cheek bones!</li>
      <li>And when you&#x27;re ready to blend, you just wiggle the brush a little, and you have the perfect contour.  </li>
      <li>My shipment came in quickly.</li>
      <li>It made everything super easy and blends really well.</li>
      <li>Which if push comes to shove, the Benefit&#x27;s complimentary brush does just as well</li>
      <li>Worth the money and the hassle of eBay shopping</li>
      <li>so I guess it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Paid a bit more than regular but worth it!</li>
      <li>This brush shape seems to do what no other brush can when it comes to contouring cheekbones, nose, jawline and a lot more.  </li>
      <li>okay, however I wish it were a little more densely packed.</li>
      <li>They have since changed the price but even at a higher price</li>
      <li>It works great but find not putting so much bronzer on it is better because it gives a very defined finish and if you have too much powder it leaves a dark line cross your face.</li>
      <li>I first got in mail</li>
      <li>The longer handle makes it nice and easy where as the Benefit&#x27;s brush handle is very small.</li>
      <li>Gives you amazing acute lines and also can be used with bronzer but be careful because it really lays down the powder</li>
      <li>u get a real contour exactly where u want it.</li>
      <li>Nars is not even a finger width making it easy to chisel out that contour, turn to the side and blend it out, using this for sculpting out the face is made simple.</li>
      <li>so I know it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a Sigma junkie, so when I really like a brush, I&#x27;ll tell everyone.</li>
      <li>i use this brush for my bronzer and let me just say that it really works</li>
      <li>really like how the blush looks after aplying it with this brush</li>
      <li>I can really see a difference.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush</li>
      <li>Overall I am happy with it, got the one with the long handle, my only concern is that I hope it wont shed to much.</li>
      <li>It took me a few times but now its so easy and quick.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and not really dense, but they pick up an adequate amount of bronzer/blush/contour without having to keep going back for more.  </li>
      <li>All stores that carry this brush including Nars were on back order and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was coming back.</li>
      <li>This brush was highly rated for contouring.</li>

    <li> This is a very good brush!  This brush shape seems to do what no other brush can when it comes to contouring cheekbones, nose, jawline and a lot more.  Being as narrow as it is, it can make those famous &amp;#34;cheekbones so sharp they can cut paper&amp;#34;!  The bristles are very soft and not really dense, but they pick up an adequate amount of bronzer/blush/contour without having to keep going back for more.  Because of the way it is made, there is no sharp, artificial-looking line on my face so that I have to work really hard to make it look natural.  I have used a lot of brushes and decided to splurge.  I  recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! just love it for contouring :D</li>
    <li> Perfect for contouring!!!!</li>
    <li> I had been wanting this brush for a while and now that I have it I&#x27;m in love. It works great but find not putting so much bronzer on it is better because it gives a very defined finish and if you have too much powder it leaves a dark line cross your face.</li>
    <li> its realy good brush for pro or sterter poeple in makeup i love to have nice countor brush like this</li>
    <li> Learned about this brush from jaclyn hill. She is amazing and so is the brush! Works awesome for contouring. love.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for bronzer. Love it! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Everybody should have one. Would  purchase this brush again.</li>
    <li> This brush makes contouring so easy well worth every penny and more. Its one of my can&#x27;t nod without brushes!</li>
    <li> I had heard so much about this brush and looked forward, but it is just okay, not as great as expected.  The bristles bent quickly and it didn&#x27;t clean  very well and was difficult to handle.</li>
    <li> My shipment came in quickly. The brush is wonderful it is soft and the shape of it is great for contouring. It is definitely a brush I use everyday. Also it came in NARS packaging so I know it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> I like this brush okay, however I wish it were a little more densely packed. The hairs aren&#x27;t packed as tightly as I wish they were.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, I use Only for contour on cheek hollows, forehead and neck/decollate. The hair is not as soft but has just the right amount of  stiffness to it, which I actually was hoping for b/c I am not using it for any delicate areas on the face, so I didn&#x27;t want it to be too soft. Overall I am happy with it, got the one with the long handle, my only concern is that I hope it wont shed to much. Ive washed it and have used it for a couple weeks now and has shed 2 hairs...I hope it was just breaking in and it will stop now. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this little brush for contouring! It is so easy to use and makes the process a lot quicker!</li>
    <li> the best brush for contouring. easy to use - just sweep down the sides of your nose and the hollows of your cheeks and voila! so fab.</li>
    <li> Brush arrived on time and in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this brush because I had heard nothing but good things about it&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush for anyone who is looking for a brush for highlighting and contouring</li>
    <li> i use this brush for my bronzer and let me just say that it really works i just love how my bronzer looks after i am done after using this brush</li>
    <li> This brush makes it very easy to apply bronzer and highlight/contour the face. Only downer, it&#x27;s expensive, as with all NARS products.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! This brush works exceptionally well for applying bronzer to the contours of the face. The application is smooth and blends wells. The bristles pick up a lot of product, so be sure to tap off the excess powder before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is quite expensive, but is totally worth purchasing if you like to contour often or are really seeking a professional finish.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected for its high dollar price</li>
    <li> I use it daily, helped me break into really learning how to contour my face. I LOVE IT!!! A need in the makeup brushes colection</li>
    <li> I was using Benefit&#x27;s, Hoola bronzing powder brush. Now that I finally got this one there&#x27;s really no contest. The longer handle makes it nice and easy where as the Benefit&#x27;s brush handle is very small. Benefit&#x27;s brush bristles are set wider (more flared out) Nars is not even a finger width making it easy to chisel out that contour, turn to the side and blend it out, using this for sculpting out the face is made simple. The bristles are incredibly soft and transfer of color from brush to face is flawless! If you want a visual demonstration there&#x27;s quite a few reviews on this brush on YouTube. Btw, I&#x27;ve been waiting for this brush for months! All stores that carry this brush including Nars were on back order and wasn&#x27;t sure if it was coming back. Whew, love it! I&#x27;m probably thinking I need another just to be on safe side. Which if push comes to shove, the Benefit&#x27;s complimentary brush does just as well if you use the one side to sculpt and flat to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Illemasqua&#x27;s Blush Up Brush. I read reviews how dense the brush is but thought it&#x27;d be great for contouring, but my thoughts on it is if you were using creams to sculpt (flat and very dense) this brush would be good but you&#x27;d need to have your contouring skills down in order to make it happen, just saying. Not for a heavy handed application for sure when using illemasqua&#x27;s. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people want this brush because of Jaclyn Hill. Don&#x27;t buy it here, you can get it cheaper. ALSO, I have this brush, and I think it&#x27;s fine, but I honestly prefer the MAC 163 (think that&#x27;s the right one)&amp; I&#x27;m not one to buy a lot of MAC brushes. I&#x27;m a Sigma junkie, so when I really like a brush, I&#x27;ll tell everyone. It has same shape as the ITA, it has nice dense bristles&amp; application/blending is flawless.</li>
    <li> Gives you amazing acute lines and also can be used with bronzer but be careful because it really lays down the powder</li>
    <li> This brush works amazingly for contouring! The flat head gives you the perfect line to begin the contouring of your cheek. And when you&#x27;re ready to blend, you just wiggle the brush a little, and you have the perfect contour.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and I&#x27;ve used a few different brushes for contouring. Before I got this one I always liked to use a large angled brush, it worked well, but this NARS brush is now my &#x27;go to&#x27; brush. A friend of mine has the MAC brush that&#x27;s very similar to this one, and we tried them out together and got the same result. This brush is half the price of the MAC brush and works just as good! It&#x27;s also a great brush for people that are just beginning to learn how to contour their face. It&#x27;s so easy to use. FYI- if there are any beginners looking into purchasing this brush, Jaclyn Hill has a great video on YouTube using this brush for a contouring tutorial. So definitely check that out and you&#x27;ll see just how easy it is. I highly recommend this brush as well as other NARS products!</li>
    <li> I can say that i&#x27;m pretty good with makeup but contouring I just couldn&#x27;t get right! I didn&#x27;t know what it was until I read various reviews about the type of brush your&#x27;e supposed to use. This brush was highly rated for contouring. I was resistant on paying this much for one brush, but when I couldn&#x27;t get my contouring down I gave in and bought it. And i&#x27;m SO glad that I did! The first time I used this brush for contouring, it came out perfect!!! VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> I had never contoured before buying this brush.  It made everything super easy and blends really well. Leaves no harsh lines.</li>
    <li> Its unbelievable for contouring !!!!! I have a bunch of brushes...this one worked like magiiiccccc for the cheekbones u get a real contour exactly where u want it. Its shape makes it easy to hold and worj with on your face.</li>
    <li> great tool for contouring</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anybody who thinks that bronzer and contouring is important for your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This product does the BEST JOB at contouring. for your cheek bones, for your nose, for your forehead, and for your jawline, this product is so perfect. DONT EVEN CONSIDER JUST GET IT.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that is having problems contouring. The shape of the brush makes for easy and fast bronzing and contouring on your cheek bones! I was never able to see it in pictures before but now with this brush  I can really see a difference. It can be used for day time and buildable for night time use as well! Tap it a few times in your bronzer or color, tap the excess and make a line from ear to the middle of your cheek. Then blend up and down. It took me a few times but now its so easy and quick. Love the brush,took a star away because of the price. Nars is the only makeup company that I have seen make a brush like this so I guess it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Thought it would work better</li>
    <li> A high quality makeup brush -- worth the price ( not cheap ) for applying bronzer &amp; highlighter. I would recommend it definitely .</li>
    <li> this is the best contour brush, great hairs and as all of Nars products that I have tried it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for contouring. I don&#x27;t mind the price, since it&#x27;s worth it! It&#x27;s easy to work with, and you get a lot of color payoff when contouring.</li>
    <li> Hello Everybody How Are You?&lt;br /&gt;I would like to say. I really love this &#x27;NARS Ita Kabuki Brush No. 21&#x27; I am using it to contour my face and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this for contouring! It gets in your cheekbones really good. If you like to contour then this is the best brush out there. I&#x27;m sad that its currently unavailable because I want to buy another one!</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day for contouring and think it&#x27;s the best on the market. They have since changed the price but even at a higher price I think it&#x27;s worth it. All if the dupes work ok but none are near as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I love it and I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I had to buy this brush on eBay since it&#x27;s sold out everywhere. Paid a bit more than regular but worth it! Saw this on makeup guru shaaanxo YouTube video. A-mazing! I have TONS of brushes and makeup too! The best!&lt;br /&gt;When I first got in mail I thought I got a fake due to the cheap packaging and even the brush a little. But after dabbing on some Nars Laguna into the hollows of my cheeks I realized just how special this brush is! Works better than any brush for contouring. Perfect. Worth the money and the hassle of eBay shopping</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;I really like how the blush looks after aplying it with this brush, it looks even and soft in the face.</li>
    <li> Terrible! The brush shipped appears to be a fake. It smells terrible &amp; the finish &amp; stitching was already coming off before I even opened the package. Will return immediately!</li>
    <li> It works well for contouring</li>
    <li> Best contour brush ever. ever.</li>
</ol>
