<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this. It has helped so much with my acne. You will see results fast.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery, love that a Welcome Guide and coupon are emailed to arrive around the time the order arrives--nice touch!</li>
    <li> Oh em gee. This worked almost immediately After putting on my face. I use it by mixing a good amount with my moisturizer. It works! I&#x27;ve always had bad acne prone oily skin (thanks genes!). Recently I got all these bumps on my face, and only after using this they are gone / almost gone in just a few days! Works better than any acne treatment I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried even prescription topical treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the tiny size bottle. Like, what difference would it make if you bought a larger size tea tree oil product for the same price? :/</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
    <li> I had some bad spots on my face and thought id try this but I qasnt hopeful at all, after one use I can seriously tell the difference.  It made the breakouts so much better, it seriously took away my acne within days of using it. It has a weird smell, but its not horrible like some people say. I applied this directly to my face and I had no irritation like some people have said. I love this stuff. although the bottle is small the description is serious when they say you need a few drops. I&#x27;ll be buying this again</li>
    <li> Strong smell. Bottle small for price. Makes my face break out more than before</li>
    <li> Whenever I have a breakout (or feel one coming) I dab some of this on, it&#x27;s very good for drying them up and making them go away much faster! If you catch them soon enough you can also prevent them from showing up :) I&#x27;ve tried using it all over my face (diluted with water) as a toner, but didn&#x27;t find it as effective. If you are going to put it all over your face I would definitely advise that you dilute it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. This worked on a really stubborn pimple I had for over a week in just a few days. I did apply several times a day. It smells of tea Tree Oil, which isn&#x27;t the best smell ever, but it goes away quick &amp; is fast absorbing. I had tee tree oil on hand, and probably could have just used it, diluted with a carrier oil, but this is convenient. Works great and is all natural and non- drying. Works because of tee tree oil&#x27;s natural antibiotic properties. Give it a try, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and it seems to be already fading my acne scars on my face and chest. The smell is awful but I&#x27;m getting used to it. I mixed the oil with my daytime moisturizer and then I spot apply the oil directly to my worst areas at nighttime.</li>
    <li> No effect - also smells awful</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews but this product is amazing! I recently had a major breakout due to stress and the acne stayed even after the stress went away. I tried everything but nothing seemed to work till I tried this. It has been amazing. I use it with almond oil nightly after I wash my face with mild soap. The smell is strong so I don&#x27;t use it in the morning but you could to do a spot treatment. My mom and I both use this product now and we have never been happier with any product. It really does work and works fast. I have yet to try their other products but if it is as good as this one I&#x27;m sure it will be a good choice.</li>
    <li> Essential tea tree for a great price. Excellent on blemishes. If you have pets, please be sure to keep away. This is very toxic for them.</li>
    <li> This product stinks and don&#x27;t work either</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t dried skin out and has worked quicker and better than otc acne creams that my children and I have used.</li>
    <li> I got a bad rash on my face after usiong this - had one of the worst breakouts. It also has a very strong smell.My bottle is still full bc I only applied it once!</li>
    <li> I dabbed a little directly on a problem spot, and within four hours, the spot was gone. I plan to add a few drops to my moisturizer and use it nightly to see if I can clear my skin a bit more.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with acne breakouts, they are not bad, just one or two pop up at a time, but they always give me problems and they are always VERY NOTICEABLE!!!  At my age, I can not stand having acne.  I have heard great things in the past about Tea Tree oil, but was told that you have to be careful because it is very strong.  So when I saw that this was specifically formulated for acne I had to try it.  I waited for a break out, which was not very long, and used just a small amount.  I was surprised at how quickly it cleared it up!!!! I recommend this to anyone who has breakouts, whether it is just a few here or there or severe acne, this is the perfect solution to clear it up.  I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> These product gets a A+ so far so good removed scars I didn&#x27;t even know was removable lightened my skin with a glow and also lightened the darkness underneath my eyes great product make this product available all the time I will be ordering more</li>
    <li> this works great. I cant believe how fast its been working leaving my skin beautiful</li>
    <li> This TreeActiv+ tea tree oil acne treatment is great! At first, I was concerned about the size, but you only need a tiny amount to do spot treatments. I, personally, don&#x27;t experience heavy breakouts but I do get bumps and blemishes like everyone else. I used this tea tree treatment on my blemishes and it really helps to clear them up! My boyfriend is much more acne prone than I am, so I had him use this treatment as well. It has been great at clearing up his minor blemishes, and has significantly helped to treat his more prominent acne. I have to say that I am impressed with its effectiveness. It shipped out to me very quickly, and arrived in perfect condition. The vial hadn&#x27;t leaked at all. I would definitely repurchase. (I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> I mixed the TreeActive tea tree oil along with a carrier oil as I have never used it on my face . tip for me bonus, it will give your skin an absolute boost the first time I used it  ..I can only imagine what my skin will feel and and look after a month for sure .This is my sole unbiased opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> This oil WORKS. directions say to mix with water or almond oil. i dont do that. it is much more effective just putting it on pure. anyways, this thing clears up your face! sounds like bs, i know.. but it is very inexpensive, and does its job. the bottle is tiny but its all you need. soon i will order a couple more of these. one thing tho, dont put this on and go out, because it has a very strong odor, and when i used it at home, my parents thought i was spraying chemicals in the house. it doesnt burn either. (one time i did burn my eyes cause i put it to close, it also burns your nose if you inhale it)&lt;br /&gt;heres how i use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i get a small bowl, open the lid on the treeactic+ tap the bottom of it so it drops out little by little (cause it doesnt just pour out) then i make sure i wash my face and hands (i personally use cold water, even tho warm water opens up your pores) i then dip the tip of my index finger and apply it to the area, i rub it in a circular motion. i apply it every 4-6 hours (3x a day) the morning after i apply Coconut oil because if i dont my skin will get flakely (cause the treeactiv+ dries up my skin) and... thats pretty much it! you see results right away!</li>
    <li> The product seems fairly effective on cystic, developed acne that has come to a head . Not much help with blackheads or smaller blemishes. It&#x27;s not drying per se, but does have a slightly harsh feel if used alone. I have sensitive skin, so it may be fine on others. I mixed it with my moisturizer/facial serum. Redness is reduced, but acne doesn&#x27;t seem to fully go away. Not sure this was much more effective than rubbing alcohol for me. The scent is absolutely pungent (menthol-y pine on steroids) and almost caustic-feeling on the nasal passages, which has caused me to stop using it.  I also dislike that the bottle is glass, the top has a small hole, and it doesn&#x27;t really offer a good way to dispense the product. I ended up turning the bottle over and tapping the base to have it drop out tiny droplets into my palm. I wish I could just dip a q-tip in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product to test. I don&#x27;t have any active acne problem on my face, but recently got a reaction from another product as some rash on my face. I put on this oil on the rashes and they were gone in two days. I also suffer from scalp acne and started putting this on the spots and I am on my 6th day and those acne has reduced a lot in size, some are totally dried. I have been using medication for my scalp for past two months without any results, but this oil worked. I am going to continue using it until all acne are dried up. The only problem is very strong smell which is particular to tea tree oil. Except for the smell it is a fantastic product and I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS IT WORKS IT REALLY WORKS :) I&#x27;m going to order some for everybody I know!!!</li>
    <li> It makes my pimples worse.  I did not like this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have seen a great improvement with my breakouts. They are fewer and far between. My large cystic acne has lessened as well. I have changed a few of my habits like washing my face before and after a workout, using more blotting papers to control oil and using this in conjunction so I think it&#x27;s all working together nicely. It is a bit drying, but overall I am very happy with this product. I also like the smell.. it&#x27;s herbally, but not as bad as the other reviews make it out to be.</li>
    <li> This oil works great. Throughout my pregnancy I started getting acne and after I had my baby the acne got worse! I was fed up with over the counter products so I did some research on Amazon and found this product. I didn&#x27;t dilute the oil and put it on directly on my face and it did dry the areas out where I applied it, but I didn&#x27;t care because it made the pimpless shrink in size and eventually go away. It did take 3-4 days for me to notice a difference. I love this product and will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> I like how this oil has some postive effect on my skin but i&#x27;m not satisfied with it. As in other reviews, this oil is like a miracle for treating acne problems. But i have very bad hormone imbalance which causes my skin to breakout at random times. The thing that i like about this oil is that it works great as a toner that i use twice a day. I don&#x27;t like how it smells from the bottle but since I dilute it with water, it smells nice and fresh. I really was hoping that my search for a cure for my acne has come to an end but this oil has some amazing properties that calms my skin and even out my skin tone. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nothing to rave about. It doesnt get rid of pimples at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! My acne problem has  improved a lot.</li>
    <li> It is pretty smelly, but you only need to use a very small amount so it&#x27;s not completely overpowering.  Works well!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any major improvement.</li>
    <li> Tea tree is one of my favorite oils to use, i was excited to get this at such a discounted price i use tea tree quite a bit on my toes have used this on my face for blemishes or a pimple that didnt go away, i have used tea tree alot i was able to give an honest and unbiased opinion of this product because it in fact does work. This product doesnt cause irritation at all, this is a great antifungal works great</li>
    <li> bottle bottom was broken and all the contents missing</li>
    <li> So far so good! #allnatural</li>
    <li> I preferred to mix it with unrefined cold pressed coconut oil instead of almond oil. It improved the red discoloration on my face and helped my acne to calm down and shrink up some. It doesn&#x27;t work for me as a primary source of acne treatment. Unfortunately I have very severe acne and sensitive combination skin.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I decided to try TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil. I am always looking for new things to keep my skin looking its best ! While I don&#x27;t suffer from any extreme case of acne I do get the occasional pimple here and there. Of course they usually decide to come at the worst possible times, like family photo time at Christmas. I get so annoyed because I have to cake extra makeup on that particular spot. Well I can tell you after trying TreeActiv+ I am simply amazed at how quickly it diminishes and gets rid of pimples. When I received the bottle I was slightly skeptical because of the size it is extremely tiny. But after receiving the helpful tips and tricks quide from the seller I understood that the size was perfect. I simply dabbed just 2 drops on my finger and applied it directly to my pimple before bed. I was amazed to find the next morning I could barely see it. I was so thrilled that I re-read the tips and tricks quide and decided to make method #3 which is a homemade acne eliminating face scrub and gift it to my friend who suffers from acne problems. And I can not wait to hear her amazing results as well ! This seller is more than helpful and 100% stands behind the product so I don&#x27;t think anyone would have anything to lose by giving it a try, you will be absolutely amazed at the results. ( I will update this review with photos)</li>
    <li> This stuff has a little burn to it but works great.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this product, from the reviews on amazon. After using 1/2th of a bottle, I see no improvement on my acne or pimples. I thought I would give it some more time, but now I&#x27;m at half a bottle 6 months later and still no improvement. I feel like my pimples go away faster with antiseptic cream than this. It smells natural, the ingredients feel natural, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Good quality tea tree oil.  I bought this oil to go with the TreeActiv facial mask and it works well with the product. There are also plenty of other uses for this oil. This is a very concentrated formula and you will have to dilute this if you are trying to use a lot of it on your skin at once. Tea tree oil can get quite expensive and this bottle is decently priced.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this tea tree oil. My pimples were gone in two days!</li>
    <li> This product came in very fast. I bought it for my teenage daughter who is an athlete. She&#x27;s been struggling with acne on her forehead for about a year. We have tried several products some worked better than others. We got her a pretty good regiment, but didn&#x27;t have it completely cleared up. I read the reviews on TreeActiv,and thought it was worth a try. Some people stated they noticed a difference the very next day, so I was pretty excited when my daughter did too. She&#x27;s only about a week in, and there already has been a huge change.</li>
    <li> Great my face is soft and clear no more acne!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! Keeps skin clear.</li>
    <li> Purchased this with the Tree Activ face wash and it is a  wonderful combination for acne / redness! After only 3 days my teens face is finally clearing up. Scent a little strong when first applied, but wears off in just seconds.Very satisfied with this product!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I bought this and the face mask together! Between the two products I feel my skin is looking much better and it definitely feeling better! I feel this product is a great little acne oil you can put directly on problem spots and is help cutting down on breakouts while the mask is helping with some of my acne scarring. I am sometimes bad about picking my skin, but I feel this product starts to work pretty quick and I am picking a lot less which is a very good thing!</li>
    <li> This is a must have! Great bottle with easy roll applicator and pleasant smell. I used it on a pimple and within 2 days it was virtually gone!! My 13 year old son is now using it as well for a few pimples and it is helping tremendously. I have ordered him his own bottle and is now using it daily. He has tried many products and none have been as effective as the TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution. My only wish was that I had discovered the product years ago. I did receive a discount on this product for my completely honest and unbiased opinion. I will definitely order again at full price when we need another one.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package I could smell the melaleuca oil right away, it has a distinctive odor and though the bottle was sealed well, it still smelled inside the envelope. I was extremely excited to try it since I smelled that smell, I knew this was a tree activ, tea tree oil but did not realize it was Melaleuca! So , it already left a positive vibe inside me just knowing I got to try the best oil I could think of. It is a small bottle but it is very concentrated and can be used in just a tiny drop inside a carrier oil but I used it full strength because I only used a little bit. I did not smear it all over my face , just a tiny drop on a small area. It is so cleansing and refreshing and has the antispetic properties so I felt good about using it on my face. I also gave it to my teenage daughter but I did have her dilute it a bit and not use full strength. I was happy to try the product for my unbiased opinion and am extremely pleased with the quality and the pure ingredients.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I was able to test this product out! I am fairly tanned, light-brown skin, and have mild acne and blemishes (which I think are acne scars that seem to last months).  I&#x27;ve tried clearasil and neutrogena acne products to help with the blemishes, but neither seemed to help. After about a week of using the TreeActiv+ my blemishes have started to lighten up. They&#x27;re not completely gone (as of yet) but at the rate its going, I&#x27;m sure it will be gone soon enough. As far as the product, it has a subtle scent (not too strong or overwhelming) and doesn&#x27;t feel too oily and rubs on pretty nicely. Doesn&#x27;t sting, burn and I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to the oil. Overall, it&#x27;s working great and I can&#x27;t wait to see the end result!</li>
    <li> seems to help clear up the acne faster.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly acne prone skin and I just came off prescription medication for acne (because I&#x27;m 25 and you would THINK I would be done with that) but all of the drugstore spot treatments I was using were just okay. This stuff works. I use it every night before bed on my problem areas and after about two weeks of regular use, I&#x27;m almost completely clear. I&#x27;m not sure about using it as a spot treatment, but as a preventative. It has definitely done the trick.</li>
    <li> Very oily, don&#x27;t like it. I didn&#x27;t see results</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the buy.  I&#x27;ve had acne since before I was a teenager and I&#x27;m 25 now.  I&#x27;m African American with oily skin so I was a little concerned that since this is an oil it would make my face even oilyer. BUT it did NOT! It&#x27;s actually very light on the skin. As soon as I put it on my face I felt tingling and immediate relief on big pimples. It has a very strong smell but I didn&#x27;t dilute it all. My skin has improved after one night of use. I also used a derma roller before application.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s tired of using the Over the counter products. Your skin might like the change :)</li>
    <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is how overwhelming the smell is but I suppose it&#x27;s to be expected with Tea Tree Oil</li>
    <li> not really work for pimples i use it for massage, headache, hair massage</li>
    <li> Makes a noticeable difference in a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service, was not expecting that.</li>
    <li> This works better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried for my daughter&#x27;s back acne...great, natural product!</li>
    <li> wonderful - smooths skin. Skin looks clearer just with a few uses.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Has greatly helped with my skin condition.  Great service!</li>
    <li> I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.  I am a big fan of tea tree oil and having it come in this small convenient packaging is perfect. The large bottle I had was wasteful and dispensed too much for a lot of things I used it for. This package is small and the way it dispenses if ideal. I can take it with me and reapply throughout the day when I need it. I currently do not have any breakouts, but I do use teatree oils for breakouts and it works wonderfully. This packaging is such a great improvement! I am a bit nervous I may drop it an it might break, but it seems very sturdy and not fragile at all.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find things for acne and blemishes that actually work. I received this TreeActiv + Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment for my honest and unbiased opinion.  It shipped very quickly. It came packaged nicely to prevent leakage. Just so happens I had a blemish pop up the day after I placed my order. As soon as it arrived I put it in use. It only takes a drop. I am a huge fan of essential oils so I had a dropper readily available.  I applied a drop that afternoon and then later that night after I got out of the shower, I applied it again. The next morning when I woke up I just couldn&#x27;t believe how effective that it was. Especially from only 2 applications. I love that its all natural 100 percent Australian Tea Tree Oil. I am very pleased with this product and I most definitely recommend it for acne/blemish treatment.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is very refreshing unlike most acne solutions that tend to have a very chemical like odor.  It also does not feel heavy on the skin, and is good choice for those in the market for Tea Tree Oil.</li>
    <li> I received this during a product launch.  When I received it, I didn&#x27;t have any blemishes to use it on, but my daughter did.  This stuff works pretty good!  It smells a bit like an antiseptic, but that&#x27;s the Tea Tree Oil.  We didn&#x27;t mind the smell of it.  We used it neat because it was just a small area right on her chin, but I would recommend testing it out first.  If it&#x27;s too strong, dilute with a carrier oil, especially if you&#x27;re using it on a larger area, or multiple areas.  The container is easy to open and close, and I liked the fact that there wasn&#x27;t a dropper in this.  You tip it up, dot it on your finger, and apply.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I even was able to tolerate directly to face - slept with it on a clear face and applied under my makeup. No change in skin quality.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It has done a great job of drying up my blemishes. Only thing is it smells sooo strong but it&#x27;s still a great product!</li>
    <li> I loved the tea tree oil, it really helped my face. It helped to clear up my acne.  It is a very good grade of oil and complements the face mask really well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works great for acne.</li>
    <li> Will help clears out acne but it will make your skin feels and looks very dry. As others have recommended, you may want to mix it with moisturizer or you can use moisturizer in prior to using this tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Was excited to use because reviews were so positive. Unfortunately it made my skin worse. More oily, more breakouts.</li>
    <li> Definitely works, and works quickly for acne.  Just want to make sure to follow the directions on bottle or this will dry the face out fast.</li>
    <li> Keeps tbe skin smooth and acne free been using it for a couple of wks &amp; see promising results good for razor bumps.Wil keep using it to see how well it works over a long period.</li>
    <li> Great on acne only thing bad I can say about it is  that is it is a small round bottle which means it hard for it to stand up straight and when it does not stand up straight it will roll around the corner and beware when it rolls around the counter it will drop and fall and hit the ground hard which will shatter and burst everywhere all over the ground but other then that it works great I would very much recommend it</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awful but it works.  Just a dab before bed and the blemishes were reduced in size in the morning, all the blemishes were completely gone within 2 to 3 days.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked at getting rid of my adult acne. i don&#x27;t actually dilute it and just dab it right on my problem areas which is drying but holy wow it works wonders. I had almost given up on trying to get rid of my pimples but really glad I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had acne as a teenager but last year started getting a bunch of acne concentrated on the sides of my cheeks and forehead... tried a bunch of different formulas, skin peels, pills etc etc. but nothing made a difference. This made a huge difference in a matter of days. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work on everyone but for 15 bucks it&#x27;s worth it to try.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Improved my over-50 skin dramatically.  Helps to promote more normal healing after acne.  (I was getting weird bumps as part of the &amp;#34;healing,&amp;#34; and now I don&#x27;t.)</li>
    <li> I have used many many many different acne treatments. Some worked, kind of, most made my face worse. I am more upset than happy that of all things this tea tree oil concoction worked better than anything else. Just kidding I am happy!</li>
    <li> You have to appy it everyday to see results, barley comes out of the bottle. Not the best considering the amount you get for the price..</li>
    <li> excellent acne solution, i used the tea tree oil for a short period of time and immediately saw results as my acne diminished and acne scars lightened tremendously.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The product works fine with my skin. I use it as spot treatment and it really heals the blemishes. I would  recommend this product to anyone who has acne skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin which also tends to be very oily.  There has so far been nothing on the market that keeps my face clear and many have caused me to break out including the expensive treatments.  Upon using the TreeActiv+, which I diluted with water after reading other reviews, my acne was noticeably improved within a day and completely gone by day 3.  It does not leave your face feeling oily or dry and I had no reaction to it whatsoever.  It has a nice light scent to it as well that was not overpowering.  This will definitely be the product that I will use from now on to treat further breakouts.  I ordered this on a Saturday and received it Tuesday.  So pleased with this product and wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> I love this, I can&#x27;t stop smelling it, people around me can smell it in my purse and love it.  it feels so great on, and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> we liked it just a little to much of a smell&lt;br /&gt;the disclaimer</li>
    <li> It has worked amazingly. Started noticing a difference after the first use. It has been really difficult for me to find anything that truly helps my acne. Ever since I had my son, I have been struggling to find something to clear up my skin I&#x27;ve tried everything for store acne products to proactiv, but nothing worked. That is until I tried this. It has not completely cleared up yet, but I have only used it three times. I still have seen an amazing difference and will continue to use this product. I&#x27;m very thankful I found this product. I also want to thank them for sending a follow up email to see if the product was working for me, I love that they want to connect with their consumers personally.</li>
    <li> I got this because I was going through a break out after not having any skin problems for a couple weeks so I hadn&#x27;t gotten a chance to use it right away, but the other day I woke up with a blemish right on the tip of my nose, I applied some of this TreeActiv+ Tea Tree oil Acne solution, and within the hour, the inflammation and redness were much, much better! I used it a few times and now it&#x27;s gone! Works very well!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It helps with drying up acne for my pre-teen daughter. She doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but it does what it needs to. Will buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> It works on my teenage daughter&#x27;s pimples. She uses it in the morning and at night. The great tea tree scent is also refreshing. My family has been using tea tree oil products for many years. It&#x27;s the best nature solution for any skin problems. Love this product, of course.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. I don&#x27;t  mind about the smell, but I still like it, smell like herbal..I care more  the effectiveness of the product, it gives clear result. I have been experiencing acne in 2 years. I have used different products with different brands  but I cannot see any good result.Until I found this product.I have been using the product in 4 days, i applied twice a day with moisturizer. My acne start healing and blemishes gone. My problem on my face now is scars, but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. The most important I found the  right product. I&#x27;m so happy  there&#x27;s a promo, so I have given a chance to test the product. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> If anyone is similar to me, i am a young adult Caucasian male with mild acne, i get occasional blemishes,i was looking to use something to help bring the blemish down and get rid of the whiteheads, this product gave many promises, in my opinion delivered none. I have used tea tree oil before it does cause a numbing sensation, it was ineffective at treating about 2-3 acne spots on my face, 1 week of use no resuts will be returning for my refund, to me and my skin not worth it.</li>
    <li> nicely packaged, lovely product!!</li>
    <li> So important to get quality top-grade unprocessed oils these days...especially ones you put on your face, and TreeActiv+ really hits the spot and delivers what they say, as well as really sincere and TOP CUSTOMER SERVICE, which I don&#x27;t normally expect from amazon sellers or stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great oil for spot blemishes and recommend diluting it with a less pungent oil or moisturizer for frequent application...especially if you are using a drying cleanser (tea tree cleanser like I do). Will save you the skin peeling.</li>
    <li> way too small of bottle for the price. Results not significant enough to validate purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started exploring the use of essential oils for a variety of uses and am really enjoying all their benefits, so I was very happy to have a chance to order this TreeActiv+ tea tree oil through a promotion in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.  This is a very high quality oil - I&#x27;m impressed with how concentrated it is.  You can tell just by opening up the bottle and smelling the bottle that this is the real stuff - the fragrance is just what you should expect from 100% pure tea tree oil.  It works great to put your finger over the hole in the top of the bottle and invert to get just a tiny bit on your finger to spread on a problem acne spot.  If you want to use it over a wider area, you can dilute some of the tea trea oil with a carrier oil (like fractionated coconut) or mix it into a moisturizer lotion.  Although TreeActiv+ is marketed specifically for acne, I also love this to help clear congested sinuses!  A little bit really goes a long way with with this top quality oil!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with high hopes but left with little to no results.  The worst part is that my acne isn&#x27;t even that bad and it still did NOTHING for me.  This products offers a strong scent with a light sensation as if it&#x27;s working but ultimately returns no results.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> awesome product works great very fast acting a must have product if you have acne</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my daughter for a few days. It seemed to start drying and shrinking the acne after a few days&#x27; worth of use. Despite its strong smell, I would recommend this product for people who have acne problems. Note1: My daughter was taking clear acne pills at the same time.  Note2: The smell was too strong for my daughter to continue using it.</li>
    <li> i mean it didn&#x27;t really helped me with acne but I loved the smell of the oil though</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size to take traveling,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this with me on a trip and had a horrible breakout, I mixed this with a little olive oil and it helped reduce the redness and cleared it up by the next day, at least to the point where it wasn&#x27;t super red. I;ve heard it is good for infections, but can&#x27;t attest to that. This works as well as any other tea tree oil that I have used,  but the dropper bottle makes it really easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product</li>
    <li> When I read reviews prior to ordering about the smell, I was expecting something horrid. I&#x27;ve previously used 100% Australian tea tree oil which smells different than this version but this TreeActiv+ tea tree oil smells as you would expect it to. I&#x27;m guessing those who complained about the smell are unfamiliar with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging comes in a small dram-sized bottle which is fine with me as I buy tea tree oil in bulk and can keep it in smaller quantities. I like that the bottle is amber to reduce sun light from passing through. The stopper is works usually and I haven&#x27;t decided if I completely like it or not because having it reduces leakage but without a stopper you could insert cotton swabs, etc. easier. I would say it&#x27;s more helpful than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product that is effective for what you&#x27;d use tea tree oil for like acne, etc.</li>
    <li> When I got the eBook while waiting for the order to arrive.  It arrived quickly but it still gave me time to review the book.  Such a cool tool to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle came wrapped in little bubble wrap inside of a larger bubble wrap.  I did not have any leaking problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tea tree oil has been amazing. I never really had acne problems when I was a teen.  But the older I get I have been getting several black heads around my nose.  I have been using the tea tree oil as a spot treatment for several weeks and the difference in my face has been amazing.  I love that it is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy when I was chosen get a sample of this tea tree oil for my opinions and experiences with it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from hormonal acne [acne around the mouth]. I started getting it a few yrs ago. I went on the pill, but it started giving me probs so I stopped. I spent quite a bit of money on medication prescribed from the dermatologist. All it did was drain my pockets. Tea tree oil and more specifically, treeactiv tt oil is the only thing that helped me. I saw videos of people on youtube raving about this oil, but I thought it was all hype and dismissed it.    How can something so simple &amp; natureal really work? Well it does and very well.  I have tried several brands too. All tea tree oil is not created equal. Some brands are rather weak specially if you get a lot of product like the walmart brand.  Treeactiv is the only one that literally makes my acne disappear within a few days of applying.</li>
    <li> This is really helping me to clear up my skin. I bought the small bottle to test it out and now that I&#x27;m convinced I&#x27;ll be looking to buy the bigger bottle once this is gone. I&#x27;m excited to continue using it and excited to keep getting the compliments.</li>
    <li> Good. Use. Helpful. Buy plz</li>
    <li> I just love it amazing Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution</li>
    <li> I use tea tree oil for so many things, but never thought of acne until I got this bottle. It helps many other skin issues, so it&#x27;s not a surprise.  Tea tree oil is a natural disinfectant.  My complimentary bottle to test was 10 ml, it says about 100 drops or 100 treatments in just 1 bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know from experience 1 drop goes a long way. I found using it 2x a day, the acne was usually gone the next day!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I was highly disappointed because, after reading the comments, I felt that maybe I had found something that would work. I have been using this for months and I still don&#x27;t see any change in my skin. The owner of this sent me an email offering me an extra bottle for a review and I didn&#x27;t even care to do it because I don&#x27;t want another bottle and I got the feeling that there is where all of the positive comments come from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel the solution on my skin so it seems like it is doing something but it certainly isn&#x27;t doing anything to my acne or blemishes. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It really seems to be healing blemishes, although with a bit of dryness. I am 42 with combination skin.  Glad I bought since it&#x27;s all natural and is working.  I use non comedogenic moisturizer a couple min afterward to minimize dryness.</li>
    <li> I have noticed that this product cleared up some acne on my forehead that has been really hard to get rid of. It has a very strong scent but does not irritate my skin, I mix it with toner, but have also used it alone and it is gentle on my skin. Also, I like that it doesn&#x27;t strip my skins natural oils.</li>
    <li> Very potent tea tree oil with a very strong scent, which I love by the way. I have had a chance to give this product a try &amp; I can honestly give my feedback about it. I have used this on my face lately because of the skin blemish &amp; also the blackheads &amp; whiteheads I have had popping up. So I was able to use it as a spot treatment and I am loving it that way. It is strong so be careful when using it, some dilute but I do not. I like using it directly and find that it works best that way. My blemishes are improving and some are gone already I also have less blackhead/whiteheads/pimples popping up. This is a great antibacterial to use and all natural alternative to use rather than those harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I think this is my first review that I have ever posted. My son was thrilled with this product. He ended up just lightly dabbing the oil directly on to the skin. It did cause drying, but boy did it work. In one day we saw less redness, with in two days it was a noticeable difference, and within a week he was almost back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;. I just ordered a second bottle. Company is also as nice as can be. They sent an email with in days making sure we were satisfied, then a follow up email with a coupon.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff</li>
    <li> This product has helped decrease the amount of pimples as well as decrease the amount of time it takes for one to clear up.  It has been a welcome addition to my skin care regimen and I would buy it again. Also, the product does not have a super strong, long lasting scent to it which is a bonus when you are using an oil like this.</li>
    <li> This does seem to work well, but if I do not replace this product it is because of the bottle it comes in. I tend to have a hard time getting any oil out on my q-tip which becomes frustrating and deters me from using it more often.</li>
    <li> I also used this for acne,  and you really don&#x27;t get enough product for the cost of this.  20 dollars for a very tiny tiny bottle. It works for spot treating but don&#x27;t cover too much skin, it will peel it right off.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 days and it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> 4/5 stars for prompt delivery and follow up email on its uses and what to avoid. I have just started using it so cannot talk about its long term uses but its a 100% tea tree oil - so use with caution if your skin is sensitive like mine. I love the smell and so far i like it. I only use it as a spot treatment and it seems to be helping in reducing redness and blemishes. Hope it works for you too :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 days, i have acne on my chin and back and have been using it twice a day everyday. It helps a little to help them heal, but i havent seen a huge difference yet, i will still be testing it some more</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and so far I am please with the results</li>
    <li> Good stuff, reduces redness quickly. I will continue to use as needed. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product. love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this for little breakouts she gets every couple weeks, and she is very impressed with it. As soon as she she&#x27;s a blemish she puts a dab on at night time and by morning the swelling is down and not breakout so far with this oil. It is smooth and soft and it hasn&#x27;t been harsh on her skin</li>
    <li> This stuff STINKS to high heaven.  Can&#x27;t get any of the benefits from it because it stinks too much to use. ;(</li>
    <li> This product works really well and fast. I am 34 and still have problems with acne :( I have tried TONS of products and this works the fastest. It is very potent so all you need is a small dab on the affected area :)</li>
    <li> My daughter, who is a teenager, gets regular breakouts.  She&#x27;s had two that have been stubborn and some that were starting to appear.  As soon as this came in the mail, she applied it.  The stubborn spots we significantly reduced, and the new ones were gone within an hour or two.  A second application was needed, we waited until the next morning.  Don&#x27;t use this too frequently, as the skin may become irritated.  My daughter and I love this!  Btw, I used it on my finger, which had eczema, and it helped it A LOT!</li>
    <li> my acne disappeared after applying it</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!  My daughter has been using for a few days and I can already tell the difference!</li>
    <li> I have had acne since I was in the 3rd grade.  This tea tree oil really helps with your acne.  It does have a strong smell; but it didn&#x27;t bother my asthma so that was a plus. I added it to my moisturizer and applied it  to my face and it worked great for me.  I was excited to receive this product to review and share my experiences because I could noticeably tell a difference after only a few days.  The pictures were taken 3 days apart.  One was taken with my i-phone and the other my digital camera.  You can still tell a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; *I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This product really helps eliminate pimples that form on my face and forehead.  It takes  only a day or two for it to start working which is really great because I can get some bad acne if I don&#x27;t treat it consistently.  This works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and its cheaper than anything else i&#x27;ve tried too!</li>
    <li> I love this product! :-) I have psoriasis around my nose and forehead and it not only helps acne it got rid of my psoriasis!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for breakouts.  My 14 year old has breakouts in her T Zone.  She washes her face with the TreeActiv  mask/wash and then uses the TreeActiv in the affected areas.  It does not make her face break out worse which is great.  Everything we have tried has either dried out her skin or make the acne worse.  It is also very affordable!  This is something that I have seen results already in 4 days and is in my single mom budget!  I will be purchasing this again once it runs out.  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***DISCLAIMER ***I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless the opinions found herein are 100% my own.***</li>
    <li> Works well..hope this product will be available again soon</li>
    <li> I received the tea tree oil for testing purposes. I am a big fan of Teatree oil I already have it on my elf zit zapper stick and I use it daily for my blemishes and zits. This Tea tree oil is very concentrated and it does have a potent smell to it but not one that is very offensive. I decided to try the Teatree oil on the back of my neck where I had a bumpy rash that was forming. My neck area was clean so I did not put any oils on top of it except for the Teatree oil. I noticed by morning the rash on the back of my neck, the little bumps were gone!&lt;br /&gt;I then began to use it on a little blemish I had on the side of my temple on my face. But I did notice that my blemish was there the next morning but it was smaller in size. So the Teatree oil does dry up blemishes and it completely healed my rash on the back of my neck. I will continue to use this product to test it further, I got the little tube but since it&#x27;s an oil there is plenty to be used. I do believe that this Teatree oil does work on certain blemishes and zits but for me I know that it worked on the back of my neck where my little bumpy rash was and that it completely dried it the next morning but I did realize that the one on my face took a little longer to dry it wasn&#x27;t as dry but it did diminished in size. But I definitely will continue to use this product so that I can get its maximum effect again the Teatree oil did well on my bumpy rash on the back of my neck but this is my opinion so you would have to test it for yourself.</li>
    <li> Very strong smell, I can&#x27;t tell if it has worked at all.</li>
    <li> This product is really great! I suffer acne and this has helped so much with the blemishes on my face and neck. Appreciate the fact that it is chemical free!</li>
    <li> I have moderate to severe acne mostly due to a hormonal imbalance, but the lack of sleep and stress caused by my job does not help either. I&#x27;ve tried birth control to treat my hormones, which worked, but for personal reasons I chose to stop medicating my hormones. Since then, I&#x27;ve tried several over the counter treatments for severe acne, with varying levels of success. Recently a friend suggested tea tree oil, and seeing the reviews on this product got me very excited. Unfortunately the TreeActiv solution was not the end all be all answer to my acne problem like it seems to have been for many others. While I was disappointed, buying this was not a complete loss. It certainly did help cut down on the painful cystic acne around my jaw line and mouth, as well as shrink and sooth the redness of existing acne. However, it did not prevent the continued breakout of small &amp;#34;teenage&amp;#34; like acne for me. Given its usefulness with cystic acne though, I decided to mix it into the routine of an over the counter 3-step acne system for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin (as opposed to the sever 3-step systems I&#x27;d been using), and my skin is clearing up incredibly quickly! Will the results continue after another week of use? I don&#x27;t know yet, but right now my skin isn&#x27;t dry, the redness and cystic acne have been greatly reduced, and I&#x27;m not breaking out anymore. There is a strong lemon/lime pine sol like scent to the oil, but that does not bother me. While the oil did not work for my by itself, I still gave it five stars, because it does plays a crucial role in my skin care treatment, and the sellers are incredibly nice and helpful. 5/5 Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me &amp; smell awfull</li>
    <li> Who would ever believe that at my age that I would have pimples? It seems like I get more now than I did in my teenager years.So, when I was offered to receive this product for my unbiased opinion, I jumped on it.
