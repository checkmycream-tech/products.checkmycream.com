      <li>love this comb!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m gonna order a couple more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered anyway.</li>
      <li>Did fit my blow dryer and didn&#x27;t come with instruction on how to adjust it!</li>
      <li>and it fit!</li>
      <li>also believe that if directions came with it, more people would&#x27;ve given it five stars.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was glad that I did not spend a lot of money on the item.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use even once.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, it works really well for me</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really fit any dryer and it&#x27;s supposedly adjustable, but when u unscrew it to adjust it, it just falls apart!</li>
      <li>I have not been able to get this device to accommodate my hairdryer.  </li>
      <li>it arrived in pieces and to return it cost more than the product.</li>
      <li>it did not even come close to fitting around my blow dryer..</li>
      <li>and It didn&#x27;t fit on any of the 3 hair dryers I own.</li>
      <li>:) if I didn&#x27;t have to put a star</li>
      <li>Was as per the specification and fits most nozzles.</li>
      <li>but i sure got the job done.....will be testting it today to for</li>
      <li>Adjust to most blow dryers</li>
      <li>The product was cheap, meaning it was made out of very cheap material, so I returned it.</li>
      <li>So far so good feels nice on strong.</li>
      <li>I put a bunch of rubberbands on the end (like the rubbery kind that come on mail or veggies) and the nozzle fit snugly and perfectly, and is fine to be switched with other attachments.</li>
      <li>I am sure it would work if it would fit</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit most dyers</li>
      <li>Glad this product is available.</li>
      <li>Comb easily through the hair</li>
      <li>My 4C hair was straightened so easy and in 10min.</li>
      <li>The plastic pieces that you put around it to make it fit break really easy.</li>
      <li>It will not work for me unless I had baby fine hair which I do not.</li>
      <li>Although it did fit my hair dryer, it fell apart after I removed it for cleaning and storage.</li>
      <li>This dryer comb attachment would be fantastic if it stayed on the dryer.</li>
      <li>I ended up leaving it in the box and using a cheap Vidal Sassoon blow dryer from Meijer.</li>
      <li>I never even got the chance to see if it would fit my dryer because the comb would not stay together.</li>
      <li>No point in returning because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
      <li>I have two blow dryers and this didn&#x27;t fit either of them.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, but doesn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer, had to tape it to my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>To Fit My BlowDryer</li>
      <li>The end is sturdy and adjust to fit my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit blow dryer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to spend extra dollar to get good</li>
      <li>Very useful and convenient.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work great if it fit my old dryer or my new one.</li>
      <li>A true find .</li>
      <li>its good enough for me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
      <li>Cheap broke first use</li>
      <li>It stays pretty secure for about 10 minutes, then I have to tighten it a bit.</li>
      <li>but the comb has a very quality strong and sturdy build to it</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>The price was great but the product did not fit on my hair dryer as an attachment.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit a whole bunch of driers I tried.</li>
      <li>It just wouldn&#x27;t be worth the hassle.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work on a smaller nozzle</li>
      <li>Its not even worth the postage to return the darn thing.</li>
      <li>So far this hasn&#x27;t prevented the adjustable nozzle from being able to be tightened around the hair dryer nozzle and used.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I am not using it right.</li>
      <li>it is a little tricky to put on at first but by reading other reviews i did get some good instructions (do not use the rings if you putting it on the sedu) all around great product will be purchasing more of these for back up.</li>
      <li>These combs are very sturdy and should fit most blowdryers with a smaller neck.</li>
      <li>So I will be buying again regardless of the fit until I buy new dryer the tape will work</li>
      <li>This is cheaply made and certainly not a universal fit.</li>
      <li>I have sense added tape around it because the blow dryer melted some of the hot glue..</li>
      <li>For those having an issue fitting it if you only need one of the adapter pieces</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
      <li>this broke the first time i tried to attach it to my blowdryer.  </li>
      <li>I guess I cant really speak on the product because I couldnt use it!</li>
      <li>The deliver was fast and uneventful!</li>
      <li>I have a similar adjustable nozzle I&#x27;ve been using for over 20 years that is a much better quality.  </li>
      <li>I refused to send it back because its so cheap and wasn&#x27;t worth it, but couldn&#x27;t find one made for a babyliss.</li>
      <li>Just a waste of my precious money!</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Adjustable&amp;#34; nozzle didnt adjust to a large enough size to fit my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Wish it fit my larger mouth blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like having to remove screws to adjust it for my daughter&#x27;s blow dryer</li>
      <li>no instructions, i have tried every possible way to fit this nozzle onto the dryer&#x27;s ( i have 3 hand held dryers) and i order 2</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer and when I contacted the seller, they never contacted me back in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>hahahaha</li>
      <li>I have frizzy, curly hair, and I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to straighten my hair as much if I used the comb.</li>
      <li>The shipping for the attachment was freaky fast, i recieved it in one day.</li>
      <li>My husband and I BOTH screwed with the \\&quot;pieces\\&quot; to try to get it to fit my hairdryer, and I see no way it would be possible.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Disappointed that the nozzle was too small to fit on my conair 1875. I am realizing that it is a gamble when you purchase a hairdryer comb attachment that uses terms like adjustable or universal.  I just have a problem with wasting money no matter how small the amount.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Adjustable&amp;#34; nozzle didnt adjust to a large enough size to fit my blow dryer. I&#x27;ll probably give it to someone because its not worth paying to return it. I guess I cant really speak on the product because I couldnt use it!</li>
    <li> NAILED IT. IT FITS.. not.. that is the 2 extra rings, hot glued to the outside to hold them together.. it did not even come close to fitting around my blow dryer.. universal? nah.. I think not.. it was just a bit smaller than the end of my blower dryer, so it would not fit on the outside, nor inside.. I have sense added tape around it because the blow dryer melted some of the hot glue.. I refused to send it back because its so cheap and wasn&#x27;t worth it, but couldn&#x27;t find one made for a babyliss. hahahaha So if you have a thicker blow dryer.. don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> impossible to use without reading other reviews to figure out how to use.  They need to learn merchandising 101.  Should have an on-line video to explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After a few uses, the comb popped off the dryer.  I won&#x27;t return it in case it fits a dryer a buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Diane adjustable nozzle for hand held hair dryers does not fit! I had read several reviews and dispite many stating that the nozzle did not fit I decided to see for myself. Well shame on me. It does will not fit. I dont know why I didn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit a whole bunch of driers I tried. Weird parts, not sure what it could possibly fit.</li>
    <li> Was just too small,I threw it out immediately.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, but doesn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer, had to tape it to my blow dryer. You get what you pay for. Will do in a pinch if you are desperate, and I am lol.</li>
    <li> A piece of CRAP!!! Very hard to fit not dryer. The &amp;#34;sizers&amp;#34; kept slipping off. Don&#x27;t bother with this!!!</li>
    <li> This is the worst attachment ever! It doesn&#x27;t really fit any dryer and it&#x27;s supposedly adjustable, but when u unscrew it to adjust it, it just falls apart! Made very cheaply. :(</li>
    <li> So far so good feels nice on strong. Let see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> It did not fit.  It will only fit a very small nozzle.  It is not adjustable regardless of what t says.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use. My only problem with this attachment is my old blow dryer died and the new one is too large for it. Ordering a larger one today. For those having an issue fitting it if you only need one of the adapter pieces like I did just use one. Seriously an 8 year old could do this.</li>
    <li> After searching long and hard for a comb attachment for my Sedu revolution 4000i dryer I found this thru a Youtube review.&lt;br /&gt;It fits perfectly and the comb still has all its teeth so it is also sturdy. It is plastic so eventually they will break&lt;br /&gt;so i will stock up a bit. A true find .</li>
    <li> I thought it work with my hair dryer but it didn&#x27;t and I wasted my money. I think its best to use on the travel size dryers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe I am not using it right. I just have it slipped on the end of my blow dryer. It stays pretty secure for about 10 minutes, then I have to tighten it a bit. I have frizzy, curly hair, and I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to straighten my hair as much if I used the comb. But, my hair pretty much looks the same, as if I didn&#x27;t even use the comb, and I still have to straighten it all. But, it could just be my technique is wrong. I would recommend you measure your blow dryer first, unless you are using one by the same company.</li>
    <li> Came broken..and It didn&#x27;t fit on any of the 3 hair dryers I own. Came late, and defiantly not worth the money or time buying it</li>
    <li> I have very thick, unruly hair so I need a comb attachment to my blowdryer. These combs are very sturdy and should fit most blowdryers with a smaller neck.</li>
    <li> This product anything but adjustable. I wasn&#x27;t able to use even once. They give you rings so that you can adjust the nozzle but you can&#x27;t undo the screws at all. Same thing with my sister Diane adjustable Nozzle. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get it to stay on at all I&#x27;m sure it would work great if it fit my old dryer or my new one. My husband looked at it and said it wouldn&#x27;t work and he doesn&#x27;t see how the nozzles would help at all. I gave up cause I got so frustrated with it</li>
    <li> Adjust to most blow dryers</li>
    <li> Does not work on anything.</li>
    <li> I own the BabylissPro Carrera 2 Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer which didn&#x27;t not come with a comb so I brought this comb attachment. Although it did fit my hair dryer, it fell apart after I removed it for cleaning and storage. I have no idea how to out it back together.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived in the mail it was already broken. I never got to use it because it was incapable of holding together. Cheap, bad product.</li>
    <li> This nozzle does not fit either of the two hair dryers I&#x27;ve tried it on so far. The \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; rings are useless. Labeling it \\&quot;adjustable nozzle\\&quot; must have been a joke.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk!  Did not fit my chi. Had weird parts to try and deal with. Rip off and waist of money.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to figure out how to contect it (it didn&#x27;t come with directions) but once I got on I loved it!! I&#x27;m gonna order a couple more. This really is a great find and buy!</li>
    <li> The adjusters were difficult to fit to my dryer. Once I finally got it on, the nozzle continued to slide off causing the adjusters to fall out again.  The really great thing about this product was the delivery. I got the item in no time.</li>
    <li> The comb came in very fast 3 days, as past posters said no instructions and unscrewing it still didnt fit my old 1875 watt Conair dryer. I got some tape, taped it on and i was good to go. My 4C hair was straightened so easy and in 10min. So I will be buying again regardless of the fit until I buy new dryer the tape will work</li>
    <li> Missing screw. Needed item for travel. No time to wait for replacement Bummer.</li>
    <li> This was too wide for my babyliss hairdryer, but I remembered an old trick... I put a bunch of rubberbands on the end (like the rubbery kind that come on mail or veggies) and the nozzle fit snugly and perfectly, and is fine to be switched with other attachments. It is not an expensive product, so Im sure the prongs will break if I drop it a bunch. But it works! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have two blow dryers and this didn&#x27;t fit either of them. The plastic &amp;#34;extenders &amp;#34; are a joke. The comb wouldn&#x27;t have been durable enough any way. I have thick waist length 3b/3c black American hair. It was only $5 so I&#x27;m not going to waste my time trying to return it. It just wouldn&#x27;t be worth the hassle. But if you&#x27;re smarter than I am you just won&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Could Not Get It To Fit My BlowDryer</li>
    <li> This piece of crap is a complete waste of time and money, it will never fit any hair dryer. It&#x27;s better to spend extra dollar to get good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money and time!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted and needed. It works great with my dryer and easily fits on and adjusts.</li>
    <li> Came with 4 pieces and have no clue how to attach it to my blow dryer</li>
    <li> This was NOTHING like advertised.  It does not fit my hair dryer, which is standard.  A complete waste.</li>
    <li> This was the worst!!! It did not fit my hair dryer at all because it was so tiny. It doesn&#x27;t even come with good directions. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Pieces fell apart during shipment...... Received a useless item.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit most dyers</li>
    <li> I had to use plenty of tape for this to stay in place (I have a pink hot tools).</li>
    <li> Does not fit bad  customer service</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer and when I contacted the seller, they never contacted me back in a timely manner. Once I finally did receive a response, it was telling me that it was too late to send it back so needless to say I don&#x27;t like it and was not happy. It may have worked great but I&#x27;ll never know because it did me no good.</li>
    <li> This piece did not fit the blow dryer.  What looks like a piece that can attach to the end of the dryer, actually the inside diameter of the attachment is much smaller than the dryer.  Even if you could force it on, the screws that were sent were too small to make a locked connection.  Thank goodness it was on $6.</li>
    <li> This product met my needs, but it&#x27;s not the best quality.  I have a similar adjustable nozzle I&#x27;ve been using for over 20 years that is a much better quality.  I purchased this one for a friend who wanted a comb attachment like mine for her hair dryer.  The 4 adjustable rings (which are really 4 half rings) are very thin and flimsy.  Portions of it have broken.  So far this hasn&#x27;t prevented the adjustable nozzle from being able to be tightened around the hair dryer nozzle and used.  It remains to be seen if over time with using the comb to go through wet, thick/coarse hair the attachment will come off.  I consider this to be adequate and preferable to other comb attachments that can&#x27;t be tightened with screws around the nozzle of the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This would not stay on my blow dryer and there were no instructions on how to use the adjustable pieces that came with it. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Another product that did not fit my dryer. Won&#x27;t purchase it again.  No worth returning. I have a regular size hair dryer, but I guess if you have a small nozzle this may work for you.</li>
    <li> Used this product and it met my expectations. The end is sturdy and adjust to fit my blow dryer. Glad this product is available. Hard to find otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am happy that I was able to get my refund, lets start off with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it does NOT fit most hair dryers. From reading reviews now, it only fits this SEDU hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do NOT buy it unless you have this specific hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I received my attachment as promised in two days  but when it came it was missing a screw so the attachment is not able to be used or secured to my dryer</li>
    <li> Did fit my blow dryer and didn&#x27;t come with instruction on how to adjust it!</li>
    <li> waste. The seller was quick and easy, that is not where my complaint is. I have two dryers and it does not fit on either one. I just gave up and bought a whole new dryer with the attachments, now I have 3...</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like having to remove screws to adjust it for my daughter&#x27;s blow dryer I thought that all I had to do was just put it on and that it would adjust itself I was wrong, but I will not make that mistake twice</li>
    <li> Nice...but just like other previous products,  it will not stay on my blow dryer :(</li>
    <li> love this comb! cuts my drying time in half! If you have kinky curly hair it wont get you hair as straight as a round brush.</li>
    <li> Does not fit larger size hair dryer but ok for smaller one.  So far it&#x27;s holding up well. Wish it fit my larger mouth blow dryer.</li>
    <li> It does not screw together properly. The screws go in each side, but it doesn&#x27;t hold it together, it just pops back open. The inserts do not work either to make it adjustable. Very poor product. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Missing one screw so i was unable to use. Not worth the hassle to send back</li>
    <li> Will not fit a John Frieda full volume hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Barbar blow dryer and couldn&#x27;t use it because I need an comb attachment. I ended up leaving it in the box and using a cheap Vidal Sassoon blow dryer from Meijer. I saw a couple of reviews about this attachment and I wanted to try it out. It had the proper opening size for the Barbar dryer. It was very hard to use at first and I thought a screw was missing! I found out about the rings inside of the comb and I removed a whole ring then half of another and it fit! It works GREAT! (I found out that I didn&#x27;t line up the comb properly. That&#x27;s why I thought a screw was missing.) To end this long story, I screwed it on tight and it still works! (Had it since April of 2012. Bought it from ebay.) (I added a pic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It also worked on the Sedu 4000i, that I am returning to Folica.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. It will not work for me unless I had baby fine hair which I do not.</li>
    <li> Cheap broke first use</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my Sedu dryer based on other reviews. I would have given five-stars had directions came with it.&lt;br /&gt;I also believe that if directions came with it, more people would&#x27;ve given it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;After unscrewing, you may not need the rings.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful. It will save you a lot of time trying to figure out how to use it!</li>
    <li> I have a very nice standard blow dryer, and this did not fit at all.</li>
    <li> It broke before I could even use it! Just a waste of my precious money! Didn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
    <li> I had a little task and 1/2 with getting this thing connected to my blowdryer....someone gave up on it before me lol but i sure got the job done.....will be testting it today to for i was way too  tired after FOREVER connecting it and screwing it on.  Hopefully my hair doesn&#x27;t yank it off the blow dryer tonight...will keep you all posted it it fails the TEST!!!!</li>
    <li> it arrived in pieces and to return it cost more than the product. It is not worth your money at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, it works really well for me</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  This is simple and straight forward.  Loosen the screws, put it on the nozzle, and go.  Very useful and convenient.</li>
    <li> The plastic pieces that you put around it to make it fit break really easy. And don&#x27;t plan on removing it after you put it on will have a hard time</li>
    <li> Biggest piece of junk ever! Didn&#x27;t even come with the ability to be screwed together!</li>
    <li> terrible quality - not adjustable at all. waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Fits my blow dryer but it keeps popping off... Keep a screw driver handy when in use</li>
    <li> This fits on any blow dryer</li>
    <li> This product arrived broken and there is no way to return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The seller should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. I tried to attach it to my Revlon blow dryer and it does not fit. The product did not come with instructions and once you open it to try to fit it on the seller will not take it back. Basically, I just gave them money for nothing because this product is worthless. I should have listened to the other reviews and passed on this.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of it&#x27;s compatibility with Sedu hair dryers I bought it. Didn&#x27;t work and broke instantly. The quality isn&#x27;t great either</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of some of the reviews! I&#x27;m glad I ordered anyway. The nozzle fit perfect after inserting the correct adapter in. After that you have to tighten the screw on the side and bingo! It works properly and i don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new dryer! The deliver was fast and uneventful!</li>
    <li> Was as per the specification and fits most nozzles. I love it and it doesn&#x27;t slip of like other types</li>
    <li> Not universal. It does not fit my dryer at all. I am not happy with this this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this it was all torn to pieces in the package.</li>
    <li> this broke the first time i tried to attach it to my blowdryer.  piece of trash.</li>
    <li> It came broken and does not even fit well.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in the product I received from this seller. When I tried too work the item it wouldn&#x27;t work, nor did the seller have any tips to share with me in how too make it work. The product was cheap, meaning it was made out of very cheap material, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and it broke. A total waste of money and I&#x27;m so unhappy.</li>
    <li> The price was great but the product did not fit on my hair dryer as an attachment. I was glad that I did not spend a lot of money on the item.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit my dryer, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work on a smaller nozzle</li>
    <li> The shipping for the attachment was freaky fast, i recieved it in one day. The adjustable pieces are very thin and cheaply made but the comb itself is sturdy and works for me. It fits my fhi weight pro nano 1875 dryer...i did put some masking tape where the dryer and comb meets to give it a little reinforcment but other than that its good enough for me</li>
    <li> This thing is so difficult to put on my dryer and I never got any use out of it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted the time and money to purchase it; however it is so inexpensive that it would cost me more to send it back to get my money back</li>
    <li> Fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; blow dryers aka only fits blow dryers with a small nozzle. Its not even worth the postage to return the darn thing. Utter disappointment. If you have a yellow bird or a gold n hot dryer, DO NOT BUY THIS. it will not fit.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to get this device to accommodate my hairdryer.  I am sure it would work if it would fit</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Does not fit my hair dryer.  A waste of time and money.  No point in returning because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
    <li> it couldn&#x27;t attach, and broke. It was a waste of money, and the plastic used with it is fragile and cheap.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money! First off I tried to screw it together &amp; no matter what it kept popping back loose. I never even got the chance to see if it would fit my dryer because the comb would not stay together. I don&#x27;t know if the screws were to short or what but I was highly disappointed. Thumbs down from me</li>
    <li> Comb easily through the hair</li>
    <li> :) if I didn&#x27;t have to put a star I wouldn&#x27;t had , that&#x27;s how terrible this product is. It came with no directions and it&#x27;s not in anyway shape or form universal like wtf. I literally had to pack tape around the comb half way screwed just to get it to be steady and not pop off of my blow dryer</li>
    <li> Did not fit my blow dryer.  Knozzle too small even when the screws are removed.</li>
    <li> I got this product and works with my all hair dryers and the adjustable nozzle its bounse.</li>
    <li> Just as bad as the first it should be taken off of amazon it&#x27;s not a good thing for you to be selling it send no instructions on how to use it what a waste</li>
    <li> This was a piece of crap and I threw it away the day I got it.  My husband and I BOTH screwed with the \\&quot;pieces\\&quot; to try to get it to fit my hairdryer, and I see no way it would be possible.  It didn&#x27;t come with any instructions or anything, just a package label that looks like it was probably from 1940.  Don&#x27;t waste your time/money/patience.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it, one of the screws won&#x27;t come off because it&#x27;s stripped and I can&#x27;t get it off so I can&#x27;t use the comb. Too expensive to send it back for a new one so It&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> fits my harry josh blow dryer perfectly</li>
    <li> This dryer comb attachment would be fantastic if it stayed on the dryer. In order to get it to dry my hair I had to hold it in place with a cloth and dry my hair in small sections which is too much work in itself. I will be returning this thing asap.</li>
    <li> Did not fit any blowdryer and fell apart straight away. This is cheaply made and certainly not a universal fit.</li>
    <li> This product works great with the sedu 4000i. it is a little tricky to put on at first but by reading other reviews i did get some good instructions (do not use the rings if you putting it on the sedu) all around great product will be purchasing more of these for back up. but the comb has a very quality strong and sturdy build to it so i can&#x27;t imagine it breaking.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s a piece of crap,  comes in 5 pieces,  and no instructions on how to put together.  Pitched in the trash.</li>
    <li> no instructions, i have tried every possible way to fit this nozzle onto the dryer&#x27;s ( i have 3 hand held dryers) and i order 2 never&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
