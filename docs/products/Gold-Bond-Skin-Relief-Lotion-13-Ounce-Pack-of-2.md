      <li>My diabetes doc had tons of free samples</li>
      <li>I have more problems with my right foot and the diabetic skin lotion</li>
      <li>No other moisturizers I tried did much good at all.</li>
      <li>It also works great for just dry, itchy skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get dry feet from flip flops and this has been a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This stuff really, really works!!  </li>

<li> and I wash my hands a lot, not just to check my sugars, but just in general and my hands are always feeling dry, itchy, and cracked I have used regular lotion and it doesn&#x27;t work it</li>
<li> This goes on all winter long</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> does what what it says.</li>
    <li> Works very well. lasts longer than all the other ones I have used.</li>
    <li> My challenges with skin dryness and callousing on my feet are hereditary and extreme. Now, as a diabetic (type 2), I have to really be diligent about keeping the callouses to a minimum. I&#x27;ve been using this product, consistently, since it arrived. It&#x27;s doing an excellent job for me, and that is saying something.</li>
    <li> I am not diabetic but use Gold Bond after a shower in the winter to keep my feet moisturized.  I have more problems with my right foot and the diabetic skin lotion seems more effective.  I&#x27;ve been a patient at our wound care center and Gold Bond is what they recommend to prevent cracking.</li>
    <li> Very good product. My son&#x27;s skin was so dry. This really helped.</li>
    <li> I love this! I had read good reviews about it and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I live in Colorado where there is extremely low humidity . Every winter my fingers dry out, crack, and bleed. This goes on all winter long and I have searched for anything that would help. When I heard the ad for this product I immediately wanted to try it. I ordered it on Amazon and it arrived promptly 2 days later. I had read in other reviews that it began to work within one hour, and it really did! Four fingers on each hand had deep cracks and within the hour they began to heal. It is now one week later and they are all healed. It also works great for just dry, itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will surely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Works well, but texture is a little too thick and oily</li>
    <li> Good grief!  This stuff really, really works!!  Who knew...</li>
    <li> Works very well on hands and feet.  I&#x27;m not diabetic and ordered this for a family member, but chose my shipping address by mistake.  Good mistake...  I get dry feet from flip flops and this has been a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;I like to put a thick layer on my feet put on a pair of socks.  Within an hour my feet feel like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem, this goes for all Gold Bond lotion, there is always a large amount of lotion that the straw cannot reach and tends to go to waste. Lets hope Gold Bond will fix</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed, the reviews were great, guess they created an unrealistic expectation on my part. Did not have the results that others have had with the product, still experience dry flaky skin on my legs after weeks of use.</li>
    <li> My husband is a diabetic, his right foot is purple , he has used this Gold Bond Diabetic Lotion now for 4 days and it is very helpful, he is not itching so much and the caller is also getting lighter. We will order it again when he is close to the end.</li>
    <li> As with all its products, Gold Bond is superior to all others.</li>
    <li> I noticed a tremendous difference withing a minute! My diabetes doc had tons of free samples and I felt a difference within a second or two and saw a huge improvement within one minute! Best lotion ever! I got my primary care doc hooked on it and most of my friends. One little girl has had rough patches since she was a toddler and this helped her immensely!&lt;br /&gt;Mrs Hambone</li>
    <li> No review, just a complaint. I paid for two bottles and only received one. Otherwise, very happy.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Diabetic Skin Cream is an amazing product. Both my wife and I use it and are very pleased with the results in aiding our dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I was told that this cream was especially designed for diabetics and that it would keep bry skin from drying out.  I found that Aveeno moisturizer works better, but it may have to do with my exceptionally dry skin.</li>
    <li> Works really well better then other products I used.</li>
    <li> This product really works well. I am diabetic and suffer from extremely dry skin on my legs &amp; feet. No other moisturizers I tried did much good at all. This lotion begins working immediately upon contact with the skin. My skin is softer and no longer irritated from dryness. It is even more effective then baby oil.</li>
    <li> great product....my husband loves it</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have been a diabetic for years now and I wash my hands a lot, not just to check my sugars, but just in general and my hands are always feeling dry, itchy, and cracked I have used regular lotion and it doesn&#x27;t work it just stays on my skin and doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin to relieve the irritation. This product on the other hand helps heal the cracks in your hands or feet by giving them the moister that they need, for anyone ( not just diabetics ) I would recommend this product, I will guarantee that you will have immediate relief.</li>
    <li> cream works but of course the package arrives and the push top on one bottle is broken. and you know the hassle it is to return</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. I use it daily.</li>
