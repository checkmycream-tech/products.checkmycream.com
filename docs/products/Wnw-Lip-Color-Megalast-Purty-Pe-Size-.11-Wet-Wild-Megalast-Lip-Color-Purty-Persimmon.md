      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a dupe for LeOrange by YSL too. :)</li>
      <li>and I love how it feels on my lips.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This color is ao pretty!!!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, the color is just as expected.</li>
      <li>This beautiful color, though, is warm warm WARM--on my lips it looks close to bright true red; on a sheet of white paper, it looks orange.</li>
      <li>ITS A REALLY NICE, BRIGHT RED ORANGE COLOR THAT IS FIT FOR ANY OCCASION.</li>
      <li>Purty Persimmon is a beautiful orange red colour almost identical to Mac lipstick</li>
      <li>but this is so pretty with a nice lip liner its almost an orange color  </li>
      <li>The majority of red lipsticks available are colder toned reds, but this one is bright and warm.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>The quality is exceptional for such an inexpensive lipstick.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to put on, yet looks very matte.</li>
      <li>color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
      <li>Shipping was actually super fast!</li>
      <li>The color is true and opaque, although it is matte and as such requires a balm underneath or on top of it.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily, and my lips feel soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sheer on me, but is build able.  </li>
      <li>I love the red lipstick look on people</li>
      <li>Ooooh, this is a pretty, springtime color.  </li>
      <li>kinda long lasting also, great buy.</li>
      <li>pretty color but brown girls need a liner with it.</li>
      <li>loved it and it last almost 8hrs long.</li>
      <li>so you have to warm it up a little</li>
      <li>really you would have to know what will work for you skin tone</li>
      <li>BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE DRY, ONCE THAT IS DONE, ITS A GREAT LIPSTICK.</li>
      <li>This Wet and Wild Mega Last line is just as good as high end lip sticks.  </li>
      <li>but Wet N Wild is helping me see the light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a true red but an orangy red, so its a good spring or summer color</li>
      <li>Since the finish isn&#x27;t shiny, it looks very old school</li>
      <li>AS FAR AS DRESSING IT UP</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a golden tan, mixed race woman, and it&#x27;s a very flaterring pink.  </li>
      <li>IT IS SUPER LONG LASTING AND DOESNT SMUDGE ALL OVER.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;d known I was going to love it so much, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted money trying out other colors and brands.</li>
      <li>If you put on balm first, it will be harder to get the color to be completely opaque.</li>
      <li>It does require layering to have a really bold lip, but is less drying than NYX mattes.</li>
      <li>I, however, would NOT purchase from Amazon because I got the exact same product from my local Meijer&#x27;s for $1.99!</li>
      <li>THE ONLY THING IS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WEARING A LIPBALM UNDERNEATH</li>
      <li>I have very, VERY pale skin, so it would seem that any red would look striking and flattering on me.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product and the price makes it even better! Its a beautiful and vibrant orange-red, and looks great with my fair skin. It IS drying but that&#x27;s to expect from a matte lipstick.</li>

    <li> This Wet and Wild Mega Last line is just as good as high end lip sticks.  Color lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is awesome. As i expected it&#x27;s red orangy in color. loved it and it last almost 8hrs long.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, the color is just as expected. I also bought &#x27;Vamp It Up&#x27; and &#x27;Coral-Ine&#x27;. Those colors also turned out nice.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Shipping was actually super fast! Thank you. Also, this color pops out.. It&#x27;s an attention grabbing lipstick. It&#x27;s a dupe for LeOrange by YSL too. :)</li>
    <li> I was afraid of color but Wet N Wild is helping me see the light. Quality as great or maybe greater than MAC...don&#x27;t be duped</li>
    <li> Love the way this color look on my skin BEAUTIFUL!</li>
    <li> good product good seller thanks</li>
    <li> really you would have to know what will work for you skin tone but this is so pretty with a nice lip liner its almost an orange color  but i will recommend this color</li>
    <li> This is THE go to red lipstick in my life. As a pale olive Latina, I find that most of the really popular red lip colors make me look weirdly ill, and I thought I hated red lipstick...until I figured out that really I hated how I looked in cool color based red lipstick. This beautiful color, though, is warm warm WARM--on my lips it looks close to bright true red; on a sheet of white paper, it looks orange. Seriously, even without flash and indoors, this color is briiiight. I love it. Since the finish isn&#x27;t shiny, it looks very old school glam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is semi matte and I love how it feels on my lips. For me there&#x27;s no feathering and it&#x27;s easy to put on, yet looks very matte. It isn&#x27;t drying, either. Basically this is the perfect product for me. Seriously. And it costs all of two bucks at walgreens. If I&#x27;d known I was going to love it so much, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted money trying out other colors and brands. How often can you buy perfection for two bucks, man?</li>
    <li> I love the red lipstick look on people so i decided to give it a try. The color is gorgeous! And i loved the way I looked with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is you would have to reapply, and check teeth. I did notice it got on my teeth a few times.</li>
    <li> The pigment is not as good as I though it would be.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS LIPSTICK ! ITS LOOKS REAALY NICE WITH BROWNS, BLACKS, NAVIES AS FAR AS DRESSING IT UP GOES. ITS A REALLY NICE, BRIGHT RED ORANGE COLOR THAT IS FIT FOR ANY OCCASION. THE ONLY THING IS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WEARING A LIPBALM UNDERNEATH LIKE CHAPSTICK BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE DRY, ONCE THAT IS DONE, ITS A GREAT LIPSTICK. IT IS SUPER LONG LASTING AND DOESNT SMUDGE ALL OVER. I LOOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT&#x27;S AFFORDABLE AND GREAT QUALITY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*THESE ARE ACTUALLY A LOT CHEAPER AT WALMART, TARGET, WALGREENS, CVS, ETC $2-3*</li>
    <li> color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily. kinda long lasting also, great buy. It&#x27;s not a true red but an orangy red, so its a good spring or summer color</li>
    <li> Go on great, amazing color, that has an orange tint to it, and very pigmented. I wear it totally alone on my lips and it STAYS. Through drinking, eating, etc., it stayed put even through a nap! I, however, would NOT purchase from Amazon because I got the exact same product from my local Meijer&#x27;s for $1.99!</li>
    <li> This color is ao pretty!!! It&#x27;s like a coral color. The lipstick is thick so you have to warm it up a little but it has a matte finish and it came in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I think this lipstick is good and has great pigments. The color is great and very pretty too. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I moist my lips using any lip balm, and then apply it. It feels and looks amazing. This is my Go-to shade.</li>
    <li> pretty color but brown girls need a liner with it. great price. would recommend it. great summer and spring color</li>
    <li> Ooooh, this is a pretty, springtime color.  I&#x27;m a golden tan, mixed race woman, and it&#x27;s a very flaterring pink.  It&#x27;s sheer on me, but is build able.  It goes on easily, and my lips feel soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Purty Persimmon is a beautiful orange red colour almost identical to Mac lipstick So Chaud- The quality is exceptional for such an inexpensive lipstick. Love this lipstick</li>
