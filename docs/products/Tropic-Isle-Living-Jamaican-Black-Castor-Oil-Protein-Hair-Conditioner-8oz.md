<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This conditioner made my hair feel very soft. The only issue I had with it was that it was runny when left on for a long time period. But overall I loved it.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4stars instead of 1 because I only used it once,but my hair felt great ! After one use. Some reviews complained about the smell ,it is not that bad and it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I use treatment only once a month.  I never had an issue with hard hair.  Great product!  My routine: Wash hair and apply protein treatment to hair for 20 mins, rinse, apply a ph conditioner with a little avocado oil or Jamaican black castor oil, then sit under a hair steamer.  Rinse, apply a leave in conditioner and a do a protective style.  No hair streamer, baggy will do for 20 mins.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair and a day later my hair started falling out. This may not happen to someone else&#x27;s hair but this happened to me and all I did was wash and condition my hair and then I used this product for the amount of time that&#x27;s stated on the container.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell the difference in my hair with using the JBCO Protein conditioner. The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant, reminds me of mayonnaise. I use it once a month for a protein treatment. I&#x27;m only 3 months into my big chop (cutting all my hair off) so I have really low maintenance. Just trying to start off on the good foot with health hair.</li>
    <li> Does not do anything for my hair. Feels dried out.</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this in December of 2014 and the first time I tried it, I had to take it out of my hair right away. It smelled so bad it gave me a headache. Now I&#x27;m not a sensitive person what so ever, so smell&#x27;s don&#x27;t get to me, but this one did. I spend the next few days clarifying my hair with apple cider vinegar and baking soda to try to take the smell out( it was only in my hair for five mins). I paid 12 bucks, so I said let me give it a second chance and this time I diluted with peppermint oil and conditioner, and the same thing happen. I&#x27;m not one to throw away a product, I either find someone to give it too or use it, but this one went to the garbage.  ​</li>
    <li> I order this on a regular basis and find it great to stimulate my roots and provide additional hair growth support. My hair has been growing like weeds ever since with extra thickness.</li>
    <li> Just to let you know this stuff smells like mayonnaise and lavender.  I have course, wavy/curly, dry, damaged hair and this deep conditioner just made it extremely greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this make my hair soft and conditions it well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change but the again if some thing doesn&#x27;t work fast enough for me I&#x27;m on to the next thing</li>
    <li> This product works well with my relaxed hair. When my beautician rinsed out the treatment, my hair felt a little hard because we didn&#x27;t use a moisturizing conditioner afterwards but my hair felt so strong and I didn&#x27;t experience any shedding or breakage when detangling, it was a miracle in a little jar. When the rollers were removed, my hair was so shiny, bouncy and thick. It looks really healthy. My hair remained bouncy and thick for the entire week. I love this product. I recently tried the Aphogee Two Step Protein Treatment and experience shedding when detangling and breakage afterwards. It was too strong. The JBCO Protein Conditioner will be my only protein treatment.</li>
    <li> This is a good protein conditioner but it&#x27;s too strong for my hair and it caused breakage itself. I used it three times and since I had a little bit of it, I threw it away. It isn&#x27;t a horrible product, it&#x27;s just not for my hair. I would recommend it to people who is looking for a good, natural protein treatment though.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use the product because when it was delivered it was a complete mess. The outside of the box was stained and when I opened the box and saw the container, it wsa slimy and greasy. I opened the lid and the product smelled horrible and was clumpy and the consistency of the product didn&#x27;t look good at all. It was both runny and clumped and a had a very odd color. I didn&#x27;t know if that was how it was supposed to look and smell or not, but I was completely turned off and returned it immediately. Really unfortunate because I wanted to try it.</li>
    <li> Was ok smelled funny.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews,as this will be my second. I&#x27;m natural and my hair can&#x27;t decide it&#x27;s texture, so I don&#x27;t use the typing system as I have a little bit of every thing in my hair. Some parts curly, some ringlets, some straight, some matted looking and some wavy,it&#x27;s a combination of coarse and normal. Anyway, I received this yesterday morning and used it last night. It says on the jar to use with heat, but I don&#x27;t like using heat on my hair and I straightened it not too long ago, heat right now is a no no. So, first off we have the all natural ingredient list: Mayonnaise, Jamaican black castor oil, Vitamin E, Avocado oil, Mustard oil, Grape seed oil, Lavender,Pimento oil. The smell is strange but I like it. It&#x27;s like a combination of pickle juice, mustard and lavender. The lavender does a pretty good job at covering up the smell of the mayonnaise and such for the most part as the mustard smell is fighting to overpower it. The mixture is white and feels more like a light skin moisturizer cream rather than a heavy protein treatment. It&#x27;s not thick but not runny, it&#x27;s like thinned out mayonnaise. Once out of the jar and onto you hair it comes out white but then it &#x27;melts&#x27; into your hair. I put my hair into sections and applied it that way, section by section until my whole head was saturated. Don&#x27;t use too much, it says apply generously, not soak your head, that will just waste product, do it until you can feel something there when you touch it but won&#x27;t drip off your hair. I could feel it soften my hair when I put it on, however since I couldn&#x27;t resist touching my hair, it got on my fingers and it smelled like a cigarette or an ashtray.That&#x27;s probably the smell of the castor oil that was covered by the lavender. It says to leave on for 20 minutes to an hour with a heating cap(Doesn&#x27;t have to be a heating cap, it can be another source of indirect heat, steamer, hooded dryer, etc.)Well I changed it as I didn&#x27;t use any heat. I put on a silk scarf, and coveredit with a satin bonnet as I have a habit of loosening them when I sleep and waking up with them on the floor or somewhere in the bed. I slept with it on and rinsed it out this morning. I have never used a protein conditioner before but I knew what to expect. My hair feels stronger, although a bit drier, but that&#x27;s my fault for not using a moisturizing conditioner and my hair is really thick already, so I can&#x27;t say anything about that. Next time I will deep condition for moisture to combat the dryness. All in all a good product. I recommend using it once a month. If you have a good moisturizing conditioner, use that, but my hair probably needs something more afterwards.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;s going to work long term, but the smell is odd.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product for the first time and found it to work wonders on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I recently had bariatric surgery and after the 4th month I began losing my hair in the front.  I tried the silica pills and they seemed to work but only on the hair that was not shedding and it was not helping to grow new hair.  About a week after massaging this product into my scalp each night, my hair has began to grow back and it is filling in nicely.  I was kinda skeptical at first, but I am now a believer.  You have to adjust to the smell of lavendar and vanilla, but I dont mind since my hair is growing back!  The most important thing is to massage your scalp so that the blood can get to the follicle and absorb the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my hair I will order more!!!!</li>
    <li> So far I have used this product twice. I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything significant as of yet. Still waiting on results.</li>
    <li> The smell is something to be reckoned with but it&#x27;s worth it. This product worked for my 4C hair. Please follow with moisturizing conditioner following the treatment or you will be sorry. I made that mistake and my hair felt like straw.</li>
    <li> This product is good my hair Is growing and with me having very thick hair ,It makes my hair soft.  Will buy again because it is natural .I like natural things.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells horrible!!! I may have been able to get pass the smell but it made my hair completely dry. It is still sitting under my sink.</li>
    <li> I use this product once a month on my hair. My hair feel softer and stronger. Great for people who use chemicals in their hair. I color my hair and this product is a miracle.</li>
    <li> I was truly sorry I purchased this product. First the smell is terrible. Its the mustard seed in it that gives off the offending odor. Second it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the hair like I expected it to. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I almost gave this a negative review when I first used it because of the smell, it smells like salad dressing on my hair. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She is three and last year her hair started breaking off, because she is so young the products I would used on my hair would make it worst. I used this on her hair as a pre poo, I left it on for 30 min under a plastic cap while she plays or watch tv. I then washed it out and deep condition. This is the third time I used it on her hair and her hair loves it. I braided her hair for two weeks and got very tiny shedding from the braid. I will be stocking up on this stuff.</li>
    <li> Gross, greasy, vinegary and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Smells like pickle juice so I have only used it once...</li>
    <li> Love Castor oil products. Good for my hair.</li>
    <li> Good but its light and doesn&#x27;t go along way if you have a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> Wroks great on my hair.</li>
    <li> The packaging was really suspicious... the jar was in a used zip lock bag that was apparently too small.  The jar had fingerprints and smudges all over it and the verbiage on the label had errors that was masked with a white label.  I didnt feel comfortable in using the product, so I just discarded it.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair seems to love Jamaican Black Castor oil so I decided to try this product.  Product worked as described.  The only problem is that I got smaller sizes than I ordered.</li>
    <li> On time, no problems....just hope it works!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and Fast Shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Great  product  for  stretching  your  new  growth as well as promoting new  growth. However  this  product smells  like pickles which  isn&#x27;t  so  pleasant  but  still a  great  buy</li>
    <li> I love how well this stuff works! It makes my hair so strong and soft. It has natural ingredients and rinses out pretty well. The only gripe I have with this is the smell. It smells like pickles and herbs! I think it&#x27;s the mustard seed that does it. I usually cut down the smell by adding other oils to it. I would give it 5 stars other than that, but that smell knocks it right down to a 4.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff I don&#x27;t have much to say about it but it is good stuff. Really moisturise my hair.</li>
    <li> I just received my order of this item and I&#x27;ve used it twice on my hair and once on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I must say, the results are amazing! Hair felt stronger after I deep conditioned for two hours and it was shinier and more lustrous. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for my hair, I will purchase again... I can&#x27;t find this in my local hair stores.</li>
    <li> excellent but makes hair hard</li>
    <li> I used this product on both my hair and my daughters.  It was not as it claimed to be for my hair.  Our hair actually felt rough and lacked luster.  Both of us have extremely soft fine hair. I will not use this again. It is very difficult to find a product that gives my moisture without being greasy.  And the cost of trying various hair products makes me want to go back to Dixie Peach.  I did not know wearing my natural hair would be so difficult.</li>
    <li> This product contains mustard seed which makes the conditioner smell like pickle juice so if you can&#x27;t put up with that do not buy this product. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me and I used it with heat for 20 minutes before rinsing. The jar says to use a moisturizing conditioner afterwards and i did. My hair did not get hard and felt sufficiently conditioned. I hope the long term results of this line will be good.</li>
    <li> Product was a lot smaller than I thought. I&#x27;ve used it, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it&#x27;s really not cost effective. I have to mix it with another conditioner.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! Weird mustard smell. However I will take it because of how soft and strong my hair felt after( and my hair is bleached!) I did heat the protein treatment beforehand (double boil method- no microwave)as I&#x27;m starting to do with all my products. Perfect for my 90 day healthy hair challenges which you can join w me http://kalssendofabwraps.com click skin click hair and click hair skin and nails. I loook forward to any questions and enjoy the protein treatment.</li>
    <li> Smells like pickles and mayonnaise. Used it once and it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. My hair felt brittle afterwards</li>
    <li> Has a minty type of smell and makes my hair extra fluffy. Everyone says castor oil is great for natural hair so I&#x27;m just seeing. Not sure of growth or thickness results because I haven&#x27;t used it regularly</li>
    <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve only used it one time because I only wash my hair once every to weeks but had the shipping would&#x27;ve been fast it took 15 days for it to arrive they need to work on they shipment other than that the product is good would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
    <li> I like it because its all natural. Definitely saw an improvement in my girls&#x27; hair. I use it on my natural tresses as well. I also use it for hot oil treatments which moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> This product comes in an 8oz plastic jar. When you take the lid off there is a vacuum seal. I did not purchase on Amazon, but from Tropic Isle&#x27;s website. So if yours does not have a seal, then I would not use it. The consistency is like pudding.  The color is light tan, sort of off white. It smells like lemongrass and vinegar.  I used as directed, close to an hour with a plastic cap on my head. When I rinsed it out my hair is soft and my hair smells only of lemongrass. Even though my hair was soft, I followed up with a deep conditioner as you should do when you use a protein conditioner. I like this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So incredibly bad smelling that I threw it away. The product didn&#x27;t work on my fine, straight hair and I smelled of the product all day. It&#x27;s a good way to have people avoid you all day.</li>
    <li> every time I wash my hair and apply this to rinse, it soften my hair great. I haven&#x27;t had time to leave it in for a while but do think it is a good leave-in condition for hair repair.</li>
    <li> This protein conditioner treatment felt like butter when I first applied which was good since it has protein, Shea butter, aloe and other ingredients that are too help the brittle hair. It does its job as stated but does have a funny scent but its tolerable!</li>
    <li> I uses this protein hair conditioner and it left my hair feeling strong. I a little goes a long way, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as yet, but I&#x27;ve fallen in love with all other Tropic Isle products I&#x27;ve tried, so I expect the same with this one.</li>
    <li> Delivered when expected. I really like the way it makes my hair feels. Will be ordering again soon. I&#x27;m not really feeling the smell but its tolerable</li>
    <li> This is the best protein treatment that I have ever used. My hair loved it. My curls popped and were so soft, protein treatments usually leave my hair dry, but not this one.  It&#x27;s important to remember to deep condition you hair, with a protein free deep conditioner, after the protein treatment.  Otherwise, you hair will be dry, brittle and possibly break.  I use it monthly in between henna treatments. My only complaint is the packaging. Although it was wrapped in the box, some of the oil leaked from the container, they need a better sealing technique. But the product itself is amazing, but they are going to have to do something about all that JBCO goodness leaking from the container.</li>
    <li> It definitely helps to add a bit of thickness to your hair. I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Wow so far not bad this look and smells great thank u for be on time this is a must I have hear this make your hair lay flat. SO again Thank u</li>
    <li> I have not used it often just once it has a very strong smell protein is very important for the human body and hair I will use it again with my hair steamer</li>
    <li> works timely delivery smells strong but works</li>
    <li> This is what I ordered BUT not what I received. Be careful ordering this product as pictured. Why could they not send me what I ordered and paid for. Sending it back would cost me more money. The bottle of conditioner that I received looks like the shampoo bottle!</li>
    <li> I have only used it one time but I do love it and will be using it again this week when I deep condition my hair it is one of the best that I have used.  I strongly recommend it to anyone who is going natural even those who have relaxed hit it is very good</li>
    <li> Great Product saw a difference with first application.  However the company didn&#x27;t tighten the cap nor was enforced with a safety seal.</li>
    <li> Did not get to use, product leaked into box</li>
    <li> Smells like some type of medicine but it makes your hair feel wonderful after deep conditioning. Love it! Took off a star for the smell but whatever.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this, fortunately I saw it in the store and didn&#x27;t just make an online purchase. I couldn&#x27;t stomach the smell...ig it smells no worse than a relaxer. But the smell was definitely a deal breaker for me</li>
    <li> it smells nice and makes my hair soft and curly doesnt take much</li>
    <li> Received product on time.   I would definitely order again from them.    Ingredients listed all natural and this is definitely hard to find.  You can even smell the natural ingredients.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Creamy texture, nice fresh and light smell, hair felt smooth with a nice sheen...I would recommend. If your hair is thick and long, purchase more than one. I have fine just past the shoulder length hair and I can afford to stretch the product. I like so far.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this products to my friends. It is a wonderful protein treatment for your hair.</li>
    <li> Where has this product been all my life. I used this before I got my hair braided and it made my hair feel so soft and strong</li>
    <li> Depending on what type of hair you have this product will be amazing. Mine didn&#x27;t take to it at all unfortunately. It had a dried up crinkle effect on my hair &amp; the same on my son. We both have very thick afro hair &amp; it just didn&#x27;t work on it. But everyone is different</li>
    <li> Definitely need some deep condish after this one but it makes your hair so strong and curls pop like crazy. Downside with armpit length hair you only get  about 5 uses out of one bottle.  Would however  re-purchase  because it works wonders. Really does help with damaged hair. P.S if you cannot get past smells do not purchase this product!  You might die.</li>
    <li> This product made an immediate difference with my hair. Breakage was reduced dramatically.  I can honestly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product line at suggestion of a hair dresser.. This is a good product, it leaves hair soft once dry and you don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizing conditioner afterwards per the directions. If you&#x27;re concerned about dryness, you can add honey when applying to hair which is what I do. My hair is natural 4a very kinky. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.. Some people are overly sensitive I think.. As long as it works, that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
    <li> When I saw this product I had to have it. I like Jamaican Black Castor Oil. Ladies, I will say this...&lt;br /&gt;This product stinks!&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works I only use it once a month.</li>
    <li> The smell, I cannot get over but it does condition my hair well. I use a regular conditioner afterwards. I like the ya it coats my hair. I should use it more but I have twists is I&#x27;ve only had the chance to use it twice.</li>
    <li> Love it. Made my hair softer. My hair was damage but this made it stronger. My hair also started to grow again. On the downside it stinks....</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF 1 MAIN INGREDIENT ! &amp;#34;APPLE CIDER VINEGAR&amp;#34;! GREAT FOR THE SCALP, SOOTHES, CLEANSES AND CALMS AND NOURISHES A DRY UNHEALTHY SCALP ! NO MORE, ITCHING, DRYNESS, OR FLAKING !&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR ALL HAIR TYPES, AFTER WASHING HAIR, PERM, COLORING SERVICES ETC....&lt;br /&gt;YOUR HAIR AND SCALP WILL THANK YOU FOR IT !&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST  TOP 5 CONDITIONERS NOW !!! , CAN ALSO BE USED AS A CO-WASH ,&lt;br /&gt;IT HELPED TO REGROW MY HAIR !</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be fore-warned that a little goes a long way.  It melts into the hair and scalp at room temperature.  It does make your hair so soft.  Since it has castor oil, there is a strong aroma, but it&#x27;s not a bad one.</li>
    <li> It is a very unpleasant &amp;#34;pickles&amp;#34; smell to me that does stay in the hair if it is not conditioned/deep conditioned after.  This is a protein treatment.  Such products generally make hair hard and drier after. Thus, a protein treatment should always be followed up with a deep conditioning treatment.  The protein strengthens the hair and the deep conditioner allows provides moisture and elasticity.  I have only had one treatment so far and I did not feel that it added the amount of strength I expected, as after I washed my hair it was still &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34;.  I have 4b/c 10 weeks post relaxer. However, when I did a strand test after I had deep conditioned and air dried, I was far more pleased and will use again in a week or two.</li>
    <li> Just what my hair needed will order again</li>
    <li> please note on your label what is made of what it is for and so on  written description would be great</li>
    <li> I use this BEFORE I wash my hair.  It really seems to get into my hair shaft, and my hair comes out silky smooth. I really like it.  Smells like mayo, but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair.  I like it a lot. All of the Island Living products are outstanding.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great condition for my dry hair. This line of product is great.I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Extremely drying..detangling was a nightmare...and overpriced for a tiny 8 oz jar.  Next time, I will try mayonnaise with some olive oil.  It will be much cheaper and last longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this protein treatment.  It smells like pickles or potato salad and my hair feels dry after I use this.  I tried giving this to my roommate and she gave it back lol.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using this product at first, but after having large chunks of hair fried off I was willing to give anything a try. Right away I noticed that the smell of the cronditioner was actually pleasent, it made me think of mustard seeds, and after I washed it out and used my regular conditioner my hair did not keep the mustard smell, I also noticed after the first use that my hair felt smoother and healthier than it had after any other products I had tried. I have used up the first container and am going to be buying the larger size soon. It really has helped my hair recover and grow quicker. I have even recommended this to friends who find their hair doesn&#x27;t shine or feel as smooth as it used to and they also love it. If you are skeptical like I was I would recommend trying the small jar first to see how you like it.</li>
    <li> Product came with seal broken and completely melted and leaking out</li>
    <li> Smells weird but leave the hair looking nice...don&#x27;t overdue the time or it will look very greasy or &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love it my hair feel so soft and nice and curly</li>
    <li> I have used this several times to make sure the results I was receiving was indeed from this product and I have to say it is.  My hair loves black castor oil but it does not like this protein treatment, it really dries my hair out even with me using moisturizing conditioners behind it so I&#x27;m no longer going to use this.  Also, I didn&#x27;t find the smell to be as bad some were saying but some people have sensitive nose so ....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great for dry hair.</li>
    <li> excellent product and excellent service!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner has my 4b hair moist and shiny. Because it is a protein conditioner, I use it every 6 - 8 weeks and follow with a deep conditioner after each use. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I hear so many naturals raving about this stuff but I don&#x27;t see it. First of all it smells weird. Like salad dressing. It&#x27;s very watery and the jar is little. I was just disappointed. Plus I didn&#x27;t see a huge benefit towards my hair. But eh. It&#x27;s whatever. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for transitioning or natural hair.  I can use as a pre-conditioner before wash or after washing my hair.  It works great if you are looking for a great conditioning product during &amp;#34;greenhouse&amp;#34; or overnight conditioning.  It does what it says it does especially for thin hair that breaks easily.</li>
    <li> The mayo smell is noticeable when you open the jar. But, it works well and worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product works miracles</li>
    <li> One when I got the product it was terribly packaged. The cap wasn&#x27;t closed all the way and a lot of the oil had seeped out into the bag it was in, the bag holding that bag and even into the box. I&#x27;m in college and I live on campus. This stuff doesn&#x27;t exactly smell great and I had to take the shuttle all the way to my campus with this smell attached to me. Then when I used the product it felt like I was putting plain oil in my hair and yes I mixed it. The product is also very small. I have to use it a few more times to see what it does to my hair but if that&#x27;s nothing then I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. I sure hope it&#x27;s effective...especially since it&#x27;s smelly and pricey. After I start using it and see results, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> I used this for the 1st time last week. I left it on for ~10-15mins based on a review I saw prior that it can get your hair feeling hard really quickly. While washing it off, my  4b/4c strands felt a bit tougher and I was scared I overdid the protein. But that feel didn&#x27;t last once my hair dried.    I&#x27;ll use again (maybe every other month or so) but def leave it on for like 5mins next time.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair feel extra dry and frizzy like straw.  I do not feel like it strengthened or improved the appearance of my hair in any way.  I am not sure if I am just sensitive to protein products or what, but I have used others with no problems.</li>
    <li> Hi !&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say that this product is the bomb.com, it worked wonders for my hair that at the first use I had to reorder another jar. This conditioner made my kinks and new growth so super easy to comb thru and that within itself is an A+ for me. Cons are the jar is small and it is kind of expensive for such a small jar and it smells like pickles.&lt;br /&gt;Pros : it works wonders on my natural hair, I almost was tempted to give up this natural thing and go back to the creamy crack, but I decided to try this after reading the reviews and I am so glad I did purchase this.&lt;br /&gt;Will I be ordering this again? Yes, Yes and a double Yes</li>
    <li> Works great, softens hair allowing for easy post wash comb-through. Very moisturizing. The smell may not be appealing to some, but it does not stay in the hair after rinsing.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Made my hair feel soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  I have noticed a change in the texture of our hair but the smell is somewhat pickley.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I only gave this product two stars, I am not sure if it is actually working and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad. The product showed up covering the directions and there were no directions in the package. I think I was actually using the product wrong.</li>
    <li> Im a natural hair person, looking for something to help my natural curls, and I bought it and it stink so bad I still have it on the shelf but when you mask it with other products its ok. When I ask people does my hair stink they say no. So maybe its just me. Buy it and let me know if it dont smell like pickle juice to you.</li>
    <li> I like they way my hair feels with this conditioner. I have read other reviews regarding it&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong odor but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair has thinned out from this product line.</li>
    <li> my hair feels so good after using this.</li>
    <li> I love it.......can feel the nutients being infused into hair folicles...... hair looks and fill healthier already.......excited about what is to come......use to use mayonnaise to conditioner hair,  this give same results.....and dont mine the smell at all.</li>
    <li> I USED THE CONDITIONER AND I DIDN&#x27;T REALLY SEE ANY RESULTS.  I THOUGH MY HAIR WOULD ATLEAST FEEL A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T.  I HAVE NATURAL HAIR SO I KNOW WHEN A PRODUCT HAS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON MY HAIR.  I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT ON AMAZON BECAUSE, I DID NOT SEE THIS IN MY LOCAL BEAUTY SUPPLY.</li>
    <li> This product is great for anyone going natural. This keeps your hair hydrated. I recommend this product line. I could tell right away that this was good for my hair. It does have a scent to it that seemed a little strong, but natural. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible, it makes me sick to my stomach. The jar was beat up and not sealed therefore I will not use it.The name of the seller on the package does not say Tropic Isle Living but blue herbs. I cannot say how it works for my hair because I haven&#x27;t used it and will not use it. This is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Tried it and it made my hair hard! When I read the instructiosn it says that after using it, I should use the &#x27;conditioner&#x27; but I cannot seem to locate the conditioner.</li>
    <li> i just cant say enough great things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, curly/really wavy hair that is to my waist and to keep it healthy and split ends minimal i use this!&lt;br /&gt;It is so amazing for your hair, i like to use this as a deep conditioning mask and as a styling product. All i do is mix some of the JBCO and some organic honey in towel dry hair and then use my hair dryer with my diffuser and BAM.... i have some swoon worthy curls! Trust me i get compliments and people asking me what i do to my hair all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and people have commented on the smell, yes it doesnt smell great, it doesnt have synthetic perfumes in it to make it smell good, but it doesnt linger in the hair, maybe the honey i use cancels out the smell bc my hair always smells normal.</li>
    <li> THE smell is atrociously awful. But I must admit that it makes my Hair stronger. I do relaxers on my Hair and using this product once helps from having to do one sooner..</li>
    <li> This product smells so bad, like it smells like mayonaise that was covered in lavender to try and make it smell better, which is exactly what it is. The product isn&#x27;t that bad, but I didn&#x27;t use it to it&#x27;s full extent. I used it and left it on for a while, but didn&#x27;t use any heat. I used it along side the coconut hair food by the same company (get that, it&#x27;s better to be honest) and it wasn&#x27;t spectacular, but like I said, I didn&#x27;t use it correctly. ANYWAYS, the black castor oil or the coconut hair food is better, get those. Not this. This smells so bad. I read about the complaints about the smell beforehand, but I figured the awesome hair results would outweigh that, it didn&#x27;t. The smell is so bad.</li>
    <li> I think this project is great for the hair because it locks In lots of moisture and softness and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> I love this product as a deep conditioner.  i will re order it.  the smell is bad BUT i think it works.</li>
    <li> love it mde my hair so soft i been using it for  about 6 months my hair stop shedding and beaking off when I comb it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with relaxed hair. I just started my healthy hair journey a little over a month now so I&#x27;m still in the process of experimenting to find out what&#x27;s the best products for my hair.  I heard protein treatments are good to help prevent and treat hair breakage so I bought this product because of the good reviews it received.  I used it for the first time today by leaving it on my hair for 10 minutes under a heat cap and immediately noticed my hair felt thicker but I also noticed that my hair started to break more after I took my rollers out and tried to comb the curls out.  Maybe I&#x27;m just protein sensitive. I have used the Aphogee Two step Protein Treatment once last month and did not notice this much breakage. I also did a deep condition with the alter Ego hair mask with extra virgin olive oil, extra virgin coconut oil and tropic isle living strong roots red pimento growth oil added to it after washing out the protein treatment.  I am going to use this product again but maybe in like 2 months from now.  Maybe this protein treatment is too strong for my thin, damaged, processed hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this product four stars just because the other products I have use, are so good, and I have not yet used this one, as soon as I have used it, I will be back to add or subtract stars.</li>
    <li> I am natural and have a short hairstyle that I often &amp;#34;dye and fry&amp;#34;  means that I need a lot of moisture and protein to offset the damaging effects (although I do try to avoid applying heat as much possible) I already used JBCO so I ordered this a few months back as a compliment and so far so good. I may not be the best judge since I don&#x27;t use it as often as I probably should, I take really good care of my hair (well try to) and my hair loves protein so it loves this product! I also think it has a nice &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell. The only complaint I have is with the texture because is a little thinner and oilier (you can definitely tell there is oil in it) than I would like which causes it to run down my neck and face when I am applying it and I am sure I use too much as a result. You can definitely tell there is oil in it). As for use, I use it about once a month.  I usually leave it in for a few hours or overnight, rinse, condition with something super moisturizing and then apply my oil mix (which includes JBCO) and shea butter. My hair always looks and feels pretty good--soft and strong--after. Never crunchy even before I use the moisturizing conditioner. On the other hand my boyfriend, says his hair feels harder/stronger after using it when he has not used a moisturizing conditioner. This could be due to our different hair textures&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my hair still looks healthy and isn&#x27;t dry despite all the abuse I put it through and I think that this has helped with that.</li>
    <li> When I first receives this conditioner I hated the smell. But this protein treatment mamade my hair feel great and the smell didnt linger.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my monthly regimen.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! Received on time. Effective moisture retention. Stop breakage and damage to hair. Strengthen every strand of hair.</li>
    <li> This Jamaican black castor conditioner has so far been good. I think I need to use it more to really get good benefits from it. So far it makes my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Wors like a charm Luv it. Nice color palette. Just what I wanted. Just as described. Works  Luv it. Nice color palette. Just what I wanted. Just as described.  Good seller. Would buy pouch again.</li>
    <li> This product smells horrible, and it stipped my hair and created a hard texture. Once again the smell is extremely too strong. I would rather pre-deep condition my hair with egg, coconut oil, castor oil, and olive oil. I received a better result with this mixture than this product.</li>
    <li> JBCO protein conditioner came on time, good service. It does not have a great smell but I apply it to my scalp every night.</li>
    <li> This conditioner regrew my edges with in a month and it Smelled like sandwiches. That&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;ll use it for one more month and see what happens.</li>
    <li> I really did not see any benefit from this product- while it was easy enough to use, the smell was not so great (not overwhelming either) and for the size, it was overpriced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing, bit of itching if left on too long, but other than that, it&#x27;s perfection I&#x27;d recommend to absolutely everyone</li>
    <li> Good product that made my hair feel strong. It is smelly but it&#x27;s not that bad. I had less breakage overall. I will definitely use it again.</li>
    <li> Smell terrible but it the job done</li>
    <li> The application process was great! I loved the consistency and way it smoothed into my hair! The smell was HORRIBLE and I was only able to use it twice, that&#x27;s not much for the price! It didn&#x27;t make my hair hard or crunchy, which is a good thing, but I really couldn&#x27;t tell that it helped my hair become stronger. I loved how shiny my hair was after washing it out! After detangling, washing it out and deep conditioning for moisture, I still had hairs in my comb while styling. I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again, but I would recommend it because it may work for others. I am thinking of purchasing the ingredients and making it myself maybe with a little more protein. Not much more.</li>
    <li> This protein conditioner is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. It works pretty much as advertised, and I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s 100% natural and not chock full of weird chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce, unlike other protein conditioners. (Looking at you, aPHogee and Aubrey GPB). Okay, look. This stuff smells, alright? I get it it. It smells like mustard, really strong mustard! You have to be very meticulous about rinsing it out. I use Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree tingle conditioner and rinse it out twice after I use this product. It says right on the jar that you should follow this protein conditioner with a moisturizing conditioner. So all of the people making reviews that are like &amp;#34;IT&#x27;S MADE MY HAIR SO HARD/BREAKABLE&amp;#34; um...it&#x27;s a protein conditioner. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. That &amp;#34;hardness&amp;#34; you feel are the proteins attached to the strands of your hair - duh. If you don&#x27;t follow it up with a moisturizing conditioner (as the directions clearly state) then you&#x27;re incompetent, and that&#x27;s why your hair is still hard. I follow mine up with shea moisture deep treatment masque for 20 minutes with a shower cap under a heated dryer. I have natural 4a/b hair, and this stuff works wonders. My hair is fluffy and lively and amazing after using this product! My only regret is I wish more came in the jar, because 8ounces is pretty steep for $13.</li>
    <li> Works just like the description says.  I experienced quite a bit of hair growth after finishing the first container. However,like other reviewers noted, it doesn&#x27;t have the best smell.  I use a very nice smelling conditioner afterwards to mask the scent.</li>
    <li> I found this product while looking for a moisturizing conditioner. After reading several reviews and the ingredients list, I decided to try it. So happy I did. It is AMAZING! I used it as directed, then after rinsing, I applied a moisturizing conditioner, then dried my hair. - My dry hair was hydrated, shiny and had lots of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will be placing more orders.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet,but i have heard so many great things about it. Im very excited to use it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;m using this right. I put this on after I thoroughly shampooed my hair and sat under a bonnet dryer for 45 minutes. It didn&#x27;t really do anything in my opinion. Maybe I need to use it more than once to really see a difference. Honestly, I wonder what the difference is between a protein conditioner and a protein treatment. I also bought Aphogee which I will use in November. I doubt I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a good deep protein conditioner. However, you will want to use another conditioner to soften your hair.</li>
    <li> This product was too greasy. I want my hair to feel soft, shiny and healthy not greasy and weighted down.  I didn&#x27;t like it and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive, natural protein treatment. It works great, but it has a smell that may be off-putting to people some people (esp. if you are sensitive to smells). I put it on my hair and sit under my heated bonnet for about a half-hour then rinse it out (followed by a deep conditioner). My hair is noticeably stronger after using this treatment.</li>
    <li> This product smells really bad, how can a company even make this to put in someone&#x27;s hair. I threw this in the garbage the minute I opened the jar.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my 3a 3c hair. My hair felt limp, dry, and damaged. My hair is in good condition because I usually make my hair masks myself out of kitchen ingredients but have become busy so I thought I&#x27;d buy what I thought was relatively close to the same thing but already made. It is not. Whatever extra chemicals used cancels out the natural products. I will just make time for my hair masks and I suggest the same for others.</li>
    <li> Drawback: It smells terrible! Like bad potato salad but keep in mind, this product isn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;apply it and let it work&amp;#34; kind of hair treatment. To work it&#x27;s best it you need to have a heating cap (which I had to go out and buy). I bought this and the Strong Roots Red Pimento hair oil-same company. It&#x27;s only been a little over 3 months since my last relaxer and I have new growth like it&#x27;s been 5 or 6 months. I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if this keep growing.</li>
    <li> It stripped my hair  made it feel very thin and gritty.</li>
    <li> Two things: 1)Its extremely hard to rinse this out of your hair! first time my hair dried a little bit i noticed that they are still sticky, so i went to rinse it again, and i thought i got it all out but my roots still look oily, i guess ill just go shampoo it now. 2) Super excessive mayonnaise smell that makes me hungry, i feel like i bought a jar of mayonnaise! Over all its not bad, made my hair soft, but nothing special and i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I only ued this conditioner once after washing my hair and find it difficult to rate at present. Please inform me of how often i need to use prooduct and if I need the shampoo with it?</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel good,  It is affordable and it does what it states. I have recommended this item to friends and family members.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected. The product smelled badly.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE SMELL. I couldn&#x27;t even get past the smell to use the product a second time. Won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. The smell is way too strong. I only used it once than threw the jar away</li>
    <li> The smell is good. Haven&#x27;t seen signicant results yet. Will repost when results are seen</li>
    <li> I purchased this and honestly haven&#x27;t used it just yet because I really don&#x27;t like the smell. It has a very strong mustard smell but I a blogger from you tube named lipstickncurls put on to it and said it really works great on curly or natural hair. So eventually I will use it!</li>
    <li> This product has a unique smell to it if you can get pass  the smell you will love using it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Protein Hair Conditioner only once. I am sure I will see better results as I continue to use it once a month. I read some reviews written by individuals who didn&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s a has a strong herbal smell, but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how I feel about this product yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do LOVEEE the ingredients in it tho&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the texture is rather light and i like my DC to be thick lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after using it on my hair, I guess it did the job but £13 or so for a container that small ,makes me think I cant use this long term..now in search of a more cost efficient product with great ingredients like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i rated it 3</li>
    <li> Loved It.  My hair felt soooooo good.</li>
    <li> This product has a strong smell and contains a lot of oil. When i received it the oil somehow leaked outside of the container. The application is messy, would be easier to apply if it was inside of a dispensing bottle and not a jar. Overall my hair seemed to like it, my hair felt moisturized after rinsing it out, but i will not be using this often since i don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of the product at all, it just gets to me so bad and I feel the product does not do much for my hair. I will finish my current  container but will not order another</li>
    <li> I just tired this product as a prepoo and it left my fine/thin strands weighed down and feeling greasy as hell. Yuck. And the smell is bad enough. Bottom line I would not recommend this product for people with fine or thin hair. I&#x27;ve tried many thick protein conditioners and none of them were greasy. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I didnt want to give this product any stars because  it smell like mayonnaise and vinegar.I only use it on places where i need my hair to grow and it broken my hair off all the way down to the scalp.I dont recommend this product to anyone.If I could get my money back I would.</li>
    <li> Did wonders for my hair, but smelled like pickle juice.  Very oily.  I could have made this at home. Mayo and different oils including pimento yuk.</li>
    <li> I havent use it yet, but I heard good things about. The smell of this product is horrible to me but I didn&#x27;t buy the product for the smell</li>
    <li> I thought it was a leave in conditioner..... But its cool when I have the time to sit under a dryer....</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this item, I decided to try it. I am not sure if it works, but I don&#x27;t really the smell it leaves.</li>
    <li> I swear this stuff makes my hair fuller and thicker and it grows much faster with it. I&#x27;ve not even used a heating cap as it says to do — I only use it as a conditioner in the shower and leave it in for a few minutes. This bottle has lasted a good amount of time and I highly recommend it to promote healthy hair as well as growth.</li>
    <li> The smell is funky but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> this stuff has a funny smell to it</li>
    <li> This is just overpriced Shea butter with unnecessary ingredients and a little castor oil. You can whip shea butter together yourself and put whatever oil you want in it. This was a waste. I brought this with two other products sold together because of the hype and after I opened it I realized that it wasn&#x27;t worth buying. Wished I would&#x27;ve been able to see this in a store, opened it and read the ingredients. It would&#x27;ve stayed there on the shelf. I&#x27;m just sad that I was too busy to get a chance to return this</li>
    <li> This oil works very well with hair dryer</li>
    <li> I just received the product and only used it once, I like it so far but will write an update after additional uses.</li>
    <li> stinks. didn&#x27;t help my hair</li>
    <li> Very good conditioner.  It smells nice.  It leaves the hair very well moisturized after use with a heating cap.  It seems to reduce breakage and strengthens the hair.  It softens the hair and makes it very manageable.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product over a year ago to combat over moisturizing my hair. It was slightly \\&quot;mushy\\&quot; and elastic-like so I felt it needed some strengthening. This stuff did the trick! Be sure to follow with a very moisturizing deep conditioner as your hair will be hard and dry afterwords...that&#x27;s normal for a protein conditioner. Anyway, after using this product I experienced the following:&lt;br /&gt;- stronger hair that no longer stretched and snaped&lt;br /&gt;- reduced shedding (almost none)&lt;br /&gt;- restored shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very pleased. I will mention that the product is a bit runny so I would suggest towel blotting the hair before applying just so it sticks to the hair better. All the other reviews are correct, it does smell like pickle juice! Call me a pickle for pretty hair, I don&#x27;t mind :-)</li>
    <li> I order this grease&amp;It actually grew my hair.A girl pulled out my braids while fighting&amp;my hair grew back in no time.I love it!</li>
    <li> After each use, my hair seems to be in a worse state and required the use of another conditioner to soften and straighten it out.  It must work on certain hair types only and not natural hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I fell in love with the JBCO. I&#x27;m African American and have natural hair.  A conditioner should have some slip to it. This conditioner felt very watery and thin to me. I will say that using this conditioner, their shampoo and oil will MOST CERTAINLY thicken your hair and help it to retain its length. HOWEVER I could not get past the stench. The smell was so strong and loud my husband knocked on the bathroom door and asked what it was! It smells sour and rank. Combine the smell with the lack of slip and I threw my towel in......</li>
    <li> I love the results I got with this product. My hair felt soft and strong, and my curls were springy! I applied it like this: pre-poo (coconut oil and jamaican black castor oil), shampoo, then applied this to my hair with my fingers. Placed two plastic bags over my head and then wrapped that with a towel and left it on for about 30 minutes--I hate sitting under a dryer. Be sure to follow this up with a moisturizing conditioner. The only con is that it does smell like potato salad. I added a little lavender essential oil to mask the smell. I don&#x27;t use the hair-typing system, but I have curly hair (picture Alicia Keys + Solange Knowles) that is partially springy curls, frizz, and tangles! I am definitely going to order this again. After reading other reviews, I think this product can be used as an intensive conditioner or a protein treatment, depending on what your hair needs. I don&#x27;t think this is the correct product for a pre-shampoo treatment though (it&#x27;s a little pricey for my taste to be the product that I immediately wash out)-I prefer coconut for a pre-poo treatment. The price isn&#x27;t terrible, and it is definitely comparable to what I found in my favorite beauty shop. I feel this product is worth a try; if you don&#x27;t like it, mix it with your regular conditioner for a deep conditioner once a month.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs a protein conditioner to use to switch out with their deep conditioner and this is a great product but it made my hair very greasy and heavy and it smells like pickles/salad dressing. Im not sure if mine was more heavy than usal b/c I mix my conditioners with oils but try it anyway it made my hair very soft and manageable in the end. Definitley a positive difference. You probably shouldnt use this if you have fine hair; may be too heavy for you.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after using this product</li>
    <li> Followed instructions, after 2 warm water rinsings, Still on/in the hair.  Sure the actual hair strands have a heavier, greasy &amp; it feels OK. Gotta go another rinse.  I bought it, so I guess IT&#x27;S MINE NOW!</li>
