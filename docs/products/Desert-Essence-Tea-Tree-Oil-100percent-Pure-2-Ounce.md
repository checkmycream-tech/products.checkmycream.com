      <li>I&#x27;ve also used it in a morning to clean my face mix with witch hazel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not really too happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem too concentrated, and seems weaker in strength from other Tea Tree Oil I&#x27;ve purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually pure Tea Tree Oil can &#x27;sting&#x27; slightly when applied to your skin, and you need to mix it yourself with other oil before application, but this one was not giving me that strong 100% Tea Tree &#x27;sting&#x27; when applied to my skin, straight from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never purchased it again, and found another company selling a larger bottle that had the strength I was used to.</li>
    <li> this is a product which I have used for many years.  It is effective as a reliever of itching from insect bites and small scrapes, etc.  It is an effective antiseptic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to explain this without being to gross :)I&#x27;ve had very bad toenail fungus on my big toe, and not so bad on some other toes. After using this for only 2 days so far (twice a day) I am already seeing great improvement. On my big toe it was so bad, that it was growing in kind of layers. I woke up this morning, and 3/4 of my toenail fell off where the fungus was. Its pretty gross, but I could see a lot of fungus under the part of the toenal that fell off. On my other toes, where its not so bad, its already clearing up. I didn&#x27;t think the results would be this fast! I&#x27;m also surprised I didn&#x27;t see any reviews for this product regarding toe nail fungus. But it is a gross subject. One thing I do agree with other posts, is the design of the bottle needs to be better for dispensing. Anyway this particular brand of Tea Tree Oil, IS working for my toenail fungus, and working fast!</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time. I believe it is the best brand out there.</li>
    <li> I had another brand of Tea Tree oil that did not work as well as this one. So I know the quality of this Tea Tree Oil is GREAT! I initially bought it to use on a cold sore and let me tell you it demolished it in a couple of days!! The cold sore had already grown and it was big and yucky. I wet a q-tip pour some drops of this on it and dabbed it on the cold sore 3 times a day, let dry for about 30 minutes and the cold sore and scab was practically gone!     Please note: I did apply Neosporin on top of the Tea Tree after it dried because it dry the cold sore up so much that it can crack and make you bleed and make it worst!! Make sure to wash the cold sore three times a day, ice it with an ice cube for about 3 minutes, then apply the tea tree oil, let it dry for about 30 mins then apply the Neopsporin on top. The Neosporin and Tea Tree as a team does a hell of a job in getting rid of a cold sore!! It is also great on acne! get it!!!    Update:: Be sure to take Lysine supplements this keeps cold sores away and they also have Lysine lip balm as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an acne treatment after my skin had a bad reaction to benzoyl peroxide.  This is definitely easier on my skin than the benzoyl peroxide, but it is also slightly less effective.  I&#x27;m told it takes a few months to see the results of tea tree oil.  I&#x27;ve been diluting it with water 1/9 (because it&#x27;s too strong to put directly on the skin).  I&#x27;m going to try moving up to 1/6 to see if that works any better/more quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my oil cleansing routine ([...]).  I think I will go back to castor oil and olive oil, and use this tea tree oil for the occasionaly breakout.  I am also planning on using it when I get a cold sore again.  Also, I am going to make my husband use it on his athlete&#x27;s foot problem.  It just smells so strong that I don&#x27;t like using it all over my face.  Also, keep away from your eyes!  It comes in a glass bottle with a heavy plastic lid.  Overall, I think it is a good product to have in your home.</li>
    <li> I am never without tea tree oil and not loyal to any brand. Just make sure it&#x27;s undiluted.  Always buy 100% Essential Tea Tree Oil.  I buy it in 16 ounce bottles. It last a long time.     As long as it&#x27;s 100 percent tea tree oil I&#x27;m good. It works from everything to getting rid of fleas and mange on dogs to lice and ring worm on children. It even dries out a pimple fairly quickly. And if I were ever to have nail fungus I would treat it with tea trea oil before resorting to other medications.     For lice I place a few drops into a dime sized blotch of shampoo and wash kids hair as usual. Then I do the same with their leave in conditioner and then blow dry child&#x27;s hair completely. Both the heat and the oil kill the lice. To be on the safe side I treat everyone in the house.     Then I soak brushes and combs daily in a water/tea tree oil mix. 40 drops to every 8 ounces of water. You can reuse the water mix if you do this in a bucket.     I also make up the same solution of 60 drops to 8 ounces of water and place it in a spritz bottle so I can spray all our furniture, bedding, clothes, stuffies and whatever else you think might have a louse on it.     I even put 40 drops into my laundry soap and fabric softener. Not the whole bottle, but 40 drops for every wash and rinse cycle. Hope this makes sense.     Sadly, when my children where in elementary school lice was abundant and we had to deal with it on four occasions. The first two times I used the regular products. They are both expensive and not nearly as effective as the tea tree oil, nor as safe. The third time I did two regular shampoos with the chemical ridden shampoos and followed up with tea tree oil regimen that I listed above. That worked great. The fourth time I treated only with tea tree oil regimen and it was super easy to get rid of.       For mange with dogs it&#x27;s similar as the lice treatment. I place several drops into both their dime sized blob of shampoo and conditioner. I leave in the conditioner.And then spray them down with the sprintzer full of 60 drops of oil to every 8 ounces of water. In between baths I sprintz them down two times a day and rub the solution into their skin. I also spritz their bedding between washes and carpeting and anything they may lie on. I swear it works better than the mange dip I got from the vet and the over the counter mange stuff I bought at the feed store. Plus, it&#x27;s safer to use than what the vet gives you and smells so much better than what is at the feed store. And most importantly completely gets rid of it.     I also use it in my mop water and my kitchen and bathroom cleaning solutions. I place several drops into my hand soap dispensers. And I even use it to disinfect cuts and other sores. It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this oil for a month twice a day for toenail fungus. It works, nails looking better, but it is taking a long time to grow out.  A better alternative to taking medicine which may gave long range  negative effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of Tea Tree oils before and I personally feel that this is the least effective one.</li>
    <li> I use this at night before bed on my acne prone areas, and not only did my skin clear up but I never get breakouts anymore. I use it in conjunction with Dessert Essence&#x27;s face soap and tea tree oil pads and it&#x27;s like a miracle regimine. It can be a little drying, but nothing like other acne products. A moisturizer helps with the dryness.</li>
    <li> this is the most amazing product i have ever come across. i suffer from severe allergies, and this has made a difference in just 24 hours--not a small difference, either--a huge noticeable improvement. i cannot recommend this product highly enough. i am now using it to treat my gums which are receding from forty-five years of prescription allergy and asthma medications, and i have to say it again--a huge noticeable improvement. &lt;BR&gt; this is a highly concentrated product, and a very little will go a very long way. this is truly a cure for whatever ails you.</li>
    <li> the bottle is a bit annoying as it doesnt have a dropper</li>
    <li> Very effective for acne and scars</li>
    <li> I apply this directly to my skin as an acne spot treatment. It works PERFECTLY.</li>
    <li> This stuff is strong but is a very good natural disinfectant.  Large bottle.  Just what I asked for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what thus stuff is, but it is definitely NOT pure tea tree oil. I usually order this from the manufactures website and this is not what I usually get. It does not work well.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using tea tree oil. I was in desperate need of a product to maintain my acne. I&#x27;ve used countless products and spent loads of money on special gadgets to improve my skin. I began researching after a bad breakout and came across many positive reviews for tea tree oil. Figuring I had nothing to lose I gave it a try and fell in love after first use. It&#x27;s an incredible toner. Interestingly, it&#x27;s an oil that strips oil away and leaves pores tight and clean. The smell can be a little strong at first, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. It is wise to dilute the oil with a moist cotton pad before applying to the face. Also be careful not to let it seep into your eyes. Frequently I experience some stinging in my eyes for a few minutes after applying. I apply before bed and when I wake up the blemish is well on its way to healing if I have popped it, which I admit to doing. Not good. Not to sound gross, but it also helps blemishes come to a head quickly, bringing that white icky stuff to the surface, but i find it to heal faster that way. Tea tree oil can be drying, so even though I have oily skin, if I apply it in the morning I follow it with jojoba oil mixed with a light oil-free moisturizer. This helps avoid flakiness under makeup. I hope it works for everyone suffering from problem skin!</li>
    <li> Skills any kind of bugs spiders hate this stuff</li>
    <li> I was so happy to finally find a bottle of 100% pure Tea Tree Oil in something bigger than a 1 oz. bottle.  I love the Desert Essence brand and often have to buy a couple of bottles at a time, as I use it so much.  Currently, I use it in my homemade hair and face products.  I will be looking for it in an even larger bottle, next.</li>
    <li> This oil is real good and works so well on breakouts. One little drop is enough for the face. This has become a must for my dresser.</li>
    <li> Works great for skin ailments. Even helps dog&#x27;s skin condition</li>
    <li> after reading numerous reviews about this product from amazon I decided to buy it from whole foods since i&#x27;m really close to it. this product is good. I&#x27;ve used it for minor cuts using a drop diluted in water in a cotton ball. I&#x27;ve also used it in a morning to clean my face mix with witch hazel. it gives my face that cool sensation and also cleans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only minor complaint about this is I wish there was a better nozzle. its hard to put a small drop of it in a cotton ball or etc. without it spilling more. sometimes it drips or slide to the side of the bottle. I feel like I wasted a little of it everytime I use it. can&#x27;t really control every drop every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and was amazing &amp; I just started go use tea tree oil again so I bought. Let me just say this stuff works!! Would highly recommend yp anybody that have breakouts here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when I Boughy my 2oz tea tree oil, I saw that there was 2 choices. The one sold my KaufmanFrangrance was cheaper (i bought this one) ,around $12 &amp; the picture was a tad blurry &amp; the other one was over 15! I thought that I might get the older one that has a different label, but I got a brand new tea tree oil with the newer label! So if you&#x27;re skeptical about that theres 2 choices for the 2oz bottle choose the cheaper one, its the exact same thing</li>
    <li> If I am to understand every source I&#x27;ve seen, this oil should be protected from light. I dislike that it&#x27;s packaged in a clear bottle for that reason. I also dislike the fact that it lacks any sort of dropper top. The oil itself seems very pure, works as expected (and yes, it has a strong odor that some people find unpleasant, but that&#x27;s the nature of the product).</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected! I use a couple of drops on a wet cotton ball as a toner nightly and have seen definite improvement.</li>
    <li> I use this for my housecleaning and I love it.  I definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> A great antiseptic for quick healing of scratches and mild cuts. Great brand, good price.</li>
    <li> HUGE help in reducing my breakouts. I didn&#x27;t dilute it at all before application, but then again I don&#x27;t have super-sensitive skin. However, once I applied it too many times in one day and it burned my skin and left a scar for a few weeks. Just make sure you start with a small amount once a day and work your way up to avoid burning the skin. Tea tree oil gives your skin a slightly tingly feeling, but if it&#x27;s a painful burning then I recommend washing off immediately with soap and water or you may scar the skin. I applied either directly with my finger or with cotton pads if I was working with a larger area. I&#x27;ve read some reviews on other brands about how they thought their product was diluted and didn&#x27;t smell very strong-- this definitely was not diluted and did exactly what I expected tea tree oil to do. I will definitely stick with Desert Essence in the future.</li>
    <li> Not fond of the smell, but it is a very good product. The price is right. I bought it to put in a homemade shampoo recipe and it is great for that.</li>
    <li> Works great for bug bites</li>
    <li> I use it where I tend to develop skin rashes, in areas that get and stay moist when I get too warm. I find it very effective in keeping my skin rash free. Actually, I prefer smaller bottles, but Amazon only sold the 2-ounce size.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this as a spot on treatment for my occasional breakout on my face.  I used it a couple times, and have found out that it is a little to harsh to use on your face (it even says on the bottle).  But then I was reading some forums online and people said it works well for bug bites.  I used it for a couple bug bites on my arm, and it did a good job stopping the itch.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried tea tree oil. I ordered it to apply to mosquito bites. I have an allergic reaction to them and the bites become inflamed and they itch terribly. I will never be without tea tree oil again. It has made the reaction to mosquito bites tolerable. It helps to reduce the itching and inflammation. In just a few days they are almost gone. Prior to using tea tree oil, 5 days after a bite it would still be a giant red welt. Not anymore. I&#x27;m so glad I found out about tea tree oil and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is excellent tea tree oil. It&#x27;s potent and affective. I have ordered it several times before, and I&#x27;ll get it again when more need arises. Had no trouble with the product or seller.</li>
    <li> Just a Pure Tea Tree Oil. Smells fresh and woody. I use it to heal minor cuts and as a mosquito repellent.</li>
    <li> I actually used this product to treat a case of molluscum contagiosum on my pubic region and 2 months later I&#x27;m all clear. It worked amazingly.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I am a huge Amazon fan! I shop here quite often due to a busy daily schedule. That being said I do not often have the time to review many products. This item however, I HAD to review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around the age of 14 my skin turned on me. Overnight, as it seemed, my smooth and baby soft skin became an irritated and oily disaster.  I tried everything to soothe and heal my broken out skin. From doctors and pills to over the counter ointments and masks. Nothing ever worked. It was beyond frustrating to be a teen with skin more unpredictable and rebellious than yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now at 32, I still continue to suffer from acne (So much for my mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll grow out of it&amp;#34; theory!). It has been nearly 20 years of fighting my troubled skin with only lackluster results.  I almost gave up completely accepting my bumpy fate. That is until I was home sick one day. Bored in bed with my laptop, I stumbled onto an option that I had always dismissed in the past as a weak alternative treatment. I thought &amp;#34;how could anything natural or homeopathic possibly stand up against today&#x27;s modern medicinal treatments&amp;#34;.  But I couldn&#x27;t stop reading. The benefits of pure and organic tea tree oil seemed too good too be true. The reviews were glowing as well, and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks later, my skin is like new! It is finally evenly toned, smooth and clear. It wasn&#x27;t instantaneous and you must be diligent but it will be worth it!  Trust me.  I am so very happy that I tried this product and my only regret is that it took me twenty years to do so.</li>
    <li> love it... apply carefully.. can be stingy, burn-y. needs to be diluted. i hv diluted wi coconut oil. smells strong but good :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I got a pedicure at a fancy spa and ended up with fungus under my toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff and it was clearing it up. I switched to another brand and it started coming back.&lt;br /&gt;It works.</li>
    <li> I use this for my acne on my back instead of Benzoyl Peroxide, and it works really well at drying out my skin, without irritating it.  I have very sensitive skin and Benzoyl was always too intense.  I am not saying that it will work for everyone, because everyone is different, but it worked amazingly for me.  Try it out!</li>
    <li> This is literally ALL you need to wash your face with. Tea tree oil is all natural, a natural anti bacterial, and will clean and clear your face free of chemicals. Just hold a damp cotton pad over it, tip the oil upside down really quick to get a tiny bit on it and put it on your face but not near your eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal legit tea tree oil. I mean..dang y&#x27;all. This stuff is POWERFUL. I mean, dilute it to the max if you can. I love it even though even the slightest amount gets on my finger (I&#x27;m talking the size of pin needle head) then I can smell it so strong unless I wash it off (which it does very easily..not like gasoline haha). It really really really drys out the pimples I get. Make sure you dilute it or it will dry your skin out so much and leave a darker spot where the pimple was. Hard to explain why it does this, but for some reason it happens. So, just make sure to dilute it. But it DOES get rid of pimples FAST. It&#x27;s a great antiseptic. Like I said, this brand delivers some potent stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This totally cleared up my white toe fungus. I applied it (using a Q-tip) to all affected toes both morning and evening. It apparently works by preventing fungus to grow on ANY NEW TOENAIL GROWTH; in other words, your fungus will be completely gone in the time required for all infected nail to grow out. (Note I am not a doctor or expert on this; this is just how it appeared to work with me.) I also scrapped away as much of the fungus I could with a pocket knife, though I&#x27;m not sure this helped at all in getting rid of it. I suspect I will have to continue applying it fairly regularly to prevent the fungus from coming back.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my sons molluscum contagiosum. I dabbed them daily for a few weeks until they were gone. I just also used this oil for toenail fungus and after 1 week it cleared up. Very potent!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would smell like tea tree shampoo. Instead it smells like acetone</li>
    <li> Tea tree oil is good for so many skin conditions. I have used it for many years to treat jock itch,insect bites and bacterial skin infections. It&#x27;s a better natural alternative compared to chemical based crams,etc. It also is a great insect repellent. The only con is it does have a strong pungent smell, but I am willing to tolerate it for the benefits I get from it.</li>
    <li> **I will try to update this review after I have been using the product for a few weeks**  I just received this product in the mail not twenty minutes ago. Unfortunately, AmericaRX took about 2.5 weeks to even ship it. That was a bit annoying because I had expected to have it in no more than 2 weeks.   Anyway, I opened the package and immediately applied it to my face. I can see what people mean when they say it had a strong smell! It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad smell; it&#x27;s like a combination of herbs, menthol, and DIRT! Personally I like the smell but I can understand how some people wouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll be applying this probably 2-3 times a day. I will update my review after I have determined it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This product is powerfully effective and therefore should be used with caution.  If you don&#x27;t dilute with water, just dab some on a cotton ball and dab on the effected areas for acne or infection.  ONe dab does wonders over the course of the day.  I never put on at night because it is so powerful that it will seep into the pillows and sheets and perhaps even the strong aroma will irritate my eyes.  Great product, you just have to use it and learn what level of use is right for you.  Oh, and since you need so little, and I really do mean this, one bottle of this can last a whole year.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year now only using a few times a week when needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great and natural product for oily skin. Just make sure to dilute it in water to avoid a skin burn.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil is a life saver for me.  This is my second bottle.  I am so glad Amazon sells it.  Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> When I need Tea Tree for my face I get a higher grade. But this stuff is perfect for the other 1000 ways I&#x27;ve found to use Tea Tree. It been out on the counter all month because we use it on the dog&#x27;s hot spots several times a day!</li>
    <li> The design of the bottle is problematic. The top is too wide. I never can get one or two drop. I accidentally pour it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I add some drops to my shampoo and use it as a facial toner. Love the smell and the results, will reorder soon.</li>
    <li> Great all purpose natural oil. I use it to keep flies away during summers at the beach. I also use it to keep my feet supple and clean.</li>
    <li> It is the real thing.</li>
    <li> It has a little strong industrial smell.  I am using the product to clear cystic acne.  Conventinal medications takes weeks with all kinds of side effects.  This product will clear the cyst within 2 weeks, and no scar left behind.</li>
    <li> Great product, do not use full strength, it needs to be cut with water. I use this guide - http://www.natural-remedies-review.com/tea-tree-oil-dilution.html</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for everything, whether pure or diluted in water, and it makes the pefect disinfectant, odor neutralizer, and hand sanitizer. For those with chemical sensitivities, this is a wonderfully natural solution!</li>
    <li> Okay. Sssshhhhh ... this is one of the secret ingredients I put into a home brew after shave lotion. Just a half a teaspoon or so per 8 oz of witch hazel and other secret ingredients. Don&#x27;t tell anyone else, okay? Just get some and try it.</li>
    <li> The smells awful.....&lt;br /&gt;but it works great on pimples.&lt;br /&gt;BUT too strong.</li>
    <li> I clean with this item and it makes my home smell great. When mixed with liquor alcohol, it clears your sinus while mopping the floors. I love it. It could be a little more potent.</li>
    <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now for toe nail fungus, and one thing I must say is that it is truly working for me. I can already see the new nail growing in. I&#x27;ve done some research about different products and this one grabbed my attention. I didn&#x27;t want to do the laser treatment, it&#x27;s too expensive. So I took this route. So far so good. Definitely getting what I paid for. Just use it as directed when you get up and before you go to sleep. Thanks for reading and hope this review can help you get rid of the nasty toe nail fungus.</li>
    <li> This stuff has gotten rid of toe nail fungus that has resisted everything else. I would recommend this without reservation.</li>
    <li> love this stuff product is great to clean your face always works for me . I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Ended up in the emergency room after using this (undiluted) on a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;I only put small amounts on acne spots but woke up with a red, swollen, itchy, face full of blisters.&lt;br /&gt;But it was all fault for using it undiluted. Can&#x27;t blame the tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;Artificial second degree burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TEST IT ON YOUR ARM FIRST!</li>
    <li> Very prompt shipping.  Product is very reasonably priced and is a great product.  Just have to keep it in the cupboard because it is not in a dark bottle, but that&#x27;s where I would keep it regardless.  Very happy with this company and with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Super, natural remedy for toe nail fungus. I use it every morning after showering and donning my socks and shoes. It has a great scent to boot!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and is just what I expected it to be! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I suffer from hormonal acne at the age of 32 around my mouth, chin area. I heard about using tree-tea oil. I found it here on Amazon and after reading all the reviews I had to try it. I think it makes a difference. It&#x27;s natural and refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant, and you have to dilute it with water. I put my witch hazel astringent on a cotton round and then put the tea tree oil on that. I&#x27;ve seen improvement on my skin. My breakouts are less. I still have a pimple here but there are fewer and this combination I have been using is speeding up the recovery time. I would recommend to someone who is as frustrated as I have been with these skin issues.</li>
    <li> This was a good value for the price.  Though I read a review complaining of the smell, I found it smelled no different than other tea tree oils I have purchased from other sources.  This comes in a clear bottle, and I try to keep my oils in amber glass bottles so they won&#x27;t be exposed to light. If it is kept in a closed cabinet it should not matter.  I use this in my bath salts mixes, and in other DIY recipes for bath, body, and hair products and I have been satisfied with the product..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been treating a ringworm infection on my hand with this tea tree oil and its just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered a lot faster than I had expected so that was a huge plus.</li>
    <li> would love a dropper option</li>
    <li> Good size bottle for its price. Cheaper than at any store here in Lincoln, Nebraska. I have many uses for it, but I especially like that I add 6-7 drops to my nightly facial moisturizer , and to to my liquid foundation makeup I use. I truly believe it &amp;#34; calms&amp;#34; down the redness on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
    <li> Essential oils are a true gift for all living beings. No synthetics, only natural oils that work wonders for humans as well as animals. 100% antibacterial with amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have over 100 different essential oils and I use them for my well being all the time.</li>
    <li> really strong scent! perfect for home made organic cleaners</li>
    <li> Smells a little off, not sure why, but works.</li>
    <li> I love using pure tea tree oil.  Be warned, too much on your bare skin and it will BURN.  I like to add a tiny drop to a cotton pad moistened with witch hazel after my shower but before applying moisturizer to my face.  I usually wipe down my oily t-zone and maybe my whole face at least once per week.  This provides a nice cooling effect and the smell does not linger, (some mind the scent--I don&#x27;t.)  Since using the oil in this manner, I have not had breakouts and my skin feels clean and smooth.  You can also add a few drops to your witch hazel and create a nice toner.  I wouldn&#x27;t go over 5-20% pure tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my face wash and also use as a toned 3 times a week. Don&#x27;t break it down with anything and have not had an issue with ache since I started with this oil. Just wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help me with a congestion problem.  I received it faster than I expected and it helped with my medical issues immediately!</li>
    <li> It has a really strong smell! It will literally fill your house with a gasoline like strong smell! I didn&#x27;t like it. I tired using it for eyebrow growth and nothing happened, tried using it for acne and nothing happened either. I disliked the strong smell! It isn&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> You can always count on Desert essence products. I use this oil for so many things, I am never disappointed. You can buy with confidence.</li>
