      <li>So I thought this sounded like a great deal!  </li>
      <li>Great length and quality!</li>
      <li>lol they put them on backwards.</li>
      <li>Great value</li>
      <li>Loved them.  </li>
      <li>so they see their fair share of abuse.</li>
      <li>Came in quickly and they are perfect.</li>
      <li>Absolutely my favorite nails!</li>
      <li>The nails are a great length and fit</li>
      <li>The nails broke very easy and the glue is not strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>now I know better.</li>
      <li>Great product highly recommend.</li>
      <li>An easy mistake to make, but</li>
      <li>I like the length and the way they fit.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put on and quick.  </li>
      <li>But the wait was well worth it!</li>
      <li>The product took a week to get here, which is honestly not bad.</li>
      <li>and I wanted something I could do quickly.</li>
      <li>far i love these nails because they are my size and not too long,and i have been wearing them for 3 days with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I buy nails online often, but these are by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It feels more natural.  </li>
      <li>The quality is great, the nail glue works better than others, and you barely have to file them down.</li>
      <li>if you trim it to the right size they will not crack or chip.</li>
      <li>The vendor must have been aware of this, as there were three bottles of another brand of glue thrown in the bottom of the box.  </li>
      <li>These work great for someone like me who is rough on their hands and need something they can rely on to last and not break or pop off</li>
      <li>They are very sturdy and I have had them on for three days with no sign of loosing or coming.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s the whole reason i got this product because i wasn&#x27;t even close to running out of the nails just yet.</li>
      <li>I have done my own nails for years because I just don&#x27;t have the time or extra money to constantly go get them done.</li>
      <li>I got these because my natural nails just aren&#x27;t smooth enough or long enough to look good painted.</li>
      <li>The nails look nice, but they don&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you put enough glue on and press down on the whole nail</li>
      <li>, LOOK VERY NATURAL</li>
      <li>This product was soft and broke</li>
      <li>I bought this at rite aid for $4.99, so if you have a rite aid near you you should buy it</li>
      <li>Bought these at my local grocery store for only 5 dollars they pop off so much!</li>
      <li>However, the glue bottle was empty when I opened the first package, the same for the second.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if these were defective or what, but these nails are Very Flimsy!!  </li>
      <li>I do my own acrylics but its a long tedious process</li>

<li> do admit these are a bit thin, but if you wear gloves when your doing you work</li>
<li> Also they are very thin!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used these Nailene nails for several years.  I like the length and the way they fit.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to find them in stores anymore.  I ordered three packages.  If I was rating the nails alone I would give them 5 stars.  However, the glue bottle was empty when I opened the first package, the same for the second.  The vendor must have been aware of this, as there were three bottles of another brand of glue thrown in the bottom of the box.  The substitute glue does not work well.</li>
    <li> The glue was dried up when I got it. The nails look nice, but they don&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
    <li> I have done my own nails for years because I just don&#x27;t have the time or extra money to constantly go get them done. These work great for someone like me who is rough on their hands and need something they can rely on to last and not break or pop off</li>
    <li> The product took a week to get here, which is honestly not bad. But the wait was well worth it! I buy nails online often, but these are by far my favorite. The quality is great, the nail glue works better than others, and you barely have to file them down. They are medium, to short length. To the girls who wrote reviews about the nails being flimsy...lol they put them on backwards. Plain as day. These get 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years.  Easy to put on and quick.  You can glue them on then immediately polish them.  They are thinner than acrylics, that&#x27;s why I like them.  It feels more natural.  I get the active lengthen which is already fairly short but I shorten them a little.  I use a wheelchair and they hold up to that.  They usually last about a week before I need to redo them.  You can get them at Walmart, but not all the time.  They aren&#x27;t reliable about carrying them.  Great product highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product was not what Nailene used to make. This product was soft and broke when&lt;br /&gt;pressure was applied. The Nailene nail was harder and lasted until it was grown out and&lt;br /&gt;ready for a fill.</li>
    <li> Bought these at my local grocery store for only 5 dollars they pop off so much! Also they are very thin!</li>
    <li> Loved them.  Received next day!</li>
    <li> Came in quickly and they are perfect. Absolutely my favorite nails! I like their shape and they hold the polish well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these were defective or what, but these nails are Very Flimsy!!  I have tried other brands of artificial nails and even the ones I got at the dollar store are stronger and they usually look great for 2 weeks. So I thought this sounded like a great deal!  Well, was I ever wrong!!!  These nails have to be the thinnest I have ever purchased! They were bending as I was gluing them in place!  They tore and bent as I was putting on my necklace and earrings! EVEN hooking up my shoes!!!  I&#x27;m very disappointed in these nails. They completely bent in half while I barely leaned my fingertips on the table!  I put these on the the morning of the wedding and had to rush out and buy another brand because these were denting and ripping.  My fingers were soooo sore from prying off the glued on pieces of nails.&lt;br /&gt; I  told them they could have everything  ( minus the 8 nails I had used ) back as long as they paid return.  They didn&#x27;t even want them back!&lt;br /&gt;They finally credited my account, but not after accusing me of trying to cheat them.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this brand of artificial nails!!!  :(</li>
    <li> I got these because my natural nails just aren&#x27;t smooth enough or long enough to look good painted. I do my own acrylics but its a long tedious process and I wanted something I could do quickly. The reviewers saying they are not strong are probably putting the nail on backwards. I did this on both thumbs and did not realize it immediately. An easy mistake to make, but now I know better. They are very sturdy and I have had them on for three days with no sign of loosing or coming. I have three kids so they see their fair share of abuse. Just make sure you put enough glue on and press down on the whole nail and you should be all set!</li>
    <li> The product arrived fast but I didn´t like that the nails are very thin. The nails broke very easy and the glue is not strong.&lt;br /&gt;I don´t recommend this product if you look for long time wear.</li>
    <li> Great length and quality! I used a different glue, but all in all I will order this again!</li>
    <li> The nails are a great length and fit but unfortunately the glue is either empty or dried up so I am not able to use the  nails until I go buy glue somewhere else.</li>
    <li> ORDER THESE ALL THE TIME, PEOPLE I GET MY NAILS DONE, LOOK VERY NATURAL</li>
    <li> the glue was all dried up cant even use it and that&#x27;s the whole reason i got this product because i wasn&#x27;t even close to running out of the nails just yet.</li>
    <li> I received these nails a couple of days ago. It was delivered in the specified time. The nails itself are sturdy but it doesn&#x27;t last long on the nail. I will not be using it again. I had to glue it  3 to 4 times to my nail because they kept unsticking.. If I could find a stronger glue then I will consider using it again...</li>
    <li> Same nails that I purchase at Walmart but much larger package for almost same money. Great value</li>
    <li> I bought this at rite aid for $4.99, so if you have a rite aid near you you should buy it there.&lt;br /&gt;So far i love these nails because they are my size and not too long,and i have been wearing them for 3 days with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I do admit these are a bit thin, but if you wear gloves when your doing you work you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;And if you trim it to the right size they will not crack or chip.</li>
