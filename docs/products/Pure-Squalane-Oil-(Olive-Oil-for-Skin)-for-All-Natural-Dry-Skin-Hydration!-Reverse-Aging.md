      <li>I just thought it would be better...</li>
      <li>I love that it is plant based.</li>
      <li>I use it in making face creams - for better penetration of nutrients into skin.</li>
      <li>I never thought I would be able to where a 2 piece bathing suit again after the kiddos were born</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>My bottle came with a spray top instead of the dropper.</li>
      <li>Larks that is 6-7 times more $$$$.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>She often mixes it with makeup; makes it apply more easily and evenly.  </li>
      <li>Feels great and hydrates naturally.  </li>
      <li>and it always arrives very quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a long time and this is an incredible price.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for two years now and all the fine lines I used to have</li>
      <li>Nice lightweight feel that is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of Foundation Primer in that it leaves the skin feeling so smooth, your fingers glide over it.</li>
      <li>Hands, feet, elbows and even for a great shine on your hair if used in a tiny amount on the palms of the hands, then rubbed into the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>Light weight</li>
      <li>Really great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I am surprised this stuff isn&#x27;t more well known!</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
      <li>Apply hyaluronic acid and after I think my skin has absorbed all the moisture that I think it can from the steam treatment</li>
      <li>This one has a bit of a scent, like a slight kerosene smell - not unpleasant but not too pleasant either.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin or combination skin issues it really works and is pleasant to feel on hands when applying</li>
      <li>It soaks right into your skin and is not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>this product put just the right amount of hydration in my skin without being oily.</li>
      <li>the picture I ordered from wasn&#x27;t the one is appearing right now.</li>
      <li>oil is very good for dry facial skin</li>
      <li>Love it and very affordable, natural too!</li>
      <li>I recommend this to many people,it is an oil but not greasy, absorbs super fast,leaves face, hands, hair smooth and supple, My son swims at the Y, chlorine very drying to hair and skin,ne applies it, before swimming, skin and hair look great,not dry at all</li>
      <li>This was my first time using the oil</li>
      <li>Simple appropriate packaging and labeling.</li>
      <li>I just ordered this for the first time</li>
      <li>I suspect this one bottle will last me a year, maybe more.</li>
      <li>and it does not set on top of the skin like regular olive oil would.</li>
      <li>Liking the gentle glide of the oil! , working with nola roller system in an effort to remove keloid scarring...</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what they used on my face at the spa after having a glycolic peel.</li>
      <li>One tip to use this is to first put water based moisturizer on and then seal the skin with squalene oil.</li>
      <li>We have ordered this several times as she has never found anything she likes better.  </li>
      <li>I break out in a rash just by using baby-safe, hypoallergenic moisturizing lotions with no chemicals (ironic!).</li>
      <li>Like all oils, a dab goes a long way, but my skin seems to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; this more thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Love this product and use it nightly for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Pure squalane does not have a scent</li>
      <li>I was worried that it was oil and would make me break out, but that hasn&#x27;t happened as you don&#x27;t need a lot to get rid of those fine lines that are caused by daily living.  </li>
      <li>Should it really smell like that?</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>TI have tried Dr. Larks Squalene and this was much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product for aging gracefully and for keeping your well earned dollars in your pocket.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice if it did anything for my face or not.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it for anyone who really needs extr moisture.</li>
      <li>I love this product, and have used other brands of squalane, including Dr.</li>
      <li>It hydrates better than other oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s normal, but I didn&#x27;t use it much after smelling it.</li>
      <li>Squalene is an essential and bioactive compound secreted by healthy human skin.</li>
      <li>I used one of her bottles up and saw that my skin was beginning to snap back into shape and the wrinkles are actually gone in some areas--not sure how it works</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used pure squalane oil before (my aunt runs a natural skincare business and gave me a bottle) and I bought this when I finished that bottle.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve not had any allergic reactions to it even though I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I used the product for so long already, maybe seems to be a little bit different but good.</li>
      <li>I am 51 years old</li>
      <li>I have done so much research to find ingredients that will actually help to heal my skin and not just mask how parched it is.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the ANEW expensive face creams I have tried.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product.  Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Make skin pump and look younger. Love squalane oil, the best for aging skin</li>
    <li> I use it in making face creams - for better penetration of nutrients into skin. It does helps . Going to try it in making shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it nightly for my dry skin. Hands, feet, elbows and even for a great shine on your hair if used in a tiny amount on the palms of the hands, then rubbed into the hair shaft.</li>
    <li> Really great for dry skin. It hydrates better than other oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this as it smells like petroleum. Should it really smell like that? I didn&#x27;t like putting it on my skin for that reason. Maybe that&#x27;s normal, but I didn&#x27;t use it much after smelling it.</li>
    <li> Great product. This product is a bit pricey everywhere but this was a good deal. Fast shipping. Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I really love this and can&#x27;t believe what a good deal it is.  I have purchased other squalene and it is always four to five times the price of this.  It is a wonderful oil that absorbs into the skin..soothes and cures irritated skin and is great to put on your face after using serums and retinols.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what they used on my face at the spa after having a glycolic peel. I use it a few nights a week also.</li>
    <li> This is not greasy.  I love that it is plant based. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have patchy dry skin during the winter. I steam my face. Apply hyaluronic acid and after I think my skin has absorbed all the moisture that I think it can from the steam treatment I apply this. My skin feels like satin now. Love this stuff! My bottle came with a spray top instead of the dropper. I have to spray on my fingers and them massage it in. A dropper tip would be a lot better.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Feels great and hydrates naturally.  No oily after sensation. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this oil; the way it makes her skin feel.  She often mixes it with makeup; makes it apply more easily and evenly.  We have ordered this several times as she has never found anything she likes better.  Feels really good to me too; maybe I&#x27;ll try it!  Never an issue with the vendor and it always arrives very quickly.</li>
    <li> Love the squalane oil.  The kind that is made with olive oil.  I am in my 80&#x27;s and people tell me I look much younger.</li>
    <li> Come back from long vacation in Asia and my skin is so dry that even a twice daily moisturuzer didn&#x27;t helped. My neck was wrinkley so I applied twice daily for 2 weeks and it&#x27;d gone. I bought more to give to my sister who has psoriasis to try. Will definitely use for my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of skin &amp; isn&#x27;t greasy!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Good products, works well.</li>
    <li> After doing some research, I thought I&#x27;d try this product for the delicate skin around my eyes. I LOVE it! There&#x27;s absolutely no fragrance, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any stinging, redness, or break-outs. Like all oils, a dab goes a long way, but my skin seems to \\&quot;drink\\&quot; this more thoroughly. I suspect this one bottle will last me a year, maybe more.</li>
    <li> Squalene oil is so absorbent and great for skin. I have been using this for two years now and all the fine lines I used to have are gone! One tip to use this is to first put water based moisturizer on and then seal the skin with squalene oil. I put more at night and wake up every morning glowing!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to lighten my stretch marks and within 2.5 weeks they went from dark pink to very light.  I never thought I would be able to where a 2 piece bathing suit again after the kiddos were born but this product made it possible.  Love it!</li>
    <li> TI have tried Dr. Larks Squalene and this was much cheaper.  It feels oily at first, but after a few minuets it absorbs into the skin and has help with my dry skin / therefore, wrinkles are not as noticeable.  Just as good as the ANEW expensive face creams I have tried.  You&#x27;d have to get Laser treatment or surgery to correct wrinkles.  I&#x27;d say to follow up with a sunscreen and I plan on looking for something to fade brown spots I&#x27;ve gotten from Sun damage.  I am 51 years old</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this is really &amp;#34;squalAne&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is &amp;#34;squalEne&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Pure &amp;#34;squalAne&amp;#34; is an irritant material.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find their customer service contact to ask them.&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering if someone already asked the.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time and this is an incredible price.  A little goes a very long way.  It has definitely helped with my dry skin, even on my hands.</li>
    <li> Helps with dry skin...a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful for your skin. I use it on my face and neck, around my eyes and on my hands a couple times a day.</li>
    <li> I love it!. Makes your skin feel hydrated and supple. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> LUV this stuff.  I use in mainly on the area above my lips.  Those nasty vertical lines just go away.  It has also soften that vertical frownie line between my brows.  Of course the next day the lines are back, I just use another drop and voila...........</li>
    <li> I have roseaca and take pills from the dermatoligist. The pill dried out my normally oily skin and I fould this product put just the right amount of hydration in my skin without being oily.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to many people,it is an oil but not greasy, absorbs super fast,leaves face, hands, hair smooth and supple, My son swims at the Y, chlorine very drying to hair and skin,ne applies it, before swimming, skin and hair look great,not dry at all</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Light weight and it does not set on top of the skin like regular olive oil would.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best for stopping wrinkles. I kid you not. I began using it onthe advice of my sister--she buys a brand that cots $28 per bottle!!! I did the research and this is the same. It does the same thing as the high priced stuff whose only advantage is it smells liek lavender. I used one of her bottles up and saw that my skin was beginning to snap back into shape and the wrinkles are actually gone in some areas--not sure how it works, just aht tit does. I woudl recommend anyone over 50 to use it.</li>
    <li> I will never buy expensive beauty products with ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce let alone understand what they are again! Ever.  This is great stuff.  I was worried that it was oil and would make me break out, but that hasn&#x27;t happened as you don&#x27;t need a lot to get rid of those fine lines that are caused by daily living.  I really recommend this product for aging gracefully and for keeping your well earned dollars in your pocket.</li>
    <li> I bought this for using after Glycolic Acid chemical peels. I didn&#x27;t really notice if it did anything for my face or not. I have used it for ultra dry hands and it did help.</li>
    <li> the picture I ordered from wasn&#x27;t the one is appearing right now. The item description y a little bit different. The products its good I used the product for so long already, maybe seems to be a little bit different but good.Thanks</li>
    <li> Nice lightweight feel that is very moisturizing. The dry areas around my eyes have already cleared up after a week of using the oil.</li>
    <li> The Squalane oil is what I expected and is an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is very good for dry facial skin</li>
    <li> Liking the gentle glide of the oil! , working with nola roller system in an effort to remove keloid scarring...it has been approximately two months and I can see the changes ...taking pictures for before and after.  Using on hip replacement scare...which is huge like Frankenstein scars, Keloid on cheek and wrist fusion scarring.....not completed, but small improvements noted.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and have used other brands of squalane, including Dr.Larks that is 6-7 times more $$$$. This product is great for mosturizing, absorbs quickly into skin, and under eyes for makeup removal. i use in conjunction with hylauronic acid to plump skin and stay hydrated. Love it and very affordable, natural too!</li>
    <li> I put it under my moisturizer and it gives it a good base. I would recommend it for anyone who really needs extr moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Within a few days I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Simple appropriate packaging and labeling. Container also functions well. Products goes a long way. The price was appropriate.</li>
    <li> This product did not do for me what the advertisement said it would...so, I&#x27;m really not using it...I should have returned it.</li>
    <li> thought it would absorb better - seems to sit on the skin I mean, it&#x27;s ok, I just thought it would be better...</li>
    <li> Have no idea what is in this bottle because no ingredients are listed.  I won&#x27;t put anything on my skin without knowing what it is.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer that will actually help my extremely dry skin without breaking it out and this is definitely it! I have done so much research to find ingredients that will actually help to heal my skin and not just mask how parched it is. After about a month of my new regime, finishing with this, my skin finally looks alive again. I am surprised this stuff isn&#x27;t more well known! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> Good product. prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of Foundation Primer in that it leaves the skin feeling so smooth, your fingers glide over it.</li>
    <li> If you look up \\&quot;squalane\\&quot; in Wikipedia, the first thing it says--in italics--is \\&quot;Not to be confused with squalene.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to purchase SQUALENE which this product claims to be. The bottle, the picture of which is hard to make out, however, says SQUALANE. There in lies the rub...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SqualEne and SqualAne are not even close to the same thing. They are about as different as butter and margarine. Squalene is an essential and bioactive compound secreted by healthy human skin. It is ubiquitous throughout nature. With its six reactive double bonds, squalene is also an antioxidant with a rather short shelf-life. SqualAne is synthetically hydrogenated squalEne. As such it has a long shelf-life, but it&#x27;s NOT an antioxidant. It&#x27;s also virtually inert biologically. It&#x27;s never even been found in nature. It&#x27;s likely no more active than mineral oil, which it closely resembles--both moisturizers that block water loss from the skin. SqualEne does this too--and a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller is being deceptive. I plan to return the bottle.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this for the first time and I really like it.  It soaks right into your skin and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick. I&#x27;ve used pure squalane oil before (my aunt runs a natural skincare business and gave me a bottle) and I bought this when I finished that bottle. This one has a bit of a scent, like a slight kerosene smell - not unpleasant but not too pleasant either. Pure squalane does not have a scent so I&#x27;m not sure if this is really all that pure but so far, I&#x27;ve not had any allergic reactions to it even though I have very sensitive skin. I break out in a rash just by using baby-safe, hypoallergenic moisturizing lotions with no chemicals (ironic!). I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference in the lines on my forehead with this product, but with the bottle from my aunt, my lines were not as visible. Again, I&#x27;m not sure how pure this product is. To each, his/her own.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this oil. It was recommended to me by sister.</li>
    <li> Not sure at this point!</li>
    <li> I have been using Squalane for several years,  I use this product along with the Vitamin C serum and the Hydurlonic serum ,  I&#x27;m 75&lt;br /&gt;and have been told many times &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t look your age.</li>
    <li> I like this product. My skin usually gets really dry and flaky in the winter, but I have used this at night for about 2 months now and I can say it has made a difference in the suppleness of my skin.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using the oil and I would recommend it for anyone with dry skin or combination skin issues it really works and is pleasant to feel on hands when applying</li>
</ol>
