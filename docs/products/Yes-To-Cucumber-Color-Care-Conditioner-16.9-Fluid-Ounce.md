      <li>Smells delicious and kept my blond highlights nice and vibrant!</li>
      <li>It works well and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Kind of a bummer.</li>
      <li>(Honeysuckle Rose &amp; GPB Protein) ...</li>
      <li>The conditioner was great, I liked how my hair felt silky smooth  </li>
      <li>so I needed a conditioner that would visibly work so that I could see the difference with my own eyes.  </li>
      <li>It does smell nice though, if you like the smell of cucumbers.  </li>
      <li>The best part of it is that it is really moisturizing</li>
      <li>It smells really good and your hair feels good and smells very fresh after use.</li>

      <li>When I first opened the seal on the bottle, I wasn&#x27;t too happy: I smelled cucumbers.</li>
      <li>ing more once I run out.  &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I do not like the dispensing top, always gets clogged, always have to take the top off to be able to use  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more once I run out.  &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>fur!!I LOVE THE SHAMPOO CONDITIONER DUO</li>
      <li>Man I love organic products.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I heard rave reviews about this conditioner on line, on many forums, and wanted to try the \\&quot;Yes for Carrots\\&quot; brand.</li>
      <li>My favorite conditioners are from Yes-to-Carrots (Yes-to-Carrots &amp; Yes-to-Cucumber) and Aubrey Organics</li>
      <li>I am glad Amazon started carrying this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this does protect my hair to some degree, I lose a LOT more color than with the higher-end &#x27;poo.</li>
      <li>But, I found out that \\&quot;Yes for Cucumbers\\&quot; was supposedly more moisturizing for the 4a/4b hair I have.    </li>
      <li>just try it its cheap to!  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and cucumbers.</li>
      <li>I love yes to cucumbers Color Care Conditioner...</li>
      <li>I have heard better things about the Yes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and still pleased with results.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>This product does a great job holding my color and is very easy on my skin as I&#x27;m very sensitive to most shampoo/ conditioner ingredients.</li>
      <li>When you shower, it smells like cucumbers, which is calming for me because that&#x27;s a very clean smell.  </li>
      <li>Good product that can also be found at some Walmarts but at a higher price.</li>
      <li>I tried it after I read pretty good reviews, but in reality it did not help my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is fine, and my hair felt OK.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many fine hair products.</li>
      <li>Makes my colored hair smooth and healthy looking/feeling.</li>
      <li>I personally love the mild fragrance where most perfumes send me running from the room.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!</li>
      <li>It is environmentally friendly, is smells great and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>Let me just start off start off by saying this is a wonderful little conditioner.</li>
      <li>From the smile on my face as I looked at my hair in the mirror, to the look on my fiances&#x27; face when he saw how shiny my hair was and how healthy it</li>
      <li>It keeps the hair from fading and makes the hair soft and smell good.</li>
      <li>and I have to use a good handful of this to feel like it covers my hair as much as a nickel sized portion of salon quality conditioner, so you lose the savings right there.</li>
      <li>- Pricing is right for the amount of product ... plus the product is so very rich.    </li>
      <li>On to the conditioner: Love the smell of fresh cucumbers and not the sickly sweet, synthetic cucumber fragrance so often used in products.</li>
      <li>I think it is a pretty refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>This conditioner also gave a slight lather (very surprising).</li>
      <li>Squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>After shampooing, my hair was insanely clean.  </li>
      <li>It has a clean, fresh scent and it is sulfate and paraben free.  </li>
      <li>Ninety eight degrees, with a humidity reading of seventy percent, and my hair is smooth and calm under the pressure.  </li>
      <li>I have to take the whole top off just to get the conditioner out.</li>
      <li>The only good thing I have to say about it is that it does not strip my hair color.  </li>
      <li>recently they&#x27;ve changed the bottle design, which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I am eager to try more products from yesto, and the price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>The scent transformed into a sweet floral aroma as I began rinsing this underwater.</li>
      <li>The cucumber smell is strong at first but quickly fades after rinsing and doesn&#x27;t linger on your hair.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very light and fresh, not like cucumbers or any particular fruit or vegetable - just fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this conditioner for healthy, shiny hair.</li>
      <li>I have been on a hunt for more natural and environmentally friendly products</li>
      <li>To Cucumber Shampoo is my new favorite hair care product.  </li>
      <li>Not only do you get a whole lot of it for a good price, but it is a more natural alternative to the supermarket and salon brands.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price</li>
      <li>So, upon leaving the shower, I combed my freshly conditioned hair and dealt with one knot, instead of fifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>To Carrots conditioner, so that might be worth a try.</li>
      <li>I have curly long hair and use mostly organic products free of silicone...</li>
      <li>I had high hopes because her hair looks fabulous, but this conditioner isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
      <li>While I haven&#x27;t compared ingredients, I am sure those are very different.</li>
      <li>Those are the only redeeming qualities to this stuff.</li>
      <li>I had to double check the bottle to make sure I hadn&#x27;t bought shampoo.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve purchased a product that does exactly what you want it to do, and then some.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But, I tried not letting first impressions dissuade me.    </li>
      <li>i finally found an affordable, moisturizing, gentle, softening, shampoo and conditioner i can depend on!!!!</li>
      <li>i understand it&#x27;s cucumber based, but i m not sure i want my hair smelling like cucumber... and doesnt provide much conditioning - and i have fine, soft and nice hair to begin with...</li>
      <li>And one look at the ingredients, made this feel like a spa-quality conditioner as a reasonable price.     </li>
      <li>and I have very lengthy hair.</li>
      <li>: I like to use when I want really straight hair, my hair is wavy  </li>
      <li>The smell is undesirable and after using it twice my hair had so much itchy buildup</li>
      <li>Which is all a girl can really ask for, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have straight, color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>amazing how conditioning the shampoo and conditioner are, i can run my fingers right threw and the smell last long after i&#x27;ve taken the show!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> *This is almost identical to the review I left for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this shampoo/conditioner [[ASIN:B0059GQYGY Yes To Cucumber Color Care Shampoo, 16.9 Fluid Ounce]] four months ago when I began coloring my hair. I also use another high-end product on special occasions because it&#x27;s too spendy for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Yes To Cucumbers after reading the reviews with the hope that I had found a reasonably-priced product that would protect my color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this does protect my hair to some degree, I lose a LOT more color than with the higher-end &#x27;poo. I&#x27;ve tested this over the course of several treatments and washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I noticed that I was losing a lot more hair than usual. At first I told myself that it was seasonal, but four months later there is no way it&#x27;s coincidental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine, and my hair felt OK. Those are the only redeeming qualities to this stuff. I use other Yes To products and thought I had found another gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am throwing away what&#x27;s left in the bottle and will never touch this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Love Yes-to-Cucumber conditioner!  Why?    - Pampers the hair and scalp!  - It keeps it&#x27;s word!  It actually does condition and nourish the hair.  Unlike most other conditioners that claim that they are nourishing ... yet they just make the hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; better by using unhealthy ingredients.  - Wonderful mourishing, moisturizing and detangling properties  - Rich ... a little goes a lonnnnng way  - Ingredients are actually readable, recognizable and REAL ... not full of ingredients that make me want to revisit chemistry class!  If you visit the yesttocarrots site, you will find that the produce is actually grown on organic farms in Israel.  - Packaging is high quality.  I have repurposed the bottles for other things.  - Pricing is right for the amount of product ... plus the product is so very rich.    My favorite conditioners are from Yes-to-Carrots (Yes-to-Carrots &amp; Yes-to-Cucumber) and Aubrey Organics (Honeysuckle Rose &amp; GPB Protein) ... I alternate between these conditioners.</li>
    <li> Product is great but the top/dispenser was unusable. No response from vendor. Will not order this product from Amazon again</li>
    <li> * Yes to Cucumbers Shampoo and Conditioner: I like to use when I want really straight hair, my hair is wavy  * Thought after a certain period of time, the shampoo seemed to go flat almost like soda does, not sure why?  * I do not like the dispensing top, always gets clogged, always have to take the top off to be able to use  * The conditioner was great, I liked how my hair felt silky smooth  * Recommend the Yes to Tomatoes Shampoo and Conditioner when you want to re-balance and add volume or body to your hair  * A good buy for the price!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this stuff, and it does wonders for her hair. She has used many brands in the past, but this one not only makes her hair soft, it does so at a reasonable cost. I am glad Amazon started carrying this stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this with the shampoo.  The only good thing I have to say about it is that it does not strip my hair color.  The smell is undesirable and after using it twice my hair had so much itchy buildup I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out.</li>
    <li> The best part of it is that it is really moisturizing and it really makes my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of the Carrots products, so I thought I would try the Cucumber even though I don&#x27;t even color my hair. When I first opened it, I did not get an offensive wiff of cucumbers, as other reviews have entailed. I think it is a pretty refreshing scent. The only problem is that I can&#x27;t get it to come out of the cap, but it&#x27;s no problem to screw it off, and it may even be easier than squeezing such a big bottle. Not only do you get a whole lot of it for a good price, but it is a more natural alternative to the supermarket and salon brands.</li>
    <li> Two star container. If you have any problems with your thumbs or weakness in your hands, you may have trouble squeezing the bottle. It takes both hands and a considerable amount of effort to get any product out. The shampoo is easier because it is thinner. I transferred the conditioner to a pump bottle and have had much better results with a lot less effort. On to the conditioner: Love the smell of fresh cucumbers and not the sickly sweet, synthetic cucumber fragrance so often used in products. It is thin for a conditioner and light. It leaves no heavy residue but really helps my hair out during the dry months when my hair gets tangled easier and staticky. I highly recommend this conditioner for healthy, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious and kept my blond highlights nice and vibrant! My hair was incredibly soft after using, and fairly smooth too - although the current summer humidity just poofs it right up. With every other day usage, this bottle last me three weeks and I have very lengthy hair. I would definitely buy again if I could find it in a store here.</li>
    <li> Cons-  Even though I gave it five stars, there is one con.  I would have preferred a different size bottle.  I&#x27;m petite, so things like this are hard to grip for me.  But I managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-  To start, I am not a person who showers every day, or every other day.  I feel that that is a waste of water, and it severely dries my skin on my body, and the skin of my scalp.  So, three days ago was the first time I used this conditioner, and obviously the shampoo before it.  There&#x27;s a reason why you don&#x27;t mix and match products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You&#x27;ve purchased a product that does exactly what you want it to do, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Not only does it condition the hair, but you&#x27;re putting vitamins and minerals onto a place where you don&#x27;t normally put those things.&lt;br /&gt;3.  It shines, and when I say it shines, I mean my head was beaming.  From the smile on my face as I looked at my hair in the mirror, to the look on my fiances&#x27; face when he saw how shiny my hair was and how healthy it looked.&lt;br /&gt;4.  When you shower, it smells like cucumbers, which is calming for me because that&#x27;s a very clean smell.  But, when your hair dries, it ceases the vegetable smell and instead leaves a faint, very subtle, floral.  Which is appealing.&lt;br /&gt;5.  My hair is thick, which means frizz and that almost always equals out to losing the battle with humidity.  Ninety eight degrees, with a humidity reading of seventy percent, and my hair is smooth and calm under the pressure.  Which is all a girl can really ask for, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back of the conditioner bottle suggests combing your hair while it&#x27;s still wet, and there&#x27;s a reason for that.  After shampooing, my hair was insanely clean.  Squeaky clean.  That can lead to problems, like tangles and knots, which are unpleasant.  So, upon leaving the shower, I combed my freshly conditioned hair and dealt with one knot, instead of fifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I believe, inspite of the bottle width, this is by far the greatest shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I will be purchasing more once I run out.  &#x3D;]ing more once I run out.  &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I am not even that choosy about conditioner, but this was bad. I have straight, color-treated hair. This left it dry and brittle, and some of my hair actually fell out. I have heard better things about the Yes To Carrots conditioner, so that might be worth a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product! IT WORKS! i used to have to brush my hair befor the shower and in it and now i dont have to do either!!!!! amazing how conditioning the shampoo and conditioner are, i can run my fingers right threw and the smell last long after i&#x27;ve taken the show!!! and i&#x27;ve been told that my hair is as soft as a baby rabbits fur!!I LOVE THE SHAMPOO CONDITIONER DUO..now i dont even have the urge to look at shampoo and conditioner online! just try it its cheap to!  i finally found an affordable, moisturizing, gentle, softening, shampoo and conditioner i can depend on!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works well and smells amazing. I am eager to try more products from yesto, and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I bought this because a friend recommended it. I had high hopes because her hair looks fabulous, but this conditioner isn&#x27;t right for me. It&#x27;s a little bit cheaper than my regular Paul Mitchell conditioner, but I find myself using a lot more of it. My hair is shoulder length and I have to use a good handful of this to feel like it covers my hair as much as a nickel sized portion of salon quality conditioner, so you lose the savings right there. My hair feels great when I&#x27;m rinsing it but after that, not much difference. I will finish the bottle but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> this product did not work for me. Made my hair very stiff and hard everywhere...&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money. Don&#x27;t know why people gave this good reviews...I have curly long hair and use mostly organic products free of silicone...this stinks</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it doesnt make my hair look greasy like other hair products. I would reccomend this.</li>
    <li> smells like cucumber - i understand it&#x27;s cucumber based, but i m not sure i want my hair smelling like cucumber... and doesnt provide much conditioning - and i have fine, soft and nice hair to begin with...</li>
    <li> This conditioner along with the Yes To Cucumber Shampoo is my new favorite hair care product.  My hair went from dry and frizzy to soft and shiny after only a couple of uses.  I even stopped using additional hair products after showering because this conditioner does it all.  The cucumber smell is strong at first but quickly fades after rinsing and doesn&#x27;t linger on your hair.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s really hard to squeeze the conditioner out of the bottle and takes two hands.  Otherwise I would rate this product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Like it as it is a natural product but then it does not detangle my hair and wish it could be more hydrating and less drying</li>
    <li> I tried it after I read pretty good reviews, but in reality it did not help my hair. I had to apply tons of conditioner before it would actually seem to soften my hair. Would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other product. This is the &amp;#34;cleanest&amp;#34;, (safest ingredients), I&#x27;ve found yet. Pleasant fragrance, but not overpowering. leaves brittle, tangled hair like silk.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a clean, fresh scent and it is sulfate and paraben free.  Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Let me just start off start off by saying this is a wonderful little conditioner. I heard rave reviews about this conditioner on line, on many forums, and wanted to try the \\&quot;Yes for Carrots\\&quot; brand. But, I found out that \\&quot;Yes for Cucumbers\\&quot; was supposedly more moisturizing for the 4a/4b hair I have.    When I first opened the seal on the bottle, I wasn&#x27;t too happy: I smelled cucumbers. Yuck! For me, the scent of cucumbers a little nauseating, because I hate eating cucumbers.(Sorry cucumber lovers)! But, I tried not letting first impressions dissuade me.    This paraben-free conditioner is light green, with a medium-thick consistency. It&#x27;s not as thick as Organix or Hello Hydration, but not as thin as V05&#x27;s smoothies, or Suave Tropical Coconut Conditioner. Yes to Cucumbers&#x27; smell changed, after I began smoothing this product through my hair in the shower. The scent transformed into a sweet floral aroma as I began rinsing this underwater. This conditioner also gave a slight lather (very surprising). I had to double check the bottle to make sure I hadn&#x27;t bought shampoo. (But, yes, it was the conditioner).    The conditioner left my hair shiny, moist and soft (even without the leave-ins and sealers). And one look at the ingredients, made this feel like a spa-quality conditioner as a reasonable price.     One caveat: although it does not contain petroleum, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or parabens, it does contain Sodium Hydroxide (or lye) albeit in a small amount.     Although it does contain a minute amount of lye, I&#x27;m still very happy with the results. I will purchase this product again for my hair arsenal.

    <li> I love yes to cucumbers Color Care Conditioner... I am natural and and I&#x27;ve been rocking my TWA(teenie weenie afro) for about 1 month now.  After I did my big chop, I put a black rinse in my hair. Since the BC, my hair seems to be very brittle and it&#x27;s always been dry.  I co-wash my hair almost on a daily basis so I needed a conditioner that would visibly work so that I could see the difference with my own eyes.  With all that said, I LOVE IT!! The black in my hair seems richer and darker ;) I felt a little tingling after I massaged the conditioner in.  I actually use this as a Leave-In.. Works extremely well with natural hair.  Got it from my local Walgreen Store for $9.  Totally worth the price and the product is thick enough to last for a very long time.. PLEASE PURCHASE!!</li>
    <li> The conditioner does not come out of the bottle. I have to take the whole top off just to get the conditioner out. Kind of a bummer. This is why I give it three stars. Although, it does smell really good and works just as well as the shampoo!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this shampoo at Target but so often they were out of stock. Then the bottle was changed and was so small. So I found the same larger size on Amazon and it was cheaper !  Thank you</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner for the last few years, soft hair and fewer chemicals.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioner. It is environmentally friendly, is smells great and it leaves my hair soft. The only gripe I have is the packaging. Over time the dispenser cap fills up with product that gets trapped that can not be used and gets messy. If they fix this one small glitch I&#x27;ll be a user for life.</li>
    <li> I have searched for products that have low toxins in them because I have an auto immune disorder and this is rated by the Environmental Working Groups as a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; which is the bottom of the &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; level for toxins. I personally love the mild fragrance where most perfumes send me running from the room. It leaves my hair shinny and soft and I have long thick hair. Good product that can also be found at some Walmarts but at a higher price.</li>
    <li> Good for my hair and smells grea!  I have bought it several times.  I think for the price, it&#x27;s a winner.  I will buy other YES products</li>
    <li> My hair loves aloe, so I decided to try this since aloe is one of the ingredients.  I&#x27;ve only ever applied aloe directly to my hair, as apposed to it being an ingredient in a product.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the aloe, or something else (this conditioner has a few ingredients which are not in other conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past), but this left my hair feeling coarse and brittle at the ends.  Granted, there is no protein in this formula, so my hair was probably protein starved, but even after the addition of protein to my hair routine, this stuff still left my hair feeling yucky at the ends.  Just not enough moisture for me, I guess.  It does smell nice though, if you like the smell of cucumbers.  The product is not very thick, and the bottle opening is annoyingly small.  Overall, I will not be purchasing this product again.  I really can&#x27;t say whether this might be good for other hair types or not, but I know it&#x27;s not good for me!  It might be good for fine hair types in the 2 range, though, judging on thickness. (My hair type is 3B, doing curly girl method)</li>
    <li> Works well on my color treated hair.  I like that it is a little bit more &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; than other more chemical laden conditioners that are usually marketed for color treated hair.  Smell is pleasant too.</li>
    <li> I am very happy I discovered this line of hair care. I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I highlight. This product does a great job holding my color and is very easy on my skin as I&#x27;m very sensitive to most shampoo/ conditioner ingredients. Also, both shampoo and conditioner smell great. Very happy.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for her colored hair. It keeps the hair from fading and makes the hair soft and smell good.</li>
    <li> Gentle product, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down but deep conditions. Makes my colored hair smooth and healthy looking/feeling. Good subscribe and save pricing- I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and still pleased with results.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner along with the Yes to Cucumbers Color Care Shampoo. Just like the shampoo, it&#x27;s really gentle, and the ingredients are very natural. The Environmental Working Group - which is a great resource for finding good quality, non-toxic personal care and cleaning products - gave it a great rating. And I find that both my husband (who does not have color-treated hair) and I can use it daily. The scent is very light and fresh, not like cucumbers or any particular fruit or vegetable - just fresh and clean. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair weighed down, which is nice since my hair is very fine and thin, but it does nourish and protect it. It&#x27;s not a detangler (or else my hair is just very fragile), but overall, it gets the knots out, too.</li>
    <li> I have been on a hunt for more natural and environmentally friendly products so I gave this one a try.  Since I have seborrheic dermatitis there is no way I can get by without using Selsun Blue or a similar product as my shampoo, however I&#x27;ve been using Matrix products (Curl Life now that I have a perm, was Sleek Look before that).  While I haven&#x27;t compared ingredients, I am sure those are very different. I have very thick hair and was used to being able to use a small amount (since this was professional grade) to needing half the bottle of this one and my hair was still a tangled rats nest.  I just wish Matrix products were a little more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Man I love organic products. This does not moisturize my thick, heavier red hair. It feels like it just glosses the surface and leaves a little bit of a greasy residue on my scalp, while leaving my hair dry. I love the smell and cucumbers. The lid is a serious defect, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many fine hair products. This one felt fine the first few times, but something wasn&#x27;t right and my hair got cranky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should try again with a new, deeper conditioner and new packaging.</li>
    <li> This conditioner left my hair a mass of tangles.  It is not worth the price. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product is good but I stopped using it because this bottle design is AWFUL.  I could put it in another bottle and I will when I have to empty bottles (I bought the matching conditioner).  I saw in the store recently they&#x27;ve changed the bottle design, which is a good thing.  It smells really good and your hair feels good and smells very fresh after use.</li>
