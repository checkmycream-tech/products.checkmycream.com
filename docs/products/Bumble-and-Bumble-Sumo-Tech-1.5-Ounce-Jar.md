      <li>This is a favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t put on my contacts after touching</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s not forget, however, that \\&quot;a great hair cut and Sumo Tech are essential to get a good hair style\\&quot; as stated by Bumble &amp; Bumble on their website.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Use something more aggressive in that case.</li>
      <li>Simply put, this is the best product I have used.  </li>
      <li>Got many compliments.</li>
      <li>because I LOVE Target).  </li>
      <li>Sumo Tech is definitely one of the best hair styling products that I have used.</li>
      <li>The smell of this stuff is my favorite part about it.   </li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>It works well in shorter hair, in my opinion, it leaves longer hair looking more oily.</li>
      <li>recieved product on time, and i wil for sure order from this company again</li>
      <li>is you&#x27;re going out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than others I&#x27;ve tried, will keep using mostly for the smell.</li>
      <li>It also smells much better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sumotech for around 8 years now and this is hands-down my favorite hair styling product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this and the Crew Fiber pomade that&#x27;s much more prevalent.</li>
      <li>This stuff is OK.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>For many people, this may not be noticeable.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Great product but my local hair stylist sells this for $28.00 - and you know that already has a nice markup.  </li>
      <li>It smells fantastic and does a great job of creating a natural looking style.</li>
      <li>It is easy to overdo it--at that point, it feels sticky.  </li>
      <li>However this issue can easily be overcome.</li>
      <li>I love this product, it gives the final touch to any hairstyle and adds a great look to your hair.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t wash out as easy</li>
      <li>It washes out of your hair and off your hands easily.</li>
      <li>It keep a really strong hold.</li>
      <li>The best part is that Sumotech is water-based, so it washes right out with no extra effort.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy with shoulder-length, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>not thin, nice and pasty, not stringy/goopy-works on my flattened hair to smooth the ends/</li>
      <li>Enjoy looking like a rockstar.</li>
      <li>If you want a iron-grip hold, check out SumoWax from Bumble and Bumble, it&#x27;s another fantastic product.</li>
      <li>I have used many different hair products and although pricey this is by far the best .</li>
      <li>Works great on my short hair.</li>
      <li>Although I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as it used to, but it&#x27;s great overall.</li>
      <li>So, this wins award after award and I generally love Bumble and Bumble.</li>
      <li>It does not glide through your hair freely.</li>
      <li>This hair gunk is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This is great if you have short hair</li>
      <li>and I liked so much that I didn&#x27;t mind paying for the premium.  </li>
      <li>Furthermore Sumo Tech has a light almost tropical smell that the ladies appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>It has great styling hold that will last all day</li>
      <li>I so miss the original unscented B&amp;B styling wax.</li>
      <li>However, Sumo Tech needs to be applied when the  hair still has a good level of moisture or otherwise it&#x27;ll be pure torture particularly if you have medium length wavy hair like mine.  </li>
      <li>good for short styles,</li>
      <li>The advantage of  Sumo Tech is that it really stays in the hair and makes it have more body.  </li>
      <li>And it has this great styling power and hold without any of the set backs like greasy textures or brittle crunchy hair that plague other products, so it maintains hand run-throughability.  </li>
      <li>Even better than my nanowax I used forever -- I am a new devoted user!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Gives my hair texture.</li>
    <li> Not greasy or messy.  Also comes off very very easily.  It is small BUT you should not be using a lot on your hair, it is meant for smaller amounts.  It does not harden when applied and you can actually play with your hair throughout the day.  I found that it is easier to manipulate your hair when applied to dry hair.</li>
    <li> I get this because my wife loves the smell and I am a big smell person.  It works well but too much makes your hair look greasy.  Too much or too little will wear off by bed time, so you may need extra is you&#x27;re going out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than others I&#x27;ve tried, will keep using mostly for the smell.</li>
    <li> My stylist turned me on to this stuff about a year ago.  Sumotech keeps your hair where you want it without it being hard as a rock and crispy.  1.5 oz may seem like very little product for the price but this stuff lasts due to the tiny amount you need to apply per use.  It smells great and can be continuously manipulated all day once applied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a full tin of each, and I can say that while similar, they are NOT the same.  Specifically, American Crew Fiber is a bit stickier and can tend to dry out your hair.  For many people, this may not be noticeable.  However, for those of us whose hair is already naturally dry, that means your hair looks frizzy after you use it.  What good is a great matte hold if your hair frizzes?  And yes, I&#x27;ve tried applying it to wet hair, dry hair, towel dried hair, and everywhere in between.  For my hair, and presumably other people with naturally dry hair, Fiber will give you a great hold, but not quite the sharp look you want.    Sumotech not only smells better (duh) but it is a bit softer and will not frizz out your hair.  So far it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works, although I continue to try cheap alternatives hoping that they work as well!</li>
    <li> I have been using various styling products for years.  I have used everything from store brand gels, to beeswax, to actual molding clay.  This product is the perfect balance between clay and beeswax as it is surprisingly soft to put in your hair and it holds extremely well.  I used this product with damp hair.  Recommended by hairstylists, this product also brings out the color of my hair!  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has short to medium length hair and is looking to hold it up in a fashionable way.</li>
    <li> Much better than Sumo Wax, Sumo Tech is softer and less greasy. It holds without being stiff. Just a smidgen of this pulled through short hair gives texture and a light hold with very little weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.</li>
    <li> This has been the best hair styling product that I have used so far.  Gel, Mousse, Hair-Spray, I&#x27;ve used them.  I don&#x27;t style my hair much, but when I do, I prefer a more natural look and feel.  I hate Gel because it usually leaves my hair crispy and stuck and hard; my hair turns into porcupine!  Mousse gets nasty after time and sweat.  Hair-Spray gives me pimples.      This SumoTech is amazing.  I mean, I use less than a pea sized amount, spread it around on my hands, then style my hair.  It takes soooo little product and yet it gets the job done, even on dry hair.  I use the low shine one, so it looks very natural.      Simply put, this is the best product I have used.  Try it out!</li>
    <li> Nice to use this stuff in combination with a non-water soluble hair wax like Sumo Wax.  It also makes good filler for dented stucco.  The price point is a bit high so I use it mainly for hair.  The smell is weird, but holds like a rappers acronym.</li>
    <li> Best of the best. Works great on my short hair. Love that it&#x27;s not sticky!</li>
    <li> Due to United States regulations they have had to change the product making it far less effective.  It lasts like 2 hours and that&#x27;s all she wrote, it smells really good and it&#x27;s quite water soluble. You really have to supplement it with Grooming Cream by B&amp;B, you&#x27;re looking at $50+ for the two products.  American Crew Fiber for comparison has a lot better hold but it doesn&#x27;t wash out as easy and I can&#x27;t put on my contacts after touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend IDHair Extreme Titanium (hard to find, I buy it at Escentual) it&#x27;s $13 + 4 S&amp;H for 3.4 Oz&#x27;s the product.  A dutch site called SlikHaar really has a wealth of knowledge of video tutorials and far superior imported products.  Renati Rock Hard is the product that American company&#x27;s try to copy.  I would also take a look at Hanz De Fuko Quick Sand, HH Simonen Spiked up Clay and an easy to find one D:Fi Extreme Cream.</li>
    <li> Nice to be able to find this online</li>
    <li> I used this stuff for a couple years and loved it! my hair is baby fine and stick straight. This stuff made it fun, funky, textured and piecy,leaving no oily residue. Got many compliments. It seems B&amp;B changed the formula and added oil. It performs very differently. Goes on slick, weighs down my hair and no longer gives it the fun funky texture. What happend Bumble and Bumble? Bring back th old forumula!!</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is my favorite part about it.   I love the smell. It works well in shorter hair, in my opinion, it leaves longer hair looking more oily.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite hair product. Good scent, nice texture, and great results on hair. You will always reach for this hair product first.</li>
    <li> My son loves this stuff. Says its the best hair product.</li>
    <li> Great quality product. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave white film on it either. I normally put a little of the product on my fingertips and warm it up with a hair dryer, it warms up right away and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bumble and Bumble Sumo Tech for the past couple of years after a stylist at a salon recommended it. I have very fine hair, and this really helps give extra body without weighing my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon hearing other reviews here on Amazon, I was made aware of a similar product called American Crew Fiber. When my last tin of Sumo Tech ran out, I gave the new one a chance. Turns out, it&#x27;s just as good, cheaper, and the tin has more product (3.53 vs 1.5 oz). The only mild downside is that I&#x27;m not as fond of the smell of Fiber as much as Sumo Tech. But for 4x the value, Fiber wins.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist has been using this on me for a long time, so i finally broke down and purchased some, although i do agree with another commenter i didn&#x27;t purchase mine from Amazon as i found it $3 cheaper at the salon. At any rate, i got it home and found out my boyfriend&#x27;s been using it! I usually put mine in with damp hair and then blow dry to help set the style.</li>
    <li> Having used both SumoTech and Crew Fiber, I have concluded that SumoTech&lt;br /&gt;is by far the better product. Besides being a softer touch, SumoTech is&lt;br /&gt;water-soluble and rinses right off your hands, whereas Crew Fiber is&lt;br /&gt;wax/oil-based and really takes a lot of hand-washing to remove.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local authorized salon. It is very hard like plastic and you need to dilute it with a little warm water. It does not glide through your hair freely. Even after diluting with water, this hard wax-like substance doesn&#x27;t completely dissolve. Definitely not for long hair nor dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sumo Tech for years, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s the best sculpting product out there.  Great for creating shape and texture - it&#x27;s light enough for my fine, thin, straight hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have that greasy shine that comes with most pomades, but you can mix with a little B&amp;B Brilliantine or Styling Wax if you want a little more gloss.  A little bit of Sumo Tech goes a long way - just put a little water on your hand if it dries out while styling instead of using more.  You can also touch up your hairstyle during the day using damp fingertips.</li>
    <li> recieved product on time, and i wil for sure order from this company again</li>
    <li> This is great if you have short hair and you want that modern bed hair/rock star hair look.  Just put it on wet, shake you head, and let dry. You look like rock star. It does not take much either.  Or, blow dry to volume sizes.  It keep a really strong hold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sumotech for around 8 years now and this is hands-down my favorite hair styling product. I naturally have straight fine hair and this product does wonders. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy residue on your hair like some products (even after you wash it). I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this product and tend to buy multiple jars of this so I don&#x27;t run out. It has a pleasant/clean smell that isn&#x27;t over powering. A definite must-have for you guys.</li>
    <li> When you receive the jar it is a little deceiving on what you are getting. It is tiny!! BUT you only need a tiny amount of product and if you buy the TONIC as well you do not need to reapply sumotech until after your next shower. Its awesome!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and is a nice hair gel.</li>
    <li> I just finished up with a discontinued Pureology Nanowax and have been searching for a new product -- got this over the weekend and it is AWESOME!!!!  I love it -- everything it says it is!  Even better than my nanowax I used forever -- I am a new devoted user!</li>
    <li> Just so you know, if you are sensitive to fragrances, this is not fragrance-free.  I had to look at the actual label to see that fragrance is an ingredient.</li>
    <li> Oh, perhaps you&#x27;ve spent the $[...] on that supermarket crap thinking, \\&quot;Oh it&#x27;s the same but I&#x27;ll save the rest of that money to put towards a case of Schlitz.  Well I&#x27;m here to tell you that you&#x27;re making the wrong move.  I&#x27;ve searched high and low for something that had the right hold/feel yet didn&#x27;t attract every wasp within a 100 mi radius and this is it.  You *do* get what you pay for.  Don&#x27;t skimp on your hair.  Sit up straight and stop mumbling!</li>
    <li> After years of searching for \\&quot;the\\&quot; hair product that left me completely satisfied, I finely found it.  I first encountered this stuff when I borrowed it from my roommate to try it out, and I was immediately impressed.  I&#x27;m a guy with shoulder-length, fine hair.  This stuff has a matte finish which makes my hair look clean, dry and natural, but it also has a firm, pliable hold that keeps my hair together outdoors yet allows it move naturally.  In addition, the fragrance is excellent (it smells like cinnamon and cardamom to me), and it has gotten me some compliments.  It might be a little expensive for some, but I think it&#x27;s a bargain at twice the price.</li>
    <li> I used Sumo Tech a lot before...and I liked so much that I didn&#x27;t mind paying for the premium.  However, over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve witnessed the quality of this product go down the toilet.  It maybe a coincidence, I think it started when B&amp;B products started appearing in stores like Target (nothing against Target, though...because I LOVE Target).  I&#x27;ve bought from three different sources: one from B&amp;B online store, one from a B&amp;B salon, and one through here...and after that i stopped buying the product: it clumps like there&#x27;s no tomorrow and it has become very hard to apply on my hair without leaving residue on it; forget about applying it on dry hair.    It&#x27;s a shame, because the brand I&#x27;m using now (Aveda Pure Performance Grooming Clay)--while it&#x27;s good in its own right--is nowhere near as good as Sumo Tech ever was.  I hope the decline in quality of B&amp;B products doesn&#x27;t happen to the rest of their product line.</li>
    <li> I am a 29-year-old man with thick, wavy blonde hair and I&#x27;ve always had difficulty finding a product that could provide hold and texture for my hair without darkening the color or making it look greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of products over the years, with my mainstay being American Crew Fiber.  At my last haircut, the stylist suggested Sumotech, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  I use only a dime-sized amount (slightly less than the amount I use of Fiber) and work it through towel-dried hair.  Sumotech provides a stronger hold than Fiber with no shine or darkening whatsoever.  My hair remains soft to the touch, with no stickiness or greasiness at all.  The best part is that Sumotech is water-based, so it washes right out with no extra effort.  The only other matte product with similar hold I&#x27;ve used is American Crew Molding Clay, but that product is petroleum-based and takes vigorous shampooing to get out each day.  The only negative of this product is the price.  It&#x27;s between $20-30 for 1.5 oz, which makes it the most expensive hair pomade I&#x27;ve seen.  I don&#x27;t use very much each day, so I can imagine that one jar will last from 3-6 months, but one can say the same for American Crew and similar products.  It&#x27;s up to you as to whether the price is worth it.  I think it is so far, but I will have to use this product for a few months to see how long a jar lasts before I can know for sure.</li>
    <li> I used to get this at a local hair salon because the stuff really works well.  I was pleased to find out that not only did Amazon have it, but that I could save the trip to the hair place AND save a few bucks at the same time.  What an incredible find.  Amazon is great as always, and to find products of this quality and save a trip to the salon when I run out is priceless.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s hardly scented, my husband and I can both use it.  You barely need any of the product at all, just a bit on the tip of your finger, then warm it up between your hands for about 10 seconds until it goes clear and apply it.  It will hold perfectly all day on its own.  If you&#x27;re in a rush the next morning or want to readjust a piece later that day just wet your fingers and go to work, when it dries again it&#x27;ll hold the shape.</li>
    <li> Sumo Tech is a good product that adds fiber to hair and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  Other fibers like American Crew are very difficult to apply even though I may agree with some of the reviews, that the results are very similar.  The advantage of  Sumo Tech is that it really stays in the hair and makes it have more body.  However, Sumo Tech needs to be applied when the  hair still has a good level of moisture or otherwise it&#x27;ll be pure torture particularly if you have medium length wavy hair like mine.  I don&#x27;t think that applying Sumo Tech on dry hair is a wise thing to do since you will be creating a lot of traction causing you hair to break.  You&#x27;ll end up with a lot of strands in your hands afterwards!  The price is high besides the added cost of layering  suggested by Bumble &amp; Bumble.  This product along with Prep or Tonic Lotions adds to be 50 dollars.  Sumo Tech smell is very pleasant and it is indeed a good quality product overall.  Let&#x27;s not forget, however, that \\&quot;a great hair cut and Sumo Tech are essential to get a good hair style\\&quot; as stated by Bumble &amp; Bumble on their website.  The difficult part sometimes is, at least in my case, where to get a \\&quot;great hair cut\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t cost less than 125.00 like it does in my area (Boston)? I found that great hair cuts are really difficult to obtain sometimes regardless of cost. My suggestion is to long on [...] and have a look at what hair dressers do to cut hair well and then interview your hairstylist to know what she/he will do on you head.  Even the occipital bone has to be considered to get proportion and symmetrical cuts.  But does everyone pay attention to that in detail as they should?</li>
    <li> Great product but my local hair stylist sells this for $28.00 - and you know that already has a nice markup.  $33 price is high for this 1.5 ounce when they make it for around $8 with packaging/labor etc.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for me. Sorta works initially but I found my hairstyle starting to sit flat after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a decade.  The jar I got from the seller was old and dry.  (Plus different packaging: a plastic lid instead of the metal one I&#x27;m accustomed to)  I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several similar products and this one is my favorite (crew fiber, bed head, woodys). It&#x27;s expensive, but it works well. Holds my frizzy hair in place without leaving it sticky or stiff. I use it with the bumble and bumble grooming cream.</li>
    <li> PROS: great look. I didn&#x27;t want any shine (check!) and I wanted it to be touchable (check!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: wilts. This is great for indoors and casual, but if you&#x27;re sweating or outside and it&#x27;s windy, it will fall apart. Use something more aggressive in that case.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> So, this wins award after award and I generally love Bumble and Bumble. While I do LIKE this product for my short, textured hair, I don&#x27;t think the stuff works nearly as well as the Jonathon Dirt product. This one didn&#x27;t have quite enough hold but does smell nice and I like the brand/packaging.</li>
    <li> I like that I can use this product on my fly aways and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. It actually gives it some texture, allowing my hair to keep its volume.</li>
    <li> It says odorless, It has a very slight scent to it though - and I love that smell!  It&#x27;s hard to describe it, but again it is slight.  as far as the texture, it is second to none. and it holds great throughout the day.  Takes very little, for my 1.5inch hair, this should last me about 2-3 months.  Enjoy looking like a rockstar.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it gives the final touch to any hairstyle and adds a great look to your hair.</li>
    <li> This hair creme is perfect.  I know it is more than the others, but it lasts longer and you can use less.  It also smells much better.  You can by the bedhead product which is cheaper and easier to apply, but it smells funny, turns into white flakes by the end of the day and require 2x as much.  No thank you.</li>
    <li> This hair gunk is fantastic.  Sure there are similar products out there (American Crew Fiber), but this one beats out anything else in the smells department.  My only complaint would be that the hold is not that strong; this product is more for texture and awesome.  If you want a iron-grip hold, check out SumoWax from Bumble and Bumble, it&#x27;s another fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It keeps your hair really set, but not firm and hard.  It smells fantastic and does a great job of creating a natural looking style.</li>
    <li> I have used many different hair products and although pricey this is by far the best . It seems to make my hair look thicker ( espescially when blow-dried ) and any style is much easier to achieve .</li>
    <li> Oh my GAWD this stuff STINKS. I can&#x27;t believe any guy would want to smell like this, let alone any women. The fake fragrance is overpowering. Even my husband, who has a terrible sense of smell, could smell it and thought it was awful. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s gotten so many good reviews. I put a tiny dab on my hair and the texture was &#x27;ok&#x27; so will give it two stars, but even that tiny dab packed a strong scent that I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash out. I so miss the original unscented B&amp;B styling wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble Sumo Tech since 2006, and it is heads and shoulders better than any other styling product I have found out there.  Actually I also had several roommates over the years that once I started using it, they dipped into my stash and were instant converts as well.  It has great styling hold that will last all day no problem and through nap time too if you fall asleep.  And it has this great styling power and hold without any of the set backs like greasy textures or brittle crunchy hair that plague other products, so it maintains hand run-throughability.  Furthermore Sumo Tech has a light almost tropical smell that the ladies appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned a change in the formula over the years affecting the quality of the product, but I have not noticed anything of the sort.  Sumo Tech is temperature sensitive though.  If left in the heat it may become runny and lose a little holding strength.  If left in the cold then it can become slightly unmanageable.  However this issue can easily be overcome.</li>
    <li> I totally put this stuff in my hair and then my hair all stays up just like you would expect</li>
    <li> Love it. Gives you the hold you need without making your hair crispy or oily. One jar lasts me about 6 months, so well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have tried and tried to like this product.  My hairdresser swears by it!  It does give a &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look but by the end of the day, it really flattens my hair down.  Because it is matte--I think it dulls my hair.  It is easy to overdo it--at that point, it feels sticky.  A good thing--a jar lasts a long long time!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Have used it for years.  I have short hair and use it for style and shape, smells good works great on my fine hair with out making it too heavy!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but the same as Modern Organic Products Molding Cream and American Crew Fiber, which are A LOT cheaper.  Check out the ingredients to compare.</li>
    <li> This stuff is OK.  It smells great and keeps a good hold.  Similar options exist for less money, though, like American Crew.</li>
    <li> This is the only wax I&#x27;ll use.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking dirty.  Controls hair and has great separation.  Love this stuff.  Hard to find locally so go it here...</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use in my hair...I&#x27;ve got thick, straight hair that will go straight down when long, or straight out when short..this product allows me to shape it however I want it...I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, bodiless hair.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to give shape and texture to my hair.  Without it I have a flat, bowl cut. With it I have a chic, contemporary style.  Of course I use it!</li>
    <li> Its what he keeps using....good for short styles, not thin, nice and pasty, not stringy/goopy-works on my flattened hair to smooth the ends/enhance the flat style-it only takes a very little!</li>
    <li> Product is great. Pricey for the size, but that&#x27;s the brand. Smells amazing and holds short styles well. A little goes a long way. Shipping took a week longer than expected, but it was during the holidays when there were apparently many delays. Seller responded promptly in response to questions about the delay.</li>
    <li> Bumble and bumble has great products, but this particular hair product leaves a white residue, the regular sumo wax is better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this and the Crew Fiber pomade that&#x27;s much more prevalent. I prefer the Sumotech because it&#x27;s matte and not as rigid as the Crew so your hair looks more natural. The Crew looks shiny and holds much more firmly, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for it may be a better option for you. Sumotech holds all day just fine for me (and even into a second day). I use a very small amount and the jar lasts maybe 4-6 months. It washes out of your hair and off your hands easily. Smells nice and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s best to apply after you&#x27;ve thoroughly towel dried and then let your hair air dry for 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4-5 years now, and it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Although I feel like it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as it used to, but it&#x27;s great overall. Also the smell is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holding spray + sumo-tech is a good combo for keeping it held longer.</li>
    <li> My hair never moves and remains silky soft all day long. Other hair products make me sweat and totally throw off my game with the ladies. This stuff here smells fabulous and the 1.5 oz will last me 3-4 months easy... And I use it daily.</li>
    <li> So I saw many reviews on here, some people liking it and some people saying that they didnt and that the product actually changed.  I have used this for many years, and actually was ready to give up on this product and agreed with the people that said the product has changed as it is far more clumpy and waxy than it had been in the past.  But before I gave up on it, I actually when to the Bumble and Bumble site and ordered it from there.  Mind you, it was cheaper than buying it off amazon, delivery took a bit longer though.  However, when I got it, I must say it worked like I remember it did.  No longer was it clumpy or left my hair having the wet look, instead, it spread smoothly in my hand and gave me kind of the messy but controlled non-wet look I was wanting.  I have a feeling that the seller from amazon did not keep it in a temperature controlled environment, as the consistency it had was similar to when I keep it in a cold environment, where it hardens up.  So before people give up on it, I would say try it from the actual Bumble and Bumble store.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have very fine hair and this keeps it from fizzing up.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair shiny.  I&#x27;m not a fan of products that make your. Hair unnaturally shiny.  It works, and no one can tell your using it.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and use this every day. It keeps my hair in place without feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the hold is great, however I still cannot fathom using this everyday due to the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to use it sparingly when I am going out or for some special event and use a cheaper gel for other days.</li>
    <li> Sumo Tech is definitely one of the best hair styling products that I have used. It is very easy to apply, easier to apply than Crew Fiber but I think Fiber holds a bit stronger. It also feels softer and less stiff than Fiber but has a bit more shine to it. It smells really great. Overall I prefer this over Crew Fiber but it is kind of expensive... and it looks like it is even more expensive now then when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that I&#x27;ve used that I think is better is the Oribe Rough Luxury Molding Wax. It is the most expensive though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or so other hair gels, and this one is the best by far. It manages to style your hair while maintaining a natural look.</li>
    <li> worth the price. hair is manageable without being stiff</li>
</ol>
