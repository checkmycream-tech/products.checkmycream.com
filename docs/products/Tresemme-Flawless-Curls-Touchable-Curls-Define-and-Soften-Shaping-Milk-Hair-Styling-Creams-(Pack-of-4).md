<li> I have fine, curly hair that is difficult to style.</li>
<li> Dry hair &amp; then crimp through your hair or crimp through it when its still wet &amp; barely blow- dry it</li>
<li> This is my go to product, as I can just apply it and allow it to air dry and always enhance my curls and makes them silky.</li>
<li> Is not sticky was you let it dry.</li>
<li> Too bad I cannot find this in stores any more.</li>
<li> No fuzz &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Like any other milk/lotion/creme product, it removes some frizz, but I didn&#x27;t notice any curl enhancement.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it is so difficult to find in stores now, and was really happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, not crunchy...</li>
<li> It did not eliminate or reduce frizz, instead it weighed my hair down.</li>
<li> Touchable curls keeps the frizz down without making my hair look oily or stiff.</li>
<li> Our toddler has big, loose ringlets and it defines them, cutting the frizz down.  </li>
<li> my wife has been looking for this product for the past 5 years, now that we have found it, we wont quit using it.</li>
<li> Everything else I have tried leaves curls very stiff; whereas this product does not.</li>
<li> Had a hard time finding it</li>
<li> I have very thick, below shoulder length, curl hair.  </li>
<li> and I am afraid it may be discontinued.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Our toddler has big, loose ringlets and it defines them, cutting the frizz down.  It smells great too! Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years &amp; I love it. It can be used so many different ways for different looks. Dry hair &amp; then crimp through your hair or crimp through it when its still wet &amp; barely blow- dry it &amp; it dries with super soft curls. No fuzz &amp; a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent either so won&#x27;t overpower your shampoo or perfume.</li>
    <li> Made my curls really bouncy and it smells AMAZING.... I would recommend especially for the price its a great deal</li>
    <li> I have been using Flawless curls for a long time and then I tried different brands but now im back to using flawless curls...I havent found anything that compares to its quality.  I have wavy hair which tends to dry but when using flawless curls my hair is soft and manageable and i dont even have to use any styling products not even curling iron or blow dryer</li>
    <li> I choose 5 stars because it is a 5 star product.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says if used correctly, one cannot use too much or too little.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with naturally curly hair that gets frizzy, it makes the best curls ever without any other product!</li>
    <li> This product is the best! Leaves my curles well defined and super soft. Is not sticky was you let it dry. Too bad I cannot find this in stores any more.</li>
    <li> I have blond, wavy hair with the tendency to frizz.  This tames the frizz pretty well and it smells good.  Small bottle though, runs out quick.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair that is difficult to style. This is my go to product, as I can just apply it and allow it to air dry and always enhance my curls and makes them silky. Smells great, too. I&#x27;m disappointed that it is so difficult to find in stores now, and was really happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> soft curls!!  of course I find a product I like and they take it off the market...just my luck eh</li>
    <li> I did not really like this product for my naturally spiraled curly hair. It smelled wonderful and I also liked the creamy texture of the product, but it did not make my curls more touchable or defined. It did not eliminate or reduce frizz, instead it weighed my hair down. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Works well for 3b hair wash n go nice slip and smells great and its not heavy I will purchase again</li>
    <li> I got this stuff for my girlfriend, and while I have no idea how well it works as a hair product, it was excellent at getting me out of dog-house.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, below shoulder length, curl hair.  It will frizz if I don&#x27;t put some kind of product in it.  I had tried some $$$ Aveda leave-in styler for curly hair; it worked okay, and I read some Amazon reviews saying this product was as effective but much cheaper.  Eh.  It&#x27;s just okay, not as good as Aveda, but it is much cheaper &amp; smells nice.  Didn&#x27;t do much to control the frizz; I had to mix it with other products to control my mane.  Won&#x27;t buy again...the search for the perfect product continues!</li>

    <li> Awesome value. Had never seen this in a &amp;#34;4-Pack&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I only hope I can replenish with the same order when necessary.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, not crunchy...just wonderful and perfect for curly FINE hair. Hard to find products to fit my kind of hair.</li>
    <li> this product worked well for my curly hair, since they no longer carry it  I have also tried there curl hydration lotion and it works just as well or even better than this product. Had a hard time finding it and it comes in a bigger bottle for now I use both but feel like the hydrating creme works better.</li>
    <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t for me... This was a &amp;#34;honey-do&amp;#34; item for my &#x27;better half.&#x27; I guess she likes it though. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine naturally curly hair, and this is the ONLY curl creme that gives me consistent results!  Plus, Amazon is the only place I can find it now!  Go Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this stuff anywhere and I am afraid it may be discontinued.  It is by far my favorite product for my fine, thin, curly hair.  Nothing else holds my curl without stickiness, stiffness, or flaking the way this does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years. I have very curly hair, shoulder length. Touchable curls keeps the frizz down without making my hair look oily or stiff. My hair remains very soft to touch without the frizz.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  Everything else I have tried leaves curls very stiff; whereas this product does not. I put it in air and curls appear and are soft and touchable. Will definately order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Wish they would bring ths back. The replacement products Tresemme and many other mainstream brands offer are far inferior to this.</li>
    <li> Wow this is the best product I have ever used in my hair! I add a touch of Tresemme mousse and a few drops of this in my hair and my curls are beautiful and shiny all day long I can&#x27;t believe they are going to discontinue this product it is amazing! They always discontinue the good stuff! I buy tons of this when I find it because I think I would be lost without this product. It smells great, it  holds the curl great, my hair is shiny and soft what ever is in this product makes my hair so beautiful I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep this product Tresemme!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy-to-curly hair, and am always on a lookout for a product that will add some definition to my unruly hair. This didn&#x27;t do much. Like any other milk/lotion/creme product, it removes some frizz, but I didn&#x27;t notice any curl enhancement. Wish I didn&#x27;t have 3 more bottles left in the medicine cabinet...</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works well in conjunction with the tresemme hydration lotion. Curls are left weightless and soft.</li>
    <li> I have heard great reviews on the product and wanted to give it a try, and I love it for the price of the 4 pack you just cant beat it.</li>
