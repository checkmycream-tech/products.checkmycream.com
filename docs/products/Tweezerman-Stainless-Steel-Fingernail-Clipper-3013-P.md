      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>really easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I had one for myself and liked it so much I bought more for each member of my family.</li>
      <li>As a result, they don&#x27;t slide easily along as you are advancing the cutter along the cutline.  </li>
      <li>Strong and sturdy.</li>
      <li>The product is fine.</li>

      <li>brushed metal makes them look nice.</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the sharpness of the Tweezerman toenail clippers I recently purchased, so I was expecting these fingernail clippers to be equally as sharp.  </li>

      <li>These are cheap, bare bones, clippers.</li>
      <li>Nice clippers, very sharp.</li>
      <li>smallness makes them difficult to get leverage on.&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and sharp though and make a good clean</li>
      <li>The clippers sold in drugstores are good for one or two times, then they are too dull to clip without effort.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t Stainless Steel.</li>
      <li>What can you say about fingernail clippers--not much really.  </li>
      <li>You can tell they are very well made</li>
      <li>Keeping only because an extra clipper may come in handy, someday.</li>
      <li>I have had many other ones that do not meet, so tear the nails.</li>
      <li>These clippers clip through the nail with ease but leave them rougher than many other quality clippers do.</li>
      <li>Cutter is sharp and powerful enough to cut nails easily without much manual power.</li>
      <li>highly recommend these.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Thus, I tend to leave my clippers in that high moisture environment.</li>
      <li>Sturdy, sharp and easy to handle.</li>
      <li>I ordered these because I have several Tweezerman items that have withstood heavy daily, and they&#x27;re all of great quality.</li>
      <li>I am really surprised how high quality these clippers are!  </li>
      <li>I love the stainless steel as it has a grippy texture to it that you don&#x27;t find in the ordinary metal used in fingernail clippers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try to see if I can get them sharpened through Tweezerman, as I have never before been displeased with the quality of their other products, and the identical clippers in the set I bought were fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is very nicely made but I can&#x27;t see that it does a better job than the 79 cent ones at the grocery store check out line.  I found it a bit difficult to use for fine work -- the grocery stores ones are a bit more agile.</li>
    <li> VERY sharp.  The best  I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> The product is fine. However, the description clearly states &amp;#34;2 tweezerman....&amp;#34; Nail clippers. I only received one. I don&#x27;t really care either way, but it gives me questionable trust on Amazon&#x27;s other items and descriptions.</li>
    <li> I ordered what was in the picture. That&#x27;s not what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got looks like cheap &#x27;drug store&#x27; quality clippers.&lt;br /&gt;They may indeed be &#x27;Tweezerman quality&#x27; items, but since they were NOT what I ordered, I returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why they think they can send something other than what you ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another thing, why should I have to pay return postage? I didn&#x27;t ,make a mistake. I&#x27;m being penalized for their mistake!</li>
    <li> Nice clippers, very sharp.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these. The first one I opened came apart  (the handle from the body) when I tried to unfold it. These are cheap, bare bones, clippers. Would not buy again. Keeping only because an extra clipper may come in handy, someday. But wouldn&#x27;t recommend!!</li>
    <li> This clipper is sturdy and dependable. It&#x27;s probably the best available on the open market. The Amazon price beats all comers. Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> The quality is definitely Tweezerman. I love the stainless steel as it has a grippy texture to it that you don&#x27;t find in the ordinary metal used in fingernail clippers. They are quite sharp although I think they actually work better on dry nails versus wet which is backwards - when I cut my nails this morning, the clippers would catch on the nails. My nails are not ragged and the wet vs dry was the only difference. I do have long fingernails so it might not make a difference with shorter nails.</li>
    <li> THESE BROKE THE SECOND TIME I USES THEM. I never had s nail clipper break on be before.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and work great. Best for fingernails. I love all my Tweezerman products they last for ever and are effective!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a larger clipper. If you want a small one then this one works fine. But it&#x27;s pretty small. I didn&#x27;t try it but returned it so not sure how it works.</li>
    <li> I have trouble cutting my thumbnails with this. I&#x27;m also used to being able to use fingernail scissors on toenails. No chance with this.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality - sturdily made and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the sharpness of the Tweezerman toenail clippers I recently purchased, so I was expecting these fingernail clippers to be equally as sharp.  But they don&#x27;t cut my fingernails as well as the toenail clippers cut my toenails, so I guess they&#x27;re not as sharp, or maybe it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t have the same leverage as the toenail clippers.</li>
    <li> It does a professional job... what more can you say!</li>
    <li> The clippers cut good.  Better than most others that I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  I bought a few different ones recently and am replacing all my old ones that don&#x27;t cut well.  This one is good and sharp.</li>
    <li> Clipper gets stuck when opening it</li>
    <li> they seem to be overly &amp;#34;small.&amp;#34;  Don&#x27;t open far enough and it came apart when I went to open and use it.  I&#x27;ll go somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Love these nail clippers.  I have their tweezers and toenail clippers too!  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> money well spent.  these are so much better than the china-made junk thats all you can get here locally at walmart, target, walgreens,CVS.</li>
    <li> These clippers clip through the nail with ease but leave them rougher than many other quality clippers do. You will need a nail file after using these.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re solid tweezers that DO NOT feel cheep at all. Not much else to say about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are quality.</li>
    <li> Cutter is sharp and powerful enough to cut nails easily without much manual power. But the cutter portion is straight and not curvy to fit in our nail, which makes it difficult to cut in the edges. It leaves a flat nail which looks shapeless.</li>
    <li> Sharp.  Easy to use.  Wish it had a file.</li>
    <li> In my lifetime I&#x27;ve probaby purchased more than a few hundred (or thousand!) clippers like this Fingernail clipper from Tweezerman. None could measure up to this product. Best I ever had. Now there is not much to discuss about the complexities of clipping ones finger nails. So lets just say –– Tweezerman hits the mark, in every way. I own their tweezers (3 pair) as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for someone, thanks!</li>
    <li> Quality expected from Tweezerman</li>
    <li> Being a man...I found these clippers too small to use on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;The smallness makes them difficult to get leverage on.&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and sharp though and make a good clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;The brushed metal makes them look nice.</li>
    <li> I tend to cut my nails in the shower... the heat seems to soften them a bit making the job a bit easier. Thus, I tend to leave my clippers in that high moisture environment. Every pair I&#x27;ve owned has degraded into what looks like a old car left in a field. Not only do they fail to work after a while, they leave nasty rust stains on whatever surface they are left on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little guy, being made of stainless, so far seems immune to this fate. Haven&#x27;t had them long, but not signs of rust so far. And I&#x27;ve been happy with all the Tweezerman products I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
    <li> My nails are extremely difficult to cut. Regular little weeny finger nail clippers don&#x27;t have a chance, and big ol&#x27; toenail clippers are awkward on the fingers. Tweezermans can&#x27;t be beat. Nothing else can cut my dinosaur talons quite like them.&lt;br /&gt;I had this pair for two days before I lost them. Luckily, I found the pair I have had since 2007 a few days later! They are still going strong!</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and cut well. I haven&#x27;t had them too long, but if they are a good as their tweezers, I will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> On my fifteenth birthday, long ago and far away, I resolved to stop chewing my nails. I&#x27;ve never chewed them since. Unfortunately, too many times my nails have grown to absurd lengths, mostly because clipping them was so tiresome. The clippers sold in drugstores are good for one or two times, then they are too dull to clip without effort. I have also found them challenging to control when clipping nails on my dominant hand because they are just plain hard to hold on to. After using the toenail clippers these guys make, which work amazingly well even on my thickest nails, I thought I try these. Holy crap, I wish I had these 20 years ago! They are perfect, or closer to perfect than I have seen before. I love these - my nails will never get crazy long again!</li>
    <li> I liked this so much that I bought it for my parents and grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good in your hand and is sharp.</li>
    <li> The picture shown is of a 3013-P (professional series) clipper, but what you get is the 3085-R clipper.  It&#x27;s a totally different style</li>
    <li> Thought it was a toe nail clipper... but it was difficult to realize which size of clipper it is.&lt;br /&gt;For a finger nail clipper it is the most stout clipper I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> These are not the cheapos you will find at the drug store.  These are sharp and very well built.  I always get a very clean cut.  I am sure these will last forever.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp nail clippers, I would recommend them</li>
    <li> Best clippers ever.  But the package I ordered said it included 2 clippers.  I only receivers one.  Kept the product bc it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> These works better than a lot of tweezers I have bought. Good price, good purchase.</li>
    <li> very sharp. I missed it recently. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Cant beat a Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> Great clippers. They&#x27;re better than ones I paid twice the price for.</li>
    <li> These are quality in materials, but poor in finishing, which makes them awkward to use.  All of the edges of the cutting blade are unpolished and not chamfered, so they are sharp 90 degree corners where you hold them and also where you are sliding them between your fingernail and your fingertip.  As a result, they don&#x27;t slide easily along as you are advancing the cutter along the cutline.  This seems like such a simple thing that a company like this should have corrected before going into production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an older pair of tweezerman clippers that are a little smaller and do not have this problem.  They&#x27;re still available and I will be getting a pair of those.  They&#x27;re cheaper too.</li>
    <li> Poorly made garbage. Blades don&#x27;t line up. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s kinda slippery. It&#x27;s almost perfect. Cuts good. Strong and sturdy. Slightly slippery. Especially if you apply lotion before using. I&#x27;m not even sure how to improve the grip without driving up the price. Solid construction. Just slightly slippery. Smooth gloss finish.</li>
    <li> Too large, cutting edge is not fine.</li>
    <li> Not hard to hold therefore easy to use. Very sharp. Cuts through my nails as if they were butter ( which is saying something)</li>
    <li> However, when I contacted the seller, I was able to obtain a refund. However, upon purchasing them a second time, I do not feel that these live up to the typical tweezerman brand name - the mechanism is not smooth, and i cannot recommend them long term. Choose another model or another brand for this item.</li>
    <li> It does not work well. You have to use a lot of force to cut the nails. I gave up cutting the nails after two fingers.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these--one individually, and one as part of a manicure set.  The single clippers do not align properly and do not cut well; they pull at the nail and cuticle if I try to cut them.  I&#x27;ll try to see if I can get them sharpened through Tweezerman, as I have never before been displeased with the quality of their other products, and the identical clippers in the set I bought were fine.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a bigger fingernail clipper.  The Tweezeman that I received is about the same size as a regular fingernail clipper.</li>
    <li> Very solid, good quality.</li>
    <li> A little pricey when I bought but the nail clippers are of great construction and cut well. A side guard to catch some of the clippings would be great.</li>
    <li> What can you say about fingernail clippers--not much really.  I will say this: These are very sharp and sturdy. You can tell they are very well made and they never seem to get dull. Definitely worth the 8 or 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for quality clippers for a long time.  My nails are in bad shape and are hard to trim.  These clippers work the best.  I bought 2 pair and may end up buying more.</li>
    <li> They came sharp and ready to work. I travel with them so I slipped a bit of reflective International Orange paracord through the hole at the end of the clippers to help me easier locate them in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far they work well and haven&#x27;t begun to show any signs of rust. Only time will tell if they do rust, but I feel these will not.</li>
    <li> This is a pro quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Cuts nails well, I usually struggle with fingernail clippers but these cut great.</li>
    <li> First Tweezerman Nail Clipper.  Seems sturdy.  Good feel and grips well in hand.  IMO, the &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34;  TRIM Brand of Finger Nail clippers have a sharper smoother cut though plus TRIM Clippers have a built in Nail File to remove rough edges and debris from under nails and Tweezerman does&#x60;nt have one.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t Stainless Steel. It&#x27;s full of stain. Overpriced junk. Better off buying one from Food Lion or CVS or any of the sort.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper to match the 5011-P toenail clipper. It does not. This one is not the same style as pictured. Still a very good clipper compared to the cheap store brands.</li>
    <li> Clipper is OK but the edge is too straight for a curved clip.  It was advertised as providing a curved clip.</li>
    <li> It has very sharp clipping edges that actually meet perfectly.  I have had many other ones that do not meet, so tear the nails. This one works like a charm.</li>
    <li> really easy to use.  You don&#x27;t need to use much force at all if you have thick nails.</li>
    <li> High quality, sharp, straight forward clippers. Doesn&#x27;t have a file - I prefer clippers without a cheap file, anyway.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes a quality product, and these nail clippers do not disappoint. Sturdy, sharp and easy to handle. I had one for myself and liked it so much I bought more for each member of my family.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I have several Tweezerman items that have withstood heavy daily, and they&#x27;re all of great quality. I received exactly what is pictured. Note that there is no nail file as some fingernail clippers have; I didn&#x27;t need that addition, so not a disappointment. My clippers are nice and sharp. Of note, Tweezerman accepts products for lifetime sharpening. I&#x27;m working on acquiring duplicates so I can have one to use while the other is at Tweezerman for sharpening. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Tweezerman products, and if, by chance, you get a poor product, it&#x27;s a fluke that Amazon&#x27;s return policy makes simple to deal with.</li>
    <li> Costs more than your standard drugstore nail clippers, but it&#x27;s worth it, this is a quality product, well made, I would recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> I am really surprised how high quality these clippers are!  I&#x27;m so used to the cheap walmart brands that you can get for a dollar, but this is well worth the money!  I broke my previous pair of cheap clippers and I don&#x27;t see how I will ever break these.  The Tweezerman is really thick steel and has a smooth surface.  It feels great in the hand and super easy to use.  I heard some people didn&#x27;t get what was pictured but I received the product pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.  Quality over quantity for sure.</li>
    <li> Solid built and goid looking.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered tweezers made by this company and was impressed by the quality so I decided to try these.  They are very well-made and should last for a long time.  I highly recommend them!!</li>
    <li> These worked very well for several months.  Then they come apart and could not get them  back together.  I was not impressed.</li>
