<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Application of product is simple however results are poor and do not last. Upon application, you wait in product.  When time is up, teeth are extra white. However, after water hits your teeth, the white is gone</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth so it is hard to find a whitening product that both whitens and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.  This didn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all, but it also didn&#x27;t whiten then that much either.  I couldn&#x27;t use it in the tanning bed bc the air from the tanning bed fan blowing on my teeth hurt too much (that&#x27;s how sensitive they are).  I used it at home with the light provided.  Again absolutely no irritationg with the light and whitener but didn&#x27;t make a big difference in whitening.</li>
    <li> Flat out, this stuff works. After just one treatment, my boyfriend noticed that my smile was brighter...and he never notices anything, so that&#x27;s saying a lot. I have sensitive gums too, but this has not affected them negatively whatsoever. There&#x27;s no burn or sensitivity. Great product, thanks!</li>
    <li> If your a tanner or not having this product is great! My teeth are white weather I&#x27;m tanning or not! I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> It probably works.  I say that because after a couple sessions, I was pretty certain I saw a difference.  NOT a miracle product but an inventive way to utilize tanning UV rays I guess.  I won&#x27;t buy again but I don&#x27;t entirely regret trying it out.  Now I just use the entire 3d white/brilliance/luxe line from Crest and I can definitely tell that works.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I saw this product online and I figured that It was worth the try. Its not to expensive so I bought it and I used it every other day when I tanned. I didn&#x27;t notice any tooth sensitivity like they warned but the mouth guard was a little uncomfortable and I kept feeling like I had to swallow well after my first time I quickly learned that swallowing was not a good idea because it made my throat sore and feel weird. I think it was maybe cause of the peroxide in the solution but I&#x27;m not quite sure. So don&#x27;t swallow just hold it until you are done tanning. I used this product for about three weeks and I didn&#x27;t really notice that big of a change. I took pictures of my teeth before and after and maybe they lighten by a shade but it wasn&#x27;t drastic. I also could only paint the solution on the first four front teeth top and bottom because of the mouth guard and the other teeth were just left alone. So if it did work well then only so many of my teeth would have whiten while the others would have stayed the same color. Which is fine I guess if when you smile you only show that many teeth. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money spent and the time and trouble to apply it and then not drink or eat for like 30 min. You can also get tan lines around your mouth from the mouth guard at least thats what the box warned. I didn&#x27;t get any but you never know. They also said that it doesn&#x27;t work if you teeth are more of an ashen color than a yellow color. And it does not work on fake teeth and crown and all that. I don&#x27;t think that I will buy this product again but my teeth are pretty white already so maybe if your teeth are more yellow it works better or maybe I&#x27;ve just tried too many products lol.</li>
    <li> The only thing cool was the mouth piece, Whitney didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought was disappointed.</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast, Ordered Thursday &amp; received Saturday. The product is ok I guess I have used it 4 times but I haven&#x27;t really seen a big difference maybe very little whitter, At the salon where I tan at it&#x27;s priced at 25 but it comes with a small U.V light that can make you also use it at home and would of so gotten it at the salon if I knew this one didn&#x27;t came with the small U.V light. The mouth piece gets my mouth soar after keeping the piece in for 15minutes but nothing serious... If I see better results using this product I might keep buying it but if after the little liquid tube is gone and I don&#x27;t see anything impressive I&#x27;ll just stop. Worth the 18 bucks to find out... My teeth are already white so maybe that&#x27;s why but might work for othear peoples teeth</li>
    <li> I ordered this and heard a lot of great things about this product. I went tanning today and my teeth are like two shades whiter. I love twilight teeth. I will be buying more of this.</li>
    <li> As long as you follow the instructions, it really works! And it costs a lot less to order it online than it does to buy it at the Tanning Salon.</li>
    <li> Kinda hard to get used to that big plastic piece in your mouth but it really works after just one tanning session. I use the 14 min bed and I saw a great improvement that even my man noticed. Doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive either. Great overall!!</li>
    <li> Great Product! I have had wonderful resluts with the TWILIGHT TEETH U.V. Accelerated Whitening System seen resluts after the first initial use.</li>
    <li> My first review...... After seeing this product a year ago I was in my tanning salon today and they had it for $14 so I decided it was time to give it a try. I do the home whitening and have cut coffee and tea out of my diet. I use a whitening rinse before brushing everyday. My canines have never been white even when using strips, whitening rinse, whitening toothpaste and home 5 minute bleaching kits( using for 30 minutes). After 12 minutes in an \\&quot;Instant\\&quot; bed (the highest my salon offers) I can see a noticeable difference. My canines are now the color that my front teeth were before using twilight teeth. I&#x27;m confident that my canines will match the rest of my teeth on the next visit. The mouthpiece isn&#x27;t uncomfortable but when I tan I usually smile the whole time (hoping to whiten a little) Next time I am going to try without the mouthpiece to get some of my other teeth exposure. I did not have any problems with saliva since I use a lay down bed, In fact my mouth wasn&#x27;t too dry even with the fans blowing full blast. I also normally have sensitive teeth, at least to cold and air and I have no sensitivity when using this product.  I highly recommend it, for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This product does not work. While you tan it creates an illusion of whiter teeth when in all reality your skin is getting darker, your teeth are not getting whiter. What happens when you take a yellow paper and place it next to a light tan and then compare it to a yellow paper against a dark tan? When you compare the yellow paper against a darker tan it appears more vibrant than the original. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I suggest baking soda mixed with a whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Works great!!!  I used this for my wedding.  I was tanning indoors anyhow, and this just made sense.  I could defiantly see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth from our engagement pictures to our wedding pictures.</li>
    <li> Twilight teeth is the best! I use it while tanning and I could tell the difference in my teeth after the first use. I&#x27;ve tried all of the over-the-counter teeth whitening products and this one is by far the best! I would definitely  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Overall yes I like this product but it doesnt really whiten that fast, the taste isnt bad but if your gums are sensitive it does burn. For the price this isnt a bad product but it isnt the best of the best either its more of a booster :)</li>
    <li> I could see a difference in my teeth after the first time!  I usually use it about 1-2 times a week.  The produce works exactly as it is described.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> it works pretty good surprisingly...but depending on your teeth it could make them a bit sensitive the next day. i would recommend the product and also i&#x27;m going to make a suggestion to use sensodyne toothpaste a week or 2 before you start using it and then also keep using sensodyne while your using the product it prevents the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> My teeth got a little whiter.. just wasn&#x27;t sure how long to keep it on to actually work</li>
    <li> I tried this after years of curiosity after seeing it on the shelf of my high end tanning salon. I used it for the first time today and I ALREADY see results. It has a sweet-minty taste and is easy to apply. This is NOT a perfect product because the mouthpiece doesn&#x27;t let all my teeth show (and I do NOT have a large mouth). However, the product is very effective so I am overall very pleased.</li>
    <li> I was trying this product out when I was tanning in St. Louis. I would put it on before tanning and I would be tan and Whitening my teeth at the same time. This semi-liquid product is applied with a a small brush (kinda like the brush in a white-out bottle)and you apply a even layer on your teeth it comes with a rubber to bite on to expose your teeth to the U.V. rays and thats what whitens it while you tan. After a week I saw a mayjor difference and I know for a fact if I would have kept it up for more than 2 weeks I would had Celebrity Whites!!! THIS STUFF WORKS AMAZING!!!! So amazing in fact I just had to search it up on Amazon and order it again!</li>
    <li> I had the typical yellow stained teeth before I bought this, and now they look great.  I only needed one bottle before I was back on top and smiling like a little baby.  I use this when I go into the tanning bed and it works great.  The mouthpiece may feel uncomfortable at first if you have never worn one, but I didn&#x27;t notice any long term discomfort.  If you are a frequent tanner and want to add some pearly whites to your regimen, this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. Just insert the mouthpiece and brush on the gel. One of the previous reviews I read warned about the drooling so I held a towel with me in the tanning bed. When I was lying down it didnt feel like I was drooling so when I stood up drool went everywhere! After that first time I learned just to remove the mouthpiece while I was still laying down and swallow. No big deal. I could tell a huge difference after the just first time. Ive used it for a month now several times a week and still have plenty left. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product, Great price!  I love this item, purchased at Amazon as an alternative to the almost double price at the tanning salon. I had great results immediately. I recieved many compliments and people really noticed my teeth were whiter!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works the first time. Teeth are definitely whiter and brighter after one session! Have to keep using this though to see continued results.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says, whitens your teeth!! I used it two times so far and my teeth are shades whiter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was in the tanning bed for 4 mins. I stepped out and was amazed at the results. A friend came over later in the day and commented about how my teeth were White! So I used it again today this time I was in the tanning bed for 5 mins, and it whitened my teeth even whiter than before. I will continue to use this until I run out and prob buy more. There is a warning that you should not use it more than 14 days, but I am happy with the results and will use it up to the recommend timeframe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a standup bed so I didn&#x27;t really have an issue with drooling all over the place. My lips do get a little tired almost like you are smiling for an extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little tricky to apply to the teeth I recommend getting a handheld mirror. The whitening solution is clear so a little hard to really tell how much goes on each tooth, but you get the hang of it once you do it a couple times.</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t work and it took way to long to ship</li>
    <li> Ive used this product in the tanning bed a few years ago and it worked wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rememered how well this worked and decided to try it again, except i do not go tanning anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if its the gel or the light but i saw no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I had the gel and the light on my teeth for almost 30 minutes and NO change in coloration of my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant believe i was suckered into buying this product. Please dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this in a tanning bed or booth yet, but I did try it out once with the little light they give you and couldn&#x27;t tell if there was any difference. The whitening liquid smells super minty though which is a good thing. I&#x27;ll have to use it in a booth soon though and take a before and after picture to see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this because it&#x27;s inexpensive (on amazon, 30 something in salons!) . I can honestly say that it worked and it&#x27;s now going to be a staple of my tanning routine! I love it. I had decent teeth and I saw a noticeable improvement. They aren&#x27;t like a dentists white teeth but, maybe with more usage who knows. I used it about 15 sessions and loved it. No sensitivity at all.    Buy it, slather it on and grin your way to a white smile!</li>
    <li> i bought twilight teeth last summer at my salon. i used it a few times while tanning and it caused my gums to get blisters on them. i visited my dentist shortly after and he told me that i got a sunburn on my gums. he told me that the product is not safe to use in a tanning bed, and in fact UV light does not help speed the process of teeth whitening. So all those who use this product, you can get the same results outside of the tanning bed. another thing is this products makes you salivate A LOT. i was uncontrollably drooling all over myself when using this on my teeth. it does make your teeth whiter but i, (and my dentist) would recommend that you use crest white strips to whiten your teeth because it is safer and provides the same results.</li>
    <li> When I was 11, I had braces and when they were removed later I had a lot of discoloration with my teeth and white spots.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, but every time I noticed a a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user who said to put the product in the creases of your teeth had a great tip.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I tan, my teeth get a shade lighter at least. I&#x27;m extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and recently my teeth have been looking a little tarnished, so I plan on using it while I&#x27;m tanning for the summer. Withing 2 uses i start to see a big difference in the color of my smile and for the price vs a professional whitening you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Only the tips of my teeth were white so Iwanted to whiten the rest. This stuff works in the tanning bed. Idk bout the light in the box Ihave not used it. Now Ihave pearly whites :)</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF! Great price as well!</li>
    <li> I started using this about a month ago. I bought it for $19.99 at Suntan City. I can honestly say that my teeth are at LEAST a shade or 2 whiter!! Looks great with a good tan. Only downside is that it wears off if you don&#x27;t use it alot.</li>
    <li> Wow, super impressed -- this tooth whitening system works sooooo quickly! I noticed a big difference after just one session and there is enough for roughly 15 tanning sessions... The results are much more noticeable than crest white strips and the mouth piece is easy to use and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It retails for 45 dollars at my tanning salon so it&#x27;s a steal for 15 dollars. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t create sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Got the product fast...packaging is exactly what the picture looks like...directions are exactly what the amazon says...very easy to use...I did not have slavia problems infact me mouth was dry due to being open under the bed...mouth peace did not hurt...have used three times in a row in a high bed for 15min each time...my teeth do look better not like other users say after the first time...I will order the product again since it has whitened them some and seams to a little more every time I use it</li>
    <li> Pretty cool idea, i just wish the mouth piece held your mouth open wider. It&#x27;s a pretty narrow space and if your teeth are not that narrow then you might be covering some of the top or bottom of your teeth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years after trying the disgusting white strips which only make me wanna gag everytime! This gel has a pleasant harmful taste and the results were instant for me , I use the U.V light at home for touch ups here and there and always get compliments on my white teeth :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is specified to use while tanning, I don&#x27;t tan and that almost turned me off the product.&lt;br /&gt;Guess What?  You can use it while watching TV or anything else you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;I agree mine came with a minimum of direction so it needs a picture and better directions plus make it known that u can use it in ways other than just while tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandia</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the results after just one use! I have done professional whitening in the dentist office and although it whitened my teeth, it doesn&#x27;t last long. I also have very sensitive teeth, probably due to all the whitening, and was afraid this would hurt. So far other than when the fans were hitting my teeth I had no pain. I will continue to use the product and let you know if my opinion changes.</li>
    <li> I would use whitening strips all the time and get little to no results in a long period of time. On top of that, the cost is ridiculous!!! I stumbled upon Twilight Teeth and decided to give it a shot. I just received my Twilight Teeth system yesterday. As soon as I received it, I went to the tanning salon and used a tanning bed with a face tanner for 15 minutes. It took a couple minutes or so to apply Twilight Teeth and to get the mouth piece on right so that all of my teeth were exposed, so next tanning session I will ask for a little more time to get ready before the bed starts. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect...    When I got out of the tanning bed and looked in the mirror, I was completely shocked at how bright my teeth were! They were one whole shade brighter! I would have to use strips for months to achieve that! I really liked that it&#x27;s gel based and there is no rinsing required. I&#x27;m in love with this product and will continue to use it from here on out! I highly recommend Twilight Teeth!!!    ***TIPS***  1. Ask for additional time before bed starts.  2. Make sure you apply this product to your teeth adequately for complete coverage. The set says that it&#x27;s good for 10 sessions, but I will probably only get 5-7 out of it. It&#x27;s completely worth it though!!! This product is excellent!</li>
    <li> it works well, however in the tanning bed if you have fans on you it tends to make your teeth hurt a little, just for the first 5 minutes or so ,and goes away.</li>
    <li> i bought this product along with some cypher face lotion got it in 5 das with he free super shipping i thought i was getting a great deal since the system in the salon is $36 however i did believe this was the at home system so i was a little dissapointed when i received it but however i did use it for the first time today (i tan in a silver bullet bed which is the strongest in the salon) i used for maximum time allowed in the bed and it lightened my teeth a good three shades after first use just wish i wouldve read the fine print to make sure it wasnt what i thought it was!</li>
    <li> Works well, noticeable results after first use. I haven&#x27;t noticed any tooth sensitivity with this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now.</li>
    <li> My teeth are pretty white on their own, but I must say if you don&#x27;t put a equal amount on each tooth, the white will be uneven.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months now. I have had phenomenal success. I actually have to not use it more frequently as my teeth are beginning to look \\&quot;abnormally white\\&quot;. I love it. I also bought it at Suntan City and am thrilled.</li>
    <li> I use a 20 minute bed for about 12 minutes each time. I started using Twilight Teeth 4 sessions ago and my teeth are WHITE. I noticed a difference after the first time, just like it says. At first I was a little apprehensive, thinking it was a scam and that my teeth would only look whiter because my skin was getting darker, but I was wrong. This stuff really does work. I brush my teeth before tanning and don&#x27;t eat for at least 15 minutes after tanning. There is saliva build up, but it&#x27;s easier to swallow and not as messy when you&#x27;re in a lay down bed as opposed to a stand-up. And the taste isn&#x27;t bad either. Very minty. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I&#x27;m a smoker have smoked for 10+ years... But this is the results after just 1 use and laying in the tanning bed for 15mins I was amazed by the results as you can see the results are AWESOME. It made me really excited as you can tell! Will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I came home to Oregon for my wedding reception and my sister had insanely white teeth, I asked how she got them (we used to use Crest Night Effects which is no longer sold) and she said Twilight Teeth. I decided to start tanning and to try this stuff out. I am impressed! I have used it 3 times and have noticed a huge difference. I spent 60 bucks on the new Crest Professional Effects whitening system and had to stop using it because it was hurting my teeth and gums too much. The air hurt my teeth. I didn&#x27;t see any results from it anyways! I received this product a day before expected and am impressed with the results. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Works very well and am very happy with results. Not too powerful either I recommend this product to anyone who tans and wishes to whiten their teeth all at once. However, whitening fades after about a week from brushing and eating.</li>
    <li> inferior product that does not work- use hydrogen peroxide it does the exact same thing at a cheaper cost. Misleading</li>
    <li> It sucks. Doesn&#x27;t work worth a damn. The light is broken but I used it in the tanning bed everyday for a week (15 minute tanning sessions) and i didn&#x27;t see any difference at all. Even brushed and dried my teeth before putting the stuff on and then didn&#x27;t rinse or anything after. It just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I tan every day for 8-20 minutes depending on the bed and haven&#x27;t seen any difference from using this over the past 2 weeks or so. Maybe it just takes a while, but like I said, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t worked yet. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw this in the salon for $30 and since I don&#x27;t buy any tanning products there, I purchased it from Amazon for a cool $14.50!  I agree with other reviewers, you have no idea what you&#x27;re getting in the box and I thought it was a one time use product.  I was pleasantly surprised that this can be used about 10 times.  After my very first use, I was completely amazed at the difference!  My daughter used it as well and was equally amazed.  We are tanning more often so we can whiten our teeth!  This product is great and well worth the Amazon price.  I will definitely refill!  A mirror is a must have for application and make sure your teeth are fully exposed.  Once you learn how to put the mouthpiece in, it&#x27;s a breeze.  There&#x27;s a little drooling involved especially if you use a stand up bed but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Used it twice with great results.  No drooly mess, no irritation.  Quick to use, instant results.  Previous whitening products have left my teeth throbbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dental work done so I have be careful that I&#x27;m keeping color even, I see my teeth being brighter and the color (or lack of) has evened out what I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing product for the results and the money!</li>
    <li> This product is PERFECT. I use Twilight Teeth at home (with the UV mouthpiece) or in the tanning bed. It is so convenient to use and people are always asking me how I get my teeth so white and I tell this about this product!</li>
    <li> I was told at a tanning salon once that a dentist came in, saw this product, and said, \\&quot;Wow, we charge so much for this to be done. This is a steal.\\&quot; So it&#x27;s just like the whitening they do at dentist offices but way cheaper. And it really whitens your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it after I shower and have brushed my teeth for about 15 min.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Used this to whiten my teeth while tanning this passed summer. It works great and causes very little sensitivity to teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon in high school and was one of the first girls to try this product, i&#x27;ve always been complimented on my teeth but after the first time i was very impressed!! after only a week i had girls i never saw before coming up to me at school asking about my teeth! I used to tan mon-fri and used it everyday..no sensitivity, no bad taste, and pretty cheap!! and PERFECT for anyone looking to whiten fast ie: for  Prom, a wedding, or just because!! And your teeth with be absolutely stunning in pictures!! :) so slap some on and whiten.. i mean brighten your day ;)</li>
    <li> Very cool product works almost instantly</li>
    <li> I own a tanning salon and sell huge amounts of this product. It works very well for the price point and doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth sensitive like a lot of teeth whiteners. The only con is that you have to hold your mouth open while tanning and not fall asleep!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this product quite often while tanning and it works GREAT! i love it.</li>
    <li> This product works even better than the youtube reviews say it will! Beats the pants of of my sonic tooth brush, crest white strips and all other whitening products. I purchased this kit for use in a tanning bed and was pleasantly surprised it came with the UV light. This product is a lot more gentle on my teeth that white strips and isn&#x27;t cause sensitivity.</li>
    <li> It does not work! The batteries it came with were no good! Disappointed when I got the package delivered. Going to buy new batteries and see how well it does if it even turns on.</li>
    <li> Love this product and works really great and easy to use and has made a noticable difference to my teeth, they are whiter and brighter after a few applications!</li>
    <li> If you want white teeth in about a week I would highly recommend this product I already see results and I kill two birds with one stone using it in the tanning bed!! Love it</li>
    <li> I love this product it is perfect. It works Great!!!! You can use it with or without the tanning bed and it works great!</li>
    <li> The at home whitening part wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Complete rip off. It works fine in the bed but I paid more so I could use the at home part. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product works if you&#x27;re patient enough to wait a few weeks for white teeth.  Of course that depends on how frequently you go tanning.  I typically go once a week, so while I could see a difference, I didn&#x27;t get bright white teeth like I do with whitening strips in a week.  This product DOES whiten your teeth, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me because I don&#x27;t go tanning often enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ordering my second batch of this, and it does really whiten your teeth while tanning! I&#x27;m not sure the whitening lasts as long as other types of whitening, but it&#x27;s easy while you tan. I&#x27;ve used the home UV light a couple of times and didn&#x27;t see much result. I think the heat of the tanning lights is a big factor in the whitening process. It do agree that the mouthpiece is way too narrow. I often just take it out and &amp;#34;smile big&#x27; while I tan!</li>
    <li> I saw an imediate difference after one use. and after about a week of using my teeth are so much whiter. I only used it twice in the tanning bed .. and then I stoped going so I did it manually, and it still works just as well, I just leave the light on for 30 - 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! You use it for about 15 minutes and I truly saw results after just a few uses. I normally experience extreme tooth sensitivity when using whitening products such as crest strips, however I had no sensitivity problems with this whatsoever. It looks goofy when you use it, but its so worth it!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I also hated the way the mouth guard fit. I got this one since it was cheap and it backfired. With stuff like this you get what you pay for. I paid very little for this and got very little out of it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this in the tanning bed yet, so can&#x27;t give a 5 star rating, but happy with the results I&#x27;ve gotten with the included light.</li>
    <li> Really does work! For starters, I have used the whitestrips faithfully, like instructed. But they never whitened my teeth like this product did. Will keep buying!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product is all that good because I couldn&#x27;t use it very long as I couldn&#x27;t stand how I couldn&#x27;t stop drooling. Its a shame because I think it would work if I could stand it.</li>
    <li> This product not work for me at home or in the tanning salon.  I would not recommend this for whitening.</li>
    <li> so white, so beautiful. You could really tell the difference after just one use! Plus, you use it while you get a great tan. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if this product works or not because I could never get the cheap UV light to work for more than 2-3 seconds at a time. My hand hurt so bad from holding the button down as hard as I can that I gave up after a few seconds of the light just flashing on and off. They really need to invest in a light with an on/off switch. Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This tastes good, and it works after only the first use! I can tell an immediate difference every time I use this. I&#x27;ve used this about 4 times now, and a few days ago my husband (who didn&#x27;t even know I was using this system) looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Wow! Your teeth are really white!&amp;#34; As someone who smoked for 10 years, and has been drinking coffee daily for 5 years, this was a really nice thing to hear. I&#x27;ll recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in the whitening of my teeth after using this product.  I did not use in the tanning bed which may make a huge difference.  I used the led light that is shipped with the product.</li>
    <li> Twilight Teeth worked very well when I was using a tanning bed. There was a noticeable difference after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;It did not work conclusively well the LED unit. It took approximately six daily uses to see the same difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often when a product does what it claims, but Twighlight Teeth really works! I  tried it with the enclosed mini led light, first, &amp; then the tanning bed. It&#x27;s goes into hyper drive in the tanning bed, of course, because of the strength of the light. If you have ever used any teeth whitener, you know to expect the mild stinging from the product on gums...this is the same. It&#x27;s strong! It also comes with a mouthpiece to hold lips out of the way so you can apply product &amp; keep mouth open for light. The small light provided actually slides into frame on a small track made for it so you don&#x27;t have to hold it. When I first used it in the tanning bed, I looked in the mirror &amp; said &amp;#34;Woa&amp;#34; because it literally made my teeth glow. The edges were illuminated for a bit until brush on product wore off &amp; revealed my noticeably whiter teeth. Of course, like anything else, you have to use it occasionally to keep the benefits going, but that is expected. It takes just a few trips to the tanning bed using Twighlight Teeth &amp; you will smile a lot more!</li>
    <li> My little sister bought this using my account. I haven&#x27;t heard her complaining about it, so I&#x27;m guessing it works for her.</li>
    <li> Noticeably whiter after a few uses. Very convenient to use while tanning. Taste isn&#x27;t awful either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says on the packaging that it doesn&#x27;t work on any dental work, but it has whitened some on mine.</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening product available for an awesome price! So much cheaper than whitestrips and works 100x faster and better. You will see results after the first use in a tanning bed!</li>
    <li> this is aweseome stuff</li>
    <li> It bleached certain parts of my teeth blindingly white, while leaving others unchanged. The result? Spotty, weird-looking teeth. I had to drink as much dark soda/coffee as I could without a straw to get them at least back to all one shade!</li>
    <li> Never saw a difference that was worth the price.</li>
    <li> The light did not work, but using this in the tanning bed has made my teeth whiten.</li>
    <li> Even whitens fake/veneers which my dentist said do NOT whiten (at least not with the ZOOM! white take home kit). Doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I Love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I think this works well (best under tanning bed, but also effectively with the included light). The directions are hard to find, but if using the light, I find that 15-20 minutes will give you subtle results.</li>
    <li> After ONE use, I already notice a huge difference. My teeth are whiter! I haven&#x27;t tried the mini-light that comes with it, I&#x27;ve just used it in conjunction with tanning in a tanning bed and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product did what it said it would do. I used it every time I was in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Some tips to maximize your usage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush teeth before use!&lt;br /&gt;2. This product ONLY works in a high pressure bed, or one with plenty of UVA Rays!! Ask your salon if you&#x27;re unsure what bed to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t eat or drink anything for fifteen minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are SPARKLING WHITE :] I will continue to always use this product!!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for teeth whitening, all except the dentist chair. I found that the crest white strips made my teeth throb for days after. So i thought this version with the tanning bed light to boost it would do the trick. I just got tanner. no notice of whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> i saw most of the reviews on this product, and i know it is cheap, but the reviews were good.  i have gone to the tanning booth every other day for two weeks straight with this product.  there is a little bit of a difference, but it&#x27;s not as i would have hoped.  maybe someone could suggest something different to me?  around the same price?</li>
    <li> This stuff is sooo good my sister cancelled a dental bleaching appointment to try this instead. I love how white teeth got after one session and I didn&#x27;t experience the sensitivity of white strips</li>
    <li> Want really white teeth and like to tan? Then this is your product. Amazing results with just one use! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I actually work at a tanning salon but we do not sell this product instead we sell more expensive one time products but one of our previous employees recommended this to me and I though \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;     My teeth were stained from being a previous smoker and I tried our 1 time use stuff and I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference. Honestly I saw more of a difference from this cheap multi use product then it&#x27;s expensive counterparts. My teeth were noticeably whiter and I even checked them on our whitening scale and they got whiter by three shades, so it does work and it wasn&#x27;t just because I was getting tanner like another reviewer said.     It&#x27;s not too expensive so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, it&#x27;s not an entire waste.    Happy whitening!</li>
    <li> No miracles but it did seem to slightly whiten my teeth. Kind of fun and easy to use, I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity at all while using this either.</li>
    <li> Really convenient in the tanning bed becausecyou dont have to use the light. The light isn&#x27;t bad though. Got my teeth a few shades lighter in a few days, but I also wear strips some days and was brushing/rinsing with hydrogen peroxide other days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this in the tanning bed and it works great but since this one comes WITH the UV light, it&#x27;s handy for a quick whitening without using the tanning bed!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all! Save your money! Used 4 times and didn&#x27;t even lighten 1 shade. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I could see a noticeable difference after two sessions. Make sure you protect your lips/gums, as they will chap or become sensitive if they come in contact with the gel. Vitamin E capsules alleviate that issue. If you tan, its a cheap investment that yields better results than anything else I&#x27;ve used as a touch up product between dental office whitenings.</li>
    <li> After my first tanning session using this (8 minutes in a stand up booth) my teeth are noticeably whiter! It was very easy to use and the mouth guard is comfortable. The whitening gel comes in a small bottle with an attached brush and has a minty taste that is very pleasant. I definitely recommend this product and love the price!</li>
    <li> I am a previous user of this product and loved how it worked in the tanning booth, so I am giving the product itself 5 stars.  However, since I can&#x27;t make it to the booth as often as I would like, I was excited to see it on sale here with the little blue hand held UV light!  I received the product on the 2nd day (thanks Prime) and opened it much like a child at Christmas time...  But just like how Ralphie looked when he did not get his Red Rider gun at first, my smile quickly faded when I could only see the whitener and mouth guard in the box... No hand held light!  After chatting with the awesome Amazon rep, I purchased the item again...  Today I got the 2nd order and ripped open the box to once again have my heart broken by the lack of a UV light...  So, returning this one and going with a different seller and hoping for better results...  If the light was actually included in the box both times, then hopefully this will make them realize the type of \\&quot;envelope\\&quot; box they are using is crap and things can (and do) easily fall out of it in transit...</li>
    <li> I purchased the Twilight Teeth Platinum without the LED light because I use a tanning bed.  I really like the product. It has made me teeth a couple of shades white. Honestly though I don&#x27;t know if it because of the product or that I&#x27;m just getting really tan so my teeth appear whiter. Whatever the cause I will continue to purchase this product. Now that I have the mouth piece all I need to buy is just the refill.</li>
    <li> I used this product every other day while tannning until the little bottle ran out and I didn&#x27;t see any whitening at all. I just have general yellowing from coffee/food/wine, not greying or aging teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is advertised WITH the light. What I received did not include a light. I know the product works well, but couldn&#x27;t give more stars due to showing one thing and sending another.</li>
    <li> I saw a review on here before I ordered this that said it did not come with the light.  I just wanted to correct that and say that mine did come with a light and i love this product. Wether your using it with the tanning bed or the at home light, this works very fast and effectively and is very easy to use!! I will definitely use this product to the last drop!</li>
    <li> I love this product for two reasons, it works and it does not make my teeth sensitive at all. I am not able to use any type of Crest Whitestrips because my teeth will hurt terribly afterwards, so I decided to give this product a try. I drink a good big of coffee and tea and didn&#x27;t use it every time I tanned so I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but a difference none the less. Next time, I&#x27;ll just have to make sure I use it every time I tan until it&#x27;s empty :)</li>
    <li> After only 3 sessions my teeth are almost glowing white, and I still have plenty of sessions worth of product in my bottle. I also have to add that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with sensitivity. It&#x27;s cheaper then white strips but works a lot faster...</li>
    <li> The LED light did not work. I would not reorder. I have used the whitener gel in the past and it works great. So i ordered from another company.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, no results after first try. Planning to try it more times to see if results are better with multiple applications</li>
    <li> I just got this item today, and all that came was the small tube of what you put on your teeth in a plastic bag. I was under the impression this came with a mouth guard and maybe some directions. But AT LEAST what it states it comes with. I haven&#x27;t tried this yet, but plan to tonight.. So far I&#x27;m let down that items that should have didn&#x27;t even come with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t work properly.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective product or what but the light doesn&#x27;t stay on by itself so I have to hold it down on my own and then it usually starts blinking crazy.  There are definitely other effective products out there that are better than this one!</li>
    <li> White strips work way better...this stuff is awkward to put on and keeping ur mouth open all thru a relaxing tanning session is not comfortable</li>
    <li> I noticed a brighter set of chompers after the first time I used it.  It tastes AWFUL but hey, that&#x27;s the price you have to pay right? If you don&#x27;t put it on evenly you can definitely tell.</li>
    <li> This product must be a knock off, I bought it a tannin salon awhile ago and it whitened my teeth! This one hasn&#x27;t whitened them one bit ! I want my money back!</li>
    <li> Love the product if I&#x27;m in a tanning bed, but the sometimes the light that comes in the box doesn&#x27;t work so I can&#x27;t whiten at home.</li>
    <li> I love the mirror on the box you can put it on anywhere without having a bathroom near by. good product</li>
    <li> great product saw a difference within two uses. the taste is not so good but goes away within 30 minutes</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use this alone, mainly in the tanning bed.  Does work though!  Better than other brands!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff . It was especially nice to have it come with the light. So easy to use I&#x27;m using it while I write this review. It arrived on time and in good condition. i would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> No didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after reading the reviews. After only 4 uses in the tanning bed (Super High Pressure UVA Beds) I have noticed my teeth a few shades whiter. No sensitivity issues and the mouth piece is comfy. Very simple and effective. Would recommend to others. Cheaper than the Zoom laser trearment! Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I think this thing works. not sure if its a mental thing but i would order it again. . .</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I got my stuff.  The first time I used it however I was mortified!! I came out of the tanning bed with blotches all over my teeth!!  Thankfully however they went away after like half an hour and my teeth were noticably whiter so over all I am pleased with the product. Oh and you do get everything you need to do it. it comes with the mouth gaurd and the whitening stuff. (just thought I&#x27;d put that out there cuz I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered mine)</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Of course it&#x27;s not like going and getting work done at the dentist. But for the price its not a bad product.</li>
    <li> love it work great in my tanning bed everybody with a tanning bed should give it a try its worth the money</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Most whitening products cause my sensitive teeth to hurt, but that didn&#x27;t happen with this product.  Results after first use.  Would recommend and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> very uncomfortable, I  used it several times while tanning and did not see any changes .. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I was expecting what was pictured which was the twi-light but ended up just getting the mouthpiece and the whitener. False advertising! WHY PICTURE THE 25 U.V LIGHT IF ITS NOT INCLUDED FALSE AD , YOU GUYS SUCK</li>
    <li> I purchased this system thinking I would receive the 1. whitening gel, 2. mouthpiece, and 3. UV light (as shown on the picture). The box in the picture also includes a UV light with rays. The gel is activated by the UV light.&lt;br /&gt;What I received was the gel and mouthpiece.....no light. The box doesn&#x27;t even have the light on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a non-tanning bed user, and having not received my UV light with the kit, this product is a worthless investment.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff at least 15 times and I couldn&#x27;t ever tell any difference.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works okay, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in the whiteness of my teeth over a two week period. May have needed to use longer</li>
    <li> I saw a little improvement in the whiteness of my teeth when using this product, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. felt stupid doing it too.</li>
    <li> This product is a great product because it actually works, I used it every time I tanned and had beautiful white teeth</li>
    <li> I got this item today and am very disappointed. The picture shows the whitener with the mouth piece and from that picture that is what I thought I would be getting. NO! I only got the whitener and no mouth piece. Very displeased!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how fast I got this product. I have only used it once and I could tell that my teeth were a little whiter!! I am going to keep using it. I also like that the mouth guard is pink. :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. No change whatsoever. Waste of money to me. In glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the tanning salon thou for twice this much!</li>
    <li> Only thing i didn&#x27;t like is how small the whitening tube was wish it was bigger. Other than that very satsified</li>
    <li> This stuff has made my teeth whiter but the light button doesn&#x27;t stay down and so I have to hold it for the light to stay on. Also even doing that the light flickers at times. It&#x27;s best to use it in the tanning bed for maximum results.</li>
    <li> The first time I saw a difference and so did my friends and family. Very easy to apply whether you use it in the tanning bed or use the light that comes with it. Minty flavor and hasn&#x27;t bothered my gums like some other products have.</li>
    <li> Product is easy to use and works very quick. I&#x27;ll definitely order this one again. Great price and great service. Thanks very much. Highly recommend.fast shipping.</li>
    <li> waste of money and space. Didnt see a difference with or without it. Waste of money I think personally!! Thanks</li>
    <li> It definitely is working to make my teeth whiter in the tanning bed but the UV light that came with it stopped working a day after I got it..could be the 2 batteries that it comes with but I would think that they would last for more than 1 10 minute use, I couldn&#x27;t return it bc the policy says that it has to be unused which is crazy bc how else would you know if it worked or not?? This is the 1st thing I&#x27;ve ever bought from Amazon that I had an issue with..just sayin</li>
    <li> I bought this along with an extra refill, the mouth guard is simple to use and doesn&#x27;t bother you much while you&#x27;re tanning, its been a month and I&#x27;ve definitely seen my teeth get whiter, although it doesn&#x27;t take a month to get results! :) Home system comes with batteries (remember to take the thin plastic cover out from between the two watch batteries)</li>
    <li> I saw this product in my local tanning salon for twice as much, saw great reviews here on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. It includes a small tube of whitening gel (looks like a sample tube of lip gloss with brush applicator), a LED light, and a mouth tray. My tanning salon rooms include small mirrors, but if yours do not, I suggest bringing one along. My teeth are pretty white on their own, and I have used other products like Crest Whitestrips, which work for me. I usually use a level 1 or 2 bed for 10-15 minutes. Even after one session, this product made my teeth much whiter! I&#x27;m not sure how much whiter they can get. A friend asked if I &amp;#34;had something on my teeth&amp;#34; like a white paint or something, because they were so dramatically white. As for the gel, it tastes like Listerine. I did not like the mouth guard, because it is too small. It doesn&#x27;t allow for all my teeth to be shown at once, so I just smile big while I&#x27;m tanning. I have not tried the LED light. The product is marketed on the power of UV rays whitening your teeth, so I&#x27;m not sure how an LED light would work. Therefore I haven&#x27;t tried it, as I don&#x27;t want to waste my limited supply of gel. Next time, I will just buy a tube of gel.</li>
    <li> This is an OK product, but the only thing truly useful out of it is the pink mouth piece that holds your mouth open. The UV light system that I received didn&#x27;t work ( I figure the battery is dead) and the &amp;#34;magic gel&amp;#34; they give to put on your teeth is just hydrogen peroxide. So it you want to save a few bucks, then go buy the brush on teeth whitening gel from your local Target , find a similar mouth piece or just smile while your in the tanning bed  and you will get the same results. Oh, yeah, it does work in the tanning beds for me, but not a huge dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> the portable light that comes with it doesn&#x27;t work, but if used in a tanning bed you can semi see a difference. not really that noticeable. it just looks brighter. I&#x27;ve used it twice, but will post an update after multiple uses. so far no significant difference</li>
    <li> After just one use my teeth were visably whiter and brighter and so smooth. The taste is actually not bad at all, have used this twice and my teeth look great i cant wait to see them after a few more uses! very easy to use!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting what was pictured which was the twi-light but ended up just getting the mouthpiece and the whitener. False advertising!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tricked with so many different beauty products, but this one really works. I was amazed how quickly my teeth became noticeably whiter--I use just the light it comes with for 20 minutes every day (or every other day, if I forget) and it is miraculous.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well. Mouth piece interesting.  Not sure about light that was included, I just use system in the tanning bed.  Haven&#x27;t had spots or any issues.</li>
    <li> I received this product super fast (thanks to Amazon Prime free trial-thank you!!) and seeing as I am snowed in and won&#x27;t have a chance to get to the tanning bed for at least a couple of days, I wanted to try this out at home and see how it worked and IF it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I made sure to slather the teeth with the gel. Be sure you are evenly putting the gel on, and not missing any spots. If you miss spots, you are absolutely going to notice. Then, you are going to drooooool. Seriously. So best thing to do is grab a small towel (I used a facecloth), and put one under my chin and had one on standby in case i needed to wipe my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was confusing that there was no time instructions written on the box. I tried looking it up and found that you can use it anywhere between 8 and 30 minutes. So I opted for 30. Then was watching a show, lost track of time, and realized that I had it in for about 50 minutes. Took it out, and wiped my mouth dry. Was slightly bummed because it didn&#x27;t look like my teeth were ANY whiter. Did I really go through all that for nothing?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward an hour. Went to look in the mirror. Oh there&#x27;s my teeth, getting whiter! Again, an hour after that, I checked again and I absolutely noticed a difference. Of course, I can only imagine it would be even better using this product in a tanning bed, which I intend to do in a few days, but using at home with the light was just fine, and I will absolutely be purchasing the refills, so I do not run out anytime soon. I did not experience ANY sensitivity at all and I have some very sensitive teeth/gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whiteness was so noticeable, my husband noticed it the second he got in from work. &amp;#34;Wow, your teeth look great&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product it the gold standard all others should be measured by. It&#x27;s effective, tastes good, safe, and works way better than any of the ones that don&#x27;t use a UV light. But costs considerably less than any other product that does use UV light. It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth sensitive either. I had one that didn&#x27;t have the light and the Twilight Teeth company said I could exchange it for the one with the light--talk about customer service!!! Wow! They were super great to deal with. This is THE best teeth white product--hands down.</li>
    <li> I buy this from my tanning salon so everything is how it&#x27;s supposed to be. You can buy it as a package or just the whitener and it&#x27;s the same online make sure you buy from a reputable dealer and that they are selling everything you need. For your first purchase you will need the mouthpiece because no you aren&#x27;t supposed to just hold your mouth open, the piece does it for u, and the at home uv light but it&#x27;s original use was for the tanning bed so don&#x27;t be too surprised if it doesn&#x27;t work solely at home since it&#x27;s not made for that. The at home light was meant for touch ups. Do your research before you bomb a product that you know nothing about. I have been using this product for years and I get results after every tan. Buying things online especially when you&#x27;re trying to get a deal and buy outside amazon or the product site u risk getting ripped off but that&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault but yours so make sure you know what you&#x27;re talking about please.</li>
    <li> I loved it ! Works best at home and in tanning bed! Diffantly  was more then I expected. I did really think it would work but it did!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I will be sticking with my crest white strips.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Does seem to whiten teeth in the salon, haven&#x27;t tried it at home.  Will try and update!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product i have used it a total of 4 times the past week 2 times in my tanning bed and then 2 times with the led light..i want to say i love this product i have used several of the other bleaching systems to try and improve my smile or bring it back to the way it was in highschool..everyone of the other products i have used ended up causing severe blisters on my gums and skin peeling of the gum line too. The pain i endured from those systems wasnt worth it because they only partially whitened my smile. This product has shown tremendous improvement in my smile and it has had no side effects or any problem with my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; below. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You</li>
    <li> This stuff works, I noticed results the first time I used it. But it does fade very quickly. Will keep using and see if it gets any better.</li>
    <li> This product worked great on me. The bottle is tiny but last a long time. Never used the light that came with it though..not sure how that worked ,but in the tanning beds it worked great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long and dried up before I could use it all, tanning one to two times a week.</li>
    <li> If u want cheap way to get pearly white try it out. Easy to use and works the first time...</li>
    <li> This teeth whitener is awesome! It seriously makes ur teeth like 3 shades whiter.  It&#x27;s double the price if you buy it at a tanning salon! I def will buy this again when I need more!</li>
    <li> This works well enough at home but it works much better in the tanning bed. There are similar products that would be ok to use at home.</li>
    <li> this didnt make any difference at all</li>
    <li> These teeth whiteners are amazing! You can use them in the tanning bed or in home. In the tanning bed, you can tell a difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> Loved this product.. I only used it twice before my friend took mine and used the rest of it.. im a smoker and it worked great</li>
    <li> This product is no joke! After just two sessions my teeth were movie star white!!! You can tell the difference after one use. And although it says u can use it at home, it is much more efficient when used in a tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I just want to say... Wow!  I almost did not purchase this product because of the few \\&quot;bad\\&quot; reviews. And let me say that I am so glad I didnt listen, What were they talking about?!  This product really WORKS. My teeth are pretty white already and just after one time using this it IN the tanning bed I definatly noticed a difference. You have to apply on a somewhat dry tooth and apply very carefully cause if you miss a spot you will see it. Put your mouth guard on and tan for a minimum of 10min. ( I tanned for 20 min my first time) Ive used crest whitening strips and after using the whole box And spending $40 I got better results from this product after just one use. Plus, I have not had any discomfort that I did get from the crest strips.   When you go to the dentist to have your teeth whitened you spend $400+ and they use a UV light,this whitening system is genius! This product is not expensive and if you use it correctly you will see results.Plus save your mouth guard and buy an $8 refill. The people that made bad reviews probably didn&#x27;t tan very long, apply correctly or wear the mouth guard. I&#x27;m not really sure how everyone wouldn&#x27;t get the same results I did, Teeth are teeth.  I did not use the light it came with yet, And I really don&#x27;t think I will. I am very happy with my purchase. $15 well worth it And I just ordered my refill.</li>
    <li> I could definitely tell a difference after one use. I find using it in the tanning bed to be MUCH more effective than using the at home uv light. It&#x27;s working great. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am sooo disappointed in this. The UV light is so dim, you can not even tell its on. This is a complete waste of good money.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference.  If you go to a tanning booth that only gives you 5 minutes to lotion-up, then you won&#x27;t have time to use this product.  Mouth piece is comfortable and not hard to figure out.</li>
    <li> I seen this product at an old tanning salon that I use to go to and it was kind of pricey. So I got it on here. Came really fast, and had great packaging. Never have I ever had whiter teeth. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile and everyone asks what I use on my teeth, they&#x27;re so white. That&#x27;s great! Not too uncomfortable, doesn&#x27;t taste awful. My only beef is that I get cold sores every time I use it. I can&#x27;t find any other reviewers who did, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with my results. I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations since it was only $15. There was a difference when used with a whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description. well worth the money, great price.</li>
    <li> It was open when I got it. Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I am a smoker and this works. In the tanning salon or at home, both work if you use it daily.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would work based on past reviews.  I thought it was great.  I tan in a high pressure bed and by the second session I noticed results.  I will continue to use</li>
    <li> I can tell a huge difference after a 10 min (Level 1 - Laydown at L.A. Tan). I am not sure how long it lasts but I can really see at least 2 shades brighter after a use.&lt;br /&gt;Tip/Thought - I use a toothbrush with no toothpaste before I leave the house to clean my teeth (I know some whitening products you aren&#x27;t supposed to brush right before use.) * I couldn&#x27;t find instructions on when I can brush before/after use... It is possible I didn&#x27;t look hard enough?!?</li>
    <li> I smoke so I get these white stains In between my two front teeth , when I tan for ten mins I just put it on and when I&#x27;m out BANG no stains I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I used it as instructed and I didn&#x27;t see any difference. Very disappointing. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product arrived exactly when it was supposed to. The light is funny looking (my family got quite the laugh) but it seemed to work after two uses. I also used it in the tanning bed, which also worked. Overall, I feel it&#x27;s definitely a good product for a good price. The gel/liquid that goes on your teeth does definitely burn if you put it on your gums, but obviously that&#x27;s not where it is intended to go.</li>
    <li> I am seriously AMAZED! I can&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror. Did I say how beyond AMAZED I am?&lt;br /&gt;If you notice, most all the Bad reviews have to do with the faulty light. If you use a tanning bed it works awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a few details about me. I have been a smoker for 32 years. I drink coffee daily. Hardly ever use a straw and love my Cherry Coke. NONE of which helps teeth look good. I have very sensitive teeth-Even Sensodine is sometimes irritating to my gums. I am a born skeptic but thought for under $20 what could I really lose buy trying this product. I am SO SO SO glad I did. I will be a repeat user for life. I did not use the little UV light it came with.&lt;br /&gt;MY PREP: I brushed my teeth and did a mouthwash before heading to tan. Still had my cigarette on the way though.&lt;br /&gt;I took a clean wash cloth from home to dry my teeth before application and a bottled water incase I had to rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;TANNING BED APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;I used it 1 time last night during my 12 minute tanning bed session. (Not sure what &amp;#34;level&amp;#34; bed I was in. I just always use the one that browns and bronzes all at the same time-if that helps anyone)&lt;br /&gt;I dried my teeth, placed in the mouth piece , shook up the tube then applied very quickly but on all my teeth showing inside the mouth piece. I did it quick cause I new the bed was about to turn on. Lol In the future I may apply a coat before I leave the house and when I get there to make sure the inbetweens get covered. Then I tanned for 12 min.&lt;br /&gt;I took my lipstick off for the after pick because I didn&#x27;t want my red lipstick making me think my teeth got whiter than they did but it wasn&#x27;t necessary. No denying they were definately whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put twilight teeth on after my lotion so it would be fresh going into the bed. HINT: At least have the brand new tube opened enough oily hands can open it or apply it before you get your hands oily.&lt;br /&gt;The mouth piece which looks odd but is comfortable. Just make sure to get your lips into the lip groove. Getting this product on your lips make them stickyish but does not burn or make them dry and crack.&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity: NO BURNING OR PAIN. JUST A LITTLE TINGLE.&lt;br /&gt;It did start to tingle some on my gums and I thought ok, here we go.&lt;br /&gt;I was prepared to wash it off but by the time I had it all applied and I got into the tanning bed it was done.&lt;br /&gt;SWALLOWING: NO WORRIES.&lt;br /&gt;Granted my tanning session was spent laying on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have alot of saliva occur and the little I did have I swallowed&lt;br /&gt;with intrepidation. I tasted NOTHING. Whew. I have a bad gag reflex and was worried for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD AND THE UGLY:NONE; My teeth looked and FELT great. Even today they still feel clean and look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after I try the home UV light.&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;I WISH I could get the pictures to show but I can&#x27;t get them to post. BIG BUMMER cause there is a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;If someone knows how to get pics to post PLEASE let me know. I have never been so proud to tell about a product that stands up to what it says it does. ***********roduct on your lips make them stickyish but does not burn or make them dry and crack.

    <li> DO NOT use this product!! The mouth guard causes the skin to thin around the corners and then SKIN DAMAGE! I now have brown spots on my upper lip- looks like a mustache :(  I have now spent over $2,000 trying to get rid of the skin damage on my upper lip and still working on the situation. Yes, my teeth looked whiter (whiteness faded few weeks later) but white teeth are not worth getting skin damage!  I wish I had NEVER used this product. I have been trying to undo the damage it caused for the last 2 years.  There are other products that whiten teeth without leading to permeant skin damage.</li>
    <li> Not my cup of tea....</li>
    <li> Used this while in the tanning bed.  It worked great!</li>
    <li> I want to warn you now before you buy this, that it DOES NOT come with the light! I bought it thinking that it would come with the light because of the picture and it didn&#x27;t, which is perfectly okay considering that I only planned to use it in the tanning bed anyways. If you look carefully at the description, it never states it comes with a light either. Anyways, this product worked GREAT after one use. I could see the results immediately. MAKE SURE you get it in the cracks between your teeth also, not just swipe across your teeth or you&#x27;ll see the difference in color. Besides that, it&#x27;s fabulous. And SO much cheaper than what the salon is offering. 5 STARS!!</li>
    <li> I had parents who didn&#x27;t teach us to properly care for anything, like our teeth. So I neglected mine until I was probably 15... this product makes it look like I&#x27;ve cared my entire life. Besides the drool I can&#x27;t control while using it, I love it. I have a year old and I can walk around playing with him, or clean, or cook, and still be doing my teeth!</li>
    <li> Have to say I expected this to work the first time. It looks like you have to use frequently and who knows for how long until the whiteness is noticeable.</li>
    <li> This product does the trick - the mouth piece opening could be larger - I feel I&#x27;m only whitening a portion of my teeth...</li>
    <li> i have  been using this for about a week and my teeth are so much whiter. it doesnt leave a bad taste eather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product multiple times &amp; haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my teeth at all. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
