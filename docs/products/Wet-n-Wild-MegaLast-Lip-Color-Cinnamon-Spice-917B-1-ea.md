      <li>I love this lipstick !</li>
      <li>Love the color !</li>
      <li>Love the colour feels good on my lips too</li>
      <li>You can control the shade very easily.</li>
      <li>Already purchased more lipsticks :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lip stick</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love the color, it&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>though it was more purple, but is ok</li>
      <li>The color is okay.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and it was great</li>
      <li>sigh* :)</li>
      <li>When blotted, the color is okay on</li>
      <li>Not the best color for my skin tone however if you are looking for a brick red</li>
      <li>Defiantly my favorite lipstick.</li>
      <li>I really love this brand, for the price is a very good product, has a nice color and stay a long time.</li>
      <li>The color is okay, but it looks really cheap and doesn&#x27;t evenly coat.</li>
      <li>This one in particular is a good winter/spring color.</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful matte color.</li>
      <li>Great color to give you a bold lip without being too loud.</li>
      <li>The color is rich...</li>
      <li>I wished I could be more positive.</li>
      <li>This came right on time!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great quality but its just not really a go too color for me.</li>
      <li>I love it thanks for asking</li>
      <li>The cinnamon spice is a true brick red and just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this, definitely going to buy more as soon as I run out.</li>
      <li>the color is beautiful but goes on messy and does not glide on whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Very smooth and soft when I apply this.</li>
      <li>Worth trying</li>
      <li>But this has such great deeply pigmented shades!</li>
      <li>I look very mysterious in this lipstick, I love wearing it.</li>
      <li>This is exactly the color I was looking for this fall.</li>
      <li>You can easily wear this as a stain...with a little lipbalm over the top.</li>
      <li>It dries out your lips pretty fast, too.</li>
      <li>Love matte lipsticks, and these are just so highly pigmented and last all day.</li>
      <li>The color was better suited for me than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I love wet n wild lip colors!</li>
      <li>It is not bad, but I&#x27;m looking for just a red brown....</li>
      <li>Wish I had purchased a lip brush as well, though, because it is kind of hard to apply straight from the tube.</li>
      <li>Since discovering Wet N Wild lipsticks I haven&#x27;t been able to justify spending another $20+ on a high end lipstick.</li>
      <li>just a little more brown tint</li>
      <li>Huge mistake buying this - not worth even $5.</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised with quality and price.</li>
      <li>With a little balm on my lips first, this lipstick stays on!</li>
      <li>My only complaint MIGHT be that the flat finish leaves my lips feeling dry, when I&#x27;d like a smooth glide.</li>

<li> My only complaint MIGHT be that the flat finish leaves my lips feeling dry, when I&#x27;d like a smooth glide.</li>
<li> and it is long wear lasting proof!</li>
<li> It last long, and matches my skin completion.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t like pink, purple or blue in my lipsticks....</li>
<li> It looks strange on my lips despite moisturizing beforehand and using my lip liner.</li>
<li> I was looking for a deep Burgundy, but when it&#x27;s applied it&#x27;s pink</li>
<li> I&#x27;d compare it to L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s long wearing lipstick.</li>
<li> have white skin with pink cheeks, dark blue eyes and pinky lips.</li>
<li> This is VERY long wearing ...</li>
<li> its like a dark cherry color in it last all day</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a deep reddish plum that is dramatic but still very wearable.</li>
<li> These layer and mix well with other lipsticks and glosses.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be as pigmented as the other colors</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little lighter than I expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m dark skin but not too dark, this color will truly work for any skin tone.</li>
<li> but I though the color will be a little darker then</li>
<li> It is matte there is some drying and a little bit of settling, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
<li> very dark chicas!</li>
<li> I just had to add a small amount of a darker color to it.</li>
<li> I was so disappointed in the colour.</li>
<li> This color look so horrible</li>

    <li> I love wet n wild lip colors! This one in particular is a good winter/spring color.</li>
    <li> I was going to order this oline, but was nervous cause the last lipsticks i ordered weren&#x27;t ecactly what I had imagined. But I saw this color in CVS for ......$1.99!!!!!!! I just had to get it especially at that price. It is BEAUTIFUL! I&#x27;m dark skin but not too dark, this color will truly work for any skin tone. And it even smells like cinnamon! How awsome is that??? GET IT!!!!Just see for yourself!</li>
    <li> Great lipsticks!!! This one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I really love this brand, for the price is a very good product, has a nice color and stay a long time.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the color I was looking for this fall. It&#x27;s a deep reddish plum that is dramatic but still very wearable. And this stuff wears all day. It is matte there is some drying and a little bit of settling, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> i like it but it is cheaper everywhere else</li>
    <li> I wished I could be more positive. I was so disappointed in the colour. I was looking for a deep Burgundy, but when it&#x27;s applied it&#x27;s pink</li>
    <li> Love the color, it&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The color is okay, but it looks really cheap and doesn&#x27;t evenly coat. It dries out your lips pretty fast, too. The lipstick tube broke within a week of using it. Huge mistake buying this - not worth even $5.</li>
    <li> Cakes up a bit, but does it&#x27;s job to color my lips (:</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brick red-ish cream (without shimmer/glitter) lipstick. I saw these and was attracted to them because you can see the lipstick bullet through the cap. This is VERY long wearing ...I&#x27;d compare it to L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s long wearing lipstick. I think this is a bit drying. But this has such great deeply pigmented shades! You can easily wear this as a stain...with a little lipbalm over the top.You can control the shade very easily. These layer and mix well with other lipsticks and glosses. Great price , too!</li>
    <li> I love it thanks for asking</li>
    <li> The cinnamon spice is a true brick red and just gorgeous. Love matte lipsticks, and these are just so highly pigmented and last all day. My favorite lipstick line!</li>
    <li> I look very mysterious in this lipstick, I love wearing it. Definitely needs setting powder or something though because everything i put my mouth on became blood-red covered.</li>
    <li> Love the color ! And the quality is amazing its like you&#x27;re wearing a MAC lipstick but cheaper !!</li>
    <li> AWESOME. just what I was looking for. Wish I had purchased a lip brush as well, though, because it is kind of hard to apply straight from the tube. Great color</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color</li>
    <li> I though it was more purple, but is ok</li>
    <li> Great will be ordering again</li>
    <li> The color was better suited for me than I expected.  My only complaint MIGHT be that the flat finish leaves my lips feeling dry, when I&#x27;d like a smooth glide.</li>
    <li> Great color to give you a bold lip without being too loud. Also pretty awesome quality for the price you pay. Since discovering Wet N Wild lipsticks I haven&#x27;t been able to justify spending another $20+ on a high end lipstick. Worth trying and if you don&#x27;t like it, not a big deal bc it&#x27;s only $1.99.</li>
    <li> The color is rich...just a little more brown tint than I like...Fits my daughter perfect!!! So I gave it to her and she is happy!!</li>
    <li> the color is beautiful but goes on messy and does not glide on whatsoever. It looks strange on my lips despite moisturizing beforehand and using my lip liner.</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and it was great but I though the color will be a little darker then this but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lip stick i all be buying it again !</li>
    <li> This color is a reddish orange color, I like it but I&#x27;&#x27;m not used to red. Hopefully it&#x27;ll grow on me. It&#x27;s great quality but its just not really a go too color for me. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to be as pigmented as the other colors but it could just be because of my lips.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful matte color. Pleasantly surprised with quality and price. Already purchased more lipsticks :)</li>
    <li> The color is great !!</li>
    <li> Yesssss its like a dark cherry color in it last all day</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick !🙌</li>
    <li> This color look so horrible</li>
    <li> The color is okay. I just had to add a small amount of a darker color to it. It&#x27;s a little lighter than I expected.</li>
    <li> Not the best color for my skin tone however if you are looking for a brick red this is for you.</li>
    <li> This came right on time! I absolutely love this, definitely going to buy more as soon as I run out. Very smooth and soft when I apply this.</li>
    <li> With a little balm on my lips first, this lipstick stays on! The staying power is just awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;I have white skin with pink cheeks, dark blue eyes and pinky lips. That being said, this lipstick makes me look like a goth-wanna-be -- again!&lt;br /&gt;This color on me is purple red brown. It is not bad, but I&#x27;m looking for just a red brown.... very dark chicas! When blotted, the color is okay on me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like pink, purple or blue in my lipsticks.... If I don&#x27;t find my red brown, I&#x27;ll go back to nude... *sigh* :)</li>
    <li> Love the colour feels good on my lips too</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but the color  is  different from what&#x27;s  shown</li>
    <li> Color as described. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This color goes on so smooth, this is the perfect color for darker skin person like me. I recommend any darker skin person to but this.</li>
    <li> Defiantly my favorite lipstick. It last long, and matches my skin completion.</li>
    <li> Great color and it is long wear lasting proof!</li>
