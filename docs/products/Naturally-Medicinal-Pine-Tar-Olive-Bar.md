      <li>it&#x27;s also amazing, I use it until I can barely hold it between the tip of my finger and my face.</li>

      <li>It is well worth your investment into your skin and complexion!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So, it makes it worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been meaning to try one of Proactiv&#x27;s cleansers, but then I was given this and WOW, I love it.</li>
      <li>Nice thick later also makes it great for shaving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this bar of soap as my primary face wash for nearly a year now.  </li>
      <li>changes on my skin were immediate soon after I bought my first Kreamy Soap.</li>
      <li>As for the smell, it&#x27;s exactly like that tea that&#x27;s roasted over pine, lapsang souchong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with the &amp;#34;disadvantages&amp;#34; of using it if it will really help my psoriasis.</li>
      <li>But &#x27;Pine Tar&#x27; is pretty much what it smells like.</li>
      <li>Ten years ago, at a little outdoor farmer&#x27;s market in the high desert near Joshua Tree, I discovered Kat &amp; Brett&#x27;s delicious Kreamy Soaps.</li>
      <li>Very piney and tarry.</li>
      <li>This soap has really improved my husbands skin.  </li>
      <li>but really who cares if it works.</li>
      <li>it is gentle, non-drying,  and removes all makeup.  </li>
      <li>Whole family won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
      <li>really helps relieve the skin irritation and allows my skin to heal.</li>
      <li>A reasonably decent soap, but very over rated by its manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>However, I would not use this as a full body soap simply because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a campfire.  </li>
      <li>Great for every kind of skin condition, no more typical dryness as from other soaps.</li>
      <li>nothing more, nothing less.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft, without drying it out!!</li>
      <li>The bathroom will smell like a newly paved parking lot surrounded by pine trees.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rarely get breakouts and if I do they seem to clear up in a short period of time.</li>
      <li>I first saw Kreamy Pine Tart Olive Bar Soaps about a 2 years ago in Solana Beach, CA at the local Farmers Market on a Sunday Afternoon.</li>
      <li>When I use this soap it has an extremely soft, thick And moisturizing lather, which makes it nice and soft and soothing when I shave my legs and get no razor burns.</li>
      <li>bar is pricey, however the size is a little bigger than most soaps on the market.  </li>
      <li>My son uses it and it keeps his skin completely clear.</li>
      <li>it is soothing and natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a shampoo and my hair is shiny and so soft.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about it!!!</li>
      <li>This soap makes my skin feel soft and hydrated because of all of its natural oils.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that is allergic to both lye and fragrances.</li>
      <li>This product is all natural and probably 1 million times better for my skin than other competing brands with multiple chemicals And dry out my skin.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle, but will sting your eyes, so be careful using this soap with children.</li>
      <li>If you live in Southern California...</li>
      <li>Due to high dosage of pain medication for nearly a year, including epidural injections, the skin on my face and back suffered an intense break-up of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We all suffer from some sort of skin irritation and this soap has definitely been THE ONE to clear and soothe our skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far I have only used the Lemon Lavender soap, but I did buy the Pine Tar Olive Bar for my son that gets eczema.</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this soap one month ago at a local natural foods store.</li>
      <li>At the time I was suffering of back injury which had left me with intense pain in my lower back.</li>
      <li>get me wrong, the soap&#x27;s properties are nice.</li>
      <li>He has tried &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; over the years, from expensive high-end shampoos to your popular over-the-counter brands to home-remedies.</li>
      <li>The price of this project is well worth it compared to other brands and it lasts a very long time.</li>

<li> strongly recommend that you try this soap at least once and compare it to the other brand you use!!</li>
<li> but I also use it in the bath on my 2 year old that has EXTREME eczema!</li>
<li> Keep it in a closed soap box container to make it last</li>
<li> I use it on my face twice a day and feel like my complexion and skin reap the benefits of this well balanced handmade luxury soap that I choose to use instead of other high-priced facial cleansing products.</li>
<li> My son and I have struggled for years with eczema and dry skin.</li>
<li> The smell does go away once you are dry, but I&#x27;d rather not worry about it.  </li>
<li> You would think that with all the natural oils it contains it would be bad for oily skin, but I&#x27;ve found it leaves my skin squeaky clean and not at all greasy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, so this isn&#x27;t the best review to go by.  I got it because I have severe psoriasis and I&#x27;ve read that pine tar soap helps with this.  Two things I DON&#x27;T LIKE ABOUT IT: 1. It&#x27;s a bar of soap, not a pump, so it makes a mess wherever I store it, and 2. When you use it, it splatters brown tar all over your bathtub and tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have some &amp;#34;recipes&amp;#34;&#x27; to use it with magnesium and shea butter to make a better quality soap, if I ever get around to doing it.  I&#x27;m willing to put up with the &amp;#34;disadvantages&amp;#34; of using it if it will really help my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> We love this soap! My husband has a life-time history of dry,itchy,flaky scalp. He has tried &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; over the years, from expensive high-end shampoos to your popular over-the-counter brands to home-remedies. They all work for about a week or two, and then his condition continues. About 15 months ago, I received some samples of Kreamy Soap Pine Tar soap at a local store.We have been buying it and using it ever since. My husband was so excited and impressed with the results; he called the company and offered to be a spokesperson for them. We are sold. After 30 + years he finally found something that works. Don&#x27;t be turned off by the strong smokey scent; it does not linger on your body or hair. Thank You Kreamy Soaps for a great, natural, and locally-made quality product.-T.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  I have bought this soap several times for my mom who suffers from bad outbreaks of eczema.  She swears by this pine tar soap. It has cleared my mom&#x27;s skin right up! I have also personally used it to wash my face. .. it is gentle, non-drying,  and removes all makeup.  Tip: great to use as a shave cream!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. I have not only been using it on my face (IT HAS CLEARED UP MY SKIN!!!  And made my pores reduce in size!) but I also use it in the bath on my 2 year old that has EXTREME eczema! I feel that this is by far one of the best soaps on the market, and I reccomend it to ANYONE with problem skin!</li>
    <li> The best and only soap I can use. I have extremely sensitive skin that is allergic to both lye and fragrances. This soap is the one and ONLY soap I have ever used that doesnt make me breakout in hives. My go to for everything. I use it as a shampoo and body/face wash.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the Lemon Lavender soap, but I did buy the Pine Tar Olive Bar for my son that gets eczema. You&#x27;ve got to check out this soap! [...] the Best Ever! My skin felt like I had put lotion on after I dried off and I used it to shave and I will never buy shaving cream again! If you live in Southern California... They are at the Solana Beach Farmers&#x27; Market every Sunday from 1 to 5pm... some Saturdays at Kobey&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> A reasonably decent soap, but very over rated by its manufacturer.  Has little if any odor to it- unlike Grandpas Pine soap.  But It is just a soap- nothing more, nothing less.  Not at all worth $10.00!</li>
    <li> I loved the sample i got to try so i purchased some soap in stock :) very happy about that</li>
    <li> I love this soap, I use it mainly for my face but also for shaving. I&#x27;ve not used shaving cream since I found this product. Gives me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. If you try it just once you&#x27;ll love it. Yes its $10 a bar but really who cares if it works. I won&#x27;t be with out it. Just ordered 4 more bars.</li>
    <li> This amazing soap has been a godsend to my family. We all suffer from some sort of skin irritation and this soap has definitely been THE ONE to clear and soothe our skin.&lt;br /&gt;Please give this a try and you will see the difference! After we use the soap we apply a small amount of pure Jojoba oil to our face and body. This combination is pure goodness!!</li>
    <li> So I guess I had the expectation that &#x27;unscented&#x27; meant...well, no smell. But &#x27;Pine Tar&#x27; is pretty much what it smells like. Very piney and tarry. The bathroom will smell like a newly paved parking lot surrounded by pine trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the soap&#x27;s properties are nice. My skin feels great, it cleanses nicely, and even lasts a while given that it&#x27;s a hand crafted bar. But as a woman, smelling like a lumberjack just isn&#x27;t my cup of tea. Even if it&#x27;s a clean lumberjack.</li>
    <li> The best soap ever! I have been using this soap for 3years now. It is the only soap that I can use that I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to!</li>
    <li> Great medicinal soap for ddermatological conditions ranging from eczema to acne. My family and I have used it for years with great results.</li>
    <li> Great soap bar for skin conditions for most ages. (I would not use it on a baby/toddler).  However, this bar is amazing for clearing up your skin.  I have had eczema all my life and this bar really helps relieve the skin irritation and allows my skin to heal. Its like a miracle in soap form.&lt;br /&gt;I take it traveling with me as well. Keep it in a closed soap box container to make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is pricey, however the size is a little bigger than most soaps on the market.  I only wish they would provide a deeper discount for buying say 10 of these bars.</li>
    <li> This soap is the best.It leaves my skin soft, without drying it out!! I take my soap with me on trips! Once you use the medicinal tar soap, will never want to use any other soap!!! I really can&#x27;t say enough about it!!! Hugh thumbs up!👍</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other soap. Ten years ago, at a little outdoor farmer&#x27;s market in the high desert near Joshua Tree, I discovered Kat &amp; Brett&#x27;s delicious Kreamy Soaps. A decade later, I am faithful to this soap. I use it for my hair and body and neither has ever looked or felt healthier.</li>
    <li> my daily wash soap for some years now, excellent quality</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this soap one month ago at a local natural foods store. I have been using it twice a day in addition to my regular Proactiv products (the scrub, the toner, the lotion, and the mask), and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for approximately 6 months, and while I like it well enough, my skin always feels oily even after using the scrub. I&#x27;d been meaning to try one of Proactiv&#x27;s cleansers, but then I was given this and WOW, I love it. You would think that with all the natural oils it contains it would be bad for oily skin, but I&#x27;ve found it leaves my skin squeaky clean and not at all greasy. My skin is also much less shiny during the day. As for the smell, it&#x27;s exactly like that tea that&#x27;s roasted over pine, lapsang souchong. I can see why some people find the smell annoying, but I actually kind of like it. If you have oily skin, definitely give this bar a try. The bar may seem expensive, but it lasts a long time and contains quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> This soap is the only soap I trust! I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Great for every kind of skin condition, no more typical dryness as from other soaps. gentle, yet effective. Nice thick later also makes it great for shaving. I&#x27;ve used it for a shampoo and my hair is shiny and so soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kreamy Soaps for many years.  I use it on my face twice a day and feel like my complexion and skin reap the benefits of this well balanced handmade luxury soap that I choose to use instead of other high-priced facial cleansing products.

The price of this project is well worth it compared to other brands and it lasts a very long time. It is well worth your investment into your skin and complexion!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it in the shower and for shaving my legs as a shaving bar. When I use this soap it has an extremely soft, thick And moisturizing lather, which makes it nice and soft and soothing when I shave my legs and get no razor burns. When I have used other soaps I get razor burn or bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend that you try this soap at least once and compare it to the other brand you use!!</li>
    <li> This soap has really improved my husbands skin.  His psorioasis has calmed down considerably after only to baths.  He loves the way it makes him feel clean.  I am going to use the soap myself.</li>
    <li> Kreamy Soaps has been the only soap that I use for my face in years.  After battling skin problems most of my life, I am forever grateful for the healing properties of this medicinal soap that works  wonders.</li>
    <li> I first saw Kreamy Pine Tart Olive Bar Soaps about a 2 years ago in Solana Beach, CA at the local Farmers Market on a Sunday Afternoon. At the time I was suffering of back injury which had left me with intense pain in my lower back. Due to high dosage of pain medication for nearly a year, including epidural injections, the skin on my face and back suffered an intense break-up of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used just about every cream, face wash, shaving lotions, and meds for my face, but nothing worked. I still remember my conversation with the lady which told me, You can even try this soap on your hair...! (Lol.) I did owe this review to the Folks of Kreamy Soap from Fall Brook. and I&#x27;d like to thank them for this Magnificent Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The changes on my skin were immediate soon after I bought my first Kreamy Soap. It is very soothing without strong scents or odors, the longevity of this Soap it&#x27;s also amazing, I use it until I can barely hold it between the tip of my finger and my face. So, it makes it worth every penny. Within a month my face healed and I have never had another case of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this Soap for almost two years I have to say that there isn&#x27;t anything out there that can heal your skin in the way that this Soap does. My Wife also uses and she loves it too. I wish I could share my pictures and then you&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m referring to. I shave at least twice a week with this Soap. I wash my face twice a day, or at least I never skip washing my face before going to bed. I wash my body with this Soap at least twice a week. I know buy them off Amazon 3-4 soaps at time or occasionally on my visits down to San Diego County.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bar of soap as my primary face wash for nearly a year now.  It is gentle for everyday use, not drying at all.  It dissolves all my makeup and there is no lingering campfire smell.  However, I would not use this as a full body soap simply because I don&#x27;t want to smell like a campfire.  The smell does go away once you are dry, but I&#x27;d rather not worry about it.  It is a great and long-lasting soap.  Very gentle, but will sting your eyes, so be careful using this soap with children.</li>
