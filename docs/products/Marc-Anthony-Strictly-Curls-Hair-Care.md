      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>This is the best curl cream for the price.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;cons: best used with another styling product</li>
      <li>Excellent best product for curly hair</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>not as good as I thought!</li>
      <li>So it takes the frizz away so that you can see the curls and smells good too!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s at a great price point too.</li>
      <li>SO happy.</li>
      <li>It works great with my hair.  </li>
      <li>Nice feel in my hand, great scent....</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so glad I bumped into my Curl Envy at Duane Read that afternoon!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an especially great product because it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; have a lot of build up and the creme really makes your hair look healthy and</li>
      <li>Works nicely for my curls :))))</li>
      <li>This by far has been the best experience.</li>
      <li>I have very fine and curly hair.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many curl defining products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products to keep my curls defined without getting crunchy or crispy, I can&#x27;t even keep track of how many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love.</li>
      <li>Most of the styling products for curly hair that I&#x27;ve tried do define my curls</li>
      <li>A great tip is to twist individual sections around your finger for a more defined curl!</li>
      <li>It DID keep my curls looking pretty good throughout the day, and not crunchy looking in any way</li>
      <li>If you have very curly hair, 3B curls or more, this is probably a good product for you.</li>
      <li>This is a dream come true!</li>
      <li>at first I liked this product.  </li>
      <li>I love the bottle too-and it doesn&#x27;t smell too sweet and sugary.</li>
      <li>but I add deva curl light defining gel and a touch of deva curl foam to get the perfect soft big curl that I love.  </li>
      <li>I guess I can say that it gives my hair a smooth definition.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to see soft defined curls.  </li>
      <li>the reviewer that said they used it and at first it was fine,</li>
      <li>I was so pleasantly surprised, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to take a chance on an untried product that I had never heard anything about.</li>
      <li>I put it on my hair right after I wash it</li>
      <li>So I finally decided to give it a try, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how happy I actually was with this product.</li>
      <li>and I definitely notice my curls are more defined</li>
      <li>I REALLY wanted to like this!</li>
      <li>so so many different curl products in my life.  </li>
      <li>And major plus, is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my curls feeling crunchy (many many other hair products do).</li>
      <li>long lasting curls - mine will look good all day and even the next two days, just by adding more cream each morning.  </li>
      <li>the hair looks too shiny, not soft to the touch at all - and also most of them end up drying my hair even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc</li>
      <li>I find that Marc Anthony products works well and are reasonably priced</li>
      <li>and they absolutely stay longer when using this product.</li>
      <li>I use this cream after shampooing and it really defines the curls.  </li>
      <li>anyone with really curly hair should know that you don&#x27;t put your fingers through your hair.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how I would recommend using it to really get</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not crunchy like a gel/mousse, but gives definition better than other creams.</li>
      <li>I noticed in the other reviews, that the people who love this product described their hair as &amp;#34;very curly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
      <li>If left to its own will my hair will be all frizzy and dry.</li>
      <li>I love this on my very tight spiral curly hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy enough cream to do the trick for my hair, but I&#x27;ll be honest</li>
      <li>I just add a little big more to make  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft and not sticky.  </li>
      <li>After using healthier shampoos (no sulfates) for a while, I have discovered I have a lot of natural curl in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the curls defined and bouncy, soft and shiny, with no crispiness or crunchiness, which I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
      <li>It makes my curls shiny, soft, and defined.</li>
      <li>It keeps your hair SO soft.</li>
      <li>I just recently cut my very long hair into slightly longer than shoulder length with layers to bring out more of the curl.  </li>
      <li>Strictly Curls Curl Envy not only defines my curls and makes them look very natural, but they also look and feel moisturized.</li>
      <li>It was marked &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; when I bought it, but it had obviously been opened and re-taped...with packaging tape...</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this to others with naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I normally just style it different for the next two days.</li>
      <li>pros: lightweight, inexpensive, a little goes a long ways, slightly tames frizzes, smells nice</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a whole bunch like you do with other products.</li>
      <li>really just wish it came in a bigger size since it doesn&#x27;t last me very long!</li>

<li> left my hair feeling strangely sticky....</li>
<li> It smells like lemons and a tiny bit goes a long, long way.  </li>
<li> I keep trying other curl creams but keep going back to this one.</li>
<li> I broke out in little white head zits all over my face and neck and back.  </li>
<li> (part bangs and scrunch hair to bring out curls) and let dry.  </li>
<li> Works in a humid climate and dry climate.</li>
<li> and I either let it dry naturaly (during summer) or use a diffuser to blow it dry (if the weather is colder).</li>
<li> By the second day you may need to add moisture and a little bit of cream leave in conditioner works for me.</li>
<li> I put a little big of detangling conditioner and that&#x27;s it.</li>
<li> I then style my hair while wet</li>
<li> I got this in the mail last week (faster than expected, too), and it just sat on my counter for a few days because I didn&#x27;t have any expectations whatsoever.</li>
<li> I have very thick, very curly, very long hair (I&#x27;m half black, half white) and have so</li>
<li> I can usually go 3-4 days without shampooing and just spritzing with water to bring back the curl every morning.  </li>
<li> I combed it through my hair in the morning and even took small sections and took the time to twist them individually</li>
<li> I was a little nervous at the label stating it was for course dry hair when my hair was neither.  </li>
<li> And if I ever feel my hair a little frizzy or dry during the day, I use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls D-</li>
<li> But I worked a little bit through my wet hair and crossed my fingers.  </li>
<li> bought this to try to find a cheaper alternative to AVEDA Curl Enhancer, but I think it just weighs the curls down.  </li>
<li> and if I lay down and my hair get messy what I do</li>
<li> If you get your curls in place, you touch them as little as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Frizz Serum to give it a little</li>
<li> but after my hair dried, if I touched it, it felt sticky, not strong-gel sticky</li>
<li> I also add Moroccan oil for shine,  because I have highlighted hair and its slightly dull.</li>
<li> I use this as a base because it leaves my 3a curls very soft</li>
<li> This stuff works and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greesy or hard!  </li>
<li> I was a longtime faithful Aveda customer, but got tired of spending an arm and a leg on hair products.</li>
<li> I was so skeptical of trying something else, because nothing seems to hold my curls together and keep them from falling out.</li>
<li> the cream itself didn&#x27;t feel sticky or bad in any way...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have wavy-to-curly frizzy hair and this product is a life saver!  It&#x27;s not crunchy like a gel/mousse, but gives definition better than other creams.</li>
    <li> I was a longtime faithful Aveda customer, but got tired of spending an arm and a leg on hair products. I looked up reviews for curl creams and found this one. It works as well as Aveda. It&#x27;s even lighter, but gives the desired texture.</li>
    <li> at first I liked this product.  My hair looked silky and curly, but if i ever put my fingers through my hair, it would start to frizz, even with the product on it.  I combed it through my hair in the morning and even took small sections and took the time to twist them individually and the product always faded out by the end of the day and I was in a ponytail!!</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to like this! Looking for an alternative for regular gel for my curly hair...well this just does Not do the trick for me. Nice feel in my hand, great scent....left my hair feeling strangely sticky....the cream itself didn&#x27;t feel sticky or bad in any way...but after my hair dried, if I touched it, it felt sticky, not strong-gel sticky but like I had a LOT of product on my hair. It DID keep my curls looking pretty good throughout the day, and not crunchy looking in any way (like some gels can do)....I just do NOT like the feel of my hair at all. NO advantage over my regular gel, might try it as a late-day touch up for frizzies but again, that sticky feeling, ugh.....</li>
    <li> I have 2C curls, so depending on the humidity, I could have wavy hair or I could have curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to try to find a cheaper alternative to AVEDA Curl Enhancer, but I think it just weighs the curls down.  It didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I noticed in the other reviews, that the people who love this product described their hair as &amp;#34;very curly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  If you have very curly hair, 3B curls or more, this is probably a good product for you.</li>
    <li> My daughter used this and didn&#x27;t like the smell, however, it did work.</li>
    <li> This is the best curl cream for the price.  It leaves my hair soft and not sticky.  I keep trying other curl creams but keep going back to this one.</li>
    <li> I love this on my very tight spiral curly hair.  It leaves the curls defined and bouncy, soft and shiny, with no crispiness or crunchiness, which I can&#x27;t stand.  I don&#x27;t want to look like I came out of the Playdough hair salon...I like my hair to move.  It smells like lemons and a tiny bit goes a long, long way.  LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and swears by it. He has curly shirt hair. It helps the curl hold its shape without looking crunchy. Works in a humid climate and dry climate.</li>
    <li> Threw away all my rollers! This is the only product I need to style my hair!</li>
    <li> This is a dream come true! It makes my curls shiny, soft, and defined. I do put a coat of gel over it, but now that I have tried this product I would like to combine it with another one to skip the gel part. Anyone have suggestions? It is a very big challenge to get my hair to look great-and this product has done the trick. I want to buy it in bulk. I love the bottle too-and it doesn&#x27;t smell too sweet and sugary. It&#x27;s at a great price point too. Love Love Love.</li>
    <li> not as good as I thought!</li>
    <li> I have very fine and curly hair. If left to its own will my hair will be all frizzy and dry. Most of the styling products for curly hair that I&#x27;ve tried do define my curls but they always leave them with that \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; look - the hair looks too shiny, not soft to the touch at all - and also most of them end up drying my hair even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marc Anthony Strictly Curls Curl Envy not only defines my curls and makes them look very natural, but they also look and feel moisturized. I guess I can say that it gives my hair a smooth definition. I put it on my hair right after I wash it and I either let it dry naturaly (during summer) or use a diffuser to blow it dry (if the weather is colder). It never disappoints me. And if I ever feel my hair a little frizzy or dry during the day, I use Marc Anthony Strictly Curls D-Frizz Serum to give it a little boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bumped into my Curl Envy at Duane Read that afternoon!</li>
    <li> This stuff works and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greesy or hard!  I love it!</li>
    <li> pros: lightweight, inexpensive, a little goes a long ways, slightly tames frizzes, smells nice&lt;br /&gt;cons: best used with another styling product</li>
    <li> After using healthier shampoos (no sulfates) for a while, I have discovered I have a lot of natural curl in my hair.  I just recently cut my very long hair into slightly longer than shoulder length with layers to bring out more of the curl.  I use this cream after shampooing and it really defines the curls.  I was a little nervous at the label stating it was for course dry hair when my hair was neither.  But I worked a little bit through my wet hair and crossed my fingers.  I was delighted to see soft defined curls.  Now my routine is:  I shampoo my my hair in the evening and in the morning I use a spray bottle with water to dampen my hair and I work about a dime to nickle size of the product through my hair and comb.  I then style my hair while wet (part bangs and scrunch hair to bring out curls) and let dry.  It defines the curls and keeps away the frizz. I can usually go 3-4 days without shampooing and just spritzing with water to bring back the curl every morning.  This product is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very curly, very long hair (I&#x27;m half black, half white) and have so so so many different curl products in my life.  I discovered this product maybe 2-3 years ago and use it religiously ever since.  I am always having people ask me what I use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy enough cream to do the trick for my hair, but I&#x27;ll be honest, I use a lot of it and coat my hair in sections.  That&#x27;s how I would recommend using it to really get long lasting curls - mine will look good all day and even the next two days, just by adding more cream each morning.  It&#x27;s an especially great product because it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; have a lot of build up and the creme really makes your hair look healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the reviewer that said they used it and at first it was fine, but then they tried putting their fingers through their hair and it got frizzy....anyone with really curly hair should know that you don&#x27;t put your fingers through your hair.  You just don&#x27;t, or the curls separate and you get frizz.  If you get your curls in place, you touch them as little as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really just wish it came in a bigger size since it doesn&#x27;t last me very long!</li>
    <li> Works nicely for my curls :))))</li>
    <li> Excellent best product for curly hair</li>
    <li> This does not provide a lot of hold, but does help to define your curls. Don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> was looking for a cheaper alternative to wax works. this product separated the curls but my hair felt sticky and did not do well on day 2</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I use it with the shampoo and conditioner, and hair lotion. You don&#x27;t have to use a whole bunch like you do with other products. And major plus, is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my curls feeling crunchy (many many other hair products do). So it takes the frizz away so that you can see the curls and smells good too! I definitely recommend this to others with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gross after the day is over. Lightweight formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many curl defining products. This by far has been the best experience. My hair finally curls and maintains the curl for about 3 days. By the second day you may need to add moisture and a little bit of cream leave in conditioner works for me. I normally just style it different for the next two days. A great tip is to twist individual sections around your finger for a more defined curl! Good luck!</li>
    <li> It does the job I just add a little big more to make  it last longer, I use almost every day and if I lay down and my hair get messy what I do I put a little big of detangling conditioner and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works great with my hair.  The only reason it received 3 stars is because of the packaging.  It was marked &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; when I bought it, but it had obviously been opened and re-taped...with packaging tape...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to keep my curls defined without getting crunchy or crispy, I can&#x27;t even keep track of how many I&#x27;ve tried. I was so skeptical of trying something else, because nothing seems to hold my curls together and keep them from falling out. I got this in the mail last week (faster than expected, too), and it just sat on my counter for a few days because I didn&#x27;t have any expectations whatsoever. So I finally decided to give it a try, and I couldn&#x27;t believe how happy I actually was with this product. It keeps your hair SO soft. Not a bit crispy or crunchy, and I definitely notice my curls are more defined and they absolutely stay longer when using this product. I won&#x27;t use anything else now. I was so pleasantly surprised, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to take a chance on an untried product that I had never heard anything about. SO happy.</li>
    <li> I use this as a base because it leaves my 3a curls very soft but I add deva curl light defining gel and a touch of deva curl foam to get the perfect soft big curl that I love.  I also add Moroccan oil for shine,  because I have highlighted hair and its slightly dull.</li>
    <li> I broke out in little white head zits all over my face and neck and back.  Something in it caused a reaction.</li>
    <li> I find that Marc Anthony products works well and are reasonably priced</li>
</ol>
