<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, smells amazing, scent lasts, my girl loves to smell it on me</li>
    <li> Super Fast Shipping !! Smells Amazing !!! Thank you 😁</li>
    <li> It is as it says in the description, I&#x27;ll soon be making deal with you again. 100% recommended</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Recently sampled a tester and couldn&#x27;t stand the fragrance, almost seemed to give me a headache. Rather pleasant citrus, leather, and cedar notes but something horribly synthetic about the smell lingers on your skin after the initial fragrances dies. A test of how synthetic this is the difficulty in washing this fragrance off your skin. Stick with natural fragrances like Versace Pour Homme.</li>
    <li> Not authentic product - this is a replica</li>
    <li> I really liked this scent in the store where I tried it before i purchased on Amazon. the wife is strange where she will tell me she loves it on me and month later (sometime at &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; time and sometimes not....I hear I don&#x27;t like that cologne on you anymore....</li>
    <li> Great scent. This is my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Very impressed! Did not expect the extra bottle and samples. Thank You So Much!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, clean. Shipping took little longer than anticipated but came on estimated date. Big bottle. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> the perfume i recieve was in a crack bottle so the perfume get leaked so plz refund me my money back</li>
    <li> If you want to smell of tulips and daisies, this isn&#x27;t your fragrance.  If you want to smell like a man, and have ladies flock after you, buy Zegna.  Discovered this beauty while cruising in Europe.  Didn&#x27;t feel like spending cruise-ship prices so I came here to Amazon and got it on the cheap.  Love it!  My mother is very sensitive to fragrances too and this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her!</li>
    <li> Love the cologne! I&#x27;ve received many compliments. I use it often because it really soft. I don&#x27;t feel like it lasts on me very long but I&#x27;ve have people tell me they can smell it even after a night out in the club. I would highly recommend it. You will love it.</li>
    <li> I had originally noticed this scent on one of my customers at work and I loved it but was too shy to ask him what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, being the resourceful gal that I am, the next time I was at a fragrance counter I sniffed around until I found it and brought home a sample for my picky husband. Now I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the actual cologne that he loves or just my enthusiasm but either way, we are both happy campers!</li>
    <li> it smells really nice and it lasts long (at least i think it does) i would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I just love this cologne.</li>
    <li> I bought this without testing the product and was not dissapointed.  Zegna has a great fragrance that isnt overpowering. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scents I&#x27;ve ever wore. It draws you in and adds that mysterious factor about you. Women smelled this on me and wondered what else I had packing! Its very sweet almost citrus like scent. It could be a little stronger though in terms of projection and longer lasting.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Casual, not strong so I can use daily! At day or night! In any occasion! A good purchase</li>
    <li> the scent is wonderful, my husband loves it, I think it&#x27;s a good gift for someone you love near you</li>
    <li> no words...so good so good so good</li>
    <li> 👎👎  way too strong smelling.... wouldn&#x27;t buy again !</li>
    <li> Excellent splash perfume</li>
    <li> This. Cologne. Is. Awesome. I had originally smelled Ermenegildo Zegna Uomo in a sample from an order from Fragrancenet, so, naturally I&#x27;m all like &amp;#34;You&#x27;re killing me Fragrancenet...&amp;#34; and had to own that one as well as I immediately loved the scent. Uomo is fresh and elegant. I am happy to say I found my signature fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uomo by Ermenegildo Zegna is a relatively new fragrance. It was launched in the spring of 2013 so it&#x27;s only been on the market for a year or so. The notes consist of citruses and bergamot accompanied by accords of Violettyne Captive –violet leaf essence. There are also some woody notes of cedar and vetiver. The result is a clean scent that is very appropriate for the office, casual settings, I&#x27;d even say this could be worn on romantic occasions such as a date. The notes in the cologne make this one lean more towards summer and spring for seasons, but, as I&#x27;ve always said if you smell nice you smell nice. I will probably wear this one year round, haters gonna hate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will say Uomo is fairly linear and really doesn’t make any new strides as far as scent goes. It will smell exactly the same when it dries down as it does upon application. Some cologne connisuers will probably be disappointed by this as the expectation is for the base notes to come through and change the cologne’s overall tone. To me though, with so many colognes out there it’s tough to be truly unique and frankly, I like how this one is a little linear, I love this scent for the opening so the fact it stays that way is a plus; it’s probably because I enjoy bergamot fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection and silage are fantastic though that could be because this one happens to work well with my skin. I sprayed some on my neck this morning around 10:00. A couple hours later I can still smell it. Granted it hasn’t been too long, but I predict it will last around five hours which for me is fine. I got the 3.4 ounce cologne for half the price with Amazon points so I am in no position to complain. For most, I would expect four to five hours out of this perhaps more depending on your skin and body chemistry; just like any other cologne. If you have the right skin even a ten buck cheapie can be a powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uomo is an excellent purchase for a safe, masculine and sensual cologne. I would go so far as to say you could blind buy this. I got mine from DiscountPerfumes and, despite the horror stories of fakes, this bottle is completely genuine so if you do business with them you will get a legitimate product! Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 5/15/2015 - I&#x27;ve been dating a lot of women in the past few months and now have a lady, but through that time Zegna Uomo was a huge hit. HUGE. The ladies seem to love this one and it&#x27;s my girlfriend&#x27;s personal favorite (and mine too). This cologne of the 20 or so I own gets the compliments. Buy this one gentlemen, trust me it&#x27;s worth the money.nts so I am in no position to complain.

    <li> My boyfriend loves it! I am really attracted by its scent when he is wearing it. Great scent and last long!</li>
    <li> Turns out I&#x27;m sensitive to this scent.</li>
    <li> Bought a sampler about a month ago &amp; immediately fell in love with this cologne! The girls at my work love this fragrance! Ordered from Perfumesworld fast shipping! I got my order in three days!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, I get lots of complements.</li>
    <li> I Love it! Great smell!</li>
    <li> A gift for a friend. Classic, clean scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff smell great on my husband.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think its real cologne . Ive brought this same cologne from macys and really like it. But this one the scent fades quicky not supposed to do that. Feel like I was scammed</li>
    <li> Girls love the smell!</li>
    <li> The perfume met my husband&#x27;s expectation. It lingers but not extensively. We have reserved the 5th star for Uomo Absolute.</li>
    <li> My Darling Husband loves this wonderful scent, but I have to admit it is heavenly to smell this scent on him!</li>
    <li> This was one of the three colognes I bought to compliment a more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; look in my life. I love the scent, and have received plenty of compliments due to it. I look forward to buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Walmart &amp; fragrance rebel.com release the same fragrance @ your local Wally&#x27;s World called Bod man Midnight Reign for 8$ or less with much more lasting power! i use Tom apricot deodarant &amp; spay Bod man Midnight Reign underarms shirt &amp; it last all day long, &amp; folks be looking for whos wearing that, but cant tell thats me cause they judge by appearance, like The Most High create man so he can go shave, if thats so, He would made all of us, women wearing women perfume, right? With that being said, dont waste your money on Uomo cause its Elmo from Sesame Street or dates from Sunsweet, because Sun-Maid dates are sweeter, cheaper &amp; less sugar! Point Made!</li>
    <li> This is a very good cologne for a decent price that will be guaranteed to get you noticed favorably. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This new fragrance smells great!  the packaging is nice and sleek and matches the experience of what you expect from Zegna.  It is a fantastic gift</li>
    <li> smell excelent my sons are used  they are so happy with womo perfume*</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of samples looking for a new scent to use regularly. This was my favorite of the bunch and also just happens to be pretty reasonably priced. GREAT smelling stuff.</li>
    <li> I wish you have some samples you can send so I can make a choice of what I would like to buy next.&lt;br /&gt;The Uomo, was good,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Rodney</li>
    <li> Great!! Fresh clean scent!! It reminds me of polo green..</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriend and, we both love it!!!  Very hot and appealing, if you know what I mean...</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Expensive, memorable , sexy smell. I love when my hubby walks by me wearing it.  It won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> Reasonable, people always asking, &amp;#34;what are you wearing&#x27;&amp;#34; smells good!</li>
    <li> The cologne is a wonderful scent for my husband!! He loves it!!</li>
    <li> We tried this fragrance initially from a &#x27;paper tester&#x27; in a sales mag, loved it, had to have it - love the aroma on my man!</li>
    <li> The item came fast and also came with a bonus bottle. I was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Bought as an anniversary gift for my man!  He loves it as do I! It is a nice modern scent without being too unisex. Definitely recommend this for any man.</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift, was suggested by the receiver.&lt;br /&gt;It is  a favorite of his, so am sure it was well received.&lt;br /&gt;Saw it in a store and loved the smell.</li>
    <li> This product gets a 5 STAR RATING.  I purchased this product on January 26, 2015, it arrived on January 28, 2015.  Great price for the size of cologne.  It smells fantastics.  Thank you for your professional service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vickie A.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents I actually got a sample when I bought some Versace elsewhere and got hooked.  Get a lot of compliments from it and Versace.</li>
    <li> Definitely my favorite calogne to date.  I received several samples of this calogne earlier this year, and once they were all emptied, I decided that it was necessary for me to make a purchase.  The item arrived as expected, and the fragrance was just as good as it was in the samples.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s fragrance is a favorite for both my husband and myself.  The quality, quantity, and quick delivery were outstanding, and we will reorder from this vendor.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband and it has a great aroma that lasts all day long. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The scent is quite good. It has that masculine smell that&#x27;s kind of woodsy that I like, but my only thing is it doesn&#x27;t last very long. However the bottle is really big,  And will last for quite some time.</li>
    <li> This cologne is good stuff. Not groundbreaking by any means, but it smells very good, above average projection and average longevity.</li>
    <li> My husband smells amazing in this!</li>
    <li> This is a very great smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> The product smell like a horrible knock off of the cologne .  i am completely disappointed they even attempt to sell this&lt;br /&gt;product and that i can not get my money back.</li>
    <li> Nice For summer. Very light at least Over my skin</li>
    <li> The product is really wonderful. The container is classy. The fragrance is perfect for me and the savings via Amazon was amazing.</li>
    <li> This. Cologne. Is. Awesome. I had originally smelled Ermenegildo Zegna Uomo in a sample from an order from Fragrancenet, so, naturally I&#x27;m all like &amp;#34;You&#x27;re killing me Fragrancenet...&amp;#34; and had to own that one as well as I immediately loved the scent. Uomo is fresh and elegant. I am happy to say I found my signature fragrance!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my nephew... he loves it... now I&#x27;m the greatest uncle ever.</li>
    <li> Really lasts and was an exceptional value for it&#x27;s size. Fragrance is very nice.</li>
