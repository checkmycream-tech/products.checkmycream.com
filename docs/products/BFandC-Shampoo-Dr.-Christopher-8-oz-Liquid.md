      <li>Very nice product...and clean.  </li>
      <li>No harsh unpronounceable chemicals, performs great, spicy scent is great, used with BF&amp;C Conditioner scalp sores</li>
      <li>This bothered me greatly when I first started to use it</li>
      <li>otherwise love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and the conditioner too.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that I can get such good results without harmful substances!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel strong and look healthy.</li>
      <li>Many natural products/solutions (even &#x27;no poo&#x27; solutions) gave me danduruff, but not this product - love it!!</li>
      <li>I love all of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products, so I was excited to see their shampoo and conditioner on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Also made it so fine</li>
      <li>Cleans well in a not so lathery way, which is fine.</li>
      <li>Sukin from New Zealand is better and quite honestly I used Wen today</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important to let it remain in the hair for a couple of minutes</li>
      <li>but it does leave my hair smelling good and feeling soft.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t do anything particularly special with my hair, but had a pleasing aroma and did  its job.</li>
      <li>If you like a full on lather, don&#x27;t buy this product.  </li>
      <li>It does not lather, as others have said, but most products with a good lather use a harsh chemical to get the product that way.</li>
      <li>lives my hair very soft and clean without the harmful chemicals that most of the shampoos have.</li>
      <li>And I am happy that it is not full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Larger bottles would be nice.</li>
      <li>It might seem pricy, but so worth it.</li>
      <li>I have struggled to find a good, fully natural product that doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;fragrance&#x27; (code for mystery chemicals) and actually works for almost 2 years now.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it there was no foam</li>
      <li>only inconvenience is that I have to use about 2-3 times more than the others.</li>
      <li>I like the shampoo, but this is too much work for me!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a large volume of suds, but it does clean well and leaves my hair very soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
      <li>first I make sure my scalp is really wet</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s BF&amp;C Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I really do like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Very hesitant to purchase this</li>
      <li>but I have now come to really like this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>makes nice fluffy foam this way.</li>
      <li>If instead you want something all natural and better for your scalp then the commercial brands, this one is for you.</li>
      <li>For those concerned about no lather, a thorough rinse and second application will provide plenty of lather resulting in squeaky clean hair.  </li>
      <li>This worked and stopped it with 1 wash!I&#x27;m buying a second bottle right now!</li>
      <li>Then I rinse and do it again with a little more product.  </li>
      <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt soft, and was very manageable.  </li>
      <li>I normally leave it in my hair for a bit before I rinse and apply the conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I like most of Dr C&#x27;s products but not sure about this one.  </li>
      <li>but I love the tooth powder and several other Dr. Christopher products so decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>Ditto for the second shampoo but by the third shampoo my hair was squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t want to strip the natural oils.  </li>
      <li>It really does clean well, but not too well if you know what I mean.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is full of amazing herbs and nothing bad for you.</li>
      <li>I have recently replaced my baby&#x27;s shampoo with this stuff(not for purpose of growing but as a safe alternative to the shampoo with chemicals) as usual</li>
      <li>seriously, seems like shampoos are ubiquitously either full of the most toxic chemicals for yr head of all places, or they&#x27;re so watered down and not containing anything of value (like the good herbs in this one - same as how dr christopher herbs are one of the few companies that actually works/contains value, from what I&#x27;ve seen at least)</li>
      <li>a lot of natural shampoos have alcohol as a second ingredient.</li>
      <li>get your hair really soaking wet, apply some shampoo and then run shower over your hair for a second, then it will be easier to spread the shampoo around.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No harsh unpronounceable chemicals, performs great, spicy scent is great, used with BF&amp;C Conditioner scalp sores have gone away.  For those concerned about no lather, a thorough rinse and second application will provide plenty of lather resulting in squeaky clean hair.  This shampoo is NOT a detergent.  Larger bottles would be nice.</li>
    <li> smells great. didn&#x27;t do anything particularly special with my hair, but had a pleasing aroma and did  its job.</li>
    <li> My hair looks very good :) Thank you</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s BF&amp;C Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. It is kinda spendy for only 8oz but it does leave my hair smelling good and feeling soft. I like that the ingredients are words I can actually pronounce! I won&#x27;t be using this as my every day shampoo though but ONLY because of the cost.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and the conditioner too. Makes my hair feel strong and look healthy. Dr Christopher - amazing herbalist.</li>
    <li> a lot of natural shampoos have alcohol as a second ingredient. no thanks. read these ingredients-simply amazing. get your hair really soaking wet, apply some shampoo and then run shower over your hair for a second, then it will be easier to spread the shampoo around. makes nice fluffy foam this way. smells like juicy fruits gum.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years.  I love it.  The only cleansers in the product are aloe vera and coconut oil with several essential oils added...that&#x27;s it.  Smells great too.  It does not lather which is a good thing.  Detergents lather which damage the hair and scalp.  I have long red curly hair, almost to my waist.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for the conditioner and it is the same for the shampoo.  Ended up giving my son the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Between this and the scalp oil I started loosing my hair.  Also made it so fine I couldn&#x27;t hardly style it.</li>
    <li> otherwise love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;are there any other brands i could trust for a shampoo besides dr christopher? seriously, seems like shampoos are ubiquitously either full of the most toxic chemicals for yr head of all places, or they&#x27;re so watered down and not containing anything of value (like the good herbs in this one - same as how dr christopher herbs are one of the few companies that actually works/contains value, from what I&#x27;ve seen at least)</li>

    <li> I like most of Dr C&#x27;s products but not sure about this one.  I do not believe with all of these &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients, no sulphates or harsh detergents that it should lather the way it does.  I am losing tons of hair just trying to comb through the messy hair afterwards. If I don&#x27;t use a cream rinse then I cannot get through my hair.so where are all these oils ?? Sukin from New Zealand is better and quite honestly I used Wen today and I did not have to fight the comb through and did not lose hair.  Other people say it did not lather, description says it does....so maybe different for each person.</li>
    <li> My favorite, chemical-free shampoo of ALL times!! Leaves my hair manageable with a healthy sheen! Follow with conditioner for best results.</li>

It&#x27;s nice to know that I can get such good results without harmful substances! It smells nice too!</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to this product.  There is almost no lather when using this shampoo.  This bothered me greatly when I first started to use it but I have now come to really like this shampoo.  I normally leave it in my hair for a bit before I rinse and apply the conditioner.  If you like a full on lather, don&#x27;t buy this product.  If instead you want something all natural and better for your scalp then the commercial brands, this one is for you.</li>

    <li> This shampoo smells nice and makes my hair feel good, but it does not lather.  I was expecting this, but thought I could still make it happen.  I wash my hair every 2-3 days as it is curly and I don&#x27;t want to strip the natural oils.  The shampoo seems like it soaks in to my scalp and there is nothing left to actually wash my hair with.  I actually wash twice with it, first I make sure my scalp is really wet and I only put a little bit on my fingertips and rub it around my scalp in various sections.  Then I rinse and do it again with a little more product.  The second time around, it does lather up a little bit, and I feel then like it&#x27;s doing the job.  I like the shampoo, but this is too much work for me!  It takes a long time to do all those steps in the shower.  I&#x27;m back to using baking soda/water/rosemary essential oil as my shampoo, and am still using the Dr. C&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great!  Best on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried so many and this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with.... It really does clean well, but not too well if you know what I mean.  Very nice product...and clean.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my flaking itchy scalp! This worked and stopped it with 1 wash!I&#x27;m buying a second bottle right now! Amazing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has changed my hair.  It&#x27;s softer and shinier.</li>
    <li> Very hesitant to purchase this but I love the tooth powder and several other Dr. Christopher products so decided to give it a try.  It truly is good for your hair.  The first time I used it there was no foam and i washed my hair a second time.  Ditto for the second shampoo but by the third shampoo my hair was squeaky clean.  Feels good and I can&#x27;t say that my hair has quit falling out totally but it has reduced the amount of hair that is falling out.  It seems to be helping with that issue.  And I am happy that it is not full of chemicals.</li>
