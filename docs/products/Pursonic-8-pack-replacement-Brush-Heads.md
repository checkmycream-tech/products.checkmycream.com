<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Price is a little high, but in comparison meets market average</li>
    <li> Yes, the replacement heads appear to be the same heads that originally came with my Pursonic toothbrush.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Used with a Diamond Electronic toothbrush, fits perfect and works great.</li>
    <li> I have the diamond toothbrush and their replacement heads are way too expensive. Thanks to other reviews, I chose these and they work perfectly with my toothbrush and for a much better price.</li>
    <li> Great Deal! These replacements are just like the originals. And, delivery was extremely fast.</li>
    <li> although I wish the tooth brush heads were less costly, I was very glad to have been able to find them on Amazon because all of mine had been used and thrown away. They fit the tooth brush perfectly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I bought these as replacements for my Diamond Toothbrush.  Much less expensive and they seem to be the same.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this toothbrush. Ever since I bought the Pursonic I don&#x27;t have to worry about toothbrushes. The Pursonic works just as well as the more expensive brand of electric toothbrushes. I have great checkups. No need to spend a lot of money to get good results.</li>
    <li> Liked the price, good value for the price paid. I would buy this item again for the price paid today</li>
    <li> works just as well as the original OEM.</li>
    <li> The picture of the brushes is not exactly what was received. I received four little baggies with two brushes in each. That said, the brushes work great on my Diamond toothbrush. I would recommend that anybody that needs new brush heads for the Diamond toothbrush buy these instead of buying them from Bling.</li>
    <li> Better deal price wise vs. Blink product but the price for greater quantity is a bit less in long term use (Bristles) and a bit less secure attachment to Sonic Unit. Not a big deal but worth noting.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Everything good.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product. I purchased my Pursonic toothbrush set elsewhere and am glad I can get the replacement toothbrushes thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> Received the package in good order. Checked that it fits my Diamond Bling toothbrush - it does. And it is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Perfect match and are working great</li>
    <li> I have a diamond ultra toothbrush and these replacement heads fit perfectly. I will definitely purchase these as long as my toothbrush works.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace the heads on my Bing Dental toothbrush but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money they were asking for their replacement heads. Found these for much cheaper and they are a perfect fit. Set for the year now!</li>
    <li> Love the price of the tooth brushes. Great product will buy again.Eight brushes for 24.00 is a better than three for the same price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the pursonic system for over a year bnIt has 3 levels of cleaning and the dentist is excited to see me every time! My gums are no longer painful or bleeding. Terriffic product!</li>
    <li> Same quality as the ones that came as oem with the Diamond Elite. I&#x27;d recommend to family and or friends.</li>
    <li> I have a Diamond electric tooth brush, and the heads were very expensive. I was reading and these looked the same and people said it was, so I bought it.  The heads are fine, and I am sure they are the exact same for a lot less. Buy it!</li>
    <li> These were a really good price on refills for my toothbrush. Should last quite awhile even with two people using them.</li>
    <li> After using the Sonic for several years, we switched to this.  Much less expensive and the product works great.  Plan to use for many more years.</li>
    <li> I read another reviewers recommendation so I decided to try it .  Fit&#x27;s my model perfectly.  Thank You for the recommendation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple,- the product is every bit as good as the more expensive one.  And the cost difference is a mile long.  I see NO difference between the Pursonic and the Bling, except, again, for the cost.</li>
    <li> Good brush heads and way cheaper than the brand name. They seem to hold up well, too. I Love them!</li>
    <li> I bought these on a chance that it may not fit my Diamond Ultrasonic Toothbrush (Bling Dental). However they do! They fit perfectly and cost less! You get 8 replacements here for the same price as getting only 3 for the Bling Dental specific ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine and feels the same. I highly recommend getting this!</li>
    <li> the brushes fit perfectly...I&#x27;m thrilled</li>
    <li> I have a Bling Dental Diamond Sonic Toothbrush. Model # RST2031. These fit perfectly and saved me tons of money!</li>
    <li> Great item, delivered on time as said on invoice</li>
    <li> If you have the older model of the pursonic (S400) these will fit.  Hard to find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Fits my diamond ultrasonic base perfectly.. Very glad that I found these!!</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit my toothbrush almost perfectly, the fit is a little tight but for the price I&#x27;m not complaining</li>
    <li> Great I am going to order another set. They work on my diamond toothbrush and are a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> The brushes fit perfectly!  They arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> very happy...exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> I ordered for replacements for my pursonic. They cost alot, just for Eight brushes. I could of ordered a brand new toothbrush and received 12 brushes. I paid $7.99 for shipping and handling. They sent it by fed ex. The post office would of been much cheaper. Eight brushes cost me around $24.00.</li>
    <li> Both the Diamond toothbrush and Pursonic replacement brush heads are working fine!</li>
    <li> Stumbled upon these, here on Amazon. These are as good a brushes as the ones that Dr.Bling sold for 2x&#x27;s the price. I don&#x27;t see any difference in quality, and while the price is great. I can change the brushes more frequently, thus getting better cleaning for my money. Yes I would recommend these to anybody who wants to get away from Dr.Bling&#x27;s ripoff.</li>
    <li> I needed some replacement heads and glad I found them. Pursonic is a good alternative to the higher priced sonic toothbrushes out there. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and exactly what I needed.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these replacement heads for the [[ASIN:B008RYTAD4 Diamond Ultrasonic Toothbrush with UV Sanitizer]]. I was unhappy with how expensive Bling Dental&#x27;s replacement heads were so set out to find a suitable substitute. The Pursonic toothbrush looked very similar and I was happy to find that their replacement heads are interchangeable with the Pursonic heads being drastically cheaper. Works just as well as the Bling Dental heads. As for these particular replacement toothbrush heads, they have performed as expected, no falling apart and functioning as expected. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Fast arrival. Works with my Diamond toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The Pursonic 8 pack replacement brush heads work perfectly with my Diamond Ultrasonic toothbrush.  Thank you so much for offering this alternative!</li>
    <li> Good deal for these brush heads which work with Diamond electric toothbrushes. I&#x27;ll use this service again.</li>
    <li> great deal and will have plenty of replacements- so far thaey are holding up well! The handle comes with some so I am set</li>
    <li> I had Sonicare for years . Was tired to pay so much for there toothbrush .. Gave this a try ...and sooo happy . My teeth look whiter , and it gentle on the gum line .. Sonicare can be harsh on the gum line .. Been using that for over 6 month ..and love it . Highly recommended !!!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush...glad amazon hsn said refills</li>
    <li> Just what I was searching for and finally found!</li>
    <li> Love these brush heads for our Pursonic. They come is many colors so everyone in the family can use a different color. This brush is the ultimate because you get the freshness in your mouth as if you have been to the dentist! It does not get any better than this!</li>
    <li> Quick service, much better price for our Diamond Sonic toothbrush.  So happy I saw that another customer had discovered these when I was trying to find replacement heads that weren&#x27;t so pricey and wore out so soon.  Hopefully these will keep their shape longer!</li>
    <li> Great deal. Great product. Great service.</li>
    <li> Pursonic Toothbrush heads:They fit great and at a lot better price than from Diamond! Very happy with them! I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I was looking for replacement heads for my diamond ultra sonic tooth brush.. anyway, I read someone review and mentioned he too was looking for replacement for the same brand, so I went for it.. Fits like a glove and cost a lot less then diamonds (I&#x27;m not sure why they cost so much)  I think I may be giving away a secret..</li>
    <li> Works great with my Diamond toothbrush and so much cheaper than the ones they sell. So glad these are available.</li>
    <li> These fit my Diamond toothbrush perfectly at 1/3 the price :)</li>
    <li> Got these for my Diamond electric toothbrush and they work great but I do find they wear quickly... but so did the Diamond&#x27;s original ones, so...&#x3D;/</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read from another reviewer that these refills work with the Diamond Bling electric toothbrush. This 8 pack is the best deal I could find, all of the other ones only came with 4 refills for about the same price.</li>
    <li> No they did not fit. To large.  The reviews said they would be a Bling but did not.</li>
    <li> Product came very fast, and suprise, 9 brushes instead of 8. Expecxted the brushes not to be as good as the original equipment, found them to be as good. Price was good, life is good. Enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Speedy shipping. They fit my bling/diamond unit and are about 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> An excellent price for just the replacement heads I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Perfect item! I have the Diamond electric toothbrush and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for their replacements and these fit perfect for 1/2 the price!</li>
    <li> These brush heads fit our Diamond electric toothbrush from Bling. I&#x27;m thrilled! The replacement heads are identical and a fraction of the price. Now we actually do change our toothbrush regularly instead of using it until the bristles fall out.</li>
