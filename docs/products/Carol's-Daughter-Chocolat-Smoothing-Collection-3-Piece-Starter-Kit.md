      <li>The best part is</li>
      <li>Best results I ever got at home !!</li>
      <li>but about two good uses out of it!</li>

      <li>It was a good buy.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that will smooth your curly/kinky hair and reduce frizz, this is one of the best product lines I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so totally in love!</li>
      <li>so that was nice.</li>
      <li>I always try to be honest, so here goes.  </li>
      <li>While both did a good job of helping my hair stay straight, they weren&#x27;t as good at moisturizing, and my hair started to frizz out over time.</li>

      <li>The conditioner was okay;  </li>
      <li>I ended up giving it a friend, hopefully she got better results.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much different in my hair after using this product, so was not so impressed.  </li>
      <li>I guess it works for most people but not well for me.</li>
      <li>which shampoo I use or how strong the detergent.</li>
      <li>The follicle of my hair is silky smooth...</li>
      <li>I found that it didn&#x27;t quite keep it frizz free for 24 hours.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I thought it would be a good product to transition from a relaxer to natural and</li>
      <li>The starter kit is the perfect portion to use for a few times before you commit to the full size product.</li>
      <li>My hair is more silky and this has been the first time in awhile</li>

      <li>I think it will benefit her more than me when she wants to straighten her hair.</li>
      <li>shampoo is ok , it didn&#x27;t really leave an impression on me.</li>
      <li>First of all the shampoo stank!  </li>

      <li>2014- Store was out of this kind last time I went in, so I tried Carols defrizz one</li>
      <li>2014- Store was out of this kind last time I went in, so I tried Carols defrizz one</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this kit because I have no relaxer and thought it would be helpful in me having my straight hair that doesn&#x27;t revert.</li>
      <li>The shampoo &amp; conditioner combo left my curly hair looking amazing straight out of the shower.</li>
      <li>The scent was very strong and the product too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>Using other products, like shine serum from another line, on your hair seems to make this one less effective, even if they were good for it before...</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this product was for a more coarse type of hair.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell like chocolate but it has a refreshing smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Things you should be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I got to the styling crème and that&#x27;s when the real nightmare began!  </li>
      <li>I think I use too much the first time as I put a dime size of each large section.</li>

      <li>that despite how much smoother my hair is it still has a ton of volume.</li>

      <li>This product worked really well.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
      <li>I will post information as to how many washes it requires for my hair to go back to its natural state.</li>
      <li>maybe my old product isn&#x27;t balanced right for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 start is because although it looks great now, not sure how it will be in 72 hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve come right back to this set each time because nothing does it as well as Carols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works best if you blow dry your hair using the blow dry serum for at least the week or two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all let me say that I gave this product one star, because it does straighten your hair, however it is lasting a lot longer than 72hrs.</li>
      <li>Smelled delicious, but did not do it&#x27;s job!:-(</li>
      <li>Please test this product on a small section of your hair, to make sure it will wash out, if you wish to go back and forth from kinky to straight.</li>
      <li>It did take about a week of using it for the full effect to hit, but now that it has I don&#x27;t know how I tolerated other shampoos.</li>

      <li>With over the counter products and only washing every other day, my hair looks fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used the Monoi series of this product and was somewhat satisfied with it.  However; after reviews of the Chocolate Smoothing Collection were half satisfied, half dissatisfied, I decided to try it for myself.  It met my expectation and more.  I&#x27;ve been needing a product with extensive thermo protection and believe I have found it in this product.  My hair is more silky and this has been the first time in awhile I&#x27;ve flat ironed my hair with one stroke after blow drying it!   I do add a product to my scalp as it is very dry, but I don&#x27;t believe it affects the results of the shampoo, conditioner and thermo protection products.  I highly recommend it!  After a shampoo, my hair is naturally wavey/curly.  I will post information as to how many washes it requires for my hair to go back to its natural state.</li>
    <li> I am Africian American the Carol&#x27;s daughter worked really good on my non-permed hair.  I will probably try more from her line.</li>
    <li> This product worked really well. Detangled  and smoothed !! I think I use too much the first time as I put a dime size of each large section. Next time I will use less .. Works great .. After blow dry I flat ironed .. Best results I ever got at home !!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this kit because I have no relaxer and thought it would be helpful in me having my straight hair that doesn&#x27;t revert. This isn&#x27;t it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is ok , it didn&#x27;t really leave an impression on me. I look for shampoo&#x27;s to be detangling. I guess it was ok. the conditioner did nothing for me also. I felt like I put nothing on my hair. the blow dry cream was the worst.It left my hair dry, brittle looking and hard to deal with. Thank goodness for my FHI titanium iron , it helped make my hair feel and look a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention this kit STINKS. it smells like perfumed chocolate, it made me sick. I ended up giving it a friend, hopefully she got better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied at all. The package was open when it arrived and some of the shampoo was in the box, dried up. Old used product to sum it up.</li>
    <li> Keep this on supply! I will need and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me...</li>
    <li> After reading other comments in which others describing having a hard time washing the product out of their hair, I did not have this problem.  I have very curly, ethnic type hair and this product works just like any other smoothing product.  I was hoping for &#x27;the one&#x27; product that would make my hair straight but this was not it.</li>
    <li> While I bought this hoping that it would keep my daughter&#x27;s hair straight and frizz free for the supposed 72 hours I found that it didn&#x27;t quite keep it frizz free for 24 hours. However, it did make it much more manageable so that I could do and redo it a few times during the week without having to do a complete detangle, rewash and dry so that was nice.</li>
    <li> First of all let me say that I gave this product one star, because it does straighten your hair, however it is lasting a lot longer than 72hrs. I am African American, my hair is not relaxed and typically it is very kinky. I&#x27;ve washed and washed my hair after using the Chocolat Smoothing Collection by Carol&#x27;s Daughter, and it remains straight no matter which shampoo I use or how strong the detergent. It has gotten to the point that my hair remains partially straight and partially kinky. It took me so long to grow my afro, and it looks like I will have to chop it off and start from scratch. Please test this product on a small section of your hair, to make sure it will wash out, if you wish to go back and forth from kinky to straight.</li>
    <li> It was a good buy. It&#x27;s just a sample so it was in a small bottle. The conditioner and shampoo smells good. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell like chocolate but it has a refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter products, and have used them before. So, when I purchased this smoothie starter kit, I was very confident! When I opened the box the first thing I noticed was the tiny little bottles. I have a lot of hair, so I knew that I wasn&#x27;t gonna get but about two good uses out of it! So I tried the product out, and it did NOTHING to my hair!! Smelled delicious, but did not do it&#x27;s job!:-(</li>
    <li> It did not last long and I didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel, I won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. It did take about a week of using it for the full effect to hit, but now that it has I don&#x27;t know how I tolerated other shampoos. I&#x27;ve always been a bit of a product snob, especially when it comes to my hair, but this blows pureology, aveda and joico out of the water. The follicle of my hair is silky smooth...it constantly looks like I just had it glossed, and the texture is like it was just deep conditioned. I&#x27;m so totally in love! The best part is that despite how much smoother my hair is it still has a ton of volume. I just cannot stop gushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you should be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It can take about a week after switching over to see the full difference in your hair. Having switched around a couple of times I&#x27;ve noticed that if I try to skip on the serum and blow dry during the transition week I get some funky results. Once my hair is used to it again I don&#x27;t need to worry about the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Works best if you blow dry your hair using the blow dry serum for at least the week or two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Using other products, like shine serum from another line, on your hair seems to make this one less effective, even if they were good for it before...maybe my old product isn&#x27;t balanced right for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product will make curling or straightening your hair a lot less necessary. Kinks just don&#x27;t happen as much when the follicle is this smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When you upgrade to the full size there is one downside- the caps are such a slick plastic that they&#x27;re really difficult to open in the shower. It&#x27;s a minor annoyance, but I wish they&#x27;d update their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2013- I have tried switching to a couple of the other straightening shampoos. The Aveda line, and the one by Ojon. While both did a good job of helping my hair stay straight, they weren&#x27;t as good at moisturizing, and my hair started to frizz out over time. I&#x27;ve come right back to this set each time because nothing does it as well as Carols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2014- Store was out of this kind last time I went in, so I tried Carols defrizz one and it didn&#x27;t work as well. I think the dry climate in Utah is part of the problem. Someone in humid environments would probably like that one better.ll as Carols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2014- Store was out of this kind last time I went in, so I tried Carols defrizz one and it didn&#x27;t work as well. I think the dry climate in Utah is part of the problem. Someone in humid environments would probably like that one better.</li>
    <li> This product was bought as a gift in hopes of helping out the young lady, and she loves it. The starter kit is the perfect portion to use for a few times before you commit to the full size product. A good choice</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this product was for a more coarse type of hair. The scent was very strong and the product too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Just brought this product and I absolutely love it.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 start is because although it looks great now, not sure how it will be in 72 hours.  Scent is just the bomb.  It&#x27;s definitely a keeper.  Just wish the cost was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I always try to be honest, so here goes.  I bought this because I thought it would be a good product to transition from a relaxer to natural and boy, I was wrong!  First of all the shampoo stank!  You know that foot powder they used to make in the 70&#x27;s?  That is what the shampoo smelled like; my dad&#x27;s work boots! Plus, it stripped my hair.  It felt hard an brittle; the same texture I am trying to stay away from.  The conditioner was okay;  nothing impressive.  Then I got to the styling crème and that&#x27;s when the real nightmare began!  The crème made my hair hard and dry when I started blow drying it. Plus, the conditioner didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job and my hair was tangled and knotted.  When I finally got through untangling my hair and got it blown dry, it was hard, dry and looked like half an afro. I have very dry hair and a medium coarse texture.  It is thick.  I am going to have my mom try this for her hair.  Her hair is fine and not coarse. It is the texture of a woman from India.  I think it will benefit her more than me when she wants to straighten her hair.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars for wash &amp; go styles. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will smooth your curly/kinky hair and reduce frizz, this is one of the best product lines I&#x27;ve tried. The shampoo &amp; conditioner combo left my curly hair looking amazing straight out of the shower. There was shine, moisture, body, curl definition, and everything I look for in curly-hair products. Also the scent is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be careful. This product DID NOT allow me to blow my  hair straight advertised. The blow-out attempt left my hair looking just as puffy as it does after using any other product. So I have to take one star away for false advertising.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much different in my hair after using this product, so was not so impressed.  My hair is THICK and curly / frizzy ... and this product did not do what I was hoping to help that.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that I like to blow day straight when I have time. With over the counter products and only washing every other day, my hair looks fine. My sister recommended that I try this product since she had good results. It totally dried out my hair and made the ends break. It was also hard to comb out, so I got more spilt ends. I guess it works for most people but not well for me.</li>
