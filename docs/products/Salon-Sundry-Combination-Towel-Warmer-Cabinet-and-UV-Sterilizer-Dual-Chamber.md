      <li>My patient love  </li>

      <li>The only thing good about it was that it was inexpensive!  </li>
      <li>I should have realized it was going to be a problem from the beginning because the towels on top level never got very hot</li>
      <li>I could tell from the photos, and confirmed that upon receiving it.  </li>
      <li>however the uv light</li>
      <li>and they have worked great for the last 7 years.  </li>
      <li>getting a nice warm towel place around their feet, legs and arms  prior to doing vascular exam.  </li>
      <li>The color is not the bright white you see in the picture.</li>

      <li>I wished the unit would hold more than 3 larger towels rolled and placed into the unit.  </li>
      <li>and it always had a lot of condensation which lead to the leaking and most likely caused fire (per fire dept.)</li>
      <li>THANKS AMAZON!</li>
      <li>broke within first week, it stopped heating</li>
      <li>However the top warmer UV light will not light...</li>
      <li>I can actually warm towels and have the other unit available for warming or sterilizing tools at the same time.</li>
      <li>I never expected to get such a nice unit for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also does show some rust around the rubber and hinge areas of the lower unit (the top unit just has dry towels and a heat pack, so</li>
      <li>The unit is large and heats very well.</li>
      <li>And this machine is huge outside</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has brought so much convenience.</li>
      <li>I am really hoping it dissipates in time.</li>
      <li>and smelled very chemical smell...returned...</li>
      <li>Very nitpicking stuff.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; very well and has to maneuvered in and out every time.  </li>
      <li>Only having had it for less than a year, the top light has quit.</li>
      <li>Because the pan doesn&#x27;t fit, the water also pools to one side or the other and seems &amp;#34;tilted&amp;#34; so it overflows versus filling the whole pan first else</li>
      <li>It does have a new smell to it that does transfer to the towels, which I expect will disipate over time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, the unit does smell for the first few weeks.</li>
      <li>I had to dispose of this hot towel cabi after only owning it for 6 months as it shorted out and caused an electrical fire in my home.</li>
      <li>Starting from the first day of use, the product had gas smelling and lasted for a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>but even when we heat old laundered towels in the unit, they still smell.  </li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t have a busy day I still have to run both units.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t receive a model number to call and get it returned or fixed.</li>
      <li>The burned chemical smell took 2-3 months to burn off most of the harsh scent (with constant use).  </li>
      <li>Overall, it functions for the price and at this time gets the main job done.  </li>
      <li>So, if it&#x27;s going to break down the same, I&#x27;d rather spend less than more for a name brand. ...</li>
      <li>I would run it for a couple hours before sessions to help lessen it for the first few months and used aromatherapy on the towels to help cover it up for awhile.  </li>

<li> no moisture dripping down -</li>
<li> The other towel cabinet -- for me, the lower cabinet stopped working after 4 uses, the door gaskets came loose, and it rusted inside pretty badly, including the pull out metal racks, which then in turn rusts the towels you&#x27;re heating in there.  </li>
<li> It is slightly faded.</li>
<li> I read the previous reviews on this item before purchase and should have listened to the previous reviewers.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a mess.  </li>
<li> I received a dead unit.</li>
<li> ; smell that a few clients commented on.</li>
<li> but I can contain just a few ties inside, which is just a waste!</li>
<li> I would go with a paragon small capacity.</li>
<li> gas\\&quot; for 3 hrs before my first client with the windows open, but it smelled terrible all day.</li>
<li> The interior towel racks are too small compare to the interior space in each rack.</li>
<li> But it seems it&#x27;s to late</li>
<li> The biggest complaint would be the drip pan.  </li>
<li> Poor design!</li>
<li> Unable to return item.</li>
<li> The unit STINKS when it heats.  </li>
<li> Frustrating!!</li>
<li> Now I have an expensive THING  I can&#x27;t use!  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, this product&#x27;s bad spots had nothing to do with Amazon services.</li>
<li> I hate it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this product in December for my massage business.  We loved it but yesterday only 4 months later it stopped heating up.  I was hoping I could get it replaced.  But it seems it&#x27;s to late and I can&#x27;t find any info to contact the company.  I have 2 others from other company&#x27;s  and they have worked great for the last 7 years.  If you can help me get this replaced that would be great.  Not with the money for 4 months use.</li>
    <li> Only having had it for less than a year, the top light has quit. It still heats but seems to be getting hotter and hotter. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again. I expect my tools to last longer than this. Also, seems to be rusting in various places.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fairly functional for the price. I didn&#x27;t spend the extra money for the Paragon units because I use them at a spa location I also work at and they have some similar issues as well.  So, if it&#x27;s going to break down the same, I&#x27;d rather spend less than more for a name brand. ... The burned chemical smell took 2-3 months to burn off most of the harsh scent (with constant use).  I would run it for a couple hours before sessions to help lessen it for the first few months and used aromatherapy on the towels to help cover it up for awhile.  It also does show some rust around the rubber and hinge areas of the lower unit (the top unit just has dry towels and a heat pack, so no moisture dripping down - yet I do spritz the dry towels to keep them from over-drying from the heat).  I also wipe the machine down after every use and let the heat and UV run for several minutes afterwards to help dry up and sanitize the unit before shutting it completely down, so the rust issue is being kept at bay.  The biggest complaint would be the drip pan.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; very well and has to maneuvered in and out every time.  Because the pan doesn&#x27;t fit, the water also pools to one side or the other and seems &amp;#34;tilted&amp;#34; so it overflows versus filling the whole pan first else I don&#x27;t think there would be an issue.  Overall, it functions for the price and at this time gets the main job done.  I&#x27;ll see how long it lasts before I determine if I would buy another one or not.</li>
    <li> I received a dead unit.</li>
    <li> Doors open with difficulty.  Can not warm only one at a time. If I don&#x27;t have a busy day I still have to run both units.  I do like the fact it warms up quickly. I like the basket  for towels.</li>
    <li> great price and lots of towels can fit easily!</li>
    <li> My patient love  getting a nice warm towel place around their feet, legs and arms  prior to doing vascular exam.  I wished the unit would hold more than 3 larger towels rolled and placed into the unit.  I will be looking for a larger unit at my favorite place to shop Amazon</li>
    <li> I have to say that I love this item.  However the top warmer UV light will not light...it is flickering.  The product does get warm and I am waiting to hear from them about fixing the problem.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product was amazing. I never expected to get such a nice unit for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has brought so much convenience. I can actually warm towels and have the other unit available for warming or sterilizing tools at the same time.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IT!  I&#x27;ve had it for just 2 months and every single seem is rusting.  The rust spots stain my nice white pedicure towels.  I even wipe it down and leave the doors open at the end of every day.  Water pours out of the bottom corners of the doors every time you open them.  Like the other reviews said, the doors don&#x27;t screw in tight so they shift every time you open them and you have to straighten them back up.  It&#x27;s a mess.  I hate it.  I&#x27;m getting one that has a door that opens from the top.</li>
    <li> This is the identical towel warmer cabinet as another one on Amazon, which is poorly-rated.  I could tell from the photos, and confirmed that upon receiving it.  Hopefully it will perform better.  The other towel cabinet -- for me, the lower cabinet stopped working after 4 uses, the door gaskets came loose, and it rusted inside pretty badly, including the pull out metal racks, which then in turn rusts the towels you&#x27;re heating in there.  The only thing good about it was that it was inexpensive!  I limped along for more than a year when my needs changed and I just had to have the capacity of two cabinets, so I ordered this replaclement.</li>
    <li> I had to dispose of this hot towel cabi after only owning it for 6 months as it shorted out and caused an electrical fire in my home. Luckily, we were home to shut off breaker and call fire department. I should have realized it was going to be a problem from the beginning because the towels on top level never got very hot and it always had a lot of condensation which lead to the leaking and most likely caused fire (per fire dept.) Also, while it was heating it produced a &amp;#34;chemical like&amp;#34; smell that a few clients commented on.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even turn on. and smelled very chemical smell...returned... lets see how that goes...?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true, the unit does smell for the first few weeks. The unit is large and heats very well. I was satisfied with this unit until recently. I&#x27;ve only had the it for 6 months and it is stopped heating just like that.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 4 Weeks!!!!!! The UV part works, but DOES NOT HEAT! Of course by that time I couldn&#x27;t return it! No instructions, no troubleshooting instructions....NOTHING! Now I have an expensive THING  I can&#x27;t use!  THANKS AMAZON! DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE ANY STARS!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working!!!!! Didn&#x27;t use before.cant content with seller~</li>
    <li> Starting from the first day of use, the product had gas smelling and lasted for a couple of weeks. Although the gas smelling has reduced recently, it still last there. If you think this would not affect your business, then you can buy the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product&#x27;s bad spots had nothing to do with Amazon services. I still recommend buyers to continue shopping at Amazon for millions of great offers.</li>
    <li> The cabbie heats well but after several months still has a smell to it when turned on.  I use the unit in my massage office but would not buy again.  I would go with a paragon small capacity.</li>
    <li> I read the previous reviews on this item before purchase and should have listened to the previous reviewers.  The unit STINKS when it heats.  I thought the smell may have come from the dye in the towels but even when we heat old laundered towels in the unit, they still smell.  The unit itself works great, nice even heat!</li>
    <li> broke within first week, it stopped heating</li>
    <li> Towel warmer works great, size is perfect for a lot of towels, but smells awful! I let it \\&quot;off gas\\&quot; for 3 hrs before my first client with the windows open, but it smelled terrible all day. I am really hoping it dissipates in time. I scented my towels with essential oils and vented the room but YUCK!</li>
    <li> The product works as intended. The build quality was not as good as i expected. The color is not the bright white you see in the picture. It is slightly faded. Some of the rubber grommets were loose and the seals not tight enough until closed. The buttons on the front were not lined up. Very nitpicking stuff. If you are looking for function over beauty go for it.</li>
    <li> Started to leak and rust after one month.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed! The interior towel racks are too small compare to the interior space in each rack. This warmer are designed for dry and tiny towels only. Not for wet and mid size towels which I need for my salon. And this machine is huge outside but I can contain just a few ties inside, which is just a waste! Poor design!</li>
    <li> the heat did not work~ however the uv light did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate them returning it for me, the UPS man was awesome &amp; it was picked up right away!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t warm towels. I didn&#x27;t receive a model number to call and get it returned or fixed.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 3 months.it was great while it lasted. Unable to return item. Should have read the reviews before purchasing. Frustrating!! Will buy a different  brand next time.</li>
    <li> This is very spacious, light weight and works well. It does have a new smell to it that does transfer to the towels, which I expect will disipate over time.</li>
