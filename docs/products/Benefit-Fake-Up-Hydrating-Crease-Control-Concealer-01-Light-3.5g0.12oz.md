      <li>This is amazing.</li>
      <li>Kind of a bummer</li>
      <li>Nice and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it under my eye much, because I can see where it might have the tendency to crease, but for a cover-up/concealer, this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best under eye concealer</li>
      <li>Great Product, worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I do the rest of my makeup then lightly add powder under my eyes then its good all day then at night</li>
      <li>Very light &amp; creamy.</li>
      <li>Good item for quick fix and blends well.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and I love the coverage.</li>
      <li>But the Nars is more liquidy and takes some time to apply correctly and so I was hoping that this in stick form would work better.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>the way if you are interesting on seeing a youtube video on how this applies and looks and my review my youtube beauty channel is \\&quot;TruelyABlonde\\&quot;.de\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad it paid off.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>It leaves a healthy glow under your eyes and even sort of acts as a highlighter for your cheeks.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>and OMG I am in love.</li>
      <li>and I have never been as completely satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this and use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Except</li>

      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it under my eyes with powder on top.</li>
      <li>I want my eyes to have a striking look to them, and this seems to do the trick.  </li>
      <li>I did put a setting powder over it to hold it better.</li>
      <li>Highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It felt nice and smooth going on</li>
      <li>I love this product from Benefit.</li>
      <li>The concealer is super blend able and you never have concealer lines either!</li>
      <li>Easy effective just plain awesome</li>
      <li>I love the combination of moisturizer and concealer to keep things smooth with no wrinkles.</li>
      <li>A light application of Hello Flawless foundation powder smooths it, but not for long.</li>
      <li>this product adds just the right amount of brightness, gives it a nice contrast.</li>
      <li>Yes pimples and wrinkles, being 30 is so much fun! :)</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try this concealer, as it&#x27;s touted as the most moist and smooth one on the market.</li>
      <li>This product has it down perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only concealer that doesn&#x27;t make things worse when I cover up blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have tried several under eye concealers and this is the absolute best!  If you have fine lines and under eye darkening this works great.  The moisturizer in the product keeps it from looking clumpy and it stays on all day.  Great for eyes over the age of 50!</li>
    <li> It really fits my needs. Very moisturising concealer for dark circles. It last the whole day and matches perfectly your skin tone. If you don&#x27;t like to put too much make up but just want to have a healthy expression that is your product!</li>
    <li> This seemed like an ideal solution to blend concealer with moisture for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; eyes.  It&#x27;s OK, but remains so moist and shiny under the eyes that mascara blots on it with the first bat of the eyelashes.  To dust the area with powder would defeat the whole purpose of the product. I would not spend the money to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love Benefit and a great price too!</li>
    <li> There is a trick to using this concealer. I put it on only using those white triangle sponges, then once its on I get my hand fan and look up while the fan dries up the concealer after about 5 minutes I do the rest of my makeup then lightly add powder under my eyes then its good all day then at night if I&#x27;m going to continue out I would repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product that you could just put on and walk away but it IS THE ONLY CONCEALER THAT WORKS WONDERS!  I&#x27;ve tried every concealer out there even the 100.00 ones and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product.  It covers up anything and everything...from dark circles to blemishes, yet it does not make you look heavily made up.  I would recommend this miracle stick to everyone!</li>
    <li> Works wonders! The only thing is that it is a bit too light for my skin.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product and has purchased it many times after the initial purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent! Covers dark circles leaving it hidrated.</li>
    <li> Work perfectly and saves ne a trip to the store:)</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  I can always depend on it, and it does have an excellent blend of moisturizer.  I will always use this!</li>
    <li> Works great. I love the combination of moisturizer and concealer to keep things smooth with no wrinkles. I use it daily!</li>
    <li> Good concealer for undereye dryess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ill and have horrible bags under my eyes from chemo and being tired...no joke this stuff works..best I have found</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best! Doesnt cake on or dry up and cause fine lines to look horrible.  Great Product, worth the money.  No need to ever switch.</li>
    <li> I read about this concealer in an article and was looking for something to help with shadows under my eyes.  the Fake Up blends easily with my ring finger and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull your skin because of the moisturizer surrounding the color.  It&#x27;s easy to tap into your skin with your finger or a small brush.  However, if you get it too close to eyeliner or mascara under the eye, I find it will smudge.  But, I like it.</li>
    <li> I have combination dry skin so any extra hydration I can get is great. I usually can&#x27;t wear concealer as it looks too cakey and dry on my skin so I was intrigued by this concealer with hydration in one. It worked really well at covering acne scars or the random pimples I still get but for under eyes I still found some creasing. But I was pleased enough with the coverage it offered the rest of my face to keep it. I&#x27;m going to play around with different under eye moisturizers now that I&#x27;m starting to see signs of wrinkles to see if that helps cut back on the creasing. Yes pimples and wrinkles, being 30 is so much fun! :)</li>
    <li> not sure what all the ranting good reviews are on this, but it is nothing special, except it&#x27;s especially over priced.</li>
    <li> It could cover slightly more, but it&#x27;s very moisturizing and it covers really well. I really like it for summer in particular. It gives you a dewy look.</li>
    <li> This goes on so smooth and looks fresh (does not get cakey)</li>
    <li> I love this product! Someone at a makeup store recommended it to me about a year ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s a double featured product because it provides great cover up around the eye area while still keeping it moisturized. Other products that I previously used produced a caked-on look that made my under-eye wrinkles stick out even more (seriously, what&#x27;s the point?!). This one is super light and smooth - like you don&#x27;t even have anything on. I&#x27;ve found that I use less liquid foundation under my eyes now because this really does the trick. I don&#x27;t have super dark circles but I do have some discoloration and this easily covers it right up. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the easiest concealer to use and great on the go. The moisturizer allows it to go on smooth and evenly.  I cannot live without my fake up!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Use light as under eye concealer. Also have medium to even out face when I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation and dark works great as a bronzer. However I will NOT be buying this here as the guaranteed real deal directly from Benefit or one of their approved department stores is, and always had been, priced at $24.</li>
    <li> Really nice coverage!</li>
    <li> I happened across this stuff after trying a sample and after just one use, I was totally hooked. The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade is the perfect shade for my skin and covers up dark spots and blemish marks completely. I don&#x27;t use it under my eye much, because I can see where it might have the tendency to crease, but for a cover-up/concealer, this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Creamy. Goes on softly and doesn&#x27;t.pull undereye. My only complaint is that it gets used up too quickly. This price is good!</li>
    <li> Similar consistency to chap stick- covers well, but almost too moisturizing for my normal skin. If you have dry skin you will probably really like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year - it does a great job covering under eye shadows, doesn&#x27;t cake, stays on all day.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I apply the fake up under my eyes and eyebrow for contrast.</li>
    <li> good coverage, not cakey and moisturizing</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a moist, concealer for a long time and I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch from this one now that I have found it! I am usually cheap with makeup, I have been wearing drugstore make up for years. I recently switched to some mid-range makeup and I included this as part of my daily routine. I LOVE it. In fact, when I leave the house, this is the only thing that I even feel the need to take with me. It leaves a healthy glow under your eyes and even sort of acts as a highlighter for your cheeks. The girl at Sephora told me to draw a line with it that traces the bottom part of your dark circles and blend it out/up into your under eye area with your ring finger or a brush. She told me that you really should not apply this or any concealer directly under the eyes or else it might settle into fine lines. I have been doing what she told me and OMG I am in love. This is absolutely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product is plenty moisturizing. I am not particularly pleased with the color, but it just does not match my complexion really well. It is my fault because I ordered this color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this concealer. I use it for all over my face because it works really well. The moisturizer on the outside edge made me nervous when I first tried using it, but if you apply it with you finger as I do, it blends together with the color in the center of the stick to make a great concealer. It works incredibly well and tends to stick around for quite a while. Definitely going to keep this around.</li>
    <li> Easy effective just plain awesome</li>
    <li> Good item for quick fix and blends well.</li>
    <li> If ever I was stranded on a deserted island this would be my one must have product. Very moisturizing under the delicate eye skin. Good coverage. And the tube last about a year with daily use.</li>
    <li> I have brown eyes so after I apply my dark eyeliner and underliner this product adds just the right amount of brightness, gives it a nice contrast. I want my eyes to have a striking look to them, and this seems to do the trick.  Just blend it in well.  A+ product.</li>
    <li> Concealer never looks good unless it is moistened.  This product has it down perfectly.  It saves a step and looks great every time.  I have very light complexion and this item looks great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all. I have pretty dark circles and I normally use Nars Radient concealer in vanilla - which totally works for me. But the Nars is more liquidy and takes some time to apply correctly and so I was hoping that this in stick form would work better. It DOES go on very smoothly and quickly - but it doesn&#x27;t provide enough coverage with just one layer. However, when I try to apply more layers - it just scrapes off the first layer since its so emollient. You can&#x27;t just let it dry and build. So unworkable for me. For someone who has dry undereyes and only needs some light correction - this would probably work. For people who have dark circles and need more coverage - just skip.</li>
    <li> Too greasy makes my mascara run in only a couple hours or so. Wife&#x27;s post.</li>
    <li> I love this product from Benefit. It stays put for the majority of the day and is moisturizing. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I am 44 with some crinkling under my eyes. I use Bare Minerals powder foundation, but their concealer looks cakey and emphasizes my wrinkles. This product is fantastic. I did notice that it can cause certain mascara&#x27;s to bleed onto my face. I switched waterproof and I&#x27;m good</li>
    <li> I totally thought I&#x27;d be getting the sample size because of the great price but it was full sized and it&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;d heard the moisturizing circle made it runny but I&#x27;ve found that it prevents it from getting cakey, I just apply it with the stick and then blend with my fingers or a brush. Kind of a bummer they only have three shades but I just bought two so I can mix it as I get tanner or paler.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff at Sephora a few months ago. I was very happy to see that Amazon has it for cheaper than Sephora! Score!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways - on to the product itself. I really like this stuff. I use it under my eyes when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep and I also use it to cover up the occasional blemish. It&#x27;s not like a typical cover-up. It has this moisturizing ring around the cover-up. It gives the perfect amount of coverage and when used properly, looks like you don&#x27;t have anything on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this stuff is how it helps my skin. If I use it under my eyes, it helps soothe any dryness and irritation. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people think it leaves their skin looking greasy. If this happens to you.. you&#x27;re probably applying too much product or you&#x27;re holding the product at the wrong angle.</li>
    <li> best concealer I have tried.  It really doesn&#x27;t cake and hydrates your eye area.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Except I buy on hsn.com and save $$$$$$$$$$$&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and does the job for those nasty dark under eye circles.</li>
    <li> great product, great service</li>
    <li> I got this in light (nw/nc20). I put in corners to brighten up the eye area and set with MAC mineralize lightscapade. Wow do I look awake. I do NOT put this all over the undereye area or it&#x27;d smear my eye makeup - it&#x27;s so emollient. It lasts all day on me set w powder. What I like best about this is that it&#x27;s the only concealer moisturizing enough to cover 2 red patches of eczema near my mouth. Anything else and my skin is flaking by day&#x27;s end.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I slather it all over my under-eyes and cheeks after primer and foundation. It has light coverage, you might need a heavier concealer if you have extra dark circles. The only downside is It has a tendency to attract mascara and eyeliner, I think because it is highly moisturizing. I get raccoon eyes by the end of the day if I don&#x27;t check it out in the mirror at lunch.</li>
    <li> Most concealers I&#x27;ve used (Smashbox, Urban Decay, eight million drugstore brands) make ugly, cakey, yellow patches on my undereyes that are really hard to blend. The Urban Decay pencil was the best of these, but it still required an annoyingly complex cycle of blending, powdering over, and praying that I hadn&#x27;t applied too much in the first place, because then I&#x27;d need to wipe off half my makeup and start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because this concealer is so blessedly simple and useful by comparison. I do have to put on two coats, because it&#x27;s so sheer, but really, I just swipe as needed, blend it, and suddenly I look a thousand times fresher. This shade is good for a pretty wide range of light skin tones, too- this worked for my mom, who&#x27;s fairly peachy, but when I got a stick for myself, it blended in perfectly well for me too (I&#x27;m basically Snow White, and I don&#x27;t have a lot of color in my face unless I use blush, or I&#x27;m sick and my face is flushing, or I&#x27;m giggly and embarassed over something).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a concealer I can use without wondering if I&#x27;d just look better if I left my under-eye shadows alone!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best under eye concealer I&#x27;ve ever used. Unfortunately the travel size is insultingly small. .12 of an ounce? For $35!? Ridiculous. Still and amazing product though. Probably could not afford to get it again.</li>
    <li> I just started using it! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because the reviews were mixed! I like it so far it is light and I love it. My complexion is rather light!&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply but you need to blend it with your fingers or sponge! Nice and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I used this once on a mild day. Within an hour, it had settled into creases. It felt nice and smooth going on but as a concealer, it is utterly useless. I would not risk wearing this out of the house and it went into the garbage. If someone thinks this is a problem only with older women, it is not as my 20 year old daughter had the same experience with this product.</li>
    <li> This makeup gives very little coverage- its much more of a moisture stick. If your skin is oily at all- this is not for you. it will make the shine worse. I use it under my eyes with powder on top.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! good cover up! Just started using it and love it! it is highly recommended! Very good stuff</li>
    <li> My husband said it works so well, it looked like I was taking makeup off when I was applying it. Didn&#x27;t know my dark circles were so bad until I finally got the right product to get rid of them. I&#x27;ll never use another concealer. Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I recommend it all the time.</li>
    <li> Awesome coverup for eyes! Very light &amp; creamy. I bought my refill on Amazon. Bought some for friends and they both repurchased This product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I know I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I felt this product deserved it. I am very pale and usually have dark bags under my eyes. I have used many drug store concealers and they dry up and hold to the lines under the eye. I have even tried the Laura Mericer and bare minerals concealer.I actually received this in a free sample from Sephora. The first day I was skeptical, but it went on like velvet and coverage was amazing! By the end of the first day it was still holding coverage and was not wrinkling or drying out. I did put a setting powder over it to hold it better. I just ordered some more! Everyone is different but this is probably one of the best products I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this concealer. I just purchased this from Sephora today and it is one of the best I have tried. I have bought and used so many high end concealers and I have never been as completely satisfied as I am with this product. It goes on smoothly, the color is perfect on me (I have yellow undertones by the way), it stays hydrated and does not become cakey.I am so excited to have found this product. Thanks Benefit!</li>
    <li> I have light, thin undereye-skin and this product works to conceal.  I&#x27;m also 43 so that might make a difference too.  It doesn&#x27;t settle into my fine lines.  I do set it with powder and wear it over Pore-fessional also from Benefit.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it&#x27;s damn close and just when I think that I want to save the money on a drugstore brand, I try one and come back to this.  I wear it daily and it&#x27;s lasted me 6 mos. for this last tube.  If you have normal to dry skin or thin, aging skin in your undereye area then give it a shot.  It&#x27;s not meant for everyone but for the right skin, it&#x27;s a true find.</li>
    <li> This is an under eye circle remover.  it has a bees wax type of outside with a color corrected in the middle.  It does not cover as much as I would like, so I don&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
    <li> I really like this cancelear, because it. soros very well, Never show the rinkles and hydrate my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite concealor ever!</li>
    <li> I really liked this but just wish the coverage was a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Has moisturizer with concealer in the middle. Use as directed.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I use it to cover red areas healing over such as blemishes etc. it is phenomenal! I put it on and let it sit a a minute then blend it in. Covers great and doesn&#x27;t break me out and I have very sensitive skin. Must have !!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this concealer, as it&#x27;s touted as the most moist and smooth one on the market. This news was welcomed by me, as most concealers that actually have good coverage are thick and cakey, and require a bit of moisturizer to give them a natural look.  How nice to have it built in!  Both advertisements and sneak reviews of it commented on its ability to neutralize bluish tints under the eye, cover uneven pigmentation, smooth fine lines while not settling into them, and its anti-caking qualities.  I&#x27;m fairly disappointed on all counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the color selections capable of matching yellow undertones, the Light option leaving a bright and obvious delineation in set makeup. For three uses, I&#x27;ve applied Fake Up with a brush under my eyes, and it immediately settles into fine lines.  The results were the same with finger application. A light application of Hello Flawless foundation powder smooths it, but not for long. While I like the idea of it being emollient--particularly as I&#x27;ve spent years using a moisturizer to smooth on more cakey concealers--it shines, even under powder. It also separates once on the skin, and settles into oily dots.  Eyeliner and mascara on bottom lashes bleed into it after a short time. Very unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most definitely be returning this concealer in hopes of finding one that actually conceals and brightens without blinding.  Perhaps if you are young and/or do not have the concern of under eye shadowing, this may work well.  Else, hold out for a more thorough option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Lancome&#x27;s Maquicomplet Complete Coverage Concealer worked out better for me, but it&#x27;s also more expensive.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin you guys need this product! I love the concept of this product with the moisturizer balm on the outside with the concealer on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;  The packaging is down right adorable!; it is a sleek silver packaging with hot pink accents and in Black Fancy printing it says Fake Up, and then benefit is written at the bottom in pink. The concealer is a twist up balm.&lt;br /&gt;  The actual product comes in 3 basic shades; Light,Medium,and Deep. I wish they had mores shades  so more people could have it better matched, but for me light matches really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;  I really like the consistency of this product it is very moisturizing and feels so great but it looks like a normal concealer on your skin. The moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel weird or balmy and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy! The concealer is super blend able and you never have concealer lines either! This concealer has decent coverage and works great on redness,under eye circles, and smaller acne; however when I use this on bigger zits I need to use more than one application to cover it. If you have dry patches this product is perfect since this product has a moisturizer you can put the concealer on dry patches without making them look flakey or it settling into creases. I recommend on dry patches to apply under your foundation and then reapply over foundation to make it appear flawless.&lt;br /&gt;The lasting power on this product is decent I feel like it lasts all day but this isn&#x27;t good to exercise in because the product will Fade A little, but just reapply after you exercise and it will work like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you have dry skin you need to try this concealer it&#x27;s a life savor, totally holy grail product. It&#x27;s so amazing! The price is $24, which is expensive, but it is high end makeup and its such a great product that I find it to be worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;By the way if you are interesting on seeing a youtube video on how this applies and looks and my review my youtube beauty channel is \\&quot;TruelyABlonde\\&quot;.de\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My go to product!  Really helps with those under eye circles and brightens eyes as well!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have genetic dark circles. This does a great job of hiding them while keeping my eye moisturized. It is also great for blemishes and as a spot concealer. Great product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been wearing for about three weeks now and I have nothing bad to say about it!  I highly recommend it.  Provides good coverage, keeps my under eye area well hydrated and I typically work 11 to 12 hour days.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Came in two days. I had already tried the concealer and loved it so much that I had to purchase the full size. It is very hydrating and I love the coverage. Its is great for my dark under eye circles and for small blemishes I have on my face. Highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I find that most spot concealers are too watery and don&#x27;t actually cover blemishes or imperfections.. not with this one! I had never tried it before ordering online which can be a risky move but I&#x27;m glad it paid off. I have relatively oily/combination skin and am very happy with this product thus far. Benefit wins again.</li>
    <li> I love that this moisturizes as well as covers- prefect for the dry areas that I use it for.</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s moisturizing, I guess, sort of. But it flops as a concealer. Absolutely no coverage and the moisture in the outer layer makes the conealer center slide right off your skin. Total waste of money. I eyed this for over 2 months before making the splurge, when my drugstore brand was just fine. Really disappointed.</li>
