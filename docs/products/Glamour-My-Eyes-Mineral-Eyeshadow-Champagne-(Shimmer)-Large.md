      <li>It&#x27;s just absolutely perfect and such a deal!</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love the eye shadow and the shimmery effect.  </li>
      <li>They even gave me a free gift!</li>
      <li>No doubt done on purpose to make the customer buy more sooner.  </li>
      <li>They even gave me a free gift which I also really love too.  </li>
      <li>Love this product and the color is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package, I though, &amp;#34;Well, its free, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a light shade of eyeshadow....</li>
      <li>Very nice light color especially for corners of the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Thi would be perfect for a young teen for highlights and fun!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and easy.  </li>
      <li>All natural and healthy, I will definitely buy more from this company.</li>
      <li>It was a nice bonus to get an extra mineral shade (smaller size) in my shipment to experiment with :).  </li>
      <li>Very affordable price!</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Worth the price and very pretty for those who like natural looks.</li>
      <li>My Eyes Mineral Eyeshadow is seriously my go-to all-over shadow and has great shimmer.  </li>
      <li>Then use a large angled brush to apply this all over.  </li>
      <li>I needed a light shadow that would last longer than Almay</li>
      <li>Absolutely gives your eyes the lightening your looking for.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say</li>
      <li>There is nothing intense about it.</li>
      <li>Best part is Champagne is lasting me a long time unlike the Almay verison where the champagne-like color is the smallest section on the palette whereas the dark shade is the largest.  </li>
      <li>I use this first and then apply a slightly darker shimmer on top of the lid.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty without looking like I&#x27;m heading to a nightclub in the middle of the day!  </li>
      <li>Intense i-Color Smoky-i Powder Shadow Palette, for Greens (I have about 10 of those sets in my medicine cabinet from the lightest shade being used up completely) - Glamour</li>
      <li>this product is a light shade of pink with shimmer.  </li>
      <li>This product disappears on my eyelids instantly unless I dampen the applicator first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Oh, and did I mention you get the awesome eyeshadow base?  </li>
      <li>Very simple but a perfect base color.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting Bare Minerals brand.</li>
      <li>had been using Bare Minerals - and still do -</li>
      <li>I am fair-skinned, do not have deep-set eyes and my eyes are small, so then I use the left over Almay palettes I previously purchased to create more definition with the darker colors.  </li>

<li> but this Champagne shadow is comperable to Vanilla Sugar and at about half</li>
<li> I wear it on my eyes or even my face when I go out to soften my complexion &amp; add a little glitz.</li>

    <li> Love the eye shadow and the shimmery effect.  They even gave me a free gift which I also really love too.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gives your eyes the lightening your looking for.</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Really nice color for your eyes. Had a little problem opening.  Very small container. Really liked product.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the color is very pretty.  I use this color in the corners of my eyes and just below the brow bone.  Very pretty without looking like I&#x27;m heading to a nightclub in the middle of the day!  Great seller, too!  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So shimmery and beautiful. A little goes a LONG way. Color shows up great. Also bought two other colors.</li>
    <li> I love make-up &amp; this has to be an all time favorite product of mine!!! I wear it on my eyes or even my face when I go out to soften my complexion &amp; add a little glitz. Must have!!!!</li>
    <li> I was expecting Bare Minerals brand. It was not what I expected and I did not like the product. Would not purchase from this eye shadow again</li>
    <li> I needed a light shadow that would last longer than Almay Intense i-Color Smoky-i Powder Shadow Palette, for Greens (I have about 10 of those sets in my medicine cabinet from the lightest shade being used up completely) - Glamour My Eyes Mineral Eyeshadow is seriously my go-to all-over shadow and has great shimmer.  The trick I use personlly is to apply my skin tone foundation from my browline to the top of my eyelid (not on eyelid itself because I use a darker color there that doesn&#x27;t need a base).  So I pour the shadow into the underside of the cap and tap it on the counter to make it spread evenly for brush dipping.  Then use a large angled brush to apply this all over.  I am fair-skinned, do not have deep-set eyes and my eyes are small, so then I use the left over Almay palettes I previously purchased to create more definition with the darker colors.  Finish with falsies mascara, a brow pencil, white eyeliner, and run a darker shadow along my lower lashes.  It was a nice bonus to get an extra mineral shade (smaller size) in my shipment to experiment with :).  Best part is Champagne is lasting me a long time unlike the Almay verison where the champagne-like color is the smallest section on the palette whereas the dark shade is the largest.  No doubt done on purpose to make the customer buy more sooner.  This is really freeing me from having to waste money on Almay&#x27;s palette combinations.</li>
    <li> This product disappears on my eyelids instantly unless I dampen the applicator first. There is nothing intense about it. Cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> I did not even realize that this product came with a base.  When I opened the package, I though, &amp;#34;Well, its free, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34;  It was AWESOME!  I can&#x27;t really say if its just the fact of using a base or because this one is particularly good, but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Bare Minerals - and still do - but this Champagne shadow is comperable to Vanilla Sugar and at about half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I mention you get the awesome eyeshadow base?  ;-)</li>
    <li> This shadow stays put and lasts forever! It&#x27;s just absolutely perfect and such a deal! I am a super happy customer! A++++++ seller! We&#x27;ll be doing business again &amp; again! Happy day to you!</li>
    <li> Very nice light color especially for corners of the eyes.  I use this first and then apply a slightly darker shimmer on top of the lid.  Brightens and wakes up the eyes.</li>
    <li> The product blends well and shimmers nicely. The color is a nice light bright tone. Very satisfied! All natural and healthy, I will definitely buy more from this company. Very affordable price!</li>
    <li> I like this eyeshadow.  The helpful hints that came with it were great.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
