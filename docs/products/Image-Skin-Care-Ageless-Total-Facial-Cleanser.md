      <li>so it&#x27;s a great was to get rid of dead skin without using abrasive exfoliator.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a higher rating is because of the scent which is more like a strong offensive odor.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  I have used it for 5 years. My daughter uses it as well. LOVE the image line</li>
    <li> In 2 week my skin felt smooth and was blemish free</li>
    <li> Best skin care line ever! The glycolic acid works wonders on exfoliating my skin and brightening it daily. I can&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser it has kept my skin glowing prior, during and most likely post my pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I love this product I get occasional  brake outs and this product has stopped that which  was an added benefit.  Will buy it again.  It tightens my skin and also makes it firmer.  My son has used it for his acne which it help a lot.  So product has 2 benefits .</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser and use it every day with my Clairsonic. I always bought it at the spa where I get my facials. The price on Amazon is a lot less than what it costs at the spa. The packaging and cleanser are exactly the same as the ones I purchased at the spa. I recommend it. It has given me excellent results. My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Takes every trace of makeup off.  I tested using a toner to see if I could get residual makeup off, there wasn&#x27;t any.  Two thumbs up</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it makes my skin feel amazing and along with the day moisturizer and the vitamin C cream it has made me look more youthful that I did in my early 20&#x27;s. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best facial wash in the universe!</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a higher rating is because of the scent which is more like a strong offensive odor.  I even checked the expiration date thinking it had gone bad but it doesn&#x27;t expire until 2015.  The product was recommended by my dermatologist.  I use the entire Image Skin Care line now and am happy with it.  Amazon&#x27;s prices are very good.  The cleanser works well and I can feel it working by the tingling on my skin.  I just hold my breath when I first apply it and then the odor goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> use it daily, love it!</li>
    <li> I been using this product over 4 year and is awesome!! Highly recommended and great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I feel the same about this product as I do the moisturizer.  I use to purhase at a salon at a higher price and found I could purchase through Amazon at a lower price.</li>
    <li> IMAGE Ageless Line -&lt;br /&gt; This review is NOT for a product bought on Amazon -&lt;br /&gt;Image products tend to tingle burn the face it is the glytholic acid that does this.&lt;br /&gt;However when using other Image products combined they should moisture your face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I have gotten red but over time it stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not feel any burning tingling when using I wonder if product is expired or not original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suncreen doesn&#x27;t tingle burn etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the cleanser, the repair, resurfacing masque, the retinol, sunblock sunscreen tinted.&lt;br /&gt;Fine lines disappeared,  even color and Loved my results,</li>
    <li> This is not the real Image!! Bottle will not look like this when you order it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this regularly and I noticed my skin responding by the tighting. My skin appears radiant. thank you</li>
    <li> Great product my favorite facial cleanser will order again, fast delivery and no problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, previously purchasing it through my dermatologist in another state, at a rather hefty price.  Great product for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Great to use in my spa</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years and is still the best face wash. My skin is smooth and even using this. It takes about 2 weeks for the flaking to stop but that&#x27;s the glycolic acid working.</li>
    <li> Item was just as described and it arrived very quickly. It was a much better price than the salon. I will buy this item again.</li>
    <li> This product may work for other people but it dried my skin out like crazy! I have sensitive/dry skin and this just made it worse. I would wake up with dry patchy flakes all over my eyes, chin, and mouth, YUCK! I really wish this would have worked:( Although, I have recently found a great skincare line that works much better on my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s called Paula&#x27;s Choice, have already seen great improvement with me skin!</li>
    <li> Whether you use it often or once in awhile, it  is a great product, as are others in this line.</li>
    <li> This cleanser can take a while for your skin to adapt to the glycolic if you have never used this acid.  I experience dry flaky skin around my mouth after use.  i perfer this as a night time cleaser or every other day cleanser.  its very exfoliating but the results are worth gaining a tolerance level for future glycolic treatments.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite glycolic skin care wash.  When I have any bumps or pimple, I pat a dab on the spot and leave for 30 mins to 1 hr and then wash of. After  I apply a few times, the unwanted bump or spot will dry and fall off.  Very concentrated.  I use this on my face 2 or 3 times a week.  Just a half dime size amount with water and rub between palms to create lather and then rub on face in circular motion.  Works great to exfoliate with a round battery operated skin brush.  Excellent exfoliation.  Love this product.  Another one of the great Image Ageless skin care line.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely abrasive and burns my face.  If you have delicate skin do not mess with this.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It gets all the deep down dirt, makeup and grime out of my pores and makes my face feel clean. It looks clean too! With the use of their entire lineup, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. This gets 5stars for blowing every other cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried out of the water, keeping my acne clear and helping to reduce my pore size. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. After just one use it dried up my oily skin and helped dry up my breakouts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an acne treatment miracle potion. I wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday but I use it once a week but I  absolutely use it if I have a breakout.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for years.  I love the clean feeling plus the extra exfoliation from the glycolic acid.  I would recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes my face feel clean and soft.  I love being able to get the product through the mail instead of having to stop at a beauty salon that carries the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Cleanse and brightens my skin. And I use other image products for my face. O k</li>
    <li> I love this product!  If you aren&#x27;t using a facial cleanser daily, try this one, you will see and feel the difference in your skin.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment and excellent product</li>
    <li> This is more of an exfoliating cleanser with a lot of glycolicic acid in it.  I&#x27;ve been using Image for doe time now and this is the only one I&#x27;ll be sure to not buy again.  FYI the label is incomplete.  &amp;#34;Total&amp;#34; facial cleanser.  Hmm.  Okay.  If anything it ought to say Total Exfoliating Facial Cleanser.  It&#x27; so high in glycolicic acid.  Avoid letting it touch your lips and if even a tiny amount gets in your mouth it&#x27;ll likely numb your tongue.</li>
    <li> This stuff peeled the skin off of my face like a bad sunburn. Not ever using again.</li>
    <li> I love this product....it leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Used this for years highly recommend</li>
    <li> amazing, love it completely</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and love it!  It lasts for months, making it a great value for the price!  Leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed...does not overdry.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for my acne.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser but completely dried out my skin within a week of using it twice a day to the point that it was peeling. I switched to the Vitamin C cleanser from Image and it is much more moisturizing to my skin.</li>
    <li> Incredible product - makes your skin feel soft, de-ages skin, prevents break-outs. For very sensitive skin, I was told by an esthetician to use just a very little at first, or mix with your current cleanser, and increase as you build tolerance--although I found I could use it undiluted immediately. A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a great investment. Amazing...a fabulous product that is sensibly priced and does amazing things for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; (love that term &amp;#60;wry grin&amp;#62;) skin</li>
    <li> Cleanser contains glycol in acid so it&#x27;s a great was to get rid of dead skin without using abrasive exfoliator.  Leaves face feeling clean and bright</li>
    <li> Been using it for 8 years. Only the rarest of the rare breakouts. Like once a year.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves your skin with a glow, but be sure to hydrate your skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have been using Image Ageless cleanser for a couple of years.  I like the way the product removes makeup and leaves my skin soft.  I am so glad Amazon has this product so I don&#x27;t have to drive to a spa in a neighboring town.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for oily/problem aging skin.</li>
    <li> Can not say enough good things about this product. I have, no correction, HAD hyperpigmentation really bad on my face. It has improved 90% since using this and my skin is healthier, glowing, soft, etc. I use it religiously and HIGHLY reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I love image products they work well!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!! Perfect for oily skin. It removes my make up so well and keeps acne at bay</li>
    <li> Great cleanser.. wish I had found it years ago.  The first two weeks took some getting use to and I had to use extra lotion as my skin adjusted. Will continue to use it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, much cheaper that my dermatologist&#x27;s office. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. You can feel your skin tingle after massaging it for a minute so you know it is working.</li>
    <li> it is very drying. maybe I purchased the wrong cleanser, I found it to be too harsh for my skin type.  it might be helpful to put that info in the ad. maybe their is something else for sensitive skin type.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t live without this product! Helps control adult acne.</li>
    <li> perfect product and price</li>
    <li> It made my face breakout worse. This is not the same as in the store.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used...included the expensive ones everyone raves about.  This is good stuff and I&#x27;ve had compliments from plastic surgeons comment on my skin. This never happened before I started using this.</li>
    <li> This Cleanser  leaves great results  face feels super clean and along with the Ageless night cream the two work great together leaving good results.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Can someone tell me of it&#x27;s the same strength as what you buy in the salon? I&#x27;ve been paying three times this cost. Thanks.</li>
    <li> this product exfoliates my skin too much and makes my skin look flushed and pink</li>
