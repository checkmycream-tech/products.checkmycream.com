      <li>Good for tubes that do not roll.</li>
      <li>Love it works great and saves time</li>
      <li>Never thought I&#x27;d find this item and was so thrilled to receive the keys.</li>
      <li>Did slip a bit, so you have to make sure you get a good grip on the end of the tube.</li>
      <li>Husband is loving them.</li>
      <li>These &amp;#34;keys&amp;#34; really work best on aluminum tubes, not the plastic toothpaste tubes</li>
      <li>Makes it very easy to get everything out of the metal tube.</li>
      <li>This item is only going to work its best on metal tubes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Being able to squeeze all the gel out of the tube saves me many dollars.</li>
      <li>Much better than the flimsy plastic alternatives sold in drug stores.</li>
      <li>Glad this old-fashioned tool is still made.</li>
      <li>most toothpast comes in now.  </li>
      <li>and I was pleased to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Nice item, arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Very useful indeed :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to put on and take off.</li>
      <li>Works fine...</li>
      <li>Works fine, does the job.</li>
      <li>Strong and holds securely</li>
      <li>This metal tube roller was super helpful to get all of the product out of an metal tube of hair color!</li>
      <li>I have had this for a few months and it&#x27;s working perfectly..</li>
      <li>Good item and delivered early</li>
      <li>It also comes off the wound tube easily for a quick removal once the tube is used.</li>
      <li>Nice key for the hair color tubes! :)</li>
      <li>Since I have several products that will work with a key winder, I am quite happy with it!!</li>
      <li>I swear by these for my tubes of Wella Koleston hair dye, but they are really useful for toothpaste tubes, which, since they are made of a plastic now, are a pain to roll up as you use them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for a while and always struggled to get the last bit out of the tubes.</li>
      <li>This way I can make sure that I am able to use as much product as possible out of each tube.</li>
      <li>.no more, no less.</li>
      <li>Thanks for being so prompt!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Thank you much!</li>
      <li>a bit short for large hand cream tubes but better value than the $10 le&#x27;Occitane offering</li>
      <li>This is the perfect tool, it makes measuring product so much easier, and less messy</li>
      <li>Much stronger than anything like it in plastic.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend it to any one.</li>
      <li>This key is strong; seems built to last.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a good idea to roll tightly because some tubes loosen slightly when not in use.</li>
      <li>it keeps slipping off the tube,  its okay as long as the tube is almost completely used.  </li>
      <li>I will use this key for smaller tubes and continue the hunt for a longer key that&#x27;s strong like this one.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re well made, inexpensive and will last forever so rest assured they&#x27;re high quality and very useful little tools.</li>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. But it can destroy your tube</li>
    <li> Worked well to push out the paste.</li>
    <li> I just discovered this GREAT item! I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for a while and always struggled to get the last bit out of the tubes. This works like a charm and I use every bit of color! I also bought one for my toothpaste. You can use if for any tube. It&#x27;s really easy to put on and take off. GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Just wish it was a bit longer to accommodate larger tubes</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few months and it&#x27;s working perfectly..</li>
    <li> Good item and delivered early</li>
    <li> This product is small, but does a big boy job at getting anything out of a tube. I use it on toothpaste, and medical ointments. It get&#x27;s it all out with just a roll and a squeeze. A must have product for home or anywhere that you keep tubbed products. I highly reccomend it to any one.</li>
    <li> great value and ease of use</li>
    <li> This item is only going to work its best on metal tubes.  For a plastic tube you are going to need a device that squeezes the product out of the tube.  This key will not roll the plastic. Since I have several products that will work with a key winder, I am quite happy with it!! It also comes off the wound tube easily for a quick removal once the tube is used. Just slide it out of the center. It&#x27;s also a good idea to roll tightly because some tubes loosen slightly when not in use.</li>
    <li> Works great! Much better than the flimsy plastic alternatives sold in drug stores. Glad this old-fashioned tool is still made.</li>

    <li> Husband is loving them.</li>
    <li> Nice to get all of what you paid for out of those tubes!!  Makeup especially because it is expensive.  Anything in a tube!</li>
    <li> This key is strong; seems built to last.  I am sure it works perfectly on Color Tubes.  The reason for the &amp;#34;almost perfect&amp;#34; title is that the length of the key (excluding the grip) is just under 2 inches (5 cm) and I need a key like this for tubes of face scrub (slightly over 3 inches/7.7 cm).  I will use this key for smaller tubes and continue the hunt for a longer key that&#x27;s strong like this one.</li>
    <li> Nice key for the hair color tubes! :)</li>
    <li> I actually use these in the kitchen for tubes of tomato paste and tubes of sun dried tomatoes. Makes it very easy to get everything out of the metal tube. These are not for plastic tubes. I have seen my hairdresser use these on tubes of hair color so I know they work well on all metal tubes. If you get any cream or ointment in a metal tube, you may as well pick up one or two of these. We have them in the kitchen and others in bathrooms. I don&#x27;t recommend using the same roller key for eczema cream and tomato paste. They&#x27;re well made, inexpensive and will last forever so rest assured they&#x27;re high quality and very useful little tools. OH! Metal tubes of paint, I forgot that I use them on tubes of paint! So it seems we use these for everything. Very useful indeed :)</li>
    <li> I swear by these for my tubes of Wella Koleston hair dye, but they are really useful for toothpaste tubes, which, since they are made of a plastic now, are a pain to roll up as you use them. Try one of these. Tube slides in on one side of the Key and turning it is a breeze. Without this key, I&#x27;d waste alot of hair dye or worse, risk popping the tube open (horrors!)</li>
    <li> This item is both durably constructed and does the job &#x27;at hand&#x27; as well. It eliminates time spent extracting tube contents, not to mention waste!</li>
    <li> This little key does what is supposed to. . .no more, no less.</li>
    <li> Works fine, does the job.</li>

    <li> Works fine...a bit short for large hand cream tubes but better value than the $10 le&#x27;Occitane offering</li>
    <li> Good for tubes that do not roll.</li>
    <li> These &amp;#34;keys&amp;#34; really work best on aluminum tubes, not the plastic toothpaste tubes most toothpast comes in now.  The aluminum holds the bend in the key - the plastic just slips out.</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Returned it.</li>
    <li> Nice item, arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Does the job it is made to do. Much stronger than anything like it in plastic.</li>
    <li> it keeps slipping off the tube,  its okay as long as the tube is almost completely used.  but before that it is useless.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d find this item and was so thrilled to receive the keys. Thank you much! I use a product called Voltaren and the tube is very hard to squeeze but the key is the answer. I recently moved and my key got lost in the transaction. Being able to squeeze all the gel out of the tube saves me many dollars. Thanks for being so prompt!</li>
    <li> Helps avoid holes/leaks in tube.</li>
    <li> Did not keep the tube tightly wound. Ended up falling off when I took the tube from the medicine cabinet</li>
    <li> I was most disappointed with this product.  It does not hold the rolled tube in place.</li>
    <li> Worked well with hair color tubes.  Did slip a bit, so you have to make sure you get a good grip on the end of the tube.</li>
    <li> Strong and holds securely</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  I wish I had purchased these sooner.</li>
    <li> Love it works great and saves time</li>
