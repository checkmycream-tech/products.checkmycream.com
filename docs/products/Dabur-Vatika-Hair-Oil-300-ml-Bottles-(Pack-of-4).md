      <li>Love it especially in summer, takes care of my hair pretty well and is easy to absorb into my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very gritty if you rub it in your hands first to warm it up to apply to your hair.</li>
      <li>What can I say other than I&#x27;m in love with vatika!?</li>
      <li>I ordered more the very next day.</li>
      <li>The smell is different than most beauty products because it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.</li>

      <li>So it&#x27;s a pain to thaw it all the time with hot water.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>great when mixed with other oils.</li>
      <li>The smell is not loud or overwhelming.</li>
      <li>He had 10 single hairs on the top of his head when he started using this.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I didn&#x27;t like the smell of pure coconut oil in my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I am really impressed-- especially since previously I had very gradually lost hair on the top of my head for the past 20 years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I left this to melt at room temp and its fine by me.</li>
      <li>I really tried with this product, I tried to ignore the smell</li>
      <li>What I really like, is</li>
      <li>It was delivered fast and as described.</li>
      <li>Second, coconut oil is ALWAYS solid unless it&#x27;s warm.</li>
      <li>The scent is unique and is reminiscent of a spicy coconut.  </li>
      <li>When I first saw it and first started buying coconut oil to aide in softening and helping my hair grow, I never expected this product to smell like lemon and henna.</li>
      <li>Mixed with a conditioner, this product is an outstanding deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to others.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the seller and the products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also growing a little faster this soon :)</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;ve read that this has thickenend, and grown hair faster than normal rates.</li>
      <li>Though it will last a long time, I bought more because it works so well</li>
      <li>This is a must buy if you want the feeling of baby soft hair!    </li>
      <li>I have 4c type hair, and this is the only product that makes my very course hair soft, and straight.</li>
      <li>This product has a different type of consistency and can be used as a hot treatment.</li>
      <li>Third, it definitely makes your hair more soft and less dry very quickly.</li>
      <li>My hair is always soft, shiny, smells like lemon.</li>
      <li>It helps my natural hair stay curly, soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended by the natural hair community on you-tube</li>
      <li>it makes my skin and hair sooo soft .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Vatika Oil (which is a really mix of coconut oil, neem, brahmi, amla, bahra, kapur kachiri, henna, rosemary oil, lemon oil and milk.) It comes in a pretty, well-designed green bottle that almost looks like a piece of art on the shelf.  don&#x27;t like the smell of oil (that sometimes smells a bit like rancid mothballs.) But, I can deal with the smell, since you&#x27;re only supposed to keep it on for a few hours or overnight.    The milk is also a mild form of a light protein treatment (but I&#x27;m sure heat would be needed).    So far, so good. I have less breakage and my hair seems to be growing a little bit, and thickening. When I leave it on overnight, (unlike other oils), my hair seems to become extremely moisturized from Vatika. My gray hairs don&#x27;t seem to be darkening any, however, in spite of the addition of the henna. You only get 10.14 fl oz per bottle, but this should last for a while. But, I suggest, depending on what the Amazon prices are, comparison shop to get the best deals.</li>
    <li> I am a newbie. I did the big chop a week ago. How ever I have been using Vatika on my 3c-4a hair texture for a couple of months. I love the results. The smell is not loud or overwhelming. My hair is soft,shiny and well moisturized. Best of all there is no shedding. It has become a part of my daily regiment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for about a month now and I&#x27;ve been trying products out in hopes to soften and moisturize my hair. This product was recommended by the natural hair community on you-tube so I decided to give it a try. Let&#x27;s just say this will be in my hair care regimen for a very long time. Not only did it soften my 4a-4c hair texture which is as coarse as it gets, it also helps seal in moisture and the ingredients are all natural and essential. What can I say other than I&#x27;m in love with vatika!? Where has vatika been all my life??? This is a must buy if you want the feeling of baby soft hair!    Also I&#x27;ve read that this has thickenend, and grown hair faster than normal rates. I&#x27;ll just have to sit back and wait for that experience...</li>
    <li> I love this product! In conjunction with my Amla by Dabur this product is a keeper. My hair loves this product. Whenever my hair is breaking and or shedding I can always depend on this product to whip it back into shape. A little goes a long ways, I notice that my hair is literally thriving from this product. I highly recommend this product to others. I always have at least 3 bottles handy at a time because I use it so much, and HATE to run out.</li>
    <li> Oil smells wonderful. Soothes dry skin, hair, feet...you name it and it does the job.  Downfall, oil hardens if temperatures drops to cool.  Warm in microwave for 30 seconds then it pours out like silky oil.</li>
    <li> This product has a different type of consistency and can be used as a hot treatment. It can also be used everyday and overnight. It works on any hair type and I am very glad about that. Everyone in my household has a different hair type and every morning we all use the same product, I even use it on my baby&#x27;s hair. It smells good and is easy to rinse from hair when needed. Though it will last a long time, I bought more because it works so well and I never want to be without it. It is well worth the price and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a while back to use on my hair.  Its light and has a pleasant scent.  To warm, I let it sit in a basin of warm water for just about a minute or two.  My hair is soft and lovely after using this.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t like the smell of pure coconut oil in my hair.  This works wonderful and smells great too.  What I really like, is my husband can use it every morning, similar to a hair gel, without smelling perfumy; and in about a months time his hair has gained back its&#x27; natural strawberry blonde, and it is so soft again!  I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July --  husband has been using this product every morning as a softener/hair cream; he rubs it into his scalp to moisturize it.  He had 10 single hairs on the top of his head when he started using this.  He is no longer balding, half of his head is covered in hair and new growth is always coming in.  I don&#x27;t know what else we can attribute this to because this product is all he&#x27;s done different.  I don&#x27;t have to tell you how pleased he is with this product. Thanks so much! I am getting out the shears, he needs haircuts again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November --  My last update for this product. My H has almost a full head of hair again.  He is still rubbing a dab every morning into his scalp \hair.  His hair has No gray what so ever, and it is sooooo soft and healthy feeling.  One thing that I ought to add though, we do Not use shampoo of any kind.  We use Coconut oil bar soap only.  That might make a difference or not.  Anyway, Excellent product.</li>
    <li> If you are loosing your hair this is a product to try it helped me grow my hair back. I will buy this product as soon as I run out. It was delivered fast and as described.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product a couple years ago to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has long (mid-back), curly, coarse hair that becomes a tangled mess if not handled properly.  After using Vatika Hair Oil for a few days, I noticed that her hair was softer, shinier and stronger.  I could oil her hair daily and the product did not weigh it down.  I even use it as a base whenever I flat iron her hair.  Mixed with a conditioner, this product is an outstanding deep conditioner.  Recently, I started using the product in my own hair and have experienced excellent results.  The scent is unique and is reminiscent of a spicy coconut.  It is subtle and not overpowering.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.    On a final note, I was was extremely pleased with the prompt service and price that the vendor provided for the 4-pack.  I received the product much earlier than the estimated delivery date.  I will definitely use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> The heck with the smell, it does not bother me because I have used coconut-based products in the past. What counts more is the good this oil has done for my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Dabur product for three months now and I am really impressed-- especially since previously I had very gradually lost hair on the top of my head for the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this hair oil, I have noticed new growth-- amazing for someone in his sixties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I have begun to use Dakur shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product.  Been using this product for about a month.  I have relaxed hair with very thick new growth.  This made my new growth soft enough that I can comb it without feeling like I’m pulling my hair out. I used a little bit every other day.  No build up and the smell is pleasant.  Have to remember that when it’s cold, I have to hold the bottle under hot running water for about 45 seconds to emulsify the product because it is an oil and turn solid when it’s cold.  Love this.</li>
    <li> I love the softness in my hair after using this, smells lovely too!.&lt;br /&gt;It tamed my mother&#x27;s curly hair, removed the frizzies nicely :).</li>
    <li> I really tried with this product, I tried to ignore the smell but I couldn&#x27;t any longer. Even in small amount the smell looms around your head like an unwanted malodorous aura. I&#x27;m sure that it keeps hair healthy and soft but at what cost??? I will stick to regular coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I have used Vatika Coconut Oil for my hair for almost 2 years now.  I burned my hair with a perm and subsequent straightening.  Had to cut my hair in a pixie January 2012 due to it breaking off and horrible split ends.  I have used Vatika oil since then on my scalp and length.  I have had one hair cut since then in June 2013.  My hair is now bra strap length and crazy shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vatika oil solidifies in cold weather or air conditioned homes because coconut oil is a solid in temps under 70-75 degrees.  I melt the oil and pour into a wide mouth jar (like used for body butters).  The wide mouth enables me to scrap out some Vatika and melt in my hand and apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply Vatika to my scalp and length of hair overnight about once a week.  I use it in my damp ends after shampooing.  I use it in my daughters hair too.  My hair is growing very fast, about half an inch to an inch a month.  My hair is strong and gorgeous.  I won&#x27;t use anything else but Vatika.</li>
    <li> Of all Vatika products I like this the best. I use it once a week. I put it on late evening and leave it in over night. It brightens my hair color, gives it shine and bounce. My hair feels thicker. If I stop using it my hair is very limp, drab color. Like nite and day.</li>
    <li> Love it. It makes my hair really soft and helps bring out the curl pattern. It is so much more manageable. It&#x27;s also growing a little faster this soon :)</li>
    <li> This hair oil is of good quality and easy to use. You can use it for your hair or skin. It has mild fragrance and is very clear and of good quality. The biggest problem is it freezes quite a bit, even at ~65-70 degrees. So it&#x27;s a pain to thaw it all the time with hot water.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time. Use this product weekly as a scalp massage, and a hot oil treatment. My hair is always soft, shiny, smells like lemon. Highly recommend the seller and the products.</li>
    <li> Wow, some of these reviews are painful to read because people have no idea what they are talking about. First of all, this is called \\&quot;coconut oil\\&quot; because it IS coconut oil. It does smell like coconut oil (real coconut not the artificial crap that you get in most lotions) and herbs. The smell is different than most beauty products because it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume. At first, it reminded me of a thai restaurant, but I&#x27;ve learned to like it more. Also I only wear it at night and overnight for deep conditioning so the public doesn&#x27;t know what my head smells like. Second, coconut oil is ALWAYS solid unless it&#x27;s warm. You do NOT have to melt it in a  bowl of water, you can just remove the inner cap or squeeze the bottle really hard until you get a chunk out. Then melt in in your hands and put on your head. Easy!! Third, it definitely makes your hair more soft and less dry very quickly. I haven&#x27;t used it long term yet, but overall I am very happy with this products ability and cost. Worth the investment. PS I got the \\&quot;Export quality.\\&quot; Apparently there is an enriched, an export quality and one that doesn&#x27;t say export quality and Im not sure what the differences are.</li>
    <li> I ordered the four pack and I have already used this in my hair.  The consistancy is good enough for my 4a/4b hair and I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.  You are instructed to pierce the top cover to extract the oil.  The bottles are about 10 oz. I left this to melt at room temp and its fine by me.</li>
    <li> Love the product works great on my daughters and my hair too, it came fast. The only thing is the oil turns into a clumpy cream but once u put it in ur hair it turns bck to oil...???? will be buying more soon</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I have 4c type hair, and this is the only product that makes my very course hair soft, and straight. I ordered more the very next day.</li>
    <li> Been using this for YEARS!!!! and I absolutely love it! Will always use!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product. Love the smell. Excellent as a hot oil treatment.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil a couple years ago.  I use it after showers while my hair is wet. It helps my natural hair stay curly, soft and manageable.  It works great as a deep conditioner in a pinch.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> A GREAT PRODUCT for hair and skin. I&#x27;am a naturalista and I fell in love with this product it makes my skin and hair sooo soft . My hair is growing and my skin is glowing .Such a great product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> great when mixed with other oils. Protects hair from heat damage, prevents damage (processed African American hair), and tames new growth. I noticed when i apply the oil to my scalp and work up a sweat (working out) my hair has a raunchy smell. It can be very oily so be cautious when applying to thin hair. Otherwise, its a great product. (Used for over a year with other essential oils combined; Jamaican castor, neem, and almond oil). Good Luck!</li>
    <li> This stuff made my hair grow and my daughters hair grow will buy again also it came quick in the mail</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. When I first saw it and first started buying coconut oil to aide in softening and helping my hair grow, I never expected this product to smell like lemon and henna. I love the smell of coconut and so does my boyfriend. We were both very disappointed! It&#x27;s very tough to get out of the bottle unless you put the closed bottle in under warm/hot water, and wait awhile to get it out. It&#x27;s also very gritty if you rub it in your hands first to warm it up to apply to your hair. I am not impressed and will never buy this product again. I gave all my bottles away to a co-worker who enjoys smelling of a Giant Lemon!</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles for my 4C very coarse dry hair and after using it the first time...OMG!!!.My hair&#x27;s soft shiny and alround lovely.The smell isn&#x27;t a distraction and while it freezes quite often just put some in your hands and rub them together and it melts faster than butter. Try it and I&#x27;m African American.</li>
    <li> Love it especially in summer, takes care of my hair pretty well and is easy to absorb into my hair. In the winter I have to rub it between my hands and then it&#x27;ll go, but it can be hard so thats the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it. Otherwise it seals the oil in my hair well, smells alright, and is a quality product. I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> Really light on the hair, not crazy buildup, moisturizes scalp really great.  My husband won&#x27;t use anything else.  Cost effective also.</li>
