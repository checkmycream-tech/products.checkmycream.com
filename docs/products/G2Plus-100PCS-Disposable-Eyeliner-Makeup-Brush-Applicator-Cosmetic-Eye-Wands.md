      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but they look like they will be perfect!!!!  : )</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
      <li>AND they came in cute zip-close packaging, which makes for travel nice and orderly!  </li>
      <li>Good for eyeliner, and healthy.</li>
      <li>Clients can get a really precised look &amp; they leave happy!</li>
      <li>Good service and adequate packaging.  </li>
      <li>I suggest packing these better.</li>
      <li>I would suggest that these are better served in the hands of more skilled makeup artists.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have these.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that I love everything about them.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
      <li>The brushes are okay.</li>
      <li>LOVE these.  </li>
      <li>Perfect little disposable &#x27;brushes&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>Love these, they are very convenient !</li>
      <li>Personally, I prefer them that way because I will be able to create a line with just the very tip of the brush, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>I use these not so much for eyeliner (I use my brushes for that) but to make sure false eyelashes are put in the right place.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional Makeup artist.  </li>
      <li>VERY VERY SMALL, but good for eyeliner not really for lips.....</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re small and so are the brush tips, which I&#x27;m fine with.  </li>
      <li>Halloween makeup designs are often messy and sticky, so it&#x27;s nice that I can just dispose of these once they&#x27;re a mess without losing a lot of money.</li>
      <li>Received it faster than what I expected ;-)</li>
      <li>Another user said the hairs are stiff and it&#x27;s true.</li>

<li> Especially since my eyes are small.</li>
<li> Having said that, I do appreciate how sharp a line you can get with them and know that it can be attributed in part to their sturdy structure.  </li>
<li> So I decided to just try them for little things;  </li>
<li> The brush is too firm</li>
<li> I wanted these wands for gel eye liner application, but they are too stiff for that purpose.</li>
<li> I wish the bristles were not as stiff.</li>
<li> Even after softening them with my fingers and a little water, these applicators are VERY stiff.  </li>
<li> I use these for making thin lines and wrinkles for Halloween makeup</li>
<li> I tried them as false eyelash applicators and worked</li>
<li> Gets in very small spaces!  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a professional Makeup artist.  I use these not so much for eyeliner (I use my brushes for that) but to make sure false eyelashes are put in the right place.  Gets in very small spaces!  LOVE these.  AND they came in cute zip-close packaging, which makes for travel nice and orderly!  Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> So I am truly impressed with these.  I&#x27;d never used these before. So I decided to just try them for little things;  However, I&#x27;ve found that I love everything about them.

    <li> Is not what i expect.</li>

    <li> Love these, they are very convenient ! great deal for a great price!</li>
    <li> Item as described.  Good service and adequate packaging.  Use for liquid liners, not gel liners!</li>
    <li> The brush is too firm</li>
    <li> Good for eyeliner, and healthy.</li>
    <li> VERY VERY SMALL, but good for eyeliner not really for lips.....</li>
    <li> Not only do I use these to apply my gel eyeliner, I use them to apply glue to my falsies. I&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>

    <li> Perfect little disposable &#x27;brushes&#x27;.  I use these for making thin lines and wrinkles for Halloween makeup and they&#x27;re a big help.  Halloween makeup designs are often messy and sticky, so it&#x27;s nice that I can just dispose of these once they&#x27;re a mess without losing a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Great size. The wand is the perfect length also.</li>

    <li> These are so very handy.  Always having to look for my eyeliner pencil so I&#x27;m glad to have these.</li>
    <li> Got them in time!  Great product!</li>
    <li> The brushes are okay. They&#x27;re small and so are the brush tips, which I&#x27;m fine with.  Another user said the hairs are stiff and it&#x27;s true. Personally, I prefer them that way because I will be able to create a line with just the very tip of the brush, but that&#x27;s just me. Also, the brushes arrived in a ripped plastic case. When I took it out of the shipping box, all my brushes spilled on the floor. I suggest packing these better.</li>
