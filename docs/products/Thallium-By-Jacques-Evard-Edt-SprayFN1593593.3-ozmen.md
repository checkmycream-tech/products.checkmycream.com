<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> More flowery than I expected but still masculine</li>
    <li> This is a good addition to any collection. It gives you a fresh powdery smell, but something that still is masculine. If your familiar and like Joop! , then you&#x27;ll approve of Thallium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s :&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap as dirt&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Bottle&lt;br /&gt;- Long Lasting (5-7 hrs on skin - 12-24 on clothes)&lt;br /&gt;- good for any occasion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;- Flimsy packaging&lt;br /&gt;- sprayer is not the best&lt;br /&gt;- I should have bought 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Love this item beefing using this for a few years now and it&#x27;s great price for an awesome smell!</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> Decent fragrance overall but doesnt last long...bottle is cheapyly made....</li>
    <li> This cologne I received was ridiculous. It was extremely water down &amp; barley has a scent to it. In order to get any scent from this fragrance I must spray my clothes &amp; or skin at least 10 times. But even that, the smell vanishes quickly. Overall, I don&#x27;t like it &amp; would not bother buying it again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells WONDERFUL. I get many compliments on it, just wish it lasted longer. The price is FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> Great smell, just doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> Smells like chanel allure sport at a cheaper price but not a cheap brand at all. Nuff said.</li>
    <li> I call this a cheaper sleeper. Quality Juice Thanks Coach Rob on youtube!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to this a lot based on all the reviews.  Sadly this was a HUGE disappointment !! I opened it right away while I was out in the garage and gave the air a light single mist.  The smell was really odd and I couldn&#x27;t quite figure out what it reminded me of.  When I left for work the next morning (12 hrs later) the smell was still there very faint.  I figured, what the heck lets give it a shot and maybe the body chemistry will change the smell.  So I gave myself a single spray.  I&#x27;ll give it this it lasts all day which is a good thing, however by the end of the day I finally realized what it reminded me of.  The smell of this reminds me of the standard &amp;quot;OLD LADY&amp;quot;  My wife asked me what that smell was and I was ashamed to tell her that it was me.  My wife and I are both 30 years old and this certainly doesn&#x27;t appeal.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE SMELL WHICH TOUCHES MY TASTE.</li>
    <li> this a great one it has its own unique scent i love it plus i dont gotta worry about to many people having this on.</li>
    <li> After smelling me, girls be like...damn boyyyyyy sup? Can I get cho numba? And I&#x27;m all like. Yep.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne months ago and I would like to say,Yuuuum!!!!I consider this cologne as a club scene type not your typical everyday smell.if you want to smell good and have the ladies go wild purchase this</li>
    <li> I have this cologne and I&#x27;m telling you the women come sniffing at my chest and I get nothing but smiles and told I smell like shower sex yep buy this</li>
    <li> Smells great as expected, shipped quick. Done deal.</li>
    <li> this cologne smells very different. is so atracctive. I recommend this fragrance  for romantic persons</li>
    <li> This is really a unisex smell. There is a female version, but it does not smell as sexy. It smells manly on a man, and sweet on a woman. A true hybrid smell.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s not what i expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these already, my bf loves it.  The smell is a amazing and the price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Smells great and at a decent price</li>
    <li> This smells similar to a cologne I used to have from Banana Republic.  I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t remember the name of it.  However, this cologne is much more refined and complex than the BR product.  The BR cologne was too sweet.  This is sweet smelling too but not tickle-the-back-of-your-throat sweet.</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome. It smells amazing. It is masculine and is long lasting.</li>
    <li> The smell is great! Get lots of compliments. Very sweet and sexy smelling. Really cheap! Do not hesitate to buy! Will last for years hopefully.</li>
    <li> Very nice cologne.  I love it.</li>
    <li> One spray to the back of your neck is all you need, this will last for hours, best at night or fall/ winter scent.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews on this cologne I decided to take a chance and ordered it from Amazon. Got it very fast, genuine product and a fresh inventory (09/2014 i believe per date on the box). I had thought all these reviews couldn&#x27;t be wrong. They all can&#x27;t be people who love something like this. How much sweet could it be?  And then I sprayed it on the back of my hand. Once. This thing is potent and I got a cloyingly sweet woman&#x27;s perfume. This is too sweet even for women !!! There is not a molecule of masculinity in this concoction. And it&#x27;s not some disgustingly bad smell that makes you wretch, no, not at all . Simply put this is not a man&#x27;s fragrance. I cannot believe there are so many men out there (who&#x27;ve supposedly written these reviews) that enjoy smelling like a dated , extremely sweet woman&#x27;s perfume. Dated because I don&#x27;t think a young woman (teens, 20s) would wear this either, they usually prefer somewhat lighter flowery perfumes.  If for you there is no such thing as too much sweet and the idea of drenching yourself with a big jug of high fructose corn syrup is something you dream about , you may enjoy this. I was hoping it would have atleast some freshness/citrusy/aquatic/herbal/spicy/woody tone that I could justify as being something masculine. Nope, it sticks with syrup. I have to say the longevity is incredible. 9+ hrs and i could still smell it on my hand. I was just hoping no one else could smell me although this would create a good size cloud around you.  My other colognes are classic men&#x27;s fragrances like old spice, bleu de chanel and I tried to get something different. Lesson learnt. No more sweet.  ps: I&#x27;ll be glad to send my bottle to any ladies that have smelt and liked this for themselves.</li>
    <li> Absolute, 100% knock-out, drop dead, chicks will want to sniff you and get all up on you type of goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne has the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; factor.  Smell awesome but not overpowering, two sprays and my shirts still smell fantastic in the morning.  My girlfriend agrees, and a few female co-workers have commented on how good it smells.  (Quick note, I rarely wear cologne to work, it just helps on those days you need a pick me up!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent last quite a long time, strong initially but it wears quite well and a few minutes post spray you&#x27;ll have em begging to get a little closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being put off by this cologne, it&#x27;s delicious and it will last.  You owe it to yourself to buy a bottle and add it to the collection (if you have such a thing, I don&#x27;t...).</li>
    <li> Got this for my Hubby and my son! We are a house of Thallium lovers lol Damn, it smells good!!!! That&#x27;s why we buy so many at one time!! Fast shipping, perfect products!</li>
    <li> I bought seven bottles of cologne all together and I  have enjoyed all but this one. The pump and the cap broke it my hand on about the third use. Its put together with pieces that interlock and snap together and fall apart each time you attempt to use it...What a disappointment.  I will not be buying this again....Garbage spray mechanism.</li>
    <li> Item was received on time and is as described.  Bought as gift, so I cannot comment any further.</li>
    <li> Great smelling....  I have bought all of the fragrances from Thallium. I find that they can be used by both men &amp; woman.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally in love this this line!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!  10 Stars.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big into fragrances, and this was my first cologne purchase in years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I would recommend this cologne. However, I did think it smelled like women&#x27;s perfume when I first sprayed it. It is very sweet-smelling at first, and I have since gotten used to it to where I can smell the faint musky side of it too. It is definitely different than the handful of scents I have sampled/bought in the past. I mainly like it because I haven&#x27;t seen it in stores where I&#x27;m from and I don&#x27;t know anybody else who wears it. Actually smells really good now that I have warmed up to it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it takes a LOT of squirts to make it last more than just an hour.  Next time, I&#x27;ll just spend a little extra and get something that will last.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. Its one of those gems not many know about. I heard about it from a lesbian that said it was a panty dropper, and wow was she right. This stuff smells amazing. i love it and most importantly the girls love it.</li>
    <li> Was given to me as a gift and love it.No more to say</li>
    <li> Currently my favorite of all the scents my husband wears.</li>
    <li> This scent is horrible smells like an old man! What a waste of $ Yves St. Stinky! Wish I  could return it!</li>
    <li> Product arrived next day even though it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be available for 3 more days Very satisfied!!!! Thallium is a favorite of mine</li>
    <li> This parfume is so amazing,I loved</li>
    <li> Very nice, very mild not strong and stay all day.</li>
    <li> Smells really great, it&#x27;s sweet and a bit floral and not overbearing. The moment I smelled it, it felt immediately familiar. The smell took me back to a trip through nostalgia, but I couldn&#x27;t place when and where....then it hit me. Dunhill Desire! This smells exactly, if not very similar to it for a fraction of the price. I used to use it back when I was in high school in 2005, that&#x27;s why it smelled so familiar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it smells absolutely great!</li>
    <li> smells more like a ladies perfume does last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;m using this cologne and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great smelling fragrance, the wife wears it as well. Gonna try the sport and the black next</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance. the smell loves all women , they ask all the time . I recommend it with my eyes closed .</li>
    <li> Luv this scent!! Sophisticated one of a kind scent, I keep this scent in stock for my fiancé ! Sexy!</li>
    <li> This cologne is a little to sweet for me. If you like unisex cologne this would be a good buy for you. I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Received many compliments on the fragrance. It cost about  half of the Hugo Boss I got for Xmas, and to tell the truth I like it better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGANCE, IT HAS THAT SCENT THAT INVOLVE ANY LADY AROUND, THEY SMELL IT LIKE A DOG WHEN IT FEEL THE PERCEPCION OF SOMETHING, IT IS SMOOTH, IT IS SEXY, AND IT HAS THAT FEELING OF POSSESS ME FOR EVER THAT IS SO GREAT.</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance. Price was great. Had not used Thallium before but gave it a shot. Recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I used this cologne before and the women LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this stuff is the bomb, my wife loves it, very unusual and distinctive scent, get it, you wont regret it. Recommended</li>
    <li> Now that&#x27;s what I call the knock out. I just received this and sprayed a lil on and WOWZERS. The lil woman was all over me. A must get for your go to cologne !</li>
    <li> Great smell. This is not a light summer type of fragrance, it is heavier. For the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> This Thallium does the job. The smell last about 3 - 4 hrs and overspraying a little will get you thru a 9 hr work day :) happy with it for sure. The smell was not as fresh/sweet as I had hoped but it is not Musty either.</li>
    <li> Quite surprised. Very pleasant scent. Also a gift.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first bottle of Thallium a couple of years ago from a kiosk in a local mall.  I think I paid about $60 at that time.  The scent is mellow and sensuous.  I was into swing dancing at the time and was amazed at the number of ladies that commented on how much they liked the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and at under $20 at Amazon it&#x27;s a steal.  If you prefer a more robust scent this may not be the one for you - but your lady will love it.</li>
    <li> Love the product and will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my son, and he absolutely loved it. For the price this is defiantly a good buy!!</li>
    <li> Like the fragrance a lot. My wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> This is the best for its price. I have used thallium black and both of these smell good. If you like it strong try Thallium black else if u play better with soft yet pleasant should definitely try this!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts really long! Doesn&#x27;t wanna fade away soon. That is also what makes it a better choice!</li>
    <li> Great smelling and at a wonderful price.. My girlfriend loves the smell of this and I wear quite a few fragrances. But she loves the smell of this.</li>
    <li> Exactly as discribed. Highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Came at a fantastic price. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Have bought this a few times now. great scent lasts for hours. people always say how good it smells. First time i bought this was in the store for 60+ dollars. Always checking amazon first from now on</li>
    <li> I swear this thing is laced with pheromones. My husband puts it on and I can smell him before I see him. I&#x27;ve passed men wearing it on the street to have it pull me out of my train of thought and look around to make sure it&#x27;s not my husband. It drives me crazy, in a good way.</li>
    <li> The scent is very pleasant &amp; lasts longer than most other colognes in this price range, which in my book makes it a real bargain..</li>
    <li> I bought it for my bro bday gift. I think it was suppose to be $60 but I found it on sale for $20 here on amazon and I was scared it probably be fake. I told him to tell me wheter it fake? IT IS REAL! I was shocked.... cheap and real? lol, I fall on my head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what i expected.didn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love it. That is all I care.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells really good... This is very cheap and very rare... they sell them in some places in the mall but for a really expensive price</li>
    <li> When I first met my boyfriend, he always smelled so good, but this scent wasn&#x27;t one that I recognized. He told me it was Thallium, his favorite - I had never heard of it. He told me that if I was ever struggling to find a present for him, that a bottle of this cologne would due just fine by him. I was a little reluctant to start that tradition, as typically cologne is pretty pricey. But Christmas came along and I needed a present for him, so I did a search for said cologne. I was pleasantly surprised to see how affordable it was and happily ordered a bottle for my man (little did he know how inexpensive it was on Amazon, as he had spent over $40 per bottle at a kiosk in the mall). Come Christmas, he was thrilled to receive his present and I was thrilled to have a good smelling man! This cologne has become a staple present he receives for just about every holiday now, and he&#x27;s always ecstatic when he sees that familiar shaped box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have never thought that such an inexpensive cologne could smell so good. It has a very pleasant, cool and crisp, yet subtly sweet scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering, even when over applied. It sits nicely on clothing and never sours in smell. This little bottle of cologne has given my long time favorite scent, Aqua Di Gio, a run for its money!</li>
    <li> Nice long lasting cologne. Maybe not the best fragance like some say but pretty good and cheap. Its great as a daily fragrance for work and just chilling.</li>
    <li> Thallium has successfully blended a decent cologne base with a big ol&#x27; helping of grandmas bath salts and insect repellant. It&#x27;s cloying (and most times nauseating) aroma will leave you desperate for a shower moments after application. Lovely packaging.</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance and delivery is fast</li>
    <li> I just received my order today which I have been anxiously waiting for (tracking the package etc. lol)! My friend introduced me to this cologne as the &#x27;Panty Dropper&#x27;. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it! It has a sweet manly smell to it.. it&#x27;s not overpowering at all but in the same sense keeps it sensual in a manly way. I&#x27;ve heard people say they have to &#x27;bathe&#x27; in the spray but I sprayed mines a hour or more ago and I still smell it. But since it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell, if you do have to do that then it won&#x27;t be too bad as to where some scents I have ie: my Burberry Brit, it would be too much.     I bought this hoping that with this extremely low price I would get a great product. At my mall it retail&#x27;s for $60 and on sale $40. Seeing I wanted this so bad I trusted my fave site Amazon with this low deal and the super saver shipping and handling. I received it 3 days after ordering and I will continue to buy my colognes and more from here!! Great product, great price! Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Not your typical male musky fragrance but different, pleasant , sexy not heavy not light but just right</li>
    <li> Every man should have Thallium on his dresser. The fragrance is just suburb. Smells great and it lingers on and on and on.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very light and refreshing. I do get a lot of compliments on the smell (when it can be smelt). The only downside to this cologne is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> The cologne refused to spray and it was a big mess. I&#x27;ve always loved men&#x27;s cologne and when my wife and I smelled this at the mall we had to have it. I love the smell not this bottle. I ordered another one from another seller for my wife and it works.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments from the ladies when they hug me. Thallium is a great product and I would purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling cologne everrr! I love this cologne. I will buy more in the future. All the ladies love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Smells Great and you get a really good amount. A must buy at this price!</li>
    <li> A little too Feminine for Me ????</li>
    <li> I like this scent.I don&#x27;t often buy without knowing what I am getting or know the scent.But my opinion is Thallium has a woodsy smell and I read someone mentioned Cedar similarity and I love the scent of cedar.But that&#x27;s not the complete list of what I can list as the scent I notice.Lavender is another reminder but not overpowering.I do think it smells more expensive than it is.</li>
    <li> I love the design of the bottle and box. The cologne smells amazing, not too strong but enough to please my senses</li>
    <li> great cologne for men...spray very little and it gets even better thru the day!</li>
    <li> This smells great. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance and bought it. The price is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and an endorsement by Ryan Seacrest on KISS-FM morning show.  Great clean scent for those Fri/Sat night excursions...Super customer service experience.</li>
    <li> not what i was hoping,i bought this based off the review&#x27;s,it&#x27;s not bad but just not my taste.it&#x27;s hard to describe the smell.. but one i really didn&#x27;t like, wish i could have gotten a sample first.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Lasts a while, too.</li>
    <li> Received the package in a timely fashion and saved money buying it thru Amazon. AMAZON is the way to go. Great job...</li>
    <li> Nice smell, not spicy soft vanilla scent. Already had comments from a younger lady LOL!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff regularly for about a year now. The first time I put it on and subsequently hugged a girl, she immediately told me, \\&quot;Wow, you smell really good...\\&quot; I smiled and went about my day like an average chump. But over the next few months I noticed something: every single time I wore this cologne, I would get the same reaction. From every girl. Every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you&#x27;re probably thinking I meant \\&quot;most girls\\&quot; or \\&quot;most times\\&quot;. No, I meant every girl over the last year, without fail. Apparently there is something in Thallium that makes a very large percentage of the female population melt, and I&#x27;m not sure why. I am happy with this product, though. It won&#x27;t help you overcome crippling social anxiety or general Chris Griffin-esque awkwardness, so I think it&#x27;s fair to say this stuff isn&#x27;t actually magic. But it&#x27;s the closest equivalent you will find.</li>
    <li> great cologne, great packaging !!! and at such a low price, great overall ...i highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;( age group 17 - 30 )</li>
    <li> Everything good. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great stuff &amp;#34;I like it &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Listen up guys! This is a really great scent!&lt;br /&gt;I smelled it a long time ago and forgot the name and was trying to remember. I bought this for my anniversary for my boyfriend. He is super picky about smells and most of them he hates, but I knew he would love this one.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very clean scent, it is not overpowering unless you spray it more than once in one spot. When it settles on the skin it leaves a very masculine woodsy smell, but that could be due to my boyfriend&#x27;s unique body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it! And I do too!&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for a bottle of this size, I think we paid the same for some cheap cologne for him that ended up smelling weird.&lt;br /&gt;If you can smell it before purchasing I always recommend that but if you want to take a chance on a  cologne, this is the one. It&#x27;s a great scent that isn&#x27;t like an old man smell or overpowering, it&#x27;s a great amount for the price and it shipped fast and got here just in time.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a new go to cologne check out this one because its totally worth it! And the ladies love it :)</li>
    <li> I thought the smell would not be as strong as it was. I will not be reordering this product again for my husband</li>
    <li> Great product perfect.</li>
    <li> Based on all the good reviews, I had high expectations. I took a chance and bought it online without having smelled it first. However when it arrived, my wife didn&#x27;t like the scent, and it cannot be returned. Maybe I use it for a white elephant gift.</li>
    <li> For myself this product is exceptional.  I have been looking for a patchouli blend for some time and this mixture is perfect i will definetly be purchasing this over and over.  I highly recomend this product!</li>
    <li> Love it, will buy it again. Smells awesome. It reminds me a lot of Dunhill Desire</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my bf and we both absolutely love it. It&#x27;s smells good without being overwhelming. And the price is awesome!👍👍👍</li>
    <li> i got carried away with the reviews.</li>
    <li> I have a remarkably hard time trying to find a scent I can actually wear without smelling like a trollop or like I was rolled in pee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is incredible. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s exactly \\&quot;panty dropper\\&quot;, but it certainly gets the attention of the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it might just be me, but I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;smelling like cookies\\&quot; effect another reviewer mentioned. It comes on kind of floral when it&#x27;s fresh, after that it mellows into a nice herb/warm spice mix with a light floral undertone and a slight touch of musk. Makes a good \\&quot;daily\\&quot; and could easily be worn at a function without seeming informal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If bought directly from Amazon, I can say that this is no knock-off, it is in fact REAL Thallium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: My wife loves it, I get comments from women I don&#x27;t know ALL THE TIME, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long - about 30-45 minutes.  Plus, you need to practically bathe in it (about 5 sprays) to have others smell it after 15 minutes.  I love the smell, but if there is an oil based alternative to this one, I&#x27;d like to know.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, GREAT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time . smells good. Super fast delivery. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got that perfume for my son since he was little now he is 18 yrs of age and I&#x27;m still getting he live it , smell really good</li>
    <li> My son loves it.  Great price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!. Value, scent, the full package of perfection in my opinion</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it!! Said she almost wanted to wear it herself!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells amazing. Compliments left and right!</li>
    <li> Well, the more I use this product, the more it is becoming my favorite cologne to go to.  Previously, I gave this product a 3 star rating.  However, I have changed my mind.  I love this cologne.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it smells good going on after about two or 3 hours starts to smell like alcohol.  May work better for you than me.  Some colognes work bette with different skin types.</li>
    <li> It does not last long the smell, but it is very good, the aroma&lt;br /&gt;and for that price it gives you a lot.For everyday use.</li>
    <li> Amazing all star product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product stands above all the many high end / high priced perfumes in the market,&lt;br /&gt;all you need is a very minimal quantity on your body to have nice fragrance all day .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High end classy perfume for unbelievable price !! that is what this is .... no supermodels no flashy commercials..just plain performance !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just bought one more as a gift to my brother !!</li>
    <li> Was a little hesitant with all the reviews about all the colognes from Amazons being fakes and watered down but for this price on my favorite cologne i thought i would take the risk. It does seem to fade away a little around 45 min. But if someone hugs you or gets close enough they will most definitely be able to smell it. Just not strong enough to smell if people walk by you 3-5 ft away.  I used to buy this cologne when i was younger for about 50 dollars so 20 for this is a steal. I just spray a little more when i go out. SMELLS SO AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Probably the best inexpensive/budget fragrance in the market today ( $15 to $20 US for a 3.4 Oz ), a real bargain for what you get; Nice night sweet but masculine scent, projection and longevity are great a 10/10 on both of those scores IMO, I&#x27;m definitely buying it again ; This one is my favorite out of the 3 Thalliums, Thallium Sport would be my second one although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be buying the sport version again, and there is also Thallium Black ( which I have smelled on my skin but didn&#x27;t buy ); The Black version is good if you like a strong cigaret smoke note, ( perhaps for an older gentleman ) but that&#x27;s just not my taste, however, if you do like that smoky scent, then Black would be a good night scent for you, but I suggest you sample it first.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scent. I find it very comforting when I have it on. I know most time we wear fragrances to attract the opposite sex, but there&#x27;s times I wear stuff just for me. Since this is a very non offensive scent I see no harm in that. I&#x27;ve seen alot of reviews calling it &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;old lady scent&amp;#34;, and I can understand it.I think the light synthetic floral part is what people are associating with those remarks. This is not a complicated scent that&#x27;s gonna challenge your nose by any means. Plus this probably isn&#x27;t for everyone. If you don&#x27;t enjoy sweet scents then you&#x27;ll hate this one. I think it&#x27;s definitely a unisex fragrance to my nose. But I really enjoy smelling this.  And I don&#x27;t think synthetic is a bad thing if it smells good and you enjoy it.  It&#x27;s sweet and fruity, altho I don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Candy Apple or Pineapple&amp;#34; notes that most people seem to get. The drydown for me is the absolute best part. Very smooth and sexy I think. But like I said I wear this for me. And people who do smell it on me seem to like it. Highly recommend if you like sweeter scents.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I will recommend this. 5 star from me.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002XQ1Y86 Thallium for Men by Yves De Sistelle 3.4 oz EDT SP]]omg people are talking about this fragrance&lt;br /&gt;and how girls like it, started thinking im gonna get laid soon loool&lt;br /&gt;seriously cant wait to smell it, ill be back</li>
    <li> I bought the Nautica Voyage for Men because it was listed at the #1 bestseller. At the same time, I bought the Thallium for Men. To me, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if I like the smell. The test is what my wife and daughters think. On different days I wore each one. The one that hands-down got the thumbs up was the Thallium. It&#x27;s positively a winner, especially when my wife said, &amp;#34;You smell divine.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll stick with the Thallium for Men.</li>
    <li> Right on time ,and ladies love the light smell of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because the price was appealing and the reviews were good.  What a great find!  It smells great and it lasts on me all day. This cologne has become one of my go-to scents, not too heavy and smells fresh and clean. I will be buying this again for sure.</li>
    <li> the cologne  are cheap knock offs that you could find in a dollar store. I didn&#x27;t even wear it once went in trash</li>
    <li> I love this smell, I am stick with it for years, soft and I don&#x27;t like strong smells like another colognes</li>
    <li> The review said it stays with you all day. I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case. The fragrance masculine and I really appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I like it, I always order this cologne. My favorite.</li>
    <li> first time using this but I am impressed with how long it lasts on me.</li>
    <li> My husband has been OBSESSED with this cologne since first buying it years and years ago. The cologne and perfume stands in the mall want to charge around $60 so you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price. This cologne is an oil based one so the smell sticks around all day.</li>
    <li> This is a phenomenal product and I love it. The quality, value and the aroma don&#x27;t even come close to the high end stuff I have used. Moreover, you get to feel like you are in France everyday you wear it.Get this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> WOW!!  This stuff smells so good,  this is my faverite.  It kind of reminds me of joop only way better.....Stays with you all day!  Its a very rich sweet smell not to overpowering,  all you need is like 1 or 2 spritz and your good.  Trust me for 15 dollers it is well worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Youll like.</li>
    <li> Sooooo happy that I got my order right. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> i just fell in love with it</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think twice BUY IT NOW.. i am flying happy with it</li>
    <li> I have been complimented on my use of this fragrance by a large number of women who ask me what it is and then say they really like it. Thallium is a strong fragrance which does not get lost in a crowd.</li>
    <li> This is a excellant cologne oil based,long lasting, and awesome aroma. The price was a great savings for me and on time shipping.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this scent, &amp;#34;i&#x27;ll throw my undies anytime at you babe&amp;#34; lol&lt;br /&gt;she really loves it :D :D</li>
    <li> just got it today morning ad used it before going to work..OMG it smell so good and lasted whole day..and my store manager wants one too.hahah.</li>
    <li> Bought it upon recommendation of others - relatively pleasant smell. Good for day wear, not flowery scent. Does not last very long and is not overpowering, but really not bad.</li>
    <li> Horrible scent. Would never wear it . Ever. Threw it in the trash almost immediately. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not even if it&#x27;s only $20.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because of the reviews it had... Some guys said it was a panty dropper! Well, I must disagree... It was just ok...&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something different for my boyfriend and I got it because of the reviews. I would&#x27;ve given it a 3 star buy I gave it a 4 star because my boyfriend did like it! I won&#x27;t buy this again! I will try something different next time!</li>
    <li> It lasts all day, and the cost in definitely in the budget. I find myself attempting to use the other bottles on my dresser in an effort to make this product last a while longer.</li>
    <li> Was expecting more based on the reviews...Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I enjoyed it but I think it is just for me for these reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is not for a daily wear&lt;br /&gt;2) Does not last the whole day&lt;br /&gt;3) Bottle was a bit fragile imo</li>
    <li> I wore this at work today. 5 women on my floor complimented me. Says it all. This scent is seriously underrated. No one wears it...cept&#x27; me and that&#x27;s good. While the losers at work wear the grossly overpriced and highly generic, weak smelling scents like Armani Code, this one at under $16 is a genuine coup. As a fragrance it&#x27;s sweet, but not in a sickly way. The fruit notes combined with the Jasmine, Lavender and Musk work really well and i think this is why women like it so much. There are no heavy typical manly notes like Sandalwood, Oakmoss, Tobacco or Leather. Guys. Don&#x27;y be put off by that fact. Try this one....it will get the ladies attention for sure.</li>
    <li> Not pleased with the scent of this one.  I think colognes are subjective, because my friend loved it.  Guess who got an early christmas gift????</li>
    <li> 1) the smell is not for men.&lt;br /&gt;2) give me headache.&lt;br /&gt;3) This item isn&#x27;t eligible for return.&lt;br /&gt;4) I should have read all the 1 star review before i purchase. they tell the truth.</li>
    <li> I love this suff. It has a great but not over bearing smell and the bottel is a nice size plus the the shipping was very fast. And at around fifteen bucks you cant be at it deffenetly will be ordering agin</li>
    <li> Smells really good, very masculine smell. Lasts all day I swear. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> ok I no its great haven&#x27;t had a chance to wear it got to buy more</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite like the smell. If I had it to do all over again, I would have smelled it in the mall first.</li>
    <li> Love it also the price is good verse 83.00 i paid at the mall i will be back great value</li>
    <li> It is nice i use to wear this back in the day.it smells good.</li>
    <li> great and long lasting smell</li>
    <li> I bought this colgne without actually smelling it first.  Big mistake.  The reviews were so glowing that I figured that it must be great.  It really is not pleasant--it actually smells like a bad womans fragrance.  I had 3 different guys smell it  and each one of them hated it.  Tried to return but couldn&#x27;t because it is a liquid.  Lesson learned--never ever buy a cologne without smelling it first.  To the trash can it went.</li>
    <li> Possibly just my nose...and my friends and my mothers (got their opinion after I put it on)...but it smells like a typical women&#x27;s perfume that you&#x27;d smell on a older lady at church. It does smell good, but to me, not something a man would wear. There&#x27;s more flower tones than woodsy or musky tones. I didn&#x27;t tell my mother what it was. I just asked if she liked the way this smelt. She said it smelt good but smelt like old women&#x27;s perfume. Indeed it does...maybe she will wear it.</li>
    <li> Not overpowering. Not special. Very subtle and sweet but still masculine. I think it is just right. Lasts the whole day/night because it is a physically &amp;#34;clingy&amp;#34; cologne in the sense that you have to wash it off to get the scent off. Though, it wears off eventually. Price is a bonus.</li>
    <li> I am a female and I brought this cologne because of the reviews. I like some male cologne so I thought I should try this and I was pleasantly surprised. It smells like it is a unisex cologne.  I got a lot of compliments about the mild fresh scent. Ladies, go for it nobody will know if it is a male colonge</li>
    <li> Love this scent and its hard to find in places that sell well known fragrances  The last time I bought this cost me a arm and a leg.  Will continue to buy this from here.</li>
    <li> this fragrance is just awesome</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Smells great, and at a fab price</li>
    <li> Great smell, my grandson loves it</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite cologne</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and the price is just awesome.</li>
    <li> MEN &amp; LADIES FOR YOUR MEN/ BF&#x27;S....THIS IS SOME VERY SWEET SMELLING COLOGNE....HAVE GOTTEN MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
    <li> People try and describe the fragrance...it is a smell from my childhood, I&#x27;m 59 at the time of this review, so let&#x27;s see...what is that smell reminiscent of?  Oh yeah I remember, my dad using Aqua Velva, $8.27 for 7oz., the cheap drugstore cologne.  It also is reminiscent of  Mennen Skin Bracer.  The difference...Mennen is $7.82 for 7 oz....delivered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, not a bad item, just not worth the cost for what it is...at least to me...there are better &amp;#34;inexpensive cologne options.  Cuba colognes has better fragrances to me in the same price range, and I receive more compliments as well.</li>
    <li> Smells like a well dressed, older, black man headed to church.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I smelled Thallium for the first time.  It is very floral, but still has masculine undertones.  It is the perfect scent for the urban gentleman.  The big problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last.  By mid-morning the scent has all but disappeared.  If it would last all day, this would be my signature go-to scent.</li>
    <li> More than pleased with this cologne. Arrived on time and smells like heaven. Lasts a long time and i get countless compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Really Good cologne. Complimented all the time for wearing it. Smells great And very good Purchase!  Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Good cologne. Gotten compliments on it but not as much as I&#x27;d like. My first impression on smelling this is fruit loops for some reason but that&#x27;s just me. I like it personally but there&#x27;s better ones out there.</li>
    <li> I was very concerned about purchasing a cologne that I have never smelled before, but this was a winner.  My nephew loves it so much he wants me to order one for him.  The packaging is beautiful and the fragrance is light, but very nice.  I will purchase this again and it was delivered as promised.  Very, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> my husband and I were very excited to see this online for cheaper than what we paid in stores! great smell and gets multiple comments on it from people!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great sent great price can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> This was a perfect gift for my husband.  The price is right and will order this again for him soon</li>
    <li> This product was as described in the ad.&lt;br /&gt; We have purchased in Caribbean and this is the same&lt;br /&gt;For way less&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
    <li> cheap price and fast shipping ... company it&#x27;s okay this product not good on me (keep in mind a fragrance has to have the right chemical reaction on your skin to smell good)</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my Brother&#x27;s Bday7 He loves it like I knew he would!! I Love IT too!!</li>
    <li> THE BEST!!!!!!! This fragrance is a defiant buy!!  Buy it now!!!! I hope it is always on the market.  I very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a candy apple.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive but high quality men&#x27;s cologne...Smell is great</li>
    <li> Not a masculine scent at all, and not very appealing, actually.  My mother is using it as sachet scent.  It smells a great deal like fabric softener.</li>
    <li> This scent is great..will order again once I run out..a nice scent that last all day!</li>
    <li> great deal like it a lot....</li>
    <li> Smell good doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite colognes very nice smell soft but with presence great cologne overall definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> Thallium has a fragrance is so delightful and so soft to the sense that I cannot find a substitute for it.</li>
    <li> yup i knew its fake but the price grabbed my attention so i wanted to try it. smells good, but because its fake it doesn&#x27;t stay long. matter of fact, you have to spray a lot to make the smell noticeable.</li>
    <li> Ok,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I decided to take a gamble and buy this product based on the great reviews... usually Amazon is pretty accurate when it comes to a collective positive review--as long as enough people are tallied of course.  However, I knew the inherent risks with buying a cologne without smelling the product first.  Despite the risk, I decided to roll the dice and buy it.  Well, the price pretty much reflects the quality of the product. CHEAP.  I&#x27;ve definitely smelled this on someone or somewhere, but it&#x27;s very nauseating to me.  If I could give negative stars I would.  That is the last time I buy a fragrance without smelling it first.  I was hoping this cologne would be just &#x27;ok&#x27; enough for me to wear once in a while.  It isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s just repulsive to me and I can&#x27;t stand this fake, overly sweet but not in a good way, cheap and wretched fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like a man&#x27;s fragrance. It smell&#x27;s like some lady&#x27;s obnoxious, nauseatingly sweet, cheap perfume.  There&#x27;s a reason why this is so cheap...if you&#x27;re going to buy it, try it out before you bother. You&#x27;ve been warned.  There are MANY, MANY other far superior colognes out there.  At least it was cheap so it&#x27;s not like I lost so much money.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF SMELLS LIKE A PERFUME.IT STINKS AND AINT WORTH 5 BUCKS.THIS DOESN&#x27;T COMPETE WITH ANYTHING.17 BUCKS DOWN THE DRAIN.</li>
    <li> I blindly purchased this based on the reviews and the reasonable price.  When I opened up the box and gave it a sniff, I didn&#x27;t care for it much upon first smell.  It smelled a little powdery to me.  My wife also thought it smelled powdery.  I gave it a try anyway and the powdery smell faded.  It ended up smelling kind of sweet.  The smell grew on me, but I think my wife is somewhat neutral to it. I was putting 2 sprays on in the morning and my wife once told me that I might want to tone it down.  Now, I&#x27;ll sometimes just use one spray and sometimes use 2.  My wife hasn&#x27;t said anything to me since. I haven&#x27;t had any comments from anyone else either.  I&#x27;m currently wearing this daily, but I will more than likely switch to something that my wife finds more desirable.</li>
    <li> Get plenty of compliments on this cologne. The fragance is light and pleasant - never overpowering.  Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Great scent and not overpowering, love it!</li>
    <li> buy all three version, for the price this is the best. this is my daily wear, and have bottles of colonge that i paid $100 - $300 (creeds, bonds, jo malones) . also i seen this in the mall for $50, thats crazy.</li>
    <li> I bought for my son he loves it and I like it to.</li>
    <li> Smells very good.  But the fragrance do not stay on longer.  It&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I first brought this item in Manhattan, it had cost me&lt;br /&gt;$76.00***You cannot beat this price Amazon has now**It is definitely  one of my favorite scents**Give it a try**The women can&#x27;t resist it***</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance but disappointed that its projection is moderate at best and I only last about 3 hours on my skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely excellent product.  Great long lasting subtle smell.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This was one of two colognes I bought at the same time and while I like this one I think it&#x27;s a little less potent then it should be, maybe I need to put on more. Either way smells very nice. I would also say this is a little bit less masculine of a smell??? Not perfumey or feminine neccesarily but I think a girl could wear it as well. Still recommended.</li>
    <li> this is the real thing, and it smells so good on me.......&lt;br /&gt;p.s. to the people trying to say its fake!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;b.s.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;y&#x27;all probably, some local perfume owner mad because y&#x27;all missing sells o lol</li>
    <li> Great smell would like to buy it again someday</li>
    <li> High quality product, super seller honest and sincere to its obligations as a seller. I recommend! I would do business with him again when I return to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance of this perfume. I recommend to all who love him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portuguese:&lt;br /&gt;Entrega super rápida e vendedor nota 100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produto de alta qualidade, vendedor super honesto e sincero para com suas obrigações como vendedor. Recomendo! Eu faria novamente negócios com ele quando eu voltar aos Estados Unidos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eu adoro a fragância desse perfume. Recomendo a todos que gostam dele.</li>
    <li> Best cologne and cheap too I call it panty droppers</li>
    <li> This has become my signature cologne; everyone asks &amp;#34;what are you wearing? it smells great&amp;#34;. I even get complements from guys, oddly enough. My girlfriend even sprays it on my pillow.  It just doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing everyone will stop and ask what you&#x27;re wearing</li>
    <li> Nice smell ...and the scent last for a good while.</li>
    <li> awesome love it. I&#x27;ve seen this colon go for sixty to seventy dollars a bottole thanks amazon you rock thank you</li>
    <li> Love this!  I rarely step out and get a different cologne, but this was a great gamble and am totally pleased!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted Will buy again from thank you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like my husband wearing cologne, but he likes to so I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and I must say, its awesome!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a very good smelling cologne that won&#x27;t break the bank than this is it. This is one of my favorite budget colognes (along with iceberg twice). The lot of the cheap colognes you won&#x27;t smell after an hour but lasting power of Thallium is pretty good. i&#x27;m going to have to try the other versions.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice and not overpowering. Spray it on in the morning and I could still smell it when I get home from work. Not sure why some reviews state it doesn&#x27;t last. It lasts. Unless you&#x27;re into smelling like you just bathed in cologne.</li>
    <li> Thallium gives you strong longevity. This stuff really lasts all day long without any additional application. This is such a great edt. with the projection and scent of a edp and all at a price below $20.00! Probably the best thing about this cologne is the fact that you can really where this all four seasons, day or night.  Not many fragrances are this versatile and not many of any lasting quality can be found at this low of a price.  It is a very sweet fragrance though, so if you don&#x27;t like sweet, don&#x27;t buy blind.  However if you are in need for a scent that is versatile, long lasting, and sweet fragrance then look no further.  A real bargain.</li>
    <li> this stuff is excellent for the money. Has a fresh, long lasting smell that goes a long way. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and get alot of compliments. It was exactly as promised and delivered to my door quickly.</li>
    <li> Warning.... For the price of this juice, you will not be mad at all. :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is some unique cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very long lasting, people will smell you even&lt;br /&gt;before you walk by (if you know how to apply)&lt;br /&gt;and not offensive like woodsy cologne can be&lt;br /&gt;(I do ware them too.) Yes, it is a sweet and&lt;br /&gt;lingering smell. If your wondering, it does&lt;br /&gt;not smell like cool water. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, if you don&#x27;t buy this juice right here then you are going to be missing out&lt;br /&gt;until you finally just buy one for around $18.00 buck&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s for listing to my input.</li>
    <li> thank you  packing was perfect and the time was really good</li>
    <li> pro cheap and smells good, get compliments all the time&lt;br /&gt;con it fades out more in the summer than in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;been looking for this for almost 10 years everyone else want 40 or more for the same product.</li>
    <li> Not a very appealing smell for my liking. Kind of smells a little like vanilla and powder or something. Not cool. If you want to smell similar to your girlfriend or wife go for it.</li>
    <li> Great scent! Lasts pretty long on my skin and is pretty versatile, IMO. It can be used in any season, day or night. It&#x27;s not too overpowering, so it&#x27;ll do a good job for most occasions. This fragrance is unbeatable for its price point!</li>
    <li> It smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it is manly!</li>
    <li> Good quality scent. A soothing sweetness in it.</li>
    <li> Perfect, on time, a great product</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne fragrance, regret in not purchasing more than one. Nicely priced and nicely packaged when received. The real deal.</li>
    <li> Smells nice; but doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I find myself reapplying it throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great price, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> nice product, as described.</li>
    <li> Ok. No compliments and pretty average smelling.</li>
    <li> I like it thought the smell do not last for more than three hours. However, it is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Not something I wear every day but I like the scent. It has a more formal smell if that makes sense. There were reviews about this losing potency quickly but it manages to stay with me through the day for sure.</li>
    <li> very sweet, powdery, sometimes i think like I&#x27;m smelling lipstick, not sure about this one. A blind buy for me.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I would buy again but it certainly smells great for what it&#x27;s worth. Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried in this price range is as good as this plus it comes in a huge bottle so props to the maker for that</li>
    <li> Smells like a musty old grandma. Like seriously. It smells like that weird musty smell old women have. Totally bummed me out when I got it.</li>
    <li> Just received my bottle today. It smells amazing!!! My mom was the first lady that ive introduced the new scent to and she absolutley loved it. I will definitly stock up on more in the near future. I think ive found my signature cologne. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells great. The ladies love it. I get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
    <li> To get this amount of cologne for $14 is pretty outstanding. Also this one of the best smelling colognes I&#x27;ve ever owned, even beating most of the colognes closer to $100. I would highly recommend this to anyone without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This cologne will blow your mind!! It has a cool and refreshing smell to it! Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> After reading several positive reviews regarding this fragrance, I decided to give it a shot. As soon as I smelled this fragrance I instantly liked it.. It doesn&#x27;t smell like any of my current fragrances; in which I wear fragrances like Versace Pour Homme, Creed, Perry Ellis 360 Red, Issey Miyake and Aqua Di Gio -which are all 5 Star classic fragrances.. Although, it falls in the same category as far as having a soft, sweet  and mellow scent.. If you like the fragrances I have listed, then you will definitely like Thallium.. I haven&#x27;t wore it to work yet as I just got it a few hours ago: but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is going to get plenty compliments.. This cologne can easily cost over $50 for a 3.3 oz.. But it doesn&#x27;t, and I will be buying a second bottle at the same price ($17)..</li>
    <li> Thallium arrived today and of course I had to give it a try.  I have to same that I absolutely love it!!!  Sprayed just a little on my arm to see how it would smell with my body chemistry.  I think it is amazing.  Now, I just have to see what others think of it.</li>
    <li> Men&#x27;s fragrances, cologne and eau de toilette (EDT) represents one&#x27;s personal &amp;#34;scent signature&amp;#34;.  Since each of us has a different body chemistry which affects scent, it is not unusual that some fragrances might be incompatible or not the right choice for some of us.  I respect the many favorable reviews which have been posted for Thallium but this clearly was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thallium (For Men) has a cloyingly-sweet, juvenile aroma. The scent reminded me of a budget-line cheap barber-shop unbalanced after shave.  A gray Thallium box arrived wrapped only with a thin polystyrene sleeve over the outer box inviting me to embark on a most unpleasant olfactory journey on the S.S. Skank.  Here are my impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Delivered in a gray cardboard box revealing an attractive pseudo-Grecian &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; apothecary decanter.&lt;br /&gt;2.  No cap necessary-The top of the bottle has an integral spray button for your scent experience.&lt;br /&gt;3.  If you look carefully, you will find a lot # and production/date of manufacture on the rear outer panel of the box-&lt;br /&gt;  (mine was 6.12.2013), which should still be reasonably fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;4. Believe it or not....made in France....oui oui oui!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS/CAUTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  There is no indication anywhere on the bottle or box that this is a men&#x27;s EDT (pour homme).  It is not unreasonable to expect such a transparent label for a product such as this and it leads one to suspect that this may not be a men&#x27;s EDT.  Tighter labeling is necessary for purchasers of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Amazon has classified Thallium (and most other EDT&#x27;s and colognes) as a hazardous (i.e. potentially combustible) item. As such, even given Amazon&#x27;s generous and liberal return policy, you will be unable to return this item. Please think carefully before purchasing this item if you are unfamiliar with the scent or simply wish to sample it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Check ingredients carefully before purchasing if you have a history of skin allergies or other sensitivities: For example, Thallium contains carboxaldehyde (Lyral), which is linked with contact skin dermatitis, butyl metoxydibenzoyl-methane-a free-radical generator when exposed to sunlight,  bht-a suspected carcinogen used as a preservative and several dyes of questionable use (D&amp;C blue 1 and red 33).  Although these substances are used widely and generally safely in the cosmetic arena, those with the above-cited conditions should take this into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. My box was not sealed like most other brands of EDT&#x27;s with cellophane wrap-Given the potential for evaporation due to differences in humidity and climate, it is possible that the scent became compromised; however, I understand that this is how Thallium is supplied and packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE IMPRESSIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells like a raw deal gentlemen!  One whiff should be enough to singe your nasal passages leaving you nauseous and in  need of a respirator. Stale, rancid, repulsive, cloying, annoying aroma reminiscent of revisiting unpleasant childhood memories of your aunt dowsing herself in the skankiest scent possible as she attacks your cheeks with hugs or the smell of your elementary school teachers long past their retirement window.  But then....Allow me to tell you how I REALLY feel!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No need to worry about &amp;#34;scent disintegration&#x27; as others have commented on. Thallium stimulates your gag reflex and attacks your nasal passages like a rabid pit-bull without remorse.  The initial assault (spray) is intense and clings without mercy for some time. My family refused to get within 20 ft. of me until I showered and &amp;#34;de-Thalliumed&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. An excellent choice for lighter fluid, mace or insect repellent but NOT for humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Try a sample if available at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus or Lord &amp; Taylor.  There are far better choices.chasing if you have a history of skin allergies or other sensitivities: For example, Thallium contains carboxaldehyde (Lyral), which is linked with contact skin dermatitis, butyl metoxydibenzoyl-methane-a free-radical generator when exposed to sunlight,  bht-a suspected carcinogen used as a preservative and several dyes of questionable use (D&amp;C blue 1 and red 33).

    <li> has a manly smell but with a Apple like sent to it. Would recommend this to any one with a nose</li>
    <li> This colonge smells so very good,i had purchased it for my son.</li>
    <li> This perfume scent is very special. This keep you the 24 hours good . I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just received Thallium, I live in Venezuela where women love to men with good smell and just today I spoke wonders of my perfume, I am grateful to have him and I will continue using all the time from now on ...</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t anything fancy, but it&#x27;s a pretty good scent for daily use. It smells a little sweet, like candy, but not overpoweringly so. My body chemistry makes most colognes end up smelling musky (or extra musky, if they were musky to begin with), so half of that might be my fault. But for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this cologne we have been looking for it for along time.</li>
    <li> I put it on when i went to work the day i got it and i had over 5 girls beg me to tell them what i was wearing. This scent last for quite a long time which is hard to find and its the best smell around.</li>
    <li> It was Excellent. Nice doing Business with you. Keep up the good works. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. This pure quality Scent.&lt;br /&gt;Worth more than $13 but please dont raise the price on my account lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I have Thallium sport so if you have Sport then its the same smell except with sport you have  ablast of Lemon.&lt;br /&gt;With This scent You have a  sweeter smell and I am not sure but I think I smell Lavander in it as well..&lt;br /&gt;I read a review that it was a laundry scent I dont get that but I guess I can see it being a fabric softner scent  becasue it so light but trust me it far from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wore it out in the night air makes it stand out so I will say it probbaly works best in cool to cold climate but I can see it being used in summer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent it just doesnt last as long as I would like,well let me explain. You will smell it on your skin all day no doubt but it loses alot of Projection during the day. I am not sure but I will say with 4 sprays you will get 3hrs strong after that it begins to fade. If this is anything like Thallium Sport you will get a good 4 hours of projection after that it turns into a skin scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been spraying directly on Shirt as well as back on neck and this keep the sent longer and as you walk you leave a trail.&lt;br /&gt;I saw on Amazon that there is a lotion. This will also extend the live of this fragrance on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will be buying this again with the lotion as well as Thallium Sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes De Sistelle is just a good Fragrance Brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed especially for under $20</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this colonge because of the customer reviews,and I&#x27;m glad I did cause I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> i got this for christmas. honestly, it took time for me to warm up to it especially since i already have lots of other &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; colognes. this isn&#x27;t my go to cologne if i go out, it&#x27;s more of a scent i wear at work but it does smell very good, very natural &amp; clean. It has a sweeter smell than the others i have but it did get compliments when i wore it. i am interested in smelling the other scents from the Thallium collection.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, and super fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> This product was just like he used to get. Smells terrific. Quick delivery time. Thanks for the great smell you gave my husband.</li>
    <li> for the money you can rock it daily, it&#x27;s a little sweet smelling but nice not too overpowering, switch it up</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite colognes ive ever bought. Currently on my second bottle. Women love the way it smells on me and friends always ask what cologne I&#x27;m wearing. Fellas do yourself a favor and buy this</li>
    <li> My husband loved it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ever wanted to smell like your great aunt or grandmother? Then this is your cologne. This is a very clumsy mix of mostly jasmine and lavender with the rest of the notes buried deep but occasionally trying to grab attention. After the dry down instead of having the decency to disappear, it desperately clings to clothing.  This blind buy was a bust for me but maybe you have a special 80 year old lady in your life that would love a new bottle.</li>
    <li> Just beautiful fragrance and worth the price. It is lasting and right up in the ranks with any of those fragrances costing over 60 bucks.</li>
    <li> I ordered this just by reading the reviews. My husband loves cologne. He wears it morning, noon, and night. He doesn&#x27;t know how to be conservative. He has to spray 3/4 times. I hope he likes it. Would I recommend? Yes. The price was right, also.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It smells like hot farts.&amp;#34; Never have I heard that phrase uttered more times then when I wore this cologne. I&#x27;m sure maybe it&#x27;s something that Sadly Pooper ( Bradley coopers stinky alter ego) would wear.</li>
    <li> The title said it all. I can use this for almost any occasion but this would not suit professional work.</li>
    <li> smells pretty damn good and the bottle is cool. i like how you can actually smell it on yourself for a good amount of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume since 2009 when I discovered it by a seller&#x27;s suggestion. Since then it&#x27;s the fourth bottle I&#x27;ve used, I simply adore it.</li>
    <li> Clean, pleasant scent that can be worn by all men regardless of age.</li>
    <li> After two uses it started smelling like rubbing alcohol and burned my boyfriends skin. Also not oil based like it should be so it doesn&#x27;t linger like the original. Got refund. Shame</li>
    <li> love it. great deal. i got this for my boyfriend and he loved it and so do i. everywhere else its like 35-40 bucks.</li>
    <li> Im an older guy who still likes to smell good and have used mambo for years. If u like mambo, u will like Thallium. I spray 3 or 4 shots on my chest and arms and after a few minutes, it tames down and will last for hours. After 4 hours, I don&#x27;t notice it at all, but u can smell residual odor even into the next day. Mambo tends to last longer though. I would recommend this product////</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and smells great</li>
    <li> Smell great,and reasonable price. Smell okay,and last a full day</li>
    <li> mesmerizing.....super long lasting....lingers around for nearly 14-16 hours......awesome projection too.....</li>
    <li> So I read all the good reports and all the bad reports and thought I&#x27;d take a chance and get it and honestly I can&#x27;t believe this product has so many stars it barley deserves 2 it smiles like baby powder and makeup it was hard to believe that this is the &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; cologne that some reviews were talking about and to have if you want to know how it skills there is a deoderand spray called axe kilo green it smells exactly like that.. There are women&#x27;s perfume that smells more masculine than this</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good I&#x27;m starting to believe it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac!</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best cologne I have ever purchased. While I am on the movie set my women co-stars can not get enough of this scent.</li>
    <li> i love this cologne ,it is so soothing ,it diffinitely is a keeper i will be ordering another one soon</li>
    <li> Smells good initially ,only last about two hours,but I purchased it as an everyday/work cologne so it does suit its purpose.Jean Paul&#x27;s Le Male is similar smoother and lasts much longer,but again \\&quot;Price\\&quot;,so this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It smells soo good! Whenever I wear it I get compliments on it ALL day, because it literally lasts ALL day. and for the price? it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I got this Item for $15.83 witch is super cheap compared to other stores retail this item for $45!! When received with 3 day fast shipping, I opened the small box it comes in, and instantly put it on. Thallium is a total chick magnet, and gets you many complements. Its a good amount of cologne and last for a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item has a very cheep price, and smell great! I recommend this for any guy who wants to impress the Ladies.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, not overly sweet or over musky with a light hint of fruit.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a gift, I haven&#x27;t given to the person yet...but you can&#x27;t bit it as a gift.  I will see what the person has to say about it.  Nice and presentable gift.</li>
    <li> Smells good on me. The misses likes the smell at least and that&#x27;s what really matters. I&#x27;ve had a couple other ladies tell me I smelt good too.</li>
    <li> SMELLS SOOO GOOD! Great for me.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and NOT Heavy.....Glad I took the chance and tried it.</li>
    <li> Husband and I love the scent.  It was a great gift and I enjoyed purchasing the Thallium trio (sport, classic and black) so that he has options depending on gym, work or night out.</li>
    <li> Great product would refer to anyone great shipping on time</li>
    <li> Just smells real good...what else can I say....this is my go to cologne ,,, . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Smell nice&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought this product after hearing good things about it and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t let you down. The smell,bottle are incredible I have going complements everytime that I have worn it.its a must buy</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same as the last several bottles I purchased. The packaging looks the same but it is definitely not the same. I spray what I have left in the old bottle and it is pleasant and fairly strong. I spry the new bottle and it smells very light, strong of alcohol and not even close to the original. I have been using this kind for years and believe what I received to be fake.</li>
    <li> This cologne will compete with the best of them....Armani, CK, Mont Blanc, Jean Paul, Perry Ellis. whichever high priced cologne you put this cologne up against, it will match it in smell, longevity of scent, and people telling you how much they love it. I dare you to try it, don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. Not too much advertising for this line like you see with the bigger names. Not sure how, but this is a 50 or 60 dollar bottle of cologne being sold for under 20 dollars.</li>
    <li> Ladies love it, mostly subconsciously, because they smell something that they themselves would consider wearing. This is a very sweet smell. It&#x27;s top and middle notes are incredibly \\&quot;candy-like\\&quot; in their quality - think Skittles or Pixie Stix. The base notes however are quite pleasant, much more subdued and attractive. Longevity is good, sillage good as well, though in my experience not as near-nuclear as the reviews on Fragrantica would have you believe. Loses points in my mind for being something I can only justify wearing with a pink or light blue shirt. The sweetness of this scent is something that juxtaposes oddly with most wardrobe choices.</li>
    <li> It smells ok but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase this again. Just not what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Possible defective bottle but i have the original and i believe this is a fake or watered down version. Buyer beware. Cant return as it is considered flammable</li>
    <li> so i have bought two bottles of this stuff,i love! it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and females love it. not a strong scent. i will definately buy more. i read a review that compared it to versace cologne so i bought versace too,but i like thalium better!</li>
    <li> This was a good buy . I like it.</li>
    <li> It has a sweet smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas.  I had previously purchased it as a gift for my son and everyone liked it.</li>
    <li> Yes is good .no complaints</li>
    <li> good, nice price, smell good, around 3 or 4 hours in my body. i´m happy with the purchase. 1 1</li>
    <li> Smells good for half a minute and the gives you a headache. It smells like old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. For only $16 I bought it &amp;#34;just to try.&amp;#34; Four men in the family (three boys and husband) and all wear cologne. For $16, this is a steal. WILL buy again, and will recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a light smelling cologne which does not have an &amp;#34;offensive&amp;#34; strength to it, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other recommendations are:&lt;br /&gt;Eternity for men (green)&lt;br /&gt;Chrome Azzaro (blue)&lt;br /&gt;Bellagio (green tower cologne)&lt;br /&gt;And this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All have a light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a slightly darker scent, Ulysse is very good (green with scene engraved on bottle)</li>
    <li> Drum Rolls..... Here comes a good fragrance at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Reasons why gave it a 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1, Really smooth fragrance unlike the cheap ones you usually get at grocery stores&lt;br /&gt;2. Long lasting &amp; I really mean 6 to 8 hours out in the sun&lt;br /&gt;3. Super elegant packing&lt;br /&gt;4. Ladies came to notice &amp; like it&lt;br /&gt;5. What else can you expect in less then 20 bucks!?</li>
    <li> I do not know if there is a female variant of this scent that was accidently sent to me but if not then this scent is terribly feminine. Wore it twice and  was told by at least 15 people I smelt like I was wearing women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
    <li> This is not the real thing. Just a cheap knock-off but ok for the price.</li>
    <li> A decent product.  This is an average men&#x27;s cologne.  The scent is pleasant enough for occasional use in the medium price range.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best, I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s not the best. I was expecting a little more &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; to the smell. The package arrives in a little well protected box, cardboard shipping box and another box that protects the large vial itself. It had a nice look to it, more of a &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; look, if you know what I mean. I was excited, you know, as soon as a put some on.. my hopes from 100 dropped to 60 real quick. The smell is ok, i&#x27;ve bought colognes before but this just didn&#x27;t feel my satisfaction. If you like those &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smells, by all means buy it; apart from that, not good.</li>
    <li> ah, The smell is ok but nothing special.</li>
    <li> pleasant odor, last long, not very young lotion.!</li>
    <li> This eau de toilette smells, to me, like a lighter, summer version of Joop!, which to me is a great blend. It seems to last a good length of time, and has a refreshing scent. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells cloyingly sweet.  The bottle is great on pictures, but in person it looks cheap.  It may work well for those that enjoy a sweeter pallet - probably around the same age range as AXE bodyspray - grades 6-12.  Once you get a bit older, something a bit more mature would probably be a better fit.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to wear every day!</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t enough words to say how well I like this cologne! My husband and my son both get so many compliments on this cologne! I LOVE IT!! Thank you so much for the great price!</li>
    <li> I really like this , was so much cheaper ordering it through here, I get compliments all the time when i use it</li>
    <li> too sweet smelling like cotton candy</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great quality that I spent much more in the mall for.</li>
    <li> Total rip off!! This item smells half like an old woman and half like cat urine. Terrible smell. I think all the people reviewing this saying this smells good would have to be fake. This is something you would find in a dollar or under type store. Stay away. Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.</li>
    <li> My sweat smells better than this,  the scent is so strong smells Cheep &amp; for some reason it never goes away even after taking a shower.</li>
    <li> i really enjoy the smell, especially for day-time casual use.  Would say that the smell does not stay on an extremely long amount of time, but i experience this with even the most expensive colognes.  In general a pleasant smell and a nice day-time cologne, would buy again.</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing! My husband wears it and it works so well with his body chemistry! He wore it the day we met and he has worn it ever since! It smells so good &amp; he only literally needs a spray to smell wonderful? It has a softness to it that reminds me a tiny bit of baby oowder, yet the masculine scents remind me I am with a real man! I love it! He is running out which is why i will be ordering some more bottles for him. By the way he has had the same bottle since 2008 which is why I have to reinstate that only a tiny dab will do the trick! Love it!</li>
    <li> It sure is worth the money. Not bad for the price. I wear it daily. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> So I bought this cologne solely due to the reviews without ever having smelled it, just for a general everyday cologne I just received this cologne today and I admit that when I first smelled it I wasnt that sold on it decided to wear it out to test it tonight.........All I can say is this cologne is awesome and demands attention!!!!! I went into a grocery store to pick up a few things and one of the workers that was helping me asked to my surprise what kind of cologne was I wearing, it kinda caught me off guard especially since it was my first time wearing it, I usually get those kind of comments only when I wear Jean Paul Gaultier, Issey Miyake, Dolce and Gabbana, and Etc. I would definitely recommend this cologne, if you don&#x27;t like it, because not everyone will whats the harm you will only be out of about 15 dollars that is less than what you would pay for a tank of gas</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT TO MY SON I GAVE HEAT BY BEYONCE TO MY DAUGHTER IN LAW WAS TOLD THAT THE TWO FRAGRANCES TOGETHER MADE FOR QUIT A ROMANTIC EVENING</li>
    <li> This was a great value for the money. I bought this strictly based on the views and its a little old man-ish for a 37 year old guy....but older ladies said it smelled wonderful.  My wife didnt care for it as much</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t expect much of this because i&#x27;m not familiar with it....but because I saw that it was bought with some others i bought, i decide to take it also.....and I didn&#x27;t regret it. it has a manly smell about it which I like. But again, alas, doesn&#x27;t last that long..</li>
    <li> My first bottle was a present from my girlfriend, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since! Drives the girls at work and at the college wild!</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s pretty good, nothing mindblowing or astonishing. It gets the job done, but for me at least the smell fades within half a day of putting it on and the smell changes from the bottle after a few months</li>
    <li> great smell. one of the best</li>
    <li> This stuff smells realllllly good.  I had not smelled it before buying but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  I love the bottle and box it came in also.  I got it in 2 days which is unheard of with amazon.</li>
    <li> Great smelling spray cologne. Lasts 4-5 hours on me. I have received several complements from it.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Good size bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased based on how many good reviews there were to bad ones. Smells just like baby powder to me. It did last a long time, almost all day, but it wasn&#x27;t one I wanted to last. I&#x27;m not particularly fond of getting random whiffs of baby powder all day at work.</li>
    <li> I love Thallium, I would not use any other cologne but this one. When I run out I will not use anything else. I first purchased this fragrance at a mall kiosk. I paid about $50 for it. The next time I was able to bargain the price down to $38.00. Every place I bought it I would try to get the same price around $38. They would always say....&amp;#34;Let me call my supervisor and check for you&amp;#34;....then they would say he&#x27;s going to let me do it for you this time. LOL.... Dude he says that every time. He was probably calling home to check on his kids or dinner. But, anyway..... I always shop Amazon and it never dawned on me to check it here....BINGO!! Amazon does it again! The price I get it for now, I could have gotten about 3 of them for what I was paying for it. This is amazing. I am a true Thallium fan....and the chicks dig it too!!</li>
    <li> Smells really good and stays for a long time</li>
    <li> Thallium is a great scent.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Great scent with absolutely awesome staying power.  Very fresh scent.  It&#x27;s definitely a must have at this low price. Get it! :0)</li>
    <li> not too overpowering.  I don&#x27;t like having to type more than i want to, so please remove that requirement very soon as its irritating.</li>
    <li> Really really really great cologne. Has that bold, yet lightly sweet smell. Definitely a good choice for the warmer months. I will continue to buy every time i run out!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is nice and masculine however it does not last. It works as an inexpensive cologne for a short day out</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes out there trust me, you will drive women crazy with this, they&#x27;ll constantly wanna get close to you, then ask what are you wearing. Really soft, alluring smell.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I think this is the bet at this price. Its addictive too ..wife says !! ;)</li>
    <li> Mr. Smell Good is BACK...Wow, these young ladies are about to SQUEEZE me to death! LOL I&#x27;m already blessed with a uncommonly handsome mug &amp; a sculptured body, this puts me in the category of IRRESISTIBLE!</li>
    <li> Nice long lasting scent feels really nice  when you spray it after a shower. Not too strong</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne for the price.</li>
    <li> great, delivered on time</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne as a jumping point for my 13 year old step son. This worked out really great for him, he wanted something more than AXE body spray. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $50+ on a kid but wanted him to have something he would like and this was a perfect solution. It smells clean and fresh like a high end product for much less. The bottle and packaging are very nice, it looks very high end. The only downfall is, a little dab will do ya. It does smell good, but the smell can easily get overwhelming if you spray it more than a few times.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of insurrection.</li>
    <li> i like this one better than thallium black i am giving it 5 stars for smell and specially price!! it&#x27;s a bargain...</li>
    <li> Awesome  scent that lasts all day without being overpowering.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Opens with a light apple scent but goes in like a beast after dry down. It last over 6 hours on my skin easily. Got sport for my son for Christmas and black for my Pastor and they said that it was the best they&#x27;ve ever had. You will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> I really like this! Didn&#x27;t expect blue juice to smell like it does! Both my co-worker and I said, &amp;#34;This smells like Big Red Gum, or at least the wrapper!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This stinks to me I like Ed hardy, Armani code and colognes similar to those this smelt cheap to me. But that&#x27;s just my opinion. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> You win with this product! You get a nicely packaged product, with a very nice smell, for a very low price! Don&#x27;t expect a long lasting over powering aroma when purchasing this, but you can expect a very nice and fresh aroma that will last 4 to 5 hours.</li>
    <li> This Eau de &amp;#34;Toilet&amp;#34; is great. It smells masculine and sexy, and it&#x27;s rather inexpensive. My friends and girlfriend love it. I would recommend this product, and I have purchased more as backup.</li>
    <li> my wife saw this on a show that ryan seacrest was wearing it that day and ordered it for me as a surprise.  boy was i surprised…it really smells like an elderly lady perfume.  I used it once and threw the rest of the bottle away.</li>
    <li> I WILL ORDER THIS ONE AGAIN.I LOVE A GOOD SMELLING MAN, AND THIS SCENT IS AN A+ FOR ANY MAN.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve owned</li>
    <li> Being a broke and down on my luck recent medical school graduate I can go around smelling better than my better-off counterparts and colleagues.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very nice. It has a very unique and mild scent. I love wearing this as an alternative to some of my other favorites.</li>
    <li> Has a strong sweet smell that lasts quite a while. Made me nauseated after a while. Won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
    <li> good product for the price. delivered fast. overall happy with my purchase. although I had not tried this item before I purchased based on reviews I read online. at first I was not happy with the fragrance, but since I have been using it, it has turned to my first choice in the morning, its good enough to use at work and lasts the whole time I am there,</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, when I first started using Thallium, it was very weak and did not last long. I thought it was watered-down, especially since it is described as being a stronger fragrance. Then I started using lotion on my neck and chest area and it seems to make a major difference in the fragrance&#x27;s strength. The stuff is now much stronger and longer-lasting. I don&#x27;t know if maybe it had something to do with the fragrance in the bottle itself too. Either way, if anybody is having issues with longevity and sillage, I would try moisturizing your skin since the fragrance seems to work poorly on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent-wise, it goes through phases smelling like cotton candy, candied apple, and a pina colada. Very sweet, juicy, and edible, like candy chews. Smells like something that can be used year-round since it does not have any notes that conflict with heat or cold. I would just manage the number of sprays accordingly. It&#x27;s a fun scent, not really for work. Great for casual outings or nights out.</li>
    <li> A little more old man smell than I was looking for :)&lt;br /&gt;Smells good though.  Not gonna complain when other colognes run $75 or more.</li>
    <li> This scent isn&#x27;t to bad for a inexpensive cologne.  it goes on with kind of a sweet powdery smell but dries nicely that isn&#x27;t offensive and gets some compliments,</li>
    <li> Great fruity fragrance, great bang for the buck. Superb longevity and projection. All 3 Thallium versions(Black, Sport and above) are a great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne based on reviews posted here and on the scent of the other version of this,Thallium Black which I really like. This is not working, not at all. I put some on several times and waited a while, but could not find myself to like this. My wife also agreed-it stinks! The worst part is I can&#x27;t return it because Amazon does not accept flammable liquids. What!! you sent it to me with no concerns. Anyway, i&#x27;ll have to find someone to give it to.&lt;br /&gt;Beware.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cologne for my husband for his birthday and I came across thallium for men. I was reading about this and decided to order this. It smells sooo good I couldn&#x27;t believe it. My husband was impressed with the cologne I picked out for him. He really liked this cologne. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Tl;Dr: An inexpensive cologne solution for us men on a budget. However, choosing a cologne to buy over the internet without actually smelling it is as much of a good idea as ______. Everyone has a different preference for smells. It would not be fair to say, &amp;#34;this cologne smells terrible/what a rip off/ect.&amp;#34; The best anyone can do for colognes online is to describe how it smells as best as one can and let the buyer decide if it&#x27;s something they&#x27;d like.  PROS: It&#x27;s pretty damn inexpensive compared to paying $70+ in stores for any cologne in general. It&#x27;s a lot of liquid for the price too. It looks really nice and has a hip name.  CONS: It isn&#x27;t the manliest smell (though that can be subjective too). It sprays out quite a bit of liquid, you could cover your body with it in 2-3 sprays, in other words moderation isn&#x27;t this colognes strong suit. Me personally, I didn&#x27;t like the smell. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you wont.  SMELL: So I prefer more of a woodsy, forestry, manly musk smell. Thallium smells more fresh, breezy. It has a clean smell to it, and what I would describe as a ocean mist smell. It has subtle notes of a more musky smell but it gets completely overshadowed by the more breezy smell. I would even go as far as to call the smell closer to like, fibreeze.  Decide for yourself, even though i dont like Thallium myself, I still use it as my all day cologne, cuz I paid for the damn thing and cuz its not a horrendous smell.</li>
    <li> I was expectin something close to the designer&#x27;s perfumes I usually buy but was disappointed when I got it. The smell is generic and cheap. The smell is similar to what you get from a dedorant or a soap. The smell lasts a long time and thats not a good thing for this smell.  Don&#x27;t buy if you are used to the $50 perfumes. I wounder why so many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this based off the reviews. At first it smelled ok.. then my girlfriend smelled it on me and she said it smells like a Babar shop..too much like baby powder. It was a good price but not worth it. I&#x27;ll probably give it away or just chunk it cuz I won&#x27;t wear again.</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances out for men.  The smell is wonderful and it last for a really long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for my husband. The scent is fruity/floral, which to me smells more feminine than masculine so actually it might be unisex to some. One spray &amp; this cologne will stay where you put it all day or night.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this cologne is much too strong &amp; like I said it is not a clean masculine scent. Did not meet my expectations at all, because I wasn&#x27;t looking for something fruity &amp; unisex.</li>
    <li> nice smelling product</li>
    <li> I definitely like this Bottle of Cologne.</li>
    <li> Thallium by Jaques Evard, has a intoxicating smell that just holds your senses for the moment and it doesn&#x27;t let you go. Its amazing...</li>
    <li> Pretty good cologne! And lasts a while too! Have never smelled something like this. I would say it&#x27;s good for casual settings</li>
    <li> Great Fragrance for the money paid.  Great complement getter for sure.</li>
    <li> smells really good and last long</li>
    <li> Just buy it.  Smells clean, and what else could a man ask for.  Great scent for everyday use and it&#x27;s priced right.  Like I said, just buy it.</li>
    <li> I went to Dillard&#x27;s and even a discount store it cost $45.  It doesn&#x27;t get a lot of compliments but it smells great.</li>
    <li> Beware do not blind buy cologne its VERY SWEET...&lt;br /&gt;If you love sweet candy colognes then go ahead you will enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;smells like cotton candy tiny amount of musk&lt;br /&gt;To each there own&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longevity 9/10&lt;br /&gt;Projection 8.5/10&lt;br /&gt;Scent 6/10&lt;br /&gt;Versatility 5/10&lt;br /&gt;Price 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Season spring, winter, fall.. maaaybe a summer night if its in the 60&#x27;s- low 70&#x27;s</li>
    <li> The best perfume I&#x27;ve ever bought. Better than Armani code or D&amp;G the one.</li>
    <li> Smells great lasts longer than other colognes i&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
    <li> i like the perfume ...</li>
    <li> Cologne smells very good and the delivery of the product was prompt.</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne, and great price too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne! I was a little skeptical being that I&#x27;ve never heard of it but the bottle was nice and the price was reasonable. It has a sweet yet light scent and its the reason why I went from a 8.5 to a perfect 10 on females Christmas list.</li>
    <li> Thallium has been a favorite for years.  Its very light fragrance and I have gotten many compliments over the years.  Always get it on Amazon I should have some auto ship set up every 3 months so I don&#x27;t forget.  Funny used to pay 40 bucks for this in some perfume shops when I first started using it.  Still would of been worth it.  But sub 20 bucks haven&#x27;t found anything else on its level&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the fragrance does only last 3 to 4 hours in this south florida humidity</li>
    <li> Came on time and smells great!</li>
    <li> bad quality, have used this one before and lasts before, this seller item disappears by the hour</li>
    <li> I think this Thallium is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s affordable and I always receive compliments of how great I smell when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Surprising nice smell for the price.  My friends keeps using this.  Actually I don&#x27;t mind since they don&#x27;t use the more expensive cologne.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at buying a scent on the internet without having a preview of it... but based on the excellent reviews, I gave it a go. Well, it is everything I could have hoped for! Clean, sexy, and yup... qualifies for what the guys call &amp;#34;panty dropper&amp;#34; cologne! It smells amazing on my fiance, I just wanted to curl up on his chest all night long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies - don&#x27;t miss out, make your man the one every other woman drools over when he walks by. A definite signature scent that lasts, plus a little bit goes a long way!!!! Enjoy..... hehehe!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne based on the good reviews.  I will say it has a great scent.  Has a somewhat sweet, vanilla hinted, smell...somewhat sweet, but not too sweet...therefore, still smells masculine.  I am late 40&#x27;s, and have had several females ask me what it was when I have worn it.  The females ALL seem to like it.  My only complaint would be that it only seems to last a couple of hours, then the scent is gone.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after watching all stella Youtube reviews and reading all the great Amazon reviews.I could not wait for it to arrive One Youtube reviewer actually rated this as his top frag over all the big names for his top 10. Smells way too flowery, been using it for 3 weeks now and still do not like it. It only last about 1-2 hrs if that on me. The name, presentation and bottle are top notch however. I am glad that I only paid abot $20 w/ shipping for it. I have to say that I am highly suspect of all these reviews.It seems that this Frag used the Blair Witch advertisment/marketing strategies to suck people in. Just like the movie this is a flop.I was going to get the Thallium Black but that wont be happening. This will be used as an expensive litter box spray.</li>
    <li> My husband love this cologne</li>
    <li> Little more vanilla and floral than expected. All the reviews saying it is a &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; scent are a bit misleading. Will make a good gift in a pinch, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Thallium is my absolute go to cologne, point blank!</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling cologne which has a very mellow scent to it. Its not too powerful but you sure will love it. Cant go wrong with this kind of deal. The shipping was fast and product is amazing. Will order again in future.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few different ones. Tried this one and like it but will come back later to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell last all day on me,recommend it for ages 21-45. My wife loves it on me.</li>
    <li> Not all scents and colognes work but for me the paris version of Thallium works fairly well.  More than a few people have commented on how nice it smells and it does last quite some time.  Like many colognes, one might want to try out a sample first.  The bottle spray unit is easy to use and handle.</li>
    <li> Very deep and rich aroma. I switch between this and another to keep from setting up an allergic reaction. I think highly of this cologne.</li>
    <li> Went to the mall in NY and a vendor was trying to sell this to me for $70 and worked her way down to &amp;#34;her discount&amp;#34; as she stated for $40 as I went to walk away. So I said to her let me see what the reviews are online. Quickly she starts to try to show me something else. I am still looking this one up and find it on my android phone on amazon for $18! So she says to me are you going to buy it? I said it is for sale on amazon for $18 she says no way! But I am sure she knew this. Bottom line is, do your research and this product is worth the money. Not everyone will like it because everyone has a different sense of smell.Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> its smells great love it....the smell latest a long time</li>
    <li> powdery and kind of feminine smelling. Works out well for when I&#x27;m cross dressing.</li>
    <li> It smells really good</li>
    <li> This smells so amazing! Girls love it when i put this on. I even really like it. The bottle is pretty big you you do get alot of bang for your buck. Not to mention it comes in a pretty dope looking bottle. I highly reccomend it to any fellow dude</li>
    <li> Love this for summertime people love the cotton candy smell i get compliments all day all night long baby!!!! my girl loves this!</li>
    <li> I have had many top designer colognes and this smeels better then almost half of them buy this u wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice at reviewing colognes. I can&#x27;t really give you a breakdown of what the cologne smells like, I can only tell you about the reaction I received when wearing it. I bought Thallium three years ago along with Rochas for Men. The person who sold them to me suggested that I wear Rochas as an everyday scent and save Thallium for nights out. I agreed with him. Thallium is definitely a \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; scent and I thought it might be a little much to wear it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Rochas for about a year and enjoyed wearing it. No one really commented on it though unless I asked. After about a year I decided to try the Thallium. The women in the office LOVED it and let me know without prompting. I got such positive feedback that I stopped using Rochas and switched to Thallium exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellas, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. It&#x27;s easily worth four times the asking price here.</li>
    <li> if you love the smell of water, then by all means buy this cheap smelling crapola</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and it is his scent...</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my boyfriend for a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift. I received it on time, great packaging and we both love the fragrance. It was both our first times smelling the fragrance and we are both pleased!</li>
    <li> This smells so bad. I highly do not recommend it</li>
    <li> Very Very fast shipping......as far a scent goes.....smells perfumy</li>
    <li> WOW  this smells great. Smooth not to strong but just right. Sent last for hours. Truly a hidden gem. If you have never tried this cologne before, you are in for a big  surprise. You will not be disappointed. Shipped  fast. package received in excellent condition  Would order form this vendor again</li>

    <li> Great smell, great comments so its a great products especially for us younger guys 18 to 20&#x27;s will order a different fragrance like the black next time.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing.  I will be ordering this again, I have not smelled a cologne or perfume that I could stand to continuously inhale and enjoy.  It&#x27;s not over powering like everything else out there.</li>
    <li> Sweet smelling and a must have</li>
    <li> Great smell, saw it at a store for $70. Was a bit skeptical looking at the price here, but after receiving the product, it looks and smells exactly like the sample at the store. The bottle is of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Good for all seasons, moderate to heavy projection and great longevity.</li>
    <li> Love the smell!!  Has a very vibrant tinge to it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, o my its heaven scent!! Reminds me of burberry- husband loves it. Great price! Thanks</li>
    <li> Great smell on my husband</li>
    <li> It has a sweeter, almost women&#x27;s perfume type scent with a manly edge. Great for going out on the town or on a date. I have received lots of compliments from women.</li>
    <li> great price , its something that takes time to get into</li>
    <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered Thallium, and for those of you saying it&#x27;s not a very strong scent, make sure to spray your wrists and neck.. Seems like this cologne gets stronger the more active you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a scent you easily get accustomed to. Which means even though you can&#x27;t smell it anymore, it&#x27;s still powerful to strange noses. I love that, because most scents give me a headache if I can smell it too long. One of my favorite budget colognes for sure.</li>
    <li> Another good,and ESPECIALLY HAS THAT CLEAN SOOTHING SMELL FOR MEN........VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent. I first smelled it when I was at Perfumania (I believe that was the store), and they were retailing it for $89.00 which is WAY out of my price range. So I came to amazon and get it for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is such a elegant, fresh scent and I absolutely love it. It gives me this confidence, and people notice it and I have received several compliments on it. Its masculine, but not musky. I really like the lavender and spices in it. Excellent cologne, and ladies will love it (even though I&#x27;m a gay man, lol).</li>
    <li> Smells good and the price is great. I am also a sucker for a an interesting looking bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells really great for a long time!</li>
    <li> It is my all time fave of all the colognes I have owned. Kouros, Balanciaga, Lapidus are the next in line. All very Unique.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent. Perfect price.</li>
    <li> When I bought this last time it seemed stronger. I think the company made a cheap version of this.  I would go back to my old stuff</li>
    <li> This cologne is nice, I love it. I normally do not wear cologne and I bought this product based off of reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this cologne, the packaging was nice and I put my nose to the spritz. I said, Damn. Not even, Wow or Nice. Just Damn. It&#x27;s that damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me beyond my expectations. I was looking for something very masculine, but this cologne gives you that smell of an innocent side.  I&#x27;ve noticed that 1-3 sprays and the smell stayed on my shirt throughout the whole day and when I woke up, I smelt my shirt &amp; still had the scent of my beloved Thallium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cologne, I recommend this for every day use as well. Very nice product, plan on trying the other ones too maybe.</li>
    <li> Great sent, great look.</li>
    <li> I had a rat infestation in my basement and heard from my pe-paw that the best rat poison he ever used is thallium. the hardware store didn&#x27;t have any, so I ordered some from here and let me tell you it killed them rats dead, though it did make my basement smell like some metrosexual fellows bung hole</li>
    <li> good price, great smell. first time we tried this brand and was very impress by it. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve order things online before. This was by far the best service I&#x27;ve ever had. I order my product on Thursday and by Monday my product was in the mail. I was definitely a very satisfied customer and will do business with them again.</li>
