<li> I&#x27;ve really been into adding a little white on my lower waterline to make my eyes look larger and the whites of my eyes look whiter.</li>
<li> It is long lasting and makes your eyes pop.</li>
<li> the only complaint I have is that it wears off fast</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe how long this stays on.</li>
<li> Not completely waterproof, but about as close as I can find.</li>
<li> It lasts yes, but not for too long maybe 6-8 hours.</li>
<li> I have tried other products that came off almost instantly.</li>
<li> I have used other white eyeliners to improve the brightness of my eye and have never found one that works as well as this one.</li>
<li> Too dry of a pencil.  </li>
<li> The weather has been very dry this summer, and in the morning I struggle to apply this without needing to blend it afterwards.  </li>
<li> After I discovered that, I&#x27;ve been trying to make it part of my makeup routine and find a reliable white eyeliner for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> bought this because I was tired of sharpening/breaking pencils, and I am not aware of any other company that makes a retractable white eyeliner.  </li>
<li> just twist the bottom half.</li>
<li> You do have to reapply half way through the day.</li>
<li> It applies with ease and does not irritate my eyes like other waterproof eyeliners have in the past.</li>
<li> I found this eyeliner to be too harsh.  </li>
<li> What prevents me from giving it 5 stars is it is a little flaky to apply, at least on me.  </li>
<li> It lasts at least a few hours.</li>
<li> I usually moisturize my face, too, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect this to require that</li>

    <li> IT IS WONDERFUL FOR ME</li>
    <li> I have never used a white eye pencil, so being in my 60&#x27;s I figured with my eyes needing to brighten up I&#x27;d try it! Well, I love it! Easy to apply and stays all day. I have extremely sensitive eyes and this white eye liner I use on my inter bottom eye rim doesn&#x27;t bother me at all!</li>
    <li> This did not last even an hour on my water line. Reading the other reviews i had high hopes.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Really pigmented! Shipped &amp; arrived quickly. I love it. Good quality and price.</li>
    <li> Great quality and unbeatable price.  Apply on inside to instantly make eyes look bigger!</li>
    <li> Really good eyeliner! the only complaint I have is that it wears off fast</li>
    <li> Best for waterline. I have tried other products that came off almost instantly. This stayed on almost all night.</li>
    <li> goes on easily, but seems to irritate my eyes over the course of the day. Not in love with it.</li>
    <li> Does not smear!! Gotta love a great eyeliner that is cheap and doesn&#x27;t smear. Easy to use and no need to sharpen ....just twist the bottom half. Love this product</li>
    <li> i just tried to use white eye liner after I saw some women in Asia using it to make their eyes bigger. It lasts yes, but not for too long maybe 6-8 hours.The thing I like most is that it never sting my eyes compared to other water-resistant eyeliners that I have used and tossed. I will definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Goes on well and doesn&#x27;t sting eyes</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. It lasts at least a few hours. It doesn&#x27;t glide on all that smoothly, but that&#x27;s all right.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different white eyeliners and this is my favorite. I&#x27;ll never buy another! It is long lasting and makes your eyes pop.</li>
    <li> Love It exactly what i excepted and got here early</li>
    <li> amazing product! stays in place, (even on the waterline), til you remove it!  thats very important for people who wear contact lenses, like me, because all other white liners ive tried have smeared and made a mess on my eye and on my contacts! this one is a winner!</li>
    <li> I found this eyeliner to be too harsh.  Too dramatic and bright.  I prefer a softer, more natural look.</li>
    <li> Works well, goes on nice and smooth. You do have to reapply half way through the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really been into adding a little white on my lower waterline to make my eyes look larger and the whites of my eyes look whiter. This is chalky. I am still on the hunt.</li>
    <li> Too dry of a pencil.  Hurt to put it on!</li>
    <li> The color is crisp and very white! I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable this was to put on. Great for cosplay make-up!</li>
    <li> Does as it says. Is waterproof and Stays in place on your inner lower lid all day, looks great and accents your make up Bringing out your eyes!</li>
    <li> Product glides on easily.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I love this on my waterline. Makes my eyes look bigger and brighter. It applies with ease and does not irritate my eyes like other waterproof eyeliners have in the past. Nice bright white color which seems last with minimal wear during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply it heavy or light depends on your liking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried white eyeliner, but I read about it.  This one goes on easy and make my eyes bright.  My husband even commented on it.  I does apply so easily that you can get the eyeliner on your eyelashes if you are not careful.  I also find that it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly.  You have to smudge it with a fingertip or qtip.  But after that, it looks great!</li>
    <li> This description says &amp;#34;water-resistant&amp;#34;. In my experience I have found this pencil to be &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;. It stays on the water line of my eye all day.  I have used other white eyeliners to improve the brightness of my eye and have never found one that works as well as this one.</li>
    <li> A little white eyeliner is a great trick for looking more awake.  After I discovered that, I&#x27;ve been trying to make it part of my makeup routine and find a reliable white eyeliner for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was tired of sharpening/breaking pencils, and I am not aware of any other company that makes a retractable white eyeliner.  It&#x27;s a decent product - the vividness is great and lasts reasonably long. What prevents me from giving it 5 stars is it is a little flaky to apply, at least on me.  The weather has been very dry this summer, and in the morning I struggle to apply this without needing to blend it afterwards.  I usually moisturize my face, too, so I wouldn&#x27;t expect this to require that extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just despise having to sharpen pencils, so I&#x27;ll probably buy this one again.  If they could just improve the formula, that would put it over the top!</li>
