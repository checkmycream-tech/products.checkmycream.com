      <li>Tried a bunch of brands, liked this one and the price was right!</li>
      <li>The eczema is almost completely gone too lol.</li>
      <li>I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this product to anyone who desires soft, beautiful skin!</li>
      <li>With my old piercings the jewelry moves more freely and I&#x27;ve seen just an overall improvement in the health of the piercings - they&#x27;re happy!</li>
      <li>all in all I would say that I am still quite happy with this product and would definitely order again</li>
      <li>So whether I buy it from &amp;#34;AustraliaNaturals.com&amp;#34; or somewhere else, Emu Oil seems to be a great addition to my daily needs.  </li>
      <li>It is also very reasonable, I love it.</li>
      <li>but so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Awesome natural oil that can be used for multiple things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my Tiger Balm patches that are tried and true for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wash my hand ALOT throughout the day, so I need super duper moisturization at night.</li>
      <li>Older skin takes a bit more care and patience these days.  </li>
      <li>Great to use at night or a little with your daytime moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The ordering process was a smooth and straight process.  </li>
      <li>Emu is great!i love it because it makes my skin soft and supple.</li>
      <li>At least for me, I&#x27;m finding that emu oil by itself is just as fine as that other product was, and already my eyelashes are looking more beautiful!  </li>
      <li>My skin is feeling great too, and actually appears somewhat smoother around the eyes (I&#x27;m too young for crow&#x27;s feet, haha!).  </li>
      <li>Good oil to mix with other oils</li>
      <li>The price was right for 2 oz.</li>
      <li>Using it all just seems right, it honors the animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Emu oil is fantastic -- I have tried many brands and as long as they are organic</li>
      <li>Mix a few more drops in any good heavy skin cream, either your own or purchased, and slather it on.</li>
      <li>So far I love what it has done for them (in addition to exfoliating them) and now I have dared to expand its use on my elbows and face, straight out of the bottle</li>
      <li>sense since it&#x27;s pretty close to being just that.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my face, just a pea size drop, absorbs quickly and does not have much of a smell.</li>
      <li>Is someone buying large quantities of it elsewhere, pouring it into bottles and sticking their label on it?  </li>
      <li>However, I purchased it as a cure for eczema and that certainly didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get it and would really like to know this part.  </li>
      <li>And this was from a cosmetologist who really knew her stuff</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really used this product.  </li>
      <li>and it was very Priced it and it broke her out .....;..ILike this product is very soft and gentle to the skin.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles I try to replace it whenever I run out, that&#x27;s how much I use it!</li>
      <li>I use it on my very dry feet and it keeps them more moisturized and soft.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this oil mainly to use on my feet and heels now that summer and flip flop days are here.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it takes a little more time.  </li>
      <li>Did wonderful on a bad burn I got on my hand during vacation.  </li>
      <li>But I won&#x27;t hold it against the oil - they are simply the lines of a life pretty well lived</li>
      <li>I used Mederma for the first 3 months as directed, but was still left with raised, reddish purple scars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m applying to my eyelashes as well; I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a natural growth stimulant and who doesn&#x27;t want longer, fuller lashes!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It helps some people more than others, but usually does the trick.</li>
      <li>It works on old or new piercings as my nipples were over a year old</li>
      <li>Hands down this particular emu oil is the shit.com it works better for me than other emu oil I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Are they such a very new company?  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily, is greasy only for a few minutes, and absorbs completely by the time I&#x27;m done drying my hair after my shower.</li>
      <li>that, even though I no longer am using that particular cosmetic, emu oil by itself might garner similar results.  </li>
      <li>I mainly use it a my facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is a little different from most Emo Oils I&#x27;ve used, because of the Vitamin E mixed in</li>
      <li>I highly recommended this product as part of someone&#x27;s daily skin care regimen; mine is minimalist, but it gets the job done, especially now</li>
      <li>As for the rest of my face, although it does remain a bit greasy (and shinier) for longer than I would like (very long), it seems to me the texture of my face is smoother although all of my wrinkles are still where they were before I started using it - no improvement on that front so far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little bottle, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not so thick as other oils and doesn&#x27;t contain strong ingredients that burn the eyes, so</li>
      <li>The Emu oil really is helping keep my skin soft , I use it every day even around the delicate eye area.</li>

<li> I add a small amount of it to my hand cream at night so as to REALLY moisturize my skin when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
<li> I like to use this as a massage oil and it does not leave a greasy residue and it last a long time</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no real scent to it as compared to the BioOil, and my scars have shown vast improvement in the last month I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
<li> I have been mixing a little emu oil with my regular lotion and it has turbo boosted the moisturizing effects, especially on my elbows, knees and feet.</li>
<li> but my VCH was a few months old to help with keep secretions from drying and adhering to the skin or jewelry, which cuts down on crusting, trauma, and discomfort.</li>
<li> i&#x27;m still using this a little goes along way, i mixed it in with castor and coconut oils, works well on the hair.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed it never really solidifies like 100% Emu Oil, meaning you don&#x27;t have to melt it to use it!&lt;br</li>
<li> So I ordered a two-ounce bottle of Australia Naturals Emu Oil from Amazon, and it arrived the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product has totally helped my dry skin, and pretty bad eczema.</li>
<li> but so far I have not seen any positive results on that and am a bit disappointed.  </li>
<li> I use it under my eyes for my dark circles and under eye wrinkle</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the product at the recommendation of a master piercer to help with the overall healing process of my piercings (nipples and VCH). It works on old or new piercings as my nipples were over a year old but my VCH was a few months old to help with keep secretions from drying and adhering to the skin or jewelry, which cuts down on crusting, trauma, and discomfort. With my old piercings the jewelry moves more freely and I&#x27;ve seen just an overall improvement in the health of the piercings - they&#x27;re happy!</li>
    <li> Mom loves it. Works better for her than anti-wrinkle creams she bought. Mother in law is happy with it too.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used this product.  My vet recommended it for a sore on my dogs paw. It was practically healed, tho, when I rec&#x27;d the oil.</li>
    <li> This good here very fast and the price was very good. If you have never used EMU oil before you need to find out what this great stuff is. It is great on scares on burns and on and on,,try it and see.....</li>
    <li> This is a little different from most Emo Oils I&#x27;ve used, because of the Vitamin E mixed in I&#x27;ve noticed it never really solidifies like 100% Emu Oil, meaning you don&#x27;t have to melt it to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Emu Oil on my keloid scars on my lobes (from stretching) and there has been a DRAMATIC difference in the size and toughness of the scars, I also like to use it during the last stage of healing on cuts and tattoos to minimize scar tissue. It&#x27;s Amazing!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything-waste of money.</li>
    <li> Emu is great!i love it because it makes my skin soft and supple. It is also very reasonable, I love it.</li>
    <li> Am so happy I found this specifically brand, because my sister bought a bottle of Emu Oil not refined and it was very Priced it and it broke her out .....;..ILike this product is very soft and gentle to the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent that makes it perfect. The price was right for 2 oz.</li>
    <li> Good oil to mix with other oils</li>
    <li> Good Quality, Goes a Looooonnnnggggg Way,  And my skin Looks n Feels GREAT!!! Will buy again. Wish there was a bigger size tho</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with betadine clay in a recipe for my son&#x27;s eczema. Hydrates, soothes, and smooths the skin. One of the nicest oils I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes a great massage oil. Will post my recipe if any one is interested.&lt;br /&gt;Update I have been using it for about a month one drop smoothed under each eyes. Has removed almost all my wrinkles. The eczema is almost completely gone too lol.</li>
    <li> Emu oil is fantastic -- I have tried many brands and as long as they are organic/natural I go with the lowest priced product.  I mainly use it a my facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil mainly to use on my feet and heels now that summer and flip flop days are here.  So far I love what it has done for them (in addition to exfoliating them) and now I have dared to expand its use on my elbows and face, straight out of the bottle (it seems I&#x27;m quite the daredevil here...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a bit of seborrheic dermatitis on my face but so far I have not seen any positive results on that and am a bit disappointed.  As for the rest of my face, although it does remain a bit greasy (and shinier) for longer than I would like (very long), it seems to me the texture of my face is smoother although all of my wrinkles are still where they were before I started using it - no improvement on that front so far.  Maybe it takes a little more time.  Older skin takes a bit more care and patience these days.  But I won&#x27;t hold it against the oil - they are simply the lines of a life pretty well lived and if they want to stay, I&#x27;m okay with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on a very painful arthritic area on my hand but didn&#x27;t feel any relief like some others have stated.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Tiger Balm patches that are tried and true for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all I would say that I am still quite happy with this product and would definitely order again (I&#x27;m here now to order another bottle for myself and one for a good friend too.)  I also plan to mix it in with my usual after shower (Eucerin Eczema Lotion) shortly and see what it can do for my miserable itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has me a bit disconcerted is the fact that when I tried to look them up on their website but their website does not exist (the domain name is being held for them at Go Daddy.)  Are they such a very new company?  Is someone buying large quantities of it elsewhere, pouring it into bottles and sticking their label on it?  Or is it that someone is selling off X amount of remaining product from going out of business (mine came from a woman with a California return address - no company name)?  I don&#x27;t get it and would really like to know this part.  So whether I buy it from &amp;#34;AustraliaNaturals.com&amp;#34; or somewhere else, Emu Oil seems to be a great addition to my daily needs.  Good Stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend who loved it. She said it was the best oil she&#x27;d ever used. And this was from a cosmetologist who really knew her stuff</li>
    <li> Purchased because the winter weather here has made my skin so dry and uncomfortable. The Emu oil really is helping keep my skin soft , I use it every day even around the delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> This stuff gave me a rash that lasted almost 3 weeks! I don&#x27;t know what all is in it but in the trash it goes!</li>
    <li> Good hair product.  The ordering process was a smooth and straight process.  It is also a goof body oil. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently begun cleansing my face with a combination of Castor and Emu Oils. My skin looks radiant and oh-so-clear! No more soap for me! This Emu oil also helps with receiving the pain of fire ant bites and mosquito bites. I&#x27;m applying to my eyelashes as well; I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a natural growth stimulant and who doesn&#x27;t want longer, fuller lashes! A must-have!</li>
    <li> This is a good buy and it works well. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my face, just a pea size drop, absorbs quickly and does not have much of a smell. I have only been using it for two weeks but so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this and my skin seems to like it also. Great to use at night or a little with your daytime moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use it on my very dry feet and it keeps them more moisturized and soft.  I use it everyday and it never leaves an oily residue.</li>
    <li> i love !!! my emu oil it moisturizes, and absorbs into the skin not greasy. Thank You</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product Great for hair growth and old scars. I will continue to buy this product from this seller. 😌</li>
    <li> I have been mixing a little emu oil with my regular lotion and it has turbo boosted the moisturizing effects, especially on my elbows, knees and feet. A little goes a long way so this small bottle has lasted me a couple of months. There is no smell or taste so I can dab a little on my lips before I go to bed at night. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great for sore muscles and join aches.  It&#x27;s a little bottle, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, so if you don&#x27;t plan on using this up in a month or two, store it in the fridge or a cool dark place. Any oil can go rancid, and when emu oil does, it smells &#x27;off&#x27;, to me it gets a chicken fat smell.&lt;br /&gt;Makes sense since it&#x27;s pretty close to being just that.&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t like the thought of putting animal fat on my body, I do like the idea that nothing goes to waste, from meat to feathers to oil. Using it all just seems right, it honors the animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this oil is added to a couple of home preparations for skin. When feet get dry and cracked, first buff, then massage a few drops in. Mix a few more drops in any good heavy skin cream, either your own or purchased, and slather it on. Cover with white socks.&lt;br /&gt;It helps some people more than others, but usually does the trick.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this oil.  I add a small amount of it to my hand cream at night so as to REALLY moisturize my skin when I&#x27;m sleeping. I wash my hand ALOT throughout the day, so I need super duper moisturization at night. This small bottle has lasted me for months. I will definitely reorder when it&#x27;s gone. BTW, there is no nasty smell to this oil.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my stomach on 8/21/12, and was left with 5 scars. I used Mederma for the first 3 months as directed, but was still left with raised, reddish purple scars. I tried BioOil, but didn&#x27;t like that it didn&#x27;t seem to fully absorb, and so then moved on to Emu Oil. I love it. It goes on easily, is greasy only for a few minutes, and absorbs completely by the time I&#x27;m done drying my hair after my shower. There&#x27;s no real scent to it as compared to the BioOil, and my scars have shown vast improvement in the last month I&#x27;ve been using it. Definitely going to be a staple in my beauty cabinet from here on out! I&#x27;ve also used it on my face after giving myself a facial, and have noticed a decrease in blemishes.</li>
    <li> Tried a bunch of brands, liked this one and the price was right!</li>
    <li> This oil does well enough for keeping my hands moist. However, I purchased it as a cure for eczema and that certainly didn&#x27;t work. Still, I like it better than vitamin E oils and it&#x27;s not so thick as other oils and doesn&#x27;t contain strong ingredients that burn the eyes, so you can even use it for your eye skin eczema if you have nothing better at the time. 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite. Emu oil is the BEST!!!!!!!! I use it every day and night on my face as a moisterizer.</li>
    <li> dooesnt leave greasy film but caused me breakouts ...</li>
    <li> Relieves pain at the source and keeps skin smooth best product I&#x27;ve ever tired. I no longer take pain medication for my muscle or skeletal aches.</li>
    <li> I put this on my skin and it made the zit bigger? and a red circle where the skin is.  It made my skin worse.  So remember it may not work for everyone.  I had to return it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a returnable item if it does not work for you, or makes you worse like it did to me.  I wounder what the recovery time is on this?</li>
    <li> Awesome natural oil that can be used for multiple things.</li>
    <li> Hands down this particular emu oil is the shit.com it works better for me than other emu oil I&#x27;ve tried. I use it mainly as a facial and eye moisturizer and on my stretch marks n scars.This prouduct does wonders. My face is softer and smother and it glows. I use it under my eyes for my dark circles and under eye wrinkle and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference. So far I&#x27;ve ordered 3 bottles I try to replace it whenever I run out, that&#x27;s how much I use it!</li>
    <li> I like to use this as a massage oil and it does not leave a greasy residue and it last a long time</li>
    <li> After surgery I used this and I have no scares. It helped with the joint pain also. I also now have the softest hands ever.</li>
    <li> Keeps dried skin moisturizer without breakouts.  Works well for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Did wonderful on a bad burn I got on my hand during vacation.  Thought it would leave an ugly scar but using the oil it healed and all of the redness and rough skin went away.  Really impressed my daughter and myself.  Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I had used a product about a year ago that contained emu oil, and I remembered how nice it made my skin feel, how luxurious and not greasy.  I experimented with that product and found that, if I put it on my eyelashes, it seemed to make them grow longer and thicker, faster!  So it occurred to me recently that, even though I no longer am using that particular cosmetic, emu oil by itself might garner similar results.  So I ordered a two-ounce bottle of Australia Naturals Emu Oil from Amazon, and it arrived the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been keeping it in the fridge while not in use, but prior to a shower, I&#x27;ll put it on the counter to become viscous again.  At least for me, I&#x27;m finding that emu oil by itself is just as fine as that other product was, and already my eyelashes are looking more beautiful!  My skin is feeling great too, and actually appears somewhat smoother around the eyes (I&#x27;m too young for crow&#x27;s feet, haha!).  I highly recommended this product as part of someone&#x27;s daily skin care regimen; mine is minimalist, but it gets the job done, especially now that I have emu oil in my arsenal again.</li>
    <li> this product took several days to become milky colored and separate out as emu oil does--so don&#x27;t despair---it is emu oil!&lt;br /&gt;is a great moisturizer---&lt;br /&gt;i would like to know how it is extracted---if lots of chemicals are used?? or just how the process works???</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m still using this a little goes along way, i mixed it in with castor and coconut oils, works well on the hair.</li>
    <li> Recently I had carpal tunnel surgery and a friend told me to use Emu Oil instead of cocoa butter.  A few days AFTER the stitches were removed I started working it into my scars and I believe it helped the healing process and believe that I will hardly have a scar at all.</li>
    <li> This product has totally helped my dry skin, and pretty bad eczema. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this product to anyone who desires soft, beautiful skin!</li>
