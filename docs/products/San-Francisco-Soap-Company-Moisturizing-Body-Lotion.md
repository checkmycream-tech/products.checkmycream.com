      <li>I will use it on my feet at the gym (because I am cheap), but wash it off my hands!!!  </li>
      <li>I have used this lotion in this scent before and absolutely loved it.</li>
      <li>I bought this lotion because I loved the sample from a hotel, but what was on sale for a discount from the Amazon seller smelled like mildew and I had to wash it off and return it.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better lotion at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with the texture and smell...</li>
      <li>Lovely sugary citrus smell.</li>
      <li>At first whiff, you&#x27;re reminded of that citrusy goodness of that hotel lotion, but like burping after a delicious barbecue, those sweet memories are quickly displaced by a burning aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>Super nice body lotion, great texture,nice scent, really soothing and creamy.  </li>
      <li>They loved it so much I decided to buy more for them to use.  </li>
      <li>Loved it so much</li>
      <li>It smells like wonderful pink lemonade!</li>
      <li>Sweet and refreshing but not overly fruity.</li>
      <li>Love the clean fresh smell !</li>
      <li>I stayed at a Ramada Inn where there were free samples of the Sugared Citrus scent by the San Francisco Soap Company-</li>
      <li>and it was light and not greasy</li>
      <li>I was HOOKED on this fantastic scent.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for those who love oranges !</li>
      <li>I used small samples of this at a hotel in California and the citrus smell was so wonderful I decided to order some.</li>
      <li>I was first given this as a gift and brought it in for my high school students to use; they LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>Luckily, I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Does not smell fresh.</li>
      <li>I wanted to shower it off right when I slathered it on....</li>
      <li>It was the right price</li>
      <li>Such a great alternative to the same scents everyone wears from Bath and Body Works.</li>
      <li>Lotion is light and soft !</li>
      <li>I first tried the lotion at the Ramada Plaza in St. Louis.</li>
      <li>The actual price paid was ridiculously cheap, as the true cost was reflected in the shipping charges.</li>
      <li>I was so excieted to finally have the lotion I had enjoyed so much!  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with this brand and scent on a recent trip.</li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my skin very supple.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to find it for sale and while the size is great the overall price and final product are poor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting older</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pin point what the smell is besides saying it smells like an old person or very old lotion.</li>
      <li>The light citrusy scent is missing completely.</li>
      <li>The bottle I got in my order though, had a cracked lid and smelled old.</li>
      <li>It just has an old soap smell.</li>
      <li>I just loved the lotion and was sad that it was gone.</li>
      <li>I will now go directly to the San Francisco Soap Company and buy the fresh, original Sugared Citrus Lotion that they will stand behind.</li>
      <li>In fact, you probably grabbed half a dozen of those samples from your last hotel stay, but since your stash is running low, you decided to go legit and get the real thing.  </li>
      <li>and then you waste your money believing this large size is the same smell.</li>

<li> I am very dissatisfied with the smell, it almost has an old smell and is not pleasant</li>
<li> so I cannot tell if it really is old; however, there is a settle line down the back of the tube like it was sitting on its side for a long time.</li>
<li> This item may have sat on a shelf for too long.  </li>
<li> This on the other hand is not the same texture (feel) or smell...</li>
<li> Even so, it was cheaper than the other total prices elsewhere online.</li>
<li> so I decided to buy the real thing through the company and when it arrived it was thick and greasy yucky!</li>
<li> The lotion leaves a chemical, plastic scent behind which overpowers the main scents</li>
<li> As long as I have students, I will keep buying this product!!!!</li>
<li> My Mom discovered this lotion a few years ago and loves it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion, which for me means less mess.  </li>
<li> I had gotten a small motel-sized tube of this lotion a few years ago.  </li>
<li> I wasted my money!</li>
<li> My husband brought home a small bottle from a hotel that he had stayed in.</li>
<li> Nothing like the small sample bottles.</li>
<li> I kept looking at it on line... too expensive... not worth it... until I found this tube.  </li>
<li> I actually smelled kinda bad.</li>
<li> And it wasn&#x27;t only me who absolutely HATED the smell.</li>
<li> and I can hardly stand it!!!</li>
<li> What a disappointment that was.  </li>
<li> Stuck to the hotel samples because this is a disappointment.</li>
<li> I am so disappointed!!!  </li>
<li> Disgusting!  </li>
<li> It smells terrible!</li>
<li> This Sugared Citrus Moisturizing Lotion smells HORRIBLE.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used small samples of this at a hotel in California and the citrus smell was so wonderful I decided to order some. It smells terrible! Nothing like the small sample bottles. I will throw it out because I can&#x27;t possibly use it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful wake up scent, lightly invigorating.  It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my skin very supple.</li>
    <li> I got a tiny sample size bottle of this traveling and staying in a hotel that used this lotion. I fell in love with the texture and smell... This on the other hand is not the same texture (feel) or smell...this smell is horrid!! I wasted my money! Yuck!!! I wanted to shower it off right when I slathered it on.... I&#x27;ve gotten better lotion at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> I ammapled this lotion in a 5 star hotel over the summer and it was light and not greasy so I decided to buy the real thing through the company and when it arrived it was thick and greasy yucky!</li>
    <li> Love the clean fresh smell ! Lotion is light and soft !</li>
    <li> My husband brought home a small bottle from a hotel that he had stayed in. I just loved the lotion and was sad that it was gone. Luckily, I found it on Amazon. Amazing. The sugar crystals help exfoliate and soften my skin. Would recommend to all my friends...oh wait.....I have!</li>
    <li> The lotion did not smell of citrus when I received it. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a ZERO I would. This is NOT like the lotion at the hotels. This Sugared Citrus Moisturizing Lotion smells HORRIBLE. To say it REEKS is an understatement. And it wasn&#x27;t only me who absolutely HATED the smell. I had others smell it and they couldn&#x27;t stand it. I&#x27;m getting older so I figured maybe my sense of smell was off but no...the sample bottle from the hotel a month ago still smelles heavenly. I believe they hook you with the great smelling one and then you waste your money believing this large size is the same smell. BUYER BEWARE this will end up in the trash. I will never buy this again. DO NOT BUY THIS LOTION.</li>
    <li> My Mom discovered this lotion a few years ago and loves it. I&#x27;ve bought it a couple of times now for different occasions. She was thrilled to get it again. The actual price paid was ridiculously cheap, as the true cost was reflected in the shipping charges. Even so, it was cheaper than the other total prices elsewhere online. Happy to find and gift it again.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re only considering purchasing this product because you tried a hotel sample with the same name from the same company. In fact, you probably grabbed half a dozen of those samples from your last hotel stay, but since your stash is running low, you decided to go legit and get the real thing.  THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That hotel sample?  Party in your nose.  This stuff?  A mix of potpourri and grandma&#x27;s armpit.  At first whiff, you&#x27;re reminded of that citrusy goodness of that hotel lotion, but like burping after a delicious barbecue, those sweet memories are quickly displaced by a burning aftertaste.  Aftersmell?  Is that a thing?  Buy this product and you&#x27;ll find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and just raid the hotel cart on your next stay at Ramada Inn.  Your nose will thank you.</li>
    <li> The lotion smelled nothing like the shampoo or soap. I am very dissatisfied with the smell, it almost has an old smell and is not pleasant</li>
    <li> Recipient loves lotion</li>
    <li> This stuff smells ridiculously delicious. It&#x27;s a medium-light moisturizer without a lot of weight or lasting greasiness to it. Great for after a shower.</li>
    <li> Love the product! great scent, and felt great on my dry skin...very refreshing! Lovely sugary citrus smell. Highly recommended for those who love oranges !</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I loved the sample from a hotel, but what was on sale for a discount from the Amazon seller smelled like mildew and I had to wash it off and return it.  Disgusting!  I will now go directly to the San Francisco Soap Company and buy the fresh, original Sugared Citrus Lotion that they will stand behind.</li>
    <li> Super nice body lotion, great texture,nice scent, really soothing and creamy.  It&#x27;s thicker than I expected, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I first tried the lotion at the Ramada Plaza in St. Louis. Loved it so much I sought it out and bought it!</li>
    <li> I was first given this as a gift and brought it in for my high school students to use; they LOVE it!  They loved it so much I decided to buy more for them to use.  It&#x27;s a thick lotion, which for me means less mess.  As long as I have students, I will keep buying this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I used the soap like this product in a hotel we stayed in upon returning home I found it online and ordered the different products to try</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion in this scent before and absolutely loved it. The bottle I got in my order though, had a cracked lid and smelled old. The light citrusy scent is missing completely. It just has an old soap smell. I can&#x27;t pin point what the smell is besides saying it smells like an old person or very old lotion. There is not an expiration on it so I cannot tell if it really is old; however, there is a settle line down the back of the tube like it was sitting on its side for a long time. I will try getting this again, but not from this seller.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a small motel-sized tube of this lotion a few years ago.  I LOVED it!  I kept looking at it on line... too expensive... not worth it... until I found this tube.  It was the right price and since I had a credit, I sprung for it.  I waited for it (only two days, but you know what it&#x27;s like when you WANT something).  I was so excieted to finally have the lotion I had enjoyed so much!  BOY!!! What a disappointment that was.  Either they&#x27;ve changed their formula or I have changed my sense of smell.  It smells like I fell into the spice rack and I can hardly stand it!!! I will use it on my feet at the gym (because I am cheap), but wash it off my hands!!!  I am so disappointed!!!  I will not recommend this lotion to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this brand and scent on a recent trip. I was so pleased to find it for sale and while the size is great the overall price and final product are poor. The lotion leaves a chemical, plastic scent behind which overpowers the main scents and it&#x27;s very oily. Stuck to the hotel samples because this is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this lotion, it smells great and does not leave a greasy feeling behind, which makes me happy. No complaints!</li>
    <li> This item may have sat on a shelf for too long.  Does not smell fresh.</li>
    <li> It did not smell a thing like the sugared citrus lotion I got before from the same company! I actually smelled kinda bad. Got this for my moms birthday and was so embarrassed!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best smelling products EVER. I stayed at a Ramada Inn where there were free samples of the Sugared Citrus scent by the San Francisco Soap Company- I was HOOKED on this fantastic scent. It smells like wonderful pink lemonade! Sweet and refreshing but not overly fruity. Such a great alternative to the same scents everyone wears from Bath and Body Works.</li>
