<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gives me the matte look that I want but takes to long to dry and because I use hot water a lot, the matte look only lasts a week.</li>
    <li> It is an awesome touch to the nail</li>
    <li> I just received my Madly Matte polish today, and as someone who has experience with kleancolor products I&#x27;ve learned you need a little patience when it comes to letting the polish dry, especially if you use multiple coats. I like the way it makes the color underneath look. I wasn&#x27;t expecting an excellent outcome just something a little different than usual, which this product provided me with, I would most likely buy this color again.</li>
    <li> Goes matte but kinda wears off or gets a lil shiny the next day... i found a better brand.... but other Kleancolor nail polishes are amazing!</li>
    <li> It really didnt leave a Matte Finish and just makes your nail look dry !:/ and messed up don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> By the time this product reached my house it was thick and goopy. Takes a very long time to dry, in fact one day I slept with them drying over night and by morning they were ruined because they weren&#x27;t dry. Leaves weird air bubbles.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered on time an extra plus. This is my first time using a matte finish and I am very pleased with the product. Had to go on you tube to learn techniques on using it. But it was perfect.</li>
    <li> I used Madly Matte  to change the look or design on a single shade of polish. Example:tape-off a portion of your nail to make certain areas matte and other areas shine. This creates an interesting, supple pattern or design using only one shade of polish.</li>
    <li> This is great works on any color u have witch I like instead of buying individual matte colors and u don&#x27;t need much just one coat .</li>
    <li> Use this product to turn any polish you own into a matte polish insted of a gloss look. You can come up with a million different design ideas with this product. I would definitely recomend this product to those who love to do nail art or those who are just looking for something different!</li>
    <li> I bought this product excited to find a cheap matte topcoat. I have purchased matte polishes, and without a topcoat, I can&#x27;t get anything to stay more than a few days. This topcoat goes on rather thick and you think it will be great. I let it completely dry, then went on with my life. The next time I happened to look at my nails, they were COMPLETELY ruined. The topcoat smudges and budges anytime it touches anything. It completely ruined my OPI polish underneath. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Loved it! And got it quick</li>
    <li> i was looking for a matte finish to try on my nails, and this one is great. it takes away the shine, and looks great.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about using this to matte all my shine polishes, but I was a little disappointed! While it does matte your top coat, it tends to leave pretty noticeable streaks on your nails</li>
    <li> It works but it takes forever to dry!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome, ordered it 2days ago, and I got it today. How awesome. And the wrapping is good. And it works fabulous! And dries in seconds!!!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t even work. It made my nailpolish come off... Please spend a little more money and get one that works!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s cheap and it arrived quickly, which was a plus! It dried quickly and the results were just what i wanted.</li>
    <li> It makes your nail polish very dry but it&#x27;s matte effect is really good we&#x27;ll kind of but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> this is an excellent item shipping was here before stated packaged in perfect brand new condition! i absolutely have no complaints about anything on this it was done in excellent order!!! no problems whatsoever!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it i love it i love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sooo pretty for the nails omg didn&#x27;t expect such great quality for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> this product does do what it says.  But it is very thick and even the thinest layer takes forever to dry.  It does give it a non-shiney look ALMOST matte look</li>
    <li> I love Kleancolor products, but this polish is no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick, matte quality is very poor and does not last long. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order off Amazon but i bought it from my nail supply store yesterday. I love klean color products but the madly matte didn&#x27;t work for me and it actually made my nail color shinier than before. I am going to find another matte Polish. I only paid. 97 cents for it so it&#x27;s ok:))</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the ratings and I should have because when I received this product and first tried it on, I like it but the paint fades and it doesn&#x27;t look matted anymore!!! It just looks like you painted your nails without a top coat!! You get what you paid for! But seriously, don&#x27;t ignore the ratings!!! I would rate it no stars.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product on Amazon, I bought it at my local beauty supply for 99 cents. The product works great! if you want a matte look you&#x27;ll have it in about 5 seconds after you apply it. I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon because its much cheaper than $3.45.</li>
    <li> Stays matte for about a day. I applied it, and by the time I washed my hands my nails were almost shiny again. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described -- a matte topcoat to turn any polish into a matte polish.  Product goes on easily and isn&#x27;t too runny (as some topcoats tend to be).  Item was well-packaged and shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> I already tried it!!! lol. I am very satisfied with the Kleancolor polishes, this matte top coat works nicely.  It was nicely packed and delivered on time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> While this polish does its job to make nails look matte, every nail I painted ended up with at least one big, nasty ridge, very similar to what crackle looks like. Applying more polish over it only made the ridge worse and worse, until the ridge ate so far through my color coat that I could see my real nail. It is not very noticeable unless someone is inspecting your nails, which I&#x27;d like people to do if my nails look nice!</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. It arrived great in bubble wrap and did not crack or anything. I painted my nails with opi and let it dry. Soon after it was dry i put on the top coat, it does give it a somewhat matte effect. the thing is that it is very streaky and think. it dries fast but very streaky with lines. almost like a cheap crackle. dont buy. its worth the about 2$</li>
    <li> Kleancolor addict here, i never thought i would like matte but i LOVE it. I get to play and do whatever i am capable of making look pretty. This is awesome with the other polishes from kleancolor, i love all their stuff!</li>
    <li> Creates a cloudy covering on the nail rather than the classy matte look I was going for. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend ever.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find such a cheap matte top coat and extremely cheap but this is not the right one it just ruins your manicure by never drying and other than that besides it is NOT matte at all in fact its just a pearly color if you want an AWSOMEE actual matte finish to your nails try the OPI one u wont regret it its more expensie but worth it I ordered mines 2 days ago and it already came I already tried it and it was perfect</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have every hard of this type of polish so cant wait until I have the chance to play around with it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get this because I&#x27;ve never used matte before and I was pleasantly surprised. The matte finish goes onto nails beautifully and leaves a nice matte coat.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish, works just like it says it does. i do recommend this to anyone .</li>
    <li> Does not leave a matte finish on your nails. Soooo disappointing, do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> The product works but goes on very thick and smudges nail polish even if it&#x27;s completely dried. After it dries you can easily smudge it because it remains gooey. You can find these same brand of nail polish at shopmissa.com for 1$ each. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> This product does not do at all what it is supposed to. It is basically a clear polish that does not make your nail color matte. It also messes up the color underneath. I immediately took it off after seeing what it looked like.</li>
    <li> does not leave nails looking Matte. they are shinier than they were without a topcoat. total waste of money! would not recommend</li>
    <li> love this finisher! Only thing is you have to wait 100% till the base coat is dry or else the finisher runs and it looks ugly</li>
    <li> Because my black nail Polish had came broken and stuck to the bubble wrap also the white color I ordered it looks like cryed up molded white-out . I will not buy another one of your products</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Bottle looks used.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to find a nice cheap matte topcoat. Unfortunately, this top coat sucks! After the top of it was dry to the touch, if you put a little pressure on your nails every bit of polish would bunch up or smudge. Even applying the thinnest layer of it, it still bunches the polish up and just messes up your nail. I don&#x27;t recommend this. I&#x27;m going to try to get Essie Matte About You next time. Guess cheap doesn&#x27;t work all the time!</li>
    <li> Its okay but the effect is not as matte as say NYC matte. Also takes very long to dry. Would rather spend my money on something else.</li>
    <li> A lot of people complain about it smudging, but I you have to actually give it time to dry. And it does take a while to dry, so I can imagine putting it under a uv lamp would help. But this product does work great.</li>
    <li> This matte polish did not meet my expectations...Its still has a slight shiney finnish after it is completely dry...Not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> i like it although its not as MATTE as i would have liked it still have somewhat of a glossy shine.</li>
    <li> I trusted the name of the Kleancolor company for the regular nail polish so I figured this matte top coat would live up to the name but it didn&#x27;t.  Does not matte at all.  This is not the sellers  fault, they held up their end of the transaction perfectly thats why I didn&#x27;t return.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. It is not shiny, and the matte cover lasts long. It does not chip, even after a weeks hard wear.</li>
    <li> I read the other user reviews and just figured they had no patience to let the polish layers dry. WRONG. any new layer of normal polish temporarily somewhat melts the undercoat which allows it to bond well. You see this effect if you layer colors and take too long with the brush - you&#x27;ll see the underlayer start to come through. Well this polish isn&#x27;t thin, and doesn&#x27;t cause layers to run, no no no. It causes all the layers to crackle, and not in a nice fairly uniform crackle but in a raw earthquake tear down your nail. I&#x27;m guessing as it bonds with the underlayers and matte&#x27;s them, it also somehow shrinks, but unlike crackle polish which only shrinks itself, this matte polish causes everything under it to warp - even if it&#x27;s been dry for a day. Seriously, by essie - it works and it&#x27;s not really THAT big a price difference. This is a product you&#x27;ll use once, be super disappointed it, and either toss out or pawn off on other unsuspecting prey.</li>
    <li> This nail polish was definitely matte, and it dried very quickly, but it totally messed up my base nail polish. It didn&#x27;t dry smooth, it dried very rigged and it looks stupid. Plus it didn&#x27;t stay matte very long. Very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is not a matte. It is just a mess. Don&#x27;t bother. Spend a few extra bucks and get a real matte polish.</li>
    <li> I used this as a top coat over color. It did not make the polish matte at all. It is still very shiny. Other matte top coats I have used are much better than this product. Even N.Y.C Matte me CRAZY top coat is much better and cheaper!</li>
    <li> Ruins the nail polish underneath and make ur nails scary rather than trendy... I need to find another matte top coat that doesnt do this.... any suggestions!?!?!?!</li>
    <li> Im not sure what this product is suppose to do. I purchased this thinking it was going to give me the non glossy effect. WAhich clearly it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure if I am applying it right or if it&#x27;s not for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Madly Matte is right I wasn&#x27;t expecting for it to be a crackle matte finish. I was bummed it crackled. Was looking for a full matte look.</li>
    <li> I ordered this topcoat looking to add a matte finish to my creme and jelly polishes- what I got instead was a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;The topcoat is nearly indistinguishable from any other finishing, nonmatte topcoat, lending only the faintest (and I do mean FAINT) dullness to my nail polishes. It looks instead much more like an older topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;I should have just taken the leap and ordered a topcoat from Essie or Butter London instead.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the estimated time. I love it. Stylish. Cute. &amp;Modern. All at a good price!!! Works perfectly and is a must have !</li>
    <li> This nail polish was supposed to be an overcoat to make you nails a matte color, but it really just made it look more of an opaque glossiness. It wasn&#x27;t matte at all and created a lot of bubbles. Not what I was looking for. I would recommend buying a matte colored nail polish, the overcoats rarely work. But this company was very quick and safe with delivery and I would recommend buying from them.</li>
    <li> If you use it with another brand this polish will be ruined. I like it I tried with a few brand Essie, OPI, Hollywood, Zoya. But only works with Kleancolor</li>
    <li> doesnt turn your nail polish matte at all its more of a top coat. wouldnt recommend to anyone waste of money</li>
    <li> I was initially excited that I finally found a matte nail polish for under $5. Turns out I buy cheap, i get cheap. Once I applied one thin coat of this product, it immediately starts to crack the nail polish. It looks as if its shrink wrapping the color. Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not worth it. Everyone is better off buying an actual brand and spend the extra dollars.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my nails I don&#x27;t know why but I&#x27;m going to try a more expensive nail polish and try it again maybe it doesn&#x27;t work on cheap nail polish or make it only works on a acrylic or gel Mani</li>
    <li> What a cool product!  I&#x27;m always looking for a new and interesting way to paint my nails...I think this could be my favorite new trend!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent!! Shipping was great and the product is simply amazing. I never heard of this brand and was a little skeptical but it was amazing I will be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> This finisher really disappointed me. I tested it on several polishes, the difference was hardly noticeable on most. It didn&#x27;t have the high gloss of my other top coats but was still shiny. When placed over my matte polish it seemed shinier.</li>
    <li> love the matte look. Shipping and everything was pretty good</li>
    <li> This product does not give a matte finish at all and took forever to dry.  I&#x27;m super disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other matte nsil polishes before and unfortunately they&#x27;re hard to find in my area. I purchased this one with high expectations and was sadly disappointed since it was not really matte. Maybe I need to try it with another color</li>
    <li> This matte did work in taking the shine off all my polishes but i found that compared to my regular essie matte polish the klean color made the colors dull and faded looking compared to my essie. I wanted to try this brand because it was a cheaper alternative but sometimes you get what you paid for. I would definitely say buy this if your one of those people who just paint your nails and don&#x27;t look at themagain until you take them off, but if you&#x27;re that person (like me) that look at your nails to go back and fill in chips and baby your nails then i&#x27;d recommend essie matte top coat.</li>
    <li> Before reading: I&#x27;m NOT sure that this is intended to be used over other nail polish that ISN&#x27;T Klean Kolor as well. But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this I was really excited and then VERY disappointed when I tried to use this over 2 coats of my regular, drug store nail polish. Just one coat of this made the nail color underneath crinkle and separate! To be sure I wasn&#x27;t crazy, I tried it again over top of a different nail color (different brand) with the same result. I ended up throwing this out. I have no idea why this reacted that way with my nail polish. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> This matte nail polish does dry fairly matte, but it does not cover evenly. There were still streaks of glossy polish showing where the matte polish had not stayed. It dried more like the crackle nail polish and I even tried applying it several different ways. Unless someone can tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this at all.</li>
    <li> This topcoat goes on extremely thick and never seems to dry.  Unless you are extremely careful, the brush makes lines or ridges in the polish as you apply.  Worst of all, it bubbles the after drying for about 15-20 minutes.  I tried it 3 times this weekend with 2 different brands of polish thinking I was at fault.  I thought the 2nd and 3rd were good until the bubbles started forming.  I give up--this stuff is going straight into the waste bin.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in bubble wrap, is of high quality and excellent style. I have looked 2 months for matte nail polish.  Great product</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than a topcoat. It does not have a matte effect at all. Very disappointed. But, you get what you pay for, and it doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;ve never even heard of this brand! Don&#x27;t buy, unless you want a cheap topcoat. But get matte elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I tried in every way possible to use this stuff, thick, thin, &amp; a bunch of other ways, it does some ugly crackle looking thing! don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a matte top coat for some time now and was very excited about the price of this product.  When I got it, tried it, it was anything but matte! When applied it looked like an ordinary top coat.  I even tried applying it to a matte finish color polish I own and it actually made it look shiny! I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> product came very fast, tried it out and it dried to a nice matte finish quite quickly. have to try the essie to to fully compare since I&#x27;ve heard that one is the best.</li>
    <li> Writing reviews about nail polish is the best thing you can do for humanity. I mean, ordering a temporary enamel colouring online is SOOOOOO stressful. It&#x27;s not life in real life where you get to test the product in the store to see... ... .. . Ummm... never mind....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is pretty okay. Not fast drying and the matte buffs out quite easily, which is kinda annoying when I get nervous and use my thumbnails for a worry stone that I factually cannot lose. Once that one&#x27;s all shiny my OCD kicks in and I&#x27;m forced to finger-buff (why is that making me giggle?) the rest of my nails. Also, wasn&#x27;t a deep \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; so the matte effect was mild at best to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, it&#x27;s good but not OMGTHISISSOAWESOMEICOULDDIEANDBEHAPPY good. It&#x27;s also nail polish and that would be a lot to ask of a nail polish.</li>
    <li> smudged base nail polish and didnt give that matte look. . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> the nail polish was ok. I love that matte finish, it looks great with colorful nails and was cheap. on the other hand, when it dries it looks like it splits your previous nail polish (maybe it dries it out?) and it chips really quickly. it&#x27;s a cheap way around the essie one, if you don&#x27;t mind doing your nails every 1-2 days</li>
    <li> This was a horrible product and makes the nail polish turn to crackle...I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> it cracked the undercoat of the nail polish and made grooves in it. the matte finish was also only fair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after watching a few YouTube videos and think it works perfectly fine. I&#x27;m 34 years old and don&#x27;t really care for all the nail designs the younger people wear but this gives your nails a fresh look without being too out there. It does work best if you make sure your nail color is completely dry before adding on the coat of matte polish.</li>
    <li> Love the theory of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel like this product does not leave your nails matte at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it never seems to dry for me! I usually use \\&quot;Out the Door\\&quot; top coat and it literally dries within a couple minutes. (So maybe i&#x27;m spoiled?) But it was at least a hour and i had smudged at least 3 nails and ended up taking it off. I do use a base coat and 2 coats of polish but it has never been a problem with other top coats.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this item if u&#x27;re looking for real matte! I guess when you look for cheap, cheap is what it really results to. -_- Highly upset! $5;$&amp;:.$~#&gt;?~&gt;&gt;%&lt;</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly &amp; in great condition. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t provide the matte look that I was looking for, it was more like a regular top coat</li>
    <li> I tried this top coat with all of the color polishes that I own. It does not work at all! My nails come out just as shiny as it would if I used a regular top coat. Do not waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> It doesnt give you the matte finish. it ends up looking like a top coat. I cant even get my money back</li>
    <li> Loved the matte look I got with this.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! It ruins your original color very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it. It is going to the garbage.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast n i was exited to used it n see a \\&quot;MATTE\\&quot; finish to my nails n i got somethng completly opposite... my nails looks shiny as if i apply regular top coat n i got this little like watter bubbles in my nails.. totally ehat i was not especting.. VERY dissapointed.</li>
    <li> CHEAP, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN. MADE MY NAILS LOOK LUMPY AND UGLY. 2 STARS</li>
    <li> Love!!! Works perfectly on dark colors !</li>
    <li> I was excited to find that all I had to purchase was a top coat to get the desired matte finish I was looking for but sadly disappointed when I tried this. It would not dry! Hours dragged on and I still had smudgable nails. Finally, when they did dry, I had small bubble bumps on every single nail. TERRIBLE!!</li>
    <li> The delivery was on time. The product was nicely wrapped in bubble wrap. The outside package looked in perfect condition. The matte polish did as it said it would do. The price was great and so was the product. I really liked it and I would buy more of this product and really recommend this product. A small amount goes a long way and dries really fast for those that like to be out the door in minutes.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to dry and doesn&#x27;t give that fully matte look. I don&#x27;t recommend it. It&#x27;s okay in a fix. If you like waiting forever for it to dry.</li>
    <li> This was the worst purchase, it game on time but it doesn&#x27;t even work. It just makes your nails shine &amp; if you touch it it completely messes up. Not matte at all.  Just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like too much this nail polish, the matte color doesn&#x27;t last long. the price was excellent, but didn&#x27;t complete what I expect of this item</li>
    <li> I want to try this new product and see if it really make the nail polish opaque or matte as it says.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this would work out, because I don&#x27;t want to pay $10 for essie or Orly&#x27;s matte top coat. But this did not work out. It goes on thick and has streaks/bald spots where it won&#x27;t go. I&#x27;ve tried on numerous brands, with and without top coats, etc. It simply isn&#x27;t that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may ultimately just be worth it to get the more expensive brand, honestly.</li>
    <li> Cap broke off when opening and dried u as a result.</li>
    <li> took forever to dry and it is quite thick. I didnt care for these there are other matte top coats that do the job better</li>
    <li> And doesn&#x27;t dry right, but for the price I guess that I didn&#x27;t end up losing too much. But I wish I had known that before.</li>
    <li> This nail polish leaves too many streaks</li>
</ol>
