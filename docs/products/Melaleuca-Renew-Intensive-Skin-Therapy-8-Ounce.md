      <li>(it&#x27;s a small area on my upper chest, I think I made it worse this summer by backpacking where the strap rubbed on my chest on the right side)Anyway, it works very well for me; it goes on easily, is absorbed into my skin very easily; it feels really nice on your hands, has a gentle light fragrance that is pleasant, and most important, IT WORKS!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The only lotion that actually works.  Not watered down at all.  Very think and moisturizing.  Nice smell.</li>
    <li> wonderful skin therapy will definately purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  I have very dry skin and it works great</li>
    <li> This cream is very soothing and healing. I kept the small tu best in my purse, car, bedside, and in my pocket when working.</li>
    <li> really helped my sons excema</li>
    <li> I must say I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I actually have Ezcema and I have been searching for some type of relief... I looked up this product... it was within my price range. The shipping price was even better. It was shipped the next day after ordering and it was delievered within 4-5 days of ordering.Only thing I didn&#x27;t really care for is that there was no package tracking information, but the package came so fast I didn&#x27;t really need a tracking number.</li>
    <li> My wife has a persistent skin condition along with one of our grandsons. Our daughter told us about this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream that she was using with great results. After a couple of days using this, her skin started looking great. She did stop after a couple of weeks, and I noticed the sores and scratching was back. She is on course again and has cleared  up again. She is concerned about the high cost, but this works where nothing else has - making it worth the cost. I am not prone to saying &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; about anything except God&#x27;s love but so far this fits. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My 4 yr old grand daughter has a patch of eczema that just started on her hand.  Melaleuca Renew Intensive Skin Therapy stopped the itch and has kept it from spreading and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever tried for dry hands.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to get really dry, so in the past I had to put lotion on every few hours. Now that I use this lotion, I only have to put on lotion once a day. It is major relief that my skin is no longer cracking and it feels really soft. My skin even looks smoother then it did before.  I love this lotion and think everyone should try it.</li>
    <li> My dad referred this lotion to me for a different reason then hand eczema  but after using it through the fist bottle I noticed my eczema clearing up on my hands!  This stuff really slowed your body to keep the moisture in a.  I would recommend this for any one with dry skin</li>
    <li> I work in a restaurant, so my hands kept breaking out from the cleaning chemicals. I tried numerous lotions and salves to cure them, but this was the only one I have ever found that cures my skin.</li>
    <li> Even though I did not actually recieve this product from the seller, I know the product is great. I have eczema and this lotion really helps soothe it and keeps my skin moist. I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Husband and daughter have sensitive skin, with eczema.  They cannot use products with petrolatum or fragrance.  This product is crazy expensive, but it works.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> is an excellent product, the best available in the market at the moment, I&#x27;ve used before and recommend the components they use for this cream are the best besides the well-known brand and very good</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried all sorts of skin products- from Avon and Mary Kay, Neutrogena and Oil of Olay, to Christian Dior, Estee Lauder and Lancome. Who would have guessed that one of the most effective moisturizers I have used is something like this?! I had passed on this line because I associated it with the many older people who sell it. One of my clients gave me the Renew as a \\&quot;tip\\&quot; when I completed a job for her- and yes, she was an older lady! lol I took it graciously but thought, \\&quot;Oh, great...old people cheap lotion...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I used some on my hands and was blown away. I used it on my dry elbows and saw remarkable differences. Then I took a breath and tried it on my dry face. Amazing. I have been using it for several years and my skin looks so smooth and even. I always get looks of surprise when I tell anyone how old I am- they say they cannot believe I have a 20 year old son etc. This is the best bang for your buck out there as far as I am concerned. And BTW,I am not a distributor and do not sell it. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever! Leaves skin silky smooth. I&#x27;m a marketing executive for melaleuca, the company that sells this product, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy if you join. Contact me for more info alexhajek@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from my doctor to try that was given to him from one of his patients. I have suffered with a rash for over 20 yrs on the lower part of my leg and been told by at least 5 different doctors(3 of which were dermatologists)that this was 5 different things all of which they treated differently and NOTHING worked till now.After using this on that rash for 2 weeks the rash is gone and hasn&#x27;t been back with regular use of this lotion of daily or every other day now for 3 months. I use it all over now for my extremely dry skin and it is simply AMAZING!!!! I rec&#x27;d it fast from the seller so that I never went without it. I intend to order from them again...Thanks so much for the MIRACLE product!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and have a hard time finding anything that works as great as it does.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best lotion on the market.  I have very dry skin and this lotion does the trick.  It&#x27;s great lotion for the body and hands too.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective lotion for treating eczema. Both of my boys have eczema and it improves the condition.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and nice feel.  I like using  the lotion at night before retiring. This is a good product.  Need to reorder.</li>
    <li> I used this on my daughter when she had a rash behind her knees and inside her elbows. I also gave her probiotics. Whatever the case, her rash was gone within a week or two, after being there for a year. Hooray!</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I can ever use to keep my eczema/contact dermatitis from reaching blister status bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soothes my arms and hands whenever they get super dry in the winter or whenever I touch any abrasives/acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend stock piling this lotion whenever you see it on sale online or when you know someone whom sells the product because its a difficult item to find and is well sought out.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has removed a rash and soothes my skin unlike other lotions. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works excellent for my son&#x27;s eczema.  There was a major improvement in his skin after just 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Worked very well for a 2 month old with eczema, not greasy and smells nice.  Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that I can use from head to toe. I use it under my makeup, after I shower, on my feet, you name it. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, I have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I have a rash that seems to get worse when I swim in chlorine pools, and I have tried various ointments and remedies.  This is by far the best as it tends to soothe and make my skin itch free (it&#x27;s a small area on my upper chest, I think I made it worse this summer by backpacking where the strap rubbed on my chest on the right side)Anyway, it works very well for me; it goes on easily, is absorbed into my skin very easily; it feels really nice on your hands, has a gentle light fragrance that is pleasant, and most important, IT WORKS!  It&#x27;s not a heavy, greasy type of ointment, rather a light, creamy one that seems very gentle on the skin.  A little goes a long way, so even though the stuff isn&#x27;t cheap, it will last a long time (in my opinion).  In sum,  if you are looking for product that does help the skin heal and feel better, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> About 4 years ago during the winter, I developed this bad itchy, scaly patch on one hand and it spread to most of the top part of my hand.  After visiting a clinic and getting creams or pills which didn&#x27;t help at all, my allergist gave me a small sample of Renew which cleared it up in 3-4 days.  Since then, this problem appeared every winter and I used the sample.  When it appeared again this winter and I no longer had the sample (and my allergist was no longer in practice), it took me awhile to remember the name and I was happy to find the product on Amazon.  Again it cleared it up in 4 days.  Would highly recommend this to anyone who gets this kind of skin problem.</li>
    <li> Renew Intensive Skin Therapy is no better or worse than all the other 12 lotions I tried for exzema. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say more about it. Some time ago a acquaintance of mines shared what little she had of her lotion with me. When I asked her to purchase me some she refused. So while I still held on to the old container I went to Amazon and found it and brought my own. Its great.</li>
    <li> I have never encountered a product that retained a dewy moisture all through the night. I felt like I didn&#x27;t even need to wash my face in the morning. It was never greasy. Wish there were coupons for this one.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This is one of the most exciting products I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  I had dry skin, eczema on my elbows and forehead, and bumps on my upper arms.  After using for a couple of days my skin was better!  I use it a couple of times a week now.  It is very overpriced on Amazon, though.  It is discounted through the manufacturer and even more discounted if you become a preferred customer. If you would like more information about my experiences, especially with the eczema, please feel free to contact me at 352Sherry@gmail.com.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the quality.  I will definitely be ordering more in the near future.  I cannot say enough about this fabulous product.  I had a skin condition on my chin and on my left eyelid.  After only ONE application the condition improved 85% and within one week was completely gone.  (I had been using a RX prescribed by my doctor for 2 months which did nothing to improve this skin condition!)  I was blown away with Renew Intensive Skin Therapy and I recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> The only thing I can find that last longer than a couple hours on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have really bad eczema, especially in the winter and summer.  I deal with a lot of paperwork, which really dries my skin and leaves my skin irritated.  This lotion keeps my skin super soft and smooth.  It also helps relieve the itchiness and controls my eczema from coming back with full force.  It also has a light and nice scent.</li>
    <li> It has helped chronic skin condition.</li>
    <li> This does work on dry skin keeping it moist from shower to shower.  I live in a very dry hot climate most of the year and need something that really works.</li>
    <li> We buy this lotion all the time.  It is great for my daughter eczema n keeps her skin so soft</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this has really helped my face putting this on before my foundation and before going to bed. My skin looks and feels so much better! Love it!</li>
    <li> No! This is ridiculously overpriced. Shop directly through melaleuca and this exact same bottle is less than half this price. This also against melaleuca company policy to be sold by anyone except melaleuca directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this lotion is amazing and has helped with my children&#x27;s and husband&#x27;a eczema better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried before. No harsh smell or sticky residue. I highly recommend this product, just not at this insane price. Be careful when buying products not directly through the company, you never know if it&#x27;s the real thing and most likely is overpriced.</li>
    <li> wonderfull skin repair product; wouldn&#x27;t use anything else; will purchase morewhen this order is gone; will be a repeat customer</li>
    <li> love this product. my daughter has sever eczema and it calmed her itching down a lot. she love they way it makes her skin feel.</li>
    <li> I got it in good time, although not super fast.  The product has a scent, which can be a little unpleasant for those who are sensitive (I am).  I had a bad case of eczema behind my knees, and nothing worked, but after a few times of using Renew, they went away.  So I&amp;#34;m pretty happy with it.  The only thing is that the cream is thick that I have a hard time getting it out of the bottle.  My hands suffer from arthritis, and I can&#x27;t squeeze well.  So basically, I had to take off the cap and dig it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;m concerned about is the ingredients.  The company doesn&#x27;t disclose the ingredients, and I&#x27;m a bit worried, because I don&#x27;t want any chemicals go into my body.  If you call them, I guess they&#x27;ll tell you, but isn&#x27;t that required by law to list all the ingredients on the bottle so that the consumers would know what they&#x27;re buying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for now, my eczema&#x27;s gone, so I shan&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream, have experienced much improvement with the skin on my arms and legs.  I shall be ordering&lt;br /&gt;more in the very near future.  I&#x27;d certainly recommend this for anybody that has dry skin.</li>
    <li> The only thing that seems to work for my 3 year old with eczema.</li>
    <li> Unless you are a Melaleuca customer purchasing this product directly from their official website, the selling or re-selling of these products is against the manufacturer&#x27;s sales policy.</li>

    <li> This is some good stuff..... My skin is so dry and I put on Renew  on my whole body..</li>
    <li> Excellent -  Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> I am not sure that this works any better than Curel or other lotions that I have tried for my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good product, recommend</li>
    <li> The product is very soothing and the fragrance is pleasant. I would recommend it the dry skin. Good for gift-giving.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.It makes your skin feel so soft.The tea tree oil is amazing .Wish the products were sold in stores</li>
    <li> I really love this product and was very happy w/the price offered. The product came quickly and was packaged well. I have searched high and low and this lotion is one of the best!</li>
    <li> I had a dry patch (exzema) on my scalp and elbow and it cleared it up within a week. I was looking for something more natural then prescription drugs. This had melaleuca in it and I wanted to see if this would work and it did. Glad I tried it out!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my infant whose fighting baby eczema on the recommendation of my pediatric nurse sister-in-law. Works very well. Takes about 3 days of use to work but doesn&#x27;t keep away. As far as I can tell it does take some of the itch and irritation out. Very expensive compared to other eczema treatments. It does leave a clean-ish scent and residue.</li>
    <li> This made my 6 month old son&#x27;s eczema worse (he&#x27;s now almost a year old). I tried it for 1 month with no improvement. It would just sting and make the eczema ooze leaving a crusty surface. Although I didn&#x27;t like the scent, it did keep my son&#x27;s skin moisturized. I already fixed his problem through an allergist.</li>
    <li> *** ///  Get it cheaper around $16 with taxes and Delivery.  No Monthly Commiment. ask me how ereyes32@yahoo.com  I have a lot of people contacting me and benefiting ///***</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t live without this lotion.  It&#x27;s the best you&#x27;ll find anywhere if you have any type of skin ailment.  Gentle enough for all over - including your face.</li>
    <li> It is the best hand lotion on the market.  It repairs even the worst dry skin problems within two days.</li>
    <li> This skin therapy lotion works very good makes my skin very soft. Would recommend this for someone with dry skin for sure.</li>
    <li> Please do not pay this price. This is a great product but costs A LOT less if you shop directly from melaleuca as a preferred customer. If you want a membership please contact me alwayscleaning at hotmail</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to Renew about 25 years ago because my hands are so dry and at the first cold breeze of fall my thumb tips split open.  I hate hand cream because it is either greasy or it doesn&#x27;t work.  This is not greasy and it DOES work!  It is the best skin therapy I have ever used.  I even use it on my face.  I love it.  I have bottles every where, at work, in my bathroom, bedroom, livingroom, anywhere I might want some.  It is absolutely the best and it does NOT vanish within a few minutes of putting it on.  Again I will say IT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
    <li> This product is not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. The healing affect lasts too, for several hours if not days. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema as a result of an auto-immune disease. This lotion is wonderful. I put it on at night before bed and my dry, cracked, sometimes bleeding skin shows marked improvement in the morning. Also has a lovely, soft scent.</li>
    <li> This really helped my itchy skin!  I don&#x27;t have eczema, but tried many other lotions and could not get the itching to stop.  This product helped so much.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see this product on Amazon.  It is by far the best hand cream/skin cream I have every found.  Usually you have to be a member of Melalueca to purchase it.  Thank you for making it available outside of the membership.</li>
    <li> The product is nice - perhaps a bit better that what is available at the local durg store.  That is not to say it is a miricle cure but &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;.  So, if average is 2 1/2 stars, I give this a three.  The fourth star is for the company who supplied this to me.  Fast service at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My husband first brought this home from work.  His female coworkers recommended it for any type of skin irritation. I have found it helpful with dry winter skin.  It is not a thick cream.  I think of it as gentle and light. It is also fragrance free.  Healing powers?  At our house we think so.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and no other lotion heals and prevents it like this one. We&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil, Vaseline intensive lotions and nothing works like this. Use after a bath or twice a day to eliminate dry, bumpy skin in less than a week. Keep using it in the winter to prevent the bumps and dry skin from coming back. Smells nice and absorbs easily.</li>
    <li> It cleared off my kids eczema in about 2 weeks.  Its about half the price if you are a member so if you want it at a cheaper price by being a member, please contact me at tuje77@aol.com.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has eczema -- her eczema is gone and so is her sister&#x27;s !!!</li>
    <li> I live in SC i am a Melaleuca Director id be happy to share the info with anyone just contact me at wesleytyler @gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Melaleuca does NOT require a person to order products every month. There is a benefit for doing so, but it is NOT required. .&lt;br /&gt;Melaleuca is a membership company that provide fabulous products for a small membership fee like cost-co or sams but without the requirement of buying in bulk</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product and many people said it was like a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; for eczema.  My toddler son has horrible eczema, and so we decided to give it a try.  For about 10 days we only moisturized with this lotion and we saw no improvement.  In fact, I was very surprised that it contains fragrance since everything I&#x27;ve been told about eczema is to avoid products with fragrance in them.  I was also a little shocked at how thin the lotion is since most topical products claiming to treat eczema are thick and greasy.  Overall, this was a waste of money for us.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Being a cancer patient that required lots of radiation my burns were really uncomfortable, but the RENEW was a life saver.  It was the only cream I found that really worked and worked fast and fantastic.  I think I said that twice, not enough. FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I have eczema and nothing works on my skin. A friend recommend this cream and it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> The one and only kind of lotion I use now. Very light scent. And even in humid HUMID weather, when applied lightly it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy which is lovely. And my skin feels so good! I&#x27;ve tried this and that kind of lotion over the years but not any more!</li>
    <li> good stuff, but way too expensive!</li>
    <li> Best lotion anywhere. I am a courier for a major freight company. My work involves handling a lot of boxes and envelopes and exposure to cold, wind, etc. During the winter months I experience extremely dry hands and cracks in my skin. This lotion repairs that in a matter of a few days. I should learn to use it prior to the problem!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else works quite like this. A dentist on my route noticed my hands and gave me a bottle a couple of years ago. I only wish I had.known about it sooner.</li>
