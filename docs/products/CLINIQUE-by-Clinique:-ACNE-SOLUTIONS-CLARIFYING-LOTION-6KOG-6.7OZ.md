### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>very good!</li>
      <li>Very good for my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>She is happy...</li>
      <li>but my wife says it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I bought it from Sephora ($15 great price).</li>
      <li>Anyhow, i&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>I have seen really great results though</li>
      <li>Perfect, love this item.</li>
      <li>and it cost more money!</li>
      <li>I kind of wish Clinique would make a pump for this bottle</li>
      <li>but I was satisfied with the product and the package.</li>
      <li>I will keep buying this toner until i find a better one.</li>
      <li>I have used many toners</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>This product, like all others I use in the Clinique line is the best in controlling oily skin and maintaining clear free skin.</li>
      <li>It was better than nothing--</li>
      <li>but I still wasn&#x27;t really satisfied...</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with all of the products.</li>
      <li>I love this set.</li>
      <li>clarifying solution&#x27; would be more descriptive--</li>
      <li>strong acohol smell, which said to inhibit acne lead to more acne on my skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit strong and it does burn when you put it on.</li>
      <li>Clinique is hands down the best skin care line......</li>
      <li>but with this toner, i can use a more mild cleanser.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m happy with it and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
      <li>I can tell I spent lots of money on creams, treatments, proactiv, all those brands, but aveeno so far is the best and this toner is a great solution when you need extra care!</li>
      <li>I have acne prone and very dry skin, so I use it with aveeno clear complexion cream, so for the best i&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
      <li>After using it my skin feels so clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This does help with mild acne, but there is a cost.</li>
      <li>So worth it.</li>
      <li>This is the only product I use from the Clinique Acne Solutions line, and even though it has salicylic acid in it I am able to use it every day.</li>
      <li>works great on my skin since it is oily but do not use it regularly for it does dry up the skin.</li>
      <li>This place is selling Macy&#x27;s returns as new merchandise!!??  </li>
      <li>if you do a little recon you CAN have zit free skin, and reasonably cheap (one bottle of this stuff lasts me 6 months on average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Studies have also shown that salicylic acid does not do much if it is found in a wash, a toner or anything else that does not stay on the skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It really works fro my skin.</li>
      <li>The toners came packaged very well and sealed with tape in case the lid get unscrewed during shipping.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about it...</li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean when used in with the other 2 steps in the set!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Where was this stuff when I was in high school?</li>
      <li>I think it will attribute to the high concentration acohol inside.</li>
      <li>This is the only toner I had used that is strong enough to control my acne while i use or tried out others brand&#x27;s moisturizers and Cleanser.  </li>
      <li>with keeping my adult skin under control!</li>
      <li>By the way I do love amazon for kids stuff, toys are usually a steal, electronics...</li>
      <li>These beauty supply companies on amazon are a complete scam, I placed an order with [...] and then emailed to ask them why are they selling clinique lotions at an almost 50% markup, their response was that I do not have to choose to order from them and that a lot of their products are marked up!  </li>
      <li>if you know Macy&#x27;s (and if you&#x27;re an American woman then really, you must get to know her</li>
      <li>Out of everything though this is probably my least favorite.</li>
      <li>Sometimes when I&#x27;m in a rush I&#x27;ll even skip a step and so far that&#x27;s not a</li>
      <li>They have a fabulous website to order their products at half the price, usually with free shipping.</li>
      <li>Having too much salicylic acid on my skin will make it very dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only product that works for my acne. It took 4 days to get to me but I was satisfied with the product and the package.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use from the Clinique Acne Solutions line, and even though it has salicylic acid in it I am able to use it every day. They say toners are not for everyone, but I have oily skin and have to use something. Studies have also shown that salicylic acid does not do much if it is found in a wash, a toner or anything else that does not stay on the skin. It definitely does exfoliate skin. Whenever my skin breaks out, I use this and I am usually cleared up with in a week.     This does help with mild acne, but there is a cost. My skin becomes red and a little irritated after using it, slightly sticky, and sensitive. I have oily skin so it does not cause my skin to over-dry. I am able to mix this a retinoid, but I am one of the few that can do it with out over irritating my skin.     I would suggest this product to some with out severe acne and has oily skin. For me it works, but for others it won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I buy this elsewhere and it cost more money! It is a bit drying on the skin so use a facial lotion with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tough: I want to give the product itself 5 stars-- like, holy FSM-- throw that proactiv crap away and start using this instead! This &#x27;lotion&#x27; (its not really a lotion, I think &#x27;clarifying solution&#x27; would be more descriptive-- its thin, clear, you blot it on) is actually part of Clinique&#x27;s 3 step anti-acne kit-- basically they&#x27;re answer to proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the proactiv generation-- that shit basically got me through college-- but, if you used it you probably know, it sucks because you HAVE TO USE IT RELIGIOUSLY for it to work-- I mean, if I didn&#x27;t apply all three steps exactly as directed every morning and evening-- then I&#x27;d start to break out. Sometimes  I&#x27;d break out anyway. It was better than nothing-- but I still wasn&#x27;t really satisfied...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you: since I switched to the clinique stuff (about 2 years now)-- I get 1--ONE-- 1 zit once a month during my period-- and sometimes I don&#x27;t even get that-- and using this stuff once a day is plenty enough. Sometimes when I&#x27;m in a rush I&#x27;ll even skip a step and so far that&#x27;s not a problem-- unless I screw it up a couple days in a row-- but that&#x27;s user error, not clinique&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the point is: but it at Macy&#x27;s. A) the regular price is cheaper-- if you don&#x27;t believe me check their website, its there-- and B) if you know Macy&#x27;s (and if you&#x27;re an American woman then really, you must get to know her if you don&#x27;t already)-- that place has coupons and sales constantly-- if you do a little recon you CAN have zit free skin, and reasonably cheap (one bottle of this stuff lasts me 6 months on average).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where was this stuff when I was in high school? Could&#x27;ve saved me load of money in therapy co-pays.</li>
    <li> very good! It really works fro my skin. I love this set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and literally had it for a day and can already see a change in my skin. So worth it.</li>
    <li> Clinique is hands down the best skin care line......They have a fabulous website to order their products at half the price, usually with free shipping. These beauty supply companies on amazon are a complete scam, I placed an order with [...] and then emailed to ask them why are they selling clinique lotions at an almost 50% markup, their response was that I do not have to choose to order from them and that a lot of their products are marked up!  Skin care and make up is expensive enough! Do not let this place scam you!  By the way I do love amazon for kids stuff, toys are usually a steal, electronics...but this was very disturbing.</li>
    <li> I bought the three step acne kit to help treat some out of control zits. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with all of the products. Out of everything though this is probably my least favorite. The smell is a bit strong and it does burn when you put it on. I have seen really great results though so I&#x27;m happy with it and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> This product, like all others I use in the Clinique line is the best in controlling oily skin and maintaining clear free skin. I have used Clinique for years, tried others, and always come back to their products.</li>
    <li> This arrived without a box, unsealed with a sticker on the side that reads &amp;#34;Macy&#x27;s return label&amp;#34; and a barcode. This place is selling Macy&#x27;s returns as new merchandise!!??  Disgusting!! Needless to say I will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Perfect, love this item.</li>
    <li> I have used many toners but i couldn&#x27;t find anything similar to clinique&#x27;s Acne Solutions Toner. This is the only toner I had used that is strong enough to control my acne while i use or tried out others brand&#x27;s moisturizers and Cleanser.  Usually i will used a cleanser that has salicylic acid in it to help prevent my acne but with this toner, i can use a more mild cleanser. Having too much salicylic acid on my skin will make it very dry and then when i add a moisturizer my skin will turned oily in a few hours.   I used up about 4 bottles of this toner already and I had to buy this toner from here because of the deal. The toners came packaged very well and sealed with tape in case the lid get unscrewed during shipping. I will keep buying this toner until i find a better one. I kind of wish Clinique would make a pump for this bottle but this will work for now. Anyhow, i&#x27;m happy with this purchase. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered the toner by mistake when I meant to order the gel spot remover and was advised they cannot &amp;#34;except&amp;#34; returns .. misusing the word except .. unbelievable!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 years and will continue to use it as long as it works for me. Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean when used in with the other 2 steps in the set!</li>
    <li> strong acohol smell, which said to inhibit acne lead to more acne on my skin. I think it will attribute to the high concentration acohol inside.</li>
    <li> Have used it for long. Very good for my skin.</li>
    <li> CLINIQUE by Clinique: ACNE SOLUTIONS CLARIFYING LOTION 6KOG--/6.7OZ&lt;br /&gt;helps with keeping my adult skin under control! doesn&#x27;t dry the skin</li>
    <li> I ordered the number 3 lotion and got the number 4. So harsh on my skin I had to throw it away</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it... but my wife says it&#x27;s great. She is happy...so therefore, five stars! I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I bought it from Sephora ($15 great price). After using it my skin feels so clean and fresh. I have acne prone and very dry skin, so I use it with aveeno clear complexion cream, so for the best i&#x27;ve ever tried! I can tell I spent lots of money on creams, treatments, proactiv, all those brands, but aveeno so far is the best and this toner is a great solution when you need extra care! Five star!</li>
    <li> \I use this at least twice a week. works great on my skin since it is oily but do not use it regularly for it does dry up the skin.</li>
    <li> my skin loves this and the price was unbeliveable. I have been using this for a long time and I love it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. It left my face uneasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and the Clinique brand seems to be the only actually works for me.  Love it...although I&#x27;ve only tried it with all 3 products together (cleansing foam, clarifying lotion, and clearing treatment).  Haven&#x27;t ever tried using just one, so it might be the combo of all 3 that actually does the trick for me.  Regardless, I&#x27;m not changing things up to figure it out, because it actually is working.</li>
