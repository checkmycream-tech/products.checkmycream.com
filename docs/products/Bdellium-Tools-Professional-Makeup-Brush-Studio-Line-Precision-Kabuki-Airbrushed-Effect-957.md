<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Such an amazing brush! It&#x27;s replaced my all time love, the beauty blender. It makes my foundation look flawless. If you have trouble with streaking, just lightly go over it with a beauty blender but I rarely have to do that!</li>
    <li> I never knew how much difference a good brush can make.  It is a truly flawless application for both liquid and mineral powder foundation.  The quality of the brush is outstanding. The ferule is impressive and much better than any other brush I have seen. It should never come loose. The handle is solid and smooth.  The bristles are soft on the skin and do a fantastic job.  Too bad they just raised the price on it. Take the price back down and I will buy some more for back up.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I LOVE this brush!! Prior to purchasing this I was using my fingers to apply my foundation (and have been doing this for a decade), but after reading articles that suggested using foundation brushes I began my search. The first thing that appealed to me about this brush was the antibacterial bristles: SO SO important in a product like this! Second was the wording \\&quot;Airbrused Effect\\&quot;....I thought, \\&quot;Hell yeah, I want to look airbrushed!!\\&quot;. And I do! My foundation looks unbelievable when used with this brush. After using it for the first time my husband commented on how smooth my skin looked (and this is a man who doesn&#x27;t notice if I chop half my hair off...)! I cannot believe I have been living without this product! I would consider it a must buy, even for minimal make-up wear-ers like myself.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this brush as soon as I opened the package! It is super soft and pretty dense. I love using it for liquid foundation. I&#x27;ve had it for two months and It has only shed one little hair. It is a high quality inexpensive brush compared to other brands. I also like that it has a big yellow handle. I really love this brush and I would definitely purchase more brushes from bdellium tools.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  These brushes are really nice.  They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  The price is very affordable.  I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush feels soft on my skin and leaves my liquid foundation looking even on my face.</li>
    <li> I have a few synthetic, flat top kabuki style brushes. I debated quite a bit before buying this because I had just gotten the E.L.F. Studio powder brush and this seemed similar. Since I never reach for that I thought it would be a waste to get this. Well, I broke down and decided to get it anyway. I really love the brush. I think it may be a little softer than the E.L.F. brush, if that&#x27;s even possible. I have used the 957 to apply pressed powder as well as liquid foundation. I think it works well for both. It blends well and feels amazing on the skin. If you like flat top kabukis I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for liquid makeup application/ blending. I used to use a sponge, but it just seemed to take my foundation off rather than blending it. This brush did more than I expected. It is soft, yet firm enough to handle the application of foundation. After I washed it, non of the bristles fell out and when it dried, it was good as new. I highly recommend this line of brushes!</li>
    <li> Yes, this brush is super soft.  Not a good thing though.  It is so soft that when I try to blend the bristles just slant. I use twice as much product, coverage is poor, but I look like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of make up.  Not at all an &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; finish.  I would recommend this brush to someone who uses mineral foundation for sure, but not liquid.  Also, bristles are much longer than the picture suggests and not as dense as other brushes.  Very long brush, too, barely fits in my current make up bag.  I find this difficult to clean as well for some reason and I use the Sigma spa glove on my brushes.  I own other brushes by this company and they look great but all are VERY soft.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it about a week but this brush works well for my foundation. I use the makeup that lasts all day so it gums up my brushes pretty quick and this is no exception. I think I&#x27;ll just have to wash it very frequently. It covers well and feels good on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/7/14, update to original review: I have washed this multiple times (dish soap &amp; vinegar w/warm water works great) and it&#x27;s holding up beautifully. This is my favorite brush so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a love affair with a makeup brush before I got this,  I tell everyone about it.  I have had it for almost a year and it doesn&#x27;t lose hairs or get stiff on me.  I love love love this brush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> As I mentioned with the eyeliner brush, this is a new brand to me. Love the bright colored handles, construction of the brush seems really well made and the bristles are supremely soft with just enough density and give for blending. I think I will like it most with powder foundations but I will try it with liquid as well.  Look forward in purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for applying foundation everything goes on smooth and perfect. It works much better than my sigma flat top  Kabuki!</li>
    <li> better than any Kabuki I have ever used! It applies liquid foundation to a flawless airbrushed perfection and my bare minerals with the same ease and smoothness. However, if you are looking for a light coverage, this is not the brush for you, This is for a medium to full coverage foundation.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality foundation brush!  I use it with my liquid foundation, and it really does give me that &#x27;airbrushed&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! it is actually gives a good finish,.....just started using brushes instead of the facial pads and i must say i am glad for the change!! I aint never using sponges again...lol!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite foundation brush for myself! I use other kinds in my MUA kit, but this is my favorite for my skin type. I&#x27;ve got only skin and sometimes it&#x27;s alot of work to blends it out smooth for me. My personal favorite!</li>
    <li> This brush is great I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much but I figured u get what u pay for brush makes my makeup look flawless instead of caked on. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I saw reviews on you tube and it convinced me to buy.  I&#x27;d say if u want a flawless look get this brush it&#x27;s well worth the price and lighting fast shipping like 2 days good seller</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Super soft, washes up well, good solid construction.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is very high quality and affordable. It is super dense and soft. The shipping was fast on this too. Great for liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> After much research and experimenting with different brushes I stumbled onto a link to the Bdellium line.  What a wonderful product!  The #957 is perfect to apply my liquid foundation.  I stipple it on and the bristles are so soft it&#x27;s like a mini massage for my face.  You only need a little bit of product using this brush and my foundation looks flawless!  I purchased other brushes from the line after this one and will review soon.    I washed this brush and so far have experienced no shedding at all.  The brush retained its shapes and softness.      I will be buying a duplicate set of these brushes.  They are such a great deal.  I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t spend the major money for the MAC brushes that are not as soft!</li>
    <li> perfect fit for a surface pro with cover, suggest incorporating elastic bands on the side pocket to fit large accessories.</li>
    <li> I am a novice make-up applier, but I have really liked this brush. I use it for loose mineral make-up and some cream based things sometimes.</li>
    <li> I love how dense the brush part is. It lets you put the right amount of powder on your skin. Makes your skin so flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash it at least once per two weeks, because the powder will be applied unevenly and also because of the hygiene.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s my first time to use this kind of brush, It&#x27;s perfect for liquid foundation, powder, good quality I can say. hope you can try it too :)</li>
    <li> This brush was really great in the first few months that I had it, and did a wonderful job buffing my foundation on smoothly and evenly. This was important to me, as I use a thicker foundation and need a brush that will help me blend it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months after I began using it (and after washing it out a few times, just as I do my other brushes), this brush began shedding heavily. I was having to use tweezers to pick the bristles off my face after buffing my foundation on. The shedding continued, and seemed to get heavier and heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently, as I was washing this brush, the entire thing fell apart. The whole head (I&#x27;m not sure what else to call it) of bristles came out of the metal holder at the top of the brush; the bristles were holding together, just in a clump my hand instead of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, it&#x27;s useless to me now. However, while it lasted, it was a good foundation brush. If you&#x27;re just looking for a reasonably priced foundation brush, and are willing to replace it every year or so, this is not a bad brush to try.</li>
    <li> This Kabuki is so soft and flawlessly puts on my bare minerals makeup every time . I will no longer use the kabuki that bare minerals has. You will fall in love with this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this Brush. This is my second purchase and I just recently bought the black one. Very well-made, very dense and really serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to confess that I own a ridiculous number of makeup brushes, especially for someone who isn&#x27;t a pro MUA. They span the range from lower priced (Real Techniques, Eco Tools) to mid-range (Mac) to high end (Louise Young, Shu Uemura).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently left a very expensive brush in a hotel room so, lesson learned, purchased this to bring with me when I travel. I&#x27;ve also been using it at home occasionally and am pleasantly surprised with the results! I&#x27;ve used it to apply both liquid and cream foundations and achieved a well-blended finish with ease. I am a big fan of the &amp;#34;buff it in&amp;#34; technique and the soft (but not too soft), densely packed bristles do a great job with the products I use, no matter if I&#x27;m going for a very light coverage, natural day look or a full coverage application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of quality, the 957 has a nice weight and balance to it and feels like a quality tool. I&#x27;ve washed the brush only 4 times so far so I can&#x27;t quite speak to longevity though if I get a year out of it, I&#x27;ll consider it worth the purchase price. Honestly, at this price point, it&#x27;s about the best brush I&#x27;ve tried. While I do find my Louise Young allows a faster application (i.e. less buffing to achieve my desired finish) and allows me to use a bit less product, the Bdellium is a *fraction* of the price and delivers nearly the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; is that the brush arrived with a few hairs out of place, that were much longer than the others and sticking out. I trimmed those with a small manicure scissor and gave a good tug to the bristles afterward with no shedding at all. It&#x27;s been smooth sailing since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I withheld one star since I don&#x27;t know how this brush will hold up over time. If anything overwhelmingly bad happens, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review to warn all of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I ordered my brush through Senyx (fulfilled by Amazon) and had no issues with packaging, delivery and such. Great service all around!Great service all around!</li>
    <li> This brush has become my new favorite! I purchased it to compare to my Sigma F80 and I have to say this Bdellium brush won hands down! I plan on purchasing more for my business!</li>
    <li> Honestly, the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned... albeit, it&#x27;s the only legit makeup brush I own besides a bunch of blush brushes, but it really is great! The bristles don&#x27;t fall out, its easy to clean, and its soft, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to use it on your face!</li>
    <li> I formerly had brushes from Bare Minerals and boy did they get rough.  Now I use PUR minerals - lots better, less mess and this brush is PERFECT for applying!!!</li>
    <li> Brush is ok not too soft. For the price would expect better.</li>
    <li> Love this brush for my Lancome liquid makeup. It REALLY does make your face look airbrushed and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of makeup. I will stick to this forever.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush, has all the features as advertised. Comparing to many others its also pretty affordable. I recommend it to all the ladies</li>
    <li> This was not as dense as I would have liked for my purpose but may be a good brush overall for someone else for some other purpose.  I use mosly liquid foundation and this didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.  I ordered Sigma F82 to replace this one.</li>
    <li> i love this brush. it feels so good applying blush on cheeks.  I tried it on myself before anyone else ,  it feels so soft and applies so good. im glad i got it</li>
    <li> Ok.  The brush is great! Soft and seems durable. However, the bristles are longer than I anticipated. Also, it picks up my liquid foundation, but does not distribute it as well as I would like. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, though. The seller is amazing. I received this item in a day. Kudos!!!</li>
    <li> Is the best brush ever, is soft and durable the hairs never fall off. I used with liquid foundation and it works magic.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is very soft and very nicely packed but also not stiff. I use this to buff out my foundation and it gives me a really nice finish. I love the color and quality of the handle and bristles. The price is very great and I love this brush so much. Must have!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Makeup looks flawless and smooth. No more sponges for me. My expectations were met. Hoping it will last long?</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about how great the quality of this brush would be at a price point of about $14. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised! The bristles feel high quality, and I honestly have not seen a single bristle shed since I&#x27;ve purchased this over a month ago. I used to work for 2 different top cosmetic companies, and the brushes that they gave me weren&#x27;t as good as this Bdellium brush! I use it everyday, and I wash it with Bare Minerals brush shampoo after each use. It still looks and feels brand new. I apply my liquid foundation to my face with this brush in circular motions, and it creates a smooth airbrushed finish. If you use the flat foundation brush (I did for years) I would suggest switching to this brush. Competing companies sell brushes similar to this one for over double the price, and honestly this one is just as good if not better! I am ordering more Bdellium brushes to add to my collection now. SUPER HAPPY!</li>
    <li> This brush works great with powder, pressed, or liquid foundation. I personally use it for liquid and its awesome. Very soft, no shedding, and sturdy. It applies my makeup in a perfect even layer. I recommend this brush for anyone who is looking for a nice flat top brush. Definitely works just like the more expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this for foundation distribution! I just dab foundation on the back of my hand. Then I dip the brush in it and dot a couple on my forehead. Then cheeks (one dot on each). A dab on my nose and chin. Then go back over the entire face with the brush (don&#x27;t add more foundation). Keep making a circular motion over your dots. It blends beautifully! I finish off with Loreal Transluscent Powder! Gorgeous!</li>
    <li> absolutely fabulous and well worth the money.  A lot of brush for a little money.  100% satisfied.  Gonna buy some more brushes from this line.  Go ahead and buy this.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft, and works great.  Great price too.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get something like this in Sephora because it would have been 20x more expensive for same function.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush at a great price!! Works just like it says. I will be ordering more brushes from like this.</li>
    <li> The best quality brushes I&#x27;ve used. They never shed and I just love the flawless look I get with this brush.</li>
    <li> LOOK NO MORE FOR OTHER BRUSHES THESE ARE IT YOU WILL SEE AN NEW YOU THESE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for.  All of the brushes I have used before felt like they were making microscopic scratches on my face.  I use mineral makeup and this brush is PERFECT!  It&#x27;s so soft and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush! It holds makeup well, and gives that airbrushed look. You have to wash it often, though. If you go more than a week without cleaning the brush, it makes your makeup look all gunky and thick. Also, when you wash it, either let it air dry or use a hair dryer on low/cool. If you use warm air, the bristles melt....</li>
    <li> I use this brush everyday. My favorite</li>
    <li> this brush makes applying powder foundation so easy and quick. it gives me a smooth/ flawless finish. the brush feels so soft on my skin and the flatness of the brush is what makes it so easy and quick to apply makeup. my new favorite makeup brush</li>
    <li> this brush are complete..i can ues it for the Liquid fountation ,blusr,lose and compact powder also any bronze or higligter .. i stearted to ues it until now for my lose powder it give rally the coverge whan i uesd it .. i love the brush hair it soft i recomend for any one to buy it</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 more as Xmas presents for my sisters! Super soft and doesn&#x27;t absorb all the makeup like others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This brush is truly incredible!  The coverage it delivers with both powder and liquid foundations is truly airbrushed.  If you have dry skin, moisturize well because using this brush in a stippling motion to apply products can micro-exfoliate and lift up dry skin so it becomes visible.  This brush is incredibly soft, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t get dirty easily.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> i used it for my liquid foundation. worked well but not as smooth as the first couple of times i used it even though i washed it really good.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush, its smooth and it buffs everything together and it is a great, affordable alternative for expensive brushes.</li>
    <li> I recently read a tutorial on Pinterest about how to achieve flawless, airbrush-looking foundation. It required getting a Kabuki foundation brush. Typically, I use MAC brushes, but I was hesitant to drop $40+ on a brush that I wasn&#x27;t sure would give me the desired effect I wanted. Based off of other reviews on Amazon, I decided to try the  Bdellium Tools Professional Kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the brush in the mail a few days early (so that was the first plus) and put the product to the test the very next day. I was very pleased with the results; my foundation and my skin looked flawless. Some reviews said this is a very heavy way to put on makeup and that if you are looking for light makeup this brush is not for you, however, I could not disagree more. I did not use anymore foundation than usual, and if fact, my makeup looked less heavy using the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past week several people have commented on how nice my makeup looks, and others have commented on how great my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brush 100 percent.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect. It spreads everything evenly and it makes my foundation look natural. It doesn&#x27;t go on with streaks, it just goes on smooth and natural looking. its also good with blending the concealer as well.</li>
    <li> i read all the good reviews and i was just thinking to myself i must try this. I purchased this like a couple of weeks ago and i just love it. It is full pact and has the most softest bristles. I had fall out the first time and then i ashed it and never again have i had a fall out....I&#x27;ve never used brushes to apply foundatuon but i just love the way it evenly spreads my foundation.....THIS IS A MUST HAVE :) VERY HAPPY</li>
    <li> Excellent brush.  Applies foundation perfectly.  No shedding and easy to clean.  One will need to use a smaller size for under eye and under the nose.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally a brush that I can apply my foundation with that does not aggravate my sensitive/dry skin. Now I can give my Beauty Blender a rest</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my foundation and it comes out flawless. This brush is really soft; no scratching up your skin like other pricey brushes. Also, NO SHEDDING either, like some of the pricey brushes. I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and price. This brand has made me rethink, just because a product is not super expensive, means its crappy. These are far from that term!</li>
    <li> Great for stippling foundation. It does provide heavy coverage. And now that my skincare routine has made my face acne-free. I don&#x27;t really need as heavy coverage as with this brush. I now prefer the stippling brush from real Techniques core collection.</li>
    <li> I watched several foundation´s tuttorials on youtube using this kind of brush. I was use to a precision foundation brush as I was tought to, but I saw how easy this kabuki made the foundation application and I decided to try it. I´m so happy I did because the texture it gives to your skin is gorgeous. You must try it</li>
    <li> I have used this brush for every thing, from applying liquid foundation and powders to blush and bronzer and each application is flawless and looks better than any makeup brush I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I kept thinking it was the makeup I was using that left it looking cakey but after I used a different brush with the same makeup I realized the brush was the issue.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s only one word to describe this brush and that is of course, AMAZING!!!! I truly love it and it&#x27;s quality can be compare with a Mac Brush. I love the precision and how smooth your foundation looks after applying it with this brush. I truly recommend this brush to anyone who wants a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; brush but does not want to spend a fortune!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I bought more just because I&#x27;m afraid they will discontinue it. It&#x27;s as good as my mac brushes... Perfect for applying foundation, perfect softness and density. Picks up makeup great, you can use this to blend or to stipple your foundation I do a mixture. I use mousse foundation and light powder on top and I get compliments on my foundation all the time and I have acne!!! I just tell people its all about the tools and the way you use them, and this is the best tool. very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Good cover to put your Surface in. Its not the best product..like a leather case..but good enough. I would buy again.......</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I received this brush in time! I use it to apply my liquid foundation and it does an excellent job. This is THE brush to use for foundation application.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think twice and click &#x27;add to cart&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes yesterday!! Super fast shipping btw!!! As soon as I opened the package I could tell they were of good quality!!! I used them this morning!!! They are super soft and work perfectly to blend my liquid foundation! I used the flat top Kabuki for my foundation and then the duo fibre brush for my finishing powder!!! Buy these...they are a must have. I will never buy another MAC brush as long as I live.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush to apply liquid foundation. It works well. It is very soft and nicely dense. It has not shed at all, even when I washed it before using it for the first time. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I was planning to buy the sigma flat top instead, I decided not to after I saw that people were leaving reviews to get a free gift from sigma? . . Anyway I just decided not to. When I first saw this brush I fell in love with this bright yellow! I usually use my makeup for ever stippling brush, which works great.&lt;br /&gt;Today I tried applying my liquid foundation with the bdellium tools brush and I love it as well, the foundation looked very smooth, and the brush was very very soft. The handle is just the perfect size!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you will regret purchasing it :)</li>
    <li> best foundation brush i have ever owned. i dont even need concealer when i use it! great value, awesome brush. will be buying more from this line</li>
    <li> I own several by MAC, Estee Lauder, and Sephora, and this is hands down, one of my favorite brushes for foundation.  You can use it with liquids, creams, or powders.  It is so versatile and guarantees a flawless finish.  I also think the size is perfect.  You can streamline for tight contouring or buffing, or quickly sweep it across the face for a quick and easy application of foundation.  It is also extremely easy to clean and in the years that I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;ve washed it every day with zero fallout!  Not a single hair or bristle has been shed!  Amazing, and it is a must have brush, you will use it every day and love it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good kabuki brush and was a little worried about buying on online without being able to check it out in person.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it though.  The quality is really good and no hairs have fallen out yet, which is always nice.  The handle is a little too long for me, but I like the size of the brush and it works great.</li>
    <li> This brush is very sturdy and has very soft bristles. I use it to apply my BB cream and it does a great job of applying the cream and distributing the product evenly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, and have just purchased another one after the old one got all the use I could get out of it (with multiple washing, lasted almost 2 years!)</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. I will definitely be ordering more from this line.</li>
    <li> Love this product is amazing my foundation was flawless after using this product.  Will purchase more of these items in the future.</li>
    <li> Needed a good foundation brush and the one at Urban Decay was $50.  Wasn&#x27;t willing to pay that, this is the same type and honestly the quality is equal to what they were selling.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Bdellium Tools Professional Antibacterial Makeup Brush Studio Line - Precision Kabuki Airbrushed Effect 957.  This is the first time I have used this type of brush for my liquid makeup.  I put a little bit on the back of my hand, dab the brush on it and stipple (dab) it lightly on my face, one area at a time until it is covered.  It goes on quickly, more so than using other brushes that are supposedly specifically for liquid makeup, or using a sponge.  I use way less makeup and get way better coverage.  It goes on evenly and does, indeed, look \\&quot;airbrushed\\&quot;.  Very good quality bristles and does not shed.  I&#x27;m telling you, this will transform the way you put on your makeup.</li>
    <li> Applies makeup very smoothly.  I also use it to blend concealer and highlighter. It is now part of my everyday routine.</li>
    <li> The brush hair is very dense and very soft. The brush is great with mineral foundation and gives a medium to full coverage. I have used this for a couple of months and there has been no shedding so far. This brush would be perfect if the head was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup brush.  I use with Physicians Formula Mineral Wear powder.  It smooths the powder on very nice and not cakey.  The only thing, I wish the brush handle was a little shorter but if I need another brush, I would buy this one again.  My dermatologist said to buy antibacterial brushes and this one says it is.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great brush for putting on makeup (foundation). I got compliments on how I looked so it must have smoothed it out nicely. Washes and dries well. Would be good for blush too.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve mentioned with other reviews in regards to the Bdellium brush line, I really really love this brush line. I have not had any issues this brush line. The brushes pick up my products with ease and there are no shedding. LOVE IT! This brush specifically I love because it gives me an airbrushed look and feel.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing -- the package came even earlier than was the estimated date of delivery and application is so easy. My make up looks perfect! :) I feel I don&#x27;t have to use lots of make up (liquid) and my skin looks very smooth .. I can recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for a make-up brush I searched out for an alternative to a MAC or a Sigma..This is it!  It works like a charm and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have bought the brush set through Bdellium Tools and have bought some separates and I am never anything but satisfied! I use this brush to apply my liquid foundation for an airbrushed look! I will continue to use and buy these brushes! This one is super soft and dense! I stipple the foundation with it and then if there are any spots I have left then I run it in circular motions over the spot! Works very well! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The brush head looked shorter in the photo. I still use my sigma brush since the buffer itself is shorter</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it is amazingly soft but firm for blending and applying makeup.  Much needed brush my my extensive collection.  A must have!</li>
    <li> Awesome air brushed foundation finish! I always receive compliments when I&#x27;ve used the brush to apply foundation.  Circular motion is the key to application.</li>
    <li> I have been using the same flat foundation brush for years and years. This is a great addition to get that airbrushed skin look. No shedding, easy to clean, good weight...really like it.</li>
    <li> So soft and this brush is very comparable to high end brush.</li>
    <li> Does not apply my foundation smoothly. I thought it was suppose to make me have an airbrush look not streaky. I&#x27;m sticking to my $1 elf foundation brush. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and this brush really lived up to the hype.  I would definfately recommend it if you are looking for a flawless makeup application every time.  Best used with liquid or creme foundation.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush!! I am so ordering more, it feels amazing on my skin when applying foundation</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy high quality stippling brush and i use it every day!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, I use it for both liquid and powder application and it blends wonderfully. It creates an airbrush looking finish and the bristles are so soft that it&#x27;s soothing and relaxing to use.  As a vegetarian, it&#x27;s nice to find a high quality synthetic brush.  Also  a great value when you compare it to the cost of similar professional tools.</li>
    <li> This brush is a great buy for the price.  I use it for my liquid foundation.  When used right, it gives an airbrushed finish.  Haven&#x27;t had any fall out.</li>
    <li> Used it to put on tarte maracuja foundation and I was surprised at how well it worked. It&#x27;s soft and dense. Very good purchase</li>
    <li> love love love love love this brush!! I can&#x27;t imagine wearing foundation without it. Honestly, I&#x27;ve tried some more expensive brand brushes but this one is just as good if not better. Gives your face such a FLAWLESS complexion and looks really natural. Use it in circular motions and I promise you won&#x27;t wear foundation without this brush ever again. LOVE IT! Order came quickly and just as expected.</li>
    <li> This brush is better than I was expecting! Perfect for liquid foundation, very soft but do the job. Go for it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing foundation brush.  This is perfect for the &amp;#34;stipple&amp;#34; technique.  It washes and dries so easily and flawlessly applies foundation and concealer.</li>
