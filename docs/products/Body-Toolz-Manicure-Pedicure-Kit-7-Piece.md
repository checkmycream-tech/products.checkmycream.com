      <li>All the utensils are of good quality...</li>

      <li>The quality of the tools is of good quality.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with this item.</li>
      <li>All of the stuff included is of good quality and fits in the pouch-thing nicely.</li>
      <li>I just wanted a nice nail care set that was not too girly.</li>
      <li>tHEY SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A NICE KIT FOR A WHILE</li>
      <li>More than anything I was looking for a good kit that was built to keep all the tools in one place.</li>
      <li>I own about 6 nail clippers.</li>
      <li>A list or some labels would have been nice.</li>
      <li>All that I needed was already in this nice set and more.  </li>
      <li>The carrying case is convenient and it came in a nice box that made it easy to wrap.</li>
      <li>It does everything i wanted it to do and more.</li>
      <li>I love the set</li>
      <li>Satisfied with results after use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was the perfect gift, especially for my grandchildren of all ages.  </li>
      <li>Attractive set, reasonably priced, tools work as well as pricier versions.</li>
      <li>It probably has too many things in it for him</li>
      <li>Ijust love a bargain.</li>
      <li>This is an okay set</li>
      <li>The price range on mani-pedi sets is overwhelming--</li>
      <li>I love the case and it fits easily into my purse.</li>
      <li>Great set with all the basic needs to do a mani-pedi which come in a nice case to keep organized.</li>
      <li>All items store easily in the included zip up pouch.</li>
      <li>For the money, it is a fine item.  </li>
      <li>Does not look or feel like a cheaply made product.</li>
      <li>The case is cheap and so are the tools.  </li>
      <li>I bought this set mostly for the scissors but most of the other tools are good.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this set for my boyfrienddid.</li>
      <li>I needed some NIPPERS and a tool to CLEAN UNDER MY NAILS.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll actually cause more damage to your nails than creating a nice manicure.  </li>
      <li>I just substituted the tweezer with my tweezerman as a quick solve.</li>
      <li>the case is handy and accessible, I only wish there were needle nose tweezers included.  </li>
      <li>Not terrible, but I am new to taking care of my nails.</li>
      <li>Nail clippers broke on the first use!</li>
      <li>received item as expected, good packaging.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll keep it and find him a more masculine one.</li>
      <li>It is a good idea though, to have your own set of these to take to the manicurist to avoid others&#x27; blood and other ickiness through contact with spa instruments, unless they have a autoclave and regularly use it.</li>
      <li>All of the pieces are very strong, work well, and sharp were they need to be while polished and smooth</li>
      <li>but first understand that I know nothing about nail care.</li>
      <li>The first component to get thrown out was the fingernail clipper, which didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure this will last him a while.</li>
      <li>The regular scissors are better but just to get the scissors this is too much to pay.</li>
      <li>The clippers did come apart after a couple of uses, but I am a &amp;#34;tinkerer&amp;#34; so they went back together easily.</li>
      <li>Pure trash.</li>
      <li>All tools are low quality, cheap instruments.</li>
      <li>Everyone that sees it wants one.</li>
      <li>so I really didn&#x27;t need that.</li>
      <li>I really like this set</li>
      <li>The various pieces are cheaply made and ineffective.</li>
      <li>I bought it for one specific tool and it is a good thing I wasn&#x27;t depending on the other tools.</li>
      <li>It is a well constructed set and has a high quality finish.</li>
      <li>This item is not bad, but I am not happy with it, because I feel that should be better.</li>
      <li>Overall, pretty decent product.</li>
      <li>none of these will cut my toe nails except the big trimmer, my nail doesnt even fit in the clipper and the small scissors buckle under my mighty toe</li>
      <li>I would have spent a lot more money trying to purchase everything individually.</li>
      <li>I did have to purchase a hard-core toe-nail clipper for my toe-nails that look more like eagle talons, because I saw myself cutting something important with the scissor-like nail clipper that came in the kit.</li>
      <li>It clearly isn&#x27;t anything for a &#x27;professional&#x27; nail salon, but for the money it served its purpose.  </li>
      <li>the straight long tool thingy works well for getting in there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Even the file isn&#x27;t coarse enough to do a decent job.</li>
      <li>Its worth the $20 for this set but not much more.</li>

<li> And as a young guy who doesn&#x27;t know about anything other than clippers, I was pretty confused with all this stuff.</li>
<li> The long, skinny, ice-pick lookin thing is kinda hard to use, and the normal file is reeeeally really gritty.</li>
<li> Finger nail clippers are smaller than expected and flimsy.</li>
<li> For it to be so thin, it does not flex at all (real solid stainless steel).</li>
<li> It&#x27;s definitely not high end</li>
<li> I would always have to use my wife&#x27;s tools which was a bit less complimenting to the male species.</li>
<li> Odd side note, it is made in Pakistan and can&#x27;t be shipped outside the US?</li>
<li> I have been using them for a few weeks now and the only problem I&#x27;ve had is the quality of the tweezer which I expected.</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used the other tools in the kit yet.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t  think too much can go wrong with the rest.</li>
<li> My only complaint is for the two files.</li>
<li> Most pieces have been tossed as they&#x27;re worthless.</li>
<li> From what I can tell the tools are very sharp and seem to be well made.</li>
<li> Second to go was the large nipper, which was so weak as to be useless against an ingrown nail.</li>
<li> It was missing the nail clipper</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Seriously, that thing is ROUGH, man.</li>
<li> The nail clippers are so dull, they won&#x27;t even cut my grandbabies finger nails.</li>
<li> This product sucks.</li>
<li> The tweezers are limp and useless though.    </li>
<li> Wish I would have bought a different product :-(</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize the case was sparkly so not a great option for him but works for me</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the outer case because it has a glittery look that is unnecessary.    </li>
<li> I bought this because I was tired of borrowing stuff from my parents to trim my nails and whatnot.</li>
<li> If you buy it, you will be sorry.</li>
<li> I was skeptical when ordering these</li>
<li> Very difficult to get the leverage to trim finger nails, forget about toes.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> Cuticle trimmers have a terrible spring mechanism so you have to make a cut and then pull the handles apart to make another cut.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It has all the tools you&#x27;ll need.  I would prefer a case that snaps but the elastic straps and zippered case keeps everything where it should be.</li>
    <li> I love the set but, the tweezers could be improved upon.  They can&#x27;t stand up to my Revlon tweezers.  Tweezers can make or break your kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this set mostly for the scissors but most of the other tools are good. The tweezers are limp and useless though.    I&#x27;m not a fan of the outer case because it has a glittery look that is unnecessary.    Odd side note, it is made in Pakistan and can&#x27;t be shipped outside the US?</li>
    <li> Nail clippers broke on the first use! Couldn&#x27;t believe it! Very disappointed in this product. Haven&#x27;t used the other tools in the kit yet. Don&#x27;t  think too much can go wrong with the rest. (Hopefully!)</li>
    <li> It does everything i wanted it to do and more. It is a well constructed set and has a high quality finish.</li>
    <li> All the utensils are of good quality... the case is handy and accessible, I only wish there were needle nose tweezers included.  All in all if I needed this again I would repurchase this one.</li>
    <li> I loved the set. It was missing the nail clipper but I didn&#x27;t make a big deal about it. I own about 6 nail clippers. I love the case and it fits easily into my purse. I would have spent a lot more money trying to purchase everything individually. Everyone that sees it wants one. Ijust love a bargain.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of borrowing stuff from my parents to trim my nails and whatnot. All of the stuff included is of good quality and fits in the pouch-thing nicely. My only complaint is for the two files. The long, skinny, ice-pick lookin thing is kinda hard to use, and the normal file is reeeeally really gritty. Seriously, that thing is ROUGH, man. They should have made one side finer so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m taking my nails to a grinder. And as a young guy who doesn&#x27;t know about anything other than clippers, I was pretty confused with all this stuff. A list or some labels would have been nice.</li>
    <li> This is an okay set but if you are looking for quality items .... this isnt it.  This would work as a back up set but thats it.  The cuticle cutters a cheapo pair. Its worth the $20 for this set but not much more.</li>
    <li> I bought it for one specific tool and it is a good thing I wasn&#x27;t depending on the other tools. The nail clippers are so dull, they won&#x27;t even cut my grandbabies finger nails.</li>
    <li> i GAVE IT TO A FRIEND AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT AND THEY LOVED IT. tHEY SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A NICE KIT FOR A WHILE AND THYE USED IT ALL THE THIME</li>
    <li> This set was perfect for me.  I needed some NIPPERS and a tool to CLEAN UNDER MY NAILS.  It came with both.  I use a glass file to file my nails so I didn&#x27;t need any files and I already have a great pair of nail clippers so I really didn&#x27;t need that. All that I needed was already in this nice set and more.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected. It&#x27;s definitely not high end but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I bought it for my boyfriend because he kept stealing my nail clippers. He doesn&#x27;t use them as often as I do so I&#x27;m sure this will last him a while. It probably has too many things in it for him but, you never know. The carrying case is convenient and it came in a nice box that made it easy to wrap. Overall, pretty decent product.</li>
    <li> Finger nail clippers are smaller than expected and flimsy. Very difficult to get the leverage to trim finger nails, forget about toes. Cuticle trimmers have a terrible spring mechanism so you have to make a cut and then pull the handles apart to make another cut. Wish I would have bought a different product :-(</li>
    <li> received item as expected, good packaging.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.  The case is cheap and so are the tools.  The clippers rip, not cut so you&#x27;ll actually cause more damage to your nails than creating a nice manicure.  Most pieces have been tossed as they&#x27;re worthless.</li>
    <li> I really like this set but first understand that I know nothing about nail care. I just wanted a nice nail care set that was not too girly. I would always have to use my wife&#x27;s tools which was a bit less complimenting to the male species. I just wish that it came with instructions. Some of the items I still don&#x27;t use. I do have ingrown toe nails and the straight long tool thingy works well for getting in there. For it to be so thin, it does not flex at all (real solid stainless steel). All of the pieces are very strong, work well, and sharp were they need to be while polished and smooth were they should be. I did have to purchase a hard-core toe-nail clipper for my toe-nails that look more like eagle talons, because I saw myself cutting something important with the scissor-like nail clipper that came in the kit.</li>
    <li> Like the quality and weight of the tools.  Satisfied with results after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this set to all who are looking for good manicure-pedicure.</li>
    <li> Not terrible, but I am new to taking care of my nails. I used to chew them to nubs so I am still learning the purpose of all of these tools. The clippers did come apart after a couple of uses, but I am a &amp;#34;tinkerer&amp;#34; so they went back together easily. Some people might have tossed them after this.</li>
    <li> Attractive set, reasonably priced, tools work as well as pricier versions. The price range on mani-pedi sets is overwhelming-- I feel that I got a good bargain</li>
    <li> For the money, it is a fine item.  It clearly isn&#x27;t anything for a &#x27;professional&#x27; nail salon, but for the money it served its purpose.  All items store easily in the included zip up pouch.</li>
    <li> Great set with all the basic needs to do a mani-pedi which come in a nice case to keep organized.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when ordering these but I thought I would give them a try. From what I can tell the tools are very sharp and seem to be well made. I have been using them for a few weeks now and the only problem I&#x27;ve had is the quality of the tweezer which I expected. I just substituted the tweezer with my tweezerman as a quick solve. More than anything I was looking for a good kit that was built to keep all the tools in one place. This does the trick.</li>
    <li> Ordered this set as a gift. Very nice set. Quality product within a quality case. Does not look or feel like a cheaply made product. The case is sturdy and will wear well. I am very satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> Pure trash. The various pieces are cheaply made and ineffective. The first component to get thrown out was the fingernail clipper, which didn&#x27;t work. How can fingernail clippers NOT work? Second to go was the large nipper, which was so weak as to be useless against an ingrown nail. Even the file isn&#x27;t coarse enough to do a decent job. Pass on this product.</li>
    <li> This product sucks. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I wish I never bought it. If you buy it, you will be sorry.</li>
    <li> none of these will cut my toe nails except the big trimmer, my nail doesnt even fit in the clipper and the small scissors buckle under my mighty toe</li>
    <li> The clippers lost their sharpness after one use. The regular scissors are better but just to get the scissors this is too much to pay. It is a good idea though, to have your own set of these to take to the manicurist to avoid others&#x27; blood and other ickiness through contact with spa instruments, unless they have a autoclave and regularly use it.</li>
    <li> All tools are low quality, cheap instruments. But they are functional. You get exactly what you pay for. Packaging is a blue zipper case that does hold all tools snugly in place.</li>
    <li> This is my fault, as i wanted a finger and toe nail kit.  This kit does not have the nail file needed to work on the fingers, or the finger and toe nail clipper.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this set for my boyfrienddid. I didn&#x27;t realize the case was sparkly so not a great option for him but works for me so I&#x27;ll keep it and find him a more masculine one.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift, especially for my grandchildren of all ages.  Now everyone does not have to borrow others tools.  The quality of the tools is of good quality.</li>
    <li> This item is not bad, but I am not happy with it, because I feel that should be better. So I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lots of tools but the cutter is too bulky for my toe nails.</li>
