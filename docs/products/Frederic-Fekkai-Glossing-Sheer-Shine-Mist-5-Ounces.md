      <li>This product is the perfect solution for fine hair or almost any hair type as it does not weigh your hair down at all and gives it the perfect level of shine.</li>
      <li>I liked the phytospecifics shine one just a tad more for this reason.</li>
      <li>It gives the hair a nice shine and light hold.</li>
      <li>the shine mist made my hair more nappy than shiny.</li>
      <li>This is the best shine spray for blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Love it, makes my hair shine.</li>
      <li>love this and all the products that went with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it.</li>
      <li>pump too many and then your hair looks oily.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the aerosol sprays because the mist seems finer and more evenly distributed.  </li>
      <li>It was just OK.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I love all the Fekkai Glossing/smoothing products.  </li>
      <li>You can find better for cheaper.</li>
      <li>Use it already many years</li>
      <li>It has a nice light scent as well.</li>
      <li>For sure it&#x27;s the best glossing spritz I&#x27;ve found; though, granted, I&#x27;ve only tried the ones from the drugstore</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair, and this feels light weight, definitly not greasy, but adds a nice, glossy finish.  </li>
      <li>Love the shine and it&#x27;s lightweight for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I like this product and its the one I carry in the travel bag but its easy to spray one</li>
      <li>Packaging was fine and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>It came quickly and the product is okay, but you can get Garnier shine spray for under $4 at Target or Walmart</li>
      <li>Light lemony scent.  </li>
      <li>Thought the product was advertised as Advanced Fekkai</li>
      <li>This is great to use when applying curling or flat irons.  </li>
      <li>I tried to spray it as the directions say to, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the money, trust me!</li>
      <li>Gives grey hair a great shine.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s important to note that the first ingredient is alcohol...</li>
      <li>It is ok, but I&#x27;ve used better products, something more emollient works better (this is a thin mist)</li>
      <li>Makes you hair shine pretty!</li>
      <li>This is great for adding a little shine that will be picked up by overhead lights.</li>
      <li>but so worth it.  </li>
      <li>my first bottle the sprayer didn&#x27;t work and they sent me a new one for free!</li>
      <li>does appear to be fine, but has a different smell then the Advanced product.  </li>
      <li>I have a limited budget, so this is on the higher end of what I&#x27;d like to pay for this kind of thing.  </li>
      <li>It also does exactly what it says</li>
      <li>It may work fine for thick, healthy hair</li>
      <li>I really like this product and recommended it to my friends.</li>
      <li>They really make my hair managable and the shine lasts.  </li>
      <li>However, I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It makes hair softer and very shiny,..</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a really nice gloss and because you spray it on you can control how heavy it is.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it is not the best product for dry or thin hair.</li>
      <li>I received this in about three business days, when i received it the pump for the spray was not working properly , the mist itself leaves a nice sheen on my black hair , light cucumber-y smell left after use, i use the fekkai glossing shampoo and conditioner along with this product - being honest i cant say that this is my favourite though... will try fekkai&#x27;s other hair products</li>
      <li>Paid the high dollar amount for this</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Like the other reviews mention, it dries out my already processed hair, making it stiff, straight and remarkably unflattering.</li>
      <li>After I used it it actually seemed to dry it out more.</li>
      <li>This one is very lightweight, but definitely adds shine to my hair.  </li>
      <li>High gloss and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair.</li>

<li> This one is very lightweight, but definitely adds shine to my hair.  </li>
<li> High gloss and doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair.</li>
<li> I have very long, black (dyed) straight layered hair, thin to normal.  </li>
<li> Leaves a dry feeling on my hair like spraying it with rubbing alcohol.</li>
<li> Since I have short hair I don&#x27;t want anything to weigh it down.</li>
<li> I have very dry hair, and hoped this would help make it shiny and silky.</li>
<li> Tried this spray to brighten up the grey and GUN-METAL dark.  </li>
<li> It is expensive and has a bit of an odd (not totally unpleasant but odd) smell.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily or weigh it down.</li>
<li> Some products weigh the hair down - this does not.  </li>
<li> Not greasy or heavy.</li>
<li> I have heavy hair, so I cannot get a heavy, greasy shine spray.  </li>
<li> Does your hair get a little dull between shampoos?  </li>
<li> Sad a decent product is rated poorly by skimping on sturdy packaging.</li>
<li> /&gt;Too expensive now for me</li>
<li> /&gt;It has a weird smell but tolerable..</li>
<li> smell is unpleasant and lingers all day</li>
<li> Terrible smell.</li>

    <li> I am never without this item...my daughter-in-law loves it to...it&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.  Makes you hair shine pretty!</li>

    <li> Love the shine and it&#x27;s lightweight for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for several years at Ulta but recently began purchasing from Amazon with the Subscribe and save option. When in stock, Amazon&#x27;s price is an amazing deal!    This product is the perfect solution for fine hair or almost any hair type as it does not weigh your hair down at all and gives it the perfect level of shine. It gets rid of all frizziness.     I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products but this one is the best. Highly recommend. You will love it!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair, and hoped this would help make it shiny and silky. After I used it it actually seemed to dry it out more.</li>
    <li> love this and all the products that went with it. This is a product i will keep using</li>
    <li> It makes hair softer and very shiny,.. I am in love with this product :)&lt;br /&gt;It has a weird smell but tolerable..</li>
    <li> smell is unpleasant and lingers all day</li>
    <li> This product smells so wonderful and is so light weight that you dont even notice that it is there!  It also does exactly what it says it does it makes your hair wonderful shiny!</li>
    <li> Paid the high dollar amount for this and I dropped it 1 foot onto the bathroom sink and the bottle lid cracked open and all of it emptied into the sink. Sad a decent product is rated poorly by skimping on sturdy packaging.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but I&#x27;ve used better products, something more emollient works better (this is a thin mist) It is expensive and has a bit of an odd (not totally unpleasant but odd) smell.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but cant use it because of the odor I would use it if you changed the perfume.</li>

    <li> It came quickly and the product is okay, but you can get Garnier shine spray for under $4 at Target or Walmart and it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
    <li> I let my hair go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.  Tried this spray to brighten up the grey and GUN-METAL dark.  It was just OK.</li>
    <li> This is s a good product.  I have a lot of hair, and this feels light weight, definitly not greasy, but adds a nice, glossy finish.

    <li> Does your hair get a little dull between shampoos?  This is great for adding a little shine that will be picked up by overhead lights. I always get a compliment after I&#x27;ve used it. I also like the Fekkai glossing cream, but it changes the texture of my hair and this doesn&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s great for short/ medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and recommended it to my friends. It does what it is supposed to do. Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice hoping for great results. Unfortunately, it is not the best product for dry or thin hair. Like the other reviews mention, it dries out my already processed hair, making it stiff, straight and remarkably unflattering. It may work fine for thick, healthy hair but it&#x27;s important to note that the first ingredient is alcohol...</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t do without it.  Gives grey hair a great shine.  For that matter would work on any color.  Not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Iove this product BUT it has doubled in&lt;br /&gt;Price since last year&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive now for me</li>
    <li> I have heavy hair, so I cannot get a heavy, greasy shine spray.  This one is very lightweight, but definitely adds shine to my hair.  Great price on Amazon.  Sometimes I find it cheaper on Ebay.</li>
