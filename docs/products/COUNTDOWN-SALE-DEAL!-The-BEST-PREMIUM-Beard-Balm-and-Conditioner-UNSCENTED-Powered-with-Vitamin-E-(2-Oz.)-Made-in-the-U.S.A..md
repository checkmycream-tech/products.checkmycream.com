    <li> Husband likes the idea of this, just has to learn the best way to apply and groom - trial and error fashion.  No directions included and one ingredient was covered up with &amp;#34;wite-out&amp;#34;??</li>
    <li> I bought it as a stocking stuffer for my husband, but he really loves it, and keeps it by his chair to use everyday!</li>
    <li> I bought this beard balm because I tried a different one first but my boyfriend stopped using it because it had a scent that he didn&#x27;t like. This one has no scent. It&#x27;s a fine balm. I just think that maybe beard hair is too coarse for anything to really make it &#x27;soft&#x27; but it can help with manageability.</li>
    <li> No smell and melts easily, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the beard as well either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub my hands through my beard later in the day and some of the material is still left.  It does work well to soften the coarse hairs</li>
    <li> gift for my son. he loved it.</li>
    <li> Good product, I have a softer beard</li>
    <li> Really unscented. I would like it more if it weren&#x27;t not so hard.</li>
    <li> I got this as well as the lemon scented version as a Christmas gift and I think this product is great.  Anyone with a beard knows how to apply this product as well as similar products.  I am liking this well enough that I will buy this for myself when I run out of the two containers I got for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my first time buying a beard product. Was looking for something to tame unruly errant hairs. It definitely has a scent but not over powering just a faint beeswax sort of smell and fades quickly. Not bad at all considering I was looking for an unscented balm. Works good seems like it&#x27;ll last for a while too. Leaves my beard a bit shiny which wears off shortly after applying and definitely makes it softer and helps for molding a bit which I have a bit of a point going with my goatee. Would definitely buy again after this one is finished. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> was a gift to my supervisor and he loved it.</li>
    <li> This beard balm had helped keep my beard looking smooth and is keeping it under control. It&#x27;s easy to use and washes out easy too.</li>
    <li> The photograph was deceiving it looks like you get more bang for the buck. But it&#x27;s a small can like all the rest. Does smell nice I give it four stars because of the photo that you posted it is just  2 ounces no more.  Shame on you for deceiving me</li>
    <li> My husbands beard looks so much better. It&#x27;s softer. It lays better. And it looks cleaner (not the dingy look it had before) he said 4 stars only bc he has to use it every day. 😔men)</li>
    <li> I really like the product but the tin can packaging can be difficult to open, especially after can gets greasy. I&#x27;m not sure if the can is necessary to keep product moist or if it designed to go along with the &amp;#34;Cowboy&amp;#34; theme of the company but,I think a screw on jar would be just fine. Also I wish they sold it in larger size.</li>
    <li> This works as advertised.  I apply a small amount in the morning and no flakes all day, puts my beard under control .  The only reason its 4 stars is the can is pretty hard to open, its too small to palm so its all fingers.  So i keep ithe lid just sitting on top of the can in the cabinet</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and his beard has never felt better!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have been using it for a week and it is really helping keep my beard soft.  It definitely has a musky scent even though it says it is unscented.  Maybe it is just the wax.  Anyway, the price is right.</li>
    <li> Product was great.  My husbands beard is like barbwire and this product held it down better than any we&#x27;ve tried.  It even arrived a day earlier than expected and before the rest of my order</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and loves it. He even gave some to his dad who also uses it. I personally think it is a little greasy when he first puts it on. Those good bye morning kisses sometimes leave me with some beard grease on my chin. My husband like it though and i think it keeps it nicely conditioned.</li>
    <li> Works well.  The only suggestion is that they put instructions on the tin.  I had to go back online to remind myself how I was to use the product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Works well and doesn&#x27;t have a crazy scent. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> Nice, unscented, general purpose beard balm. Good at moisturizing and taming frizz.</li>
    <li> I like the feeling it gives and my wife likes it too and that&#x27;s what really matters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still ugly but my beard is now neat.</li>
    <li> My beard looks extremly cool with this, its smells a little but it general very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Very hard,...more like cement than balm.</li>
    <li> Softens the beard a little.</li>
    <li> Keeping me under control!</li>
    <li> really good product, makes the beard nice and shiny.  no hold, just softening.  So far so good, love using it and happy with my purchase.</li>
