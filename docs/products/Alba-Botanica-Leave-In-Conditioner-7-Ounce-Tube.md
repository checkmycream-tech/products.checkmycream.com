      <li>This is a great product for my fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found such a good leave-in conditioner that does not cost a ton!</li>
      <li>Hair is easy to comb out and remains manageable after it dries.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it . I used it all the time and It keep my hair very moist. Just what i was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I use this for my almost-3 year old toddler&#x27;s super fine and short blonde hair. Without this stuff she gets super frizzy static-y fuzz. With this stuff (while her hair is still wet) I dab a bit on my hands and work it through her hair, and I blow dry it for 5 seconds and her hair stays smooth and fly-away free even overnight. It actually makes her hair look thick and gives it a nice subtle shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell the best, not what I would consider &amp;#34;botanical&amp;#34; at all, but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
    <li> At first I was not really impressed with this conditioner.  But I have grown to love it.  It is not heavy and does not in any way weigh down my fine hair.  It also makes my hair SOO soft.  This is the only conditioner I put on my hair and I love it.  I can&#x27;t believe I found such a good leave-in conditioner that does not cost a ton!</li>
    <li> After the shampoo you will apply a LEAVE IN conditioner which continues to work on your hair.  You are not going to believe what you will end up after a couple of treatments.  Don&#x27;t stop using this special formula to get your hair back to normal and to keep it that way.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Denise Hope&lt;br /&gt;The Gypsy In Your Soul</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and great &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; for 3C/4A black hair. It&#x27;s a staple for my wash-n-go and works well with my light glycerine-based curl sealing gel. My wash and go lasts for about 3 good days!</li>
    <li> My daughter has biracial hair-very 3c, curly, dry hair. I found this product on the EWG website because it is shown to be very safe. I LOVE IT! I don&#x27;t like using a lot of product on her hair so this is great. It goes on right after I wash it and then I also have a spray bottle with water and some of this product mixed in for days we don&#x27;t wash.  I use a denman brush and we are set to go. Now again, I don&#x27;t like her to have stiff hair or anything since she is so young but you may need a gel on top of this for styling. I will say with the denman brush and this conditioner her curls look great. I cannot say enough...try it!!!</li>
    <li> A bit heavy, but it worked alright when applied sparingly to wet hair.</li>
    <li> Better than some, not as good as some</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My hair tangles terribly and it really helps with that and also keeping the hair from being dried out.</li>
    <li> Hi I really enjoyed this product. Im a person who is creature of habit. I had been using Treseme  conditioner for a leave in. I wanted to try something new and so I did. Alba is good. Why? Its light on the hair and gives the hair great moisture. The tube makes it easy for the creme to come out without a mess. I enjoyed the creamy feeling of this leave in.It doesnt have a smell. If you have allergies and is sensitive to smells this would go well with your nose. The bottle is pretty and this product is a good leave in. Making the hair stronger than before</li>
    <li> Did a good job at protecting my hair from frizz.  It made my hair too curly for my taste, but the volume might be appreciated by someone else.</li>
    <li> I love products that don&#x27;t smell. I&#x27;m allergic to fragrances, so to find an unscented product that works is terrific. It doesn&#x27;t build up as washes out each day when you wet your hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> This worked great for my color treated hair. A little goes a long way! It is unscented which is actually nice for a leave-in product, you won&#x27;t end up with an overly perfumed hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I like Alba products alive. This particular one I am not thrilled with. I feel it makes my hair unmanageable, and greasy. Some seem to like it. Maybe their hair is different. It&#x27;s reasonable, not terrible, not great, so so. And Alba needs to lower their prices; their prices are too expensive.</li>
    <li> According to EWG this product is very low in toxins.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner keeps my curly hair moisturized and healthy. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have lots of chemicals and it has a mild, pleasant smell. It&#x27;s a great price too as I need to use it all the time and go through many bottles. Alba makes great products in general. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet with any of their products.</li>
    <li> Been using this conditioner for a long time on my fine, dry, naturally curly and sometimes frizzy hair. Is especially nice after swimming to restore moisture and manageability.</li>
    <li> I have dense, naturally curly hair and have tried everything in the whole wide world...this conditioner is FANTASTIC! I suggest you shampoo, then use a conditioner (recommend Naked Naturals Shea Butter), then, while your hair is still damp, use the Alba Botanica Leave In.  Then if you really need heavy hold, use a light styling gel....You will be so HAPPY! My hair keeps the curl, but remains soft and touchable.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a fantastic product. My favorite hair company is Devacurl and I feel this compares to their styling cream. I give Devacurl a 5 and this is probably a 4.5 at less than half the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you need to use just a tiny, tiny dab of this. I have curly hair and I put it on freshly rinsed or washed hair. Then I follow it with either Devacurl product or Alba&#x27;s soft hold style cream (I will be writing a similar review for that item).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase. I think I paid a little list at Vitacost because I had a coupon.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in plastic wrapping - which I liked because that means it probably wasn&#x27;t tapered with. Good sized bottle. I only use about a nickel size amount of product in my hair - thick strands, thin density. Light weight. No Fragrance! I didn&#x27;t believe that it wouldn&#x27;t smell like anything, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great for curly/kinky hair.</li>
    <li> Alba Botanica leaves my long fine hair manageable after getting out of the shower. Often with hard water, using conditioner while showering isn&#x27;t enough to de-tangle my long locks that fall well below my shoulders. This product is not only free of crazy chemicals that I don&#x27;t want, but works like nothing I have used in the past to help me run my paddle brush through my tresses without causing excess damage to my hair. A little goes a long way, I use only a quarter sized dollop, and I have very long fine hair. Ladies with thicker or coarser hair may need more, but if you use too much it does make your hair look &amp;#34;product laden.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture and sheen of my hair since using it: softer, shinier locks!</li>
    <li> Great for my and my daughter&#x27;s curly hair! My daughter has some corkscrew curls and in the Houston weather it can be very frizzy and unruly. With just a little drop of this leave in conditioner her curls stay tight and the frizz is kept at bay. I use it on my hair when the weather is really bad out and it does the same for me. Although I use it when I straighten my hair, it still does a good job of taming the frizz.</li>
    <li> I love this one..  It is thick and creamy feeling yet dries light.  Hair feels soft, smooth and has great slip.  Little goes a long way so it will last long time.  Great mix of ingredients.  Very pleased with this one.  Cone free, protein free, unscented.&lt;br /&gt;This never leaves my fine hair looking greasy or oily.  I really cannot put into words how well it works.  The coconut oil does wonders for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also takes my frizz away which stuns me.  This is an HG product for me and I fear it being discontinued or being reformulated.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find a cone free product like this that actually works so well on retaining moisture while smoothing frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a product junkie who changes products often.  I have over 30 different leave ins under my sink and this is the first one that stopped me in my tracks and made me take notice. Usually I dislike or tolerate a leave in.  This is first one that was so noticeably remarkable I could claim \\&quot;love it\\&quot; status.  This is the real deal for me.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to help condition my hair on the weekends. Works ok but will continue to look for another product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I use it to protect a bleached section of my hair from pool chemicals and it works fabulously. It keeps my hair soft all day without feeling greasy. A little goes a long way, too!</li>
    <li> This product did not make my hair shine or improve my hair in any way.  It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I gave a five star rating because I like the product overall. The ingredients are beneficial to hair health and it gives me the results I want for my hair. I will purchase this again. I recommend this leave-in conditioner for women who have wavy and frizzy hair. My hair type is 2a/2b (using the wikipedia definitions).</li>
    <li> This product is great!  I have very naturally curly hair that is often dry and frizzy.  I bought this out of desperation because my hair has been so dry after the birth of our 5th child.  After I wash my hair, I use some hair serum as always and then this.  I only need the amount the size of a pea and just run it through my hair.  I always let my hair air dry.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my hair!  The frizz is lessened and it&#x27;s not as dry as it was, not by a long run.  There is no scent to this product, which I am ok with.  I also use it to touch up my curls throughout the day as needed.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a nice, natural leave in conditioner.  The value was great as well!!!</li>
    <li> Just your ordinary leave in conditioner nothing special. Don&#x27;t be fooled like me,</li>
    <li> Life saver for dry hair</li>
    <li> This really is the best leave-in conditioner on the market, AND it&#x27;s all-natural. Honestly, what more could you ever want? One tip: A little goes a long way- use less than you think you need, and apply more on the ends than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I use this when letting my hair be naturally curly or to smooth it out to straighten, and it works well for both. A little goes along way, and there is no scent. I&#x27;m scent sensitive and am finding it harder to use any professional line of products anymore. So, to find an inexpensive leave-in that works as well as a professional salon product is a great find. And Alba is cruelty-free!</li>
    <li> Ever since Kiehls discontinued their unscented, leave-in conditioner, I have been looking for a replacement. This product is much less expensive and just as good--if not better--than Kiehls was! Perfect. Lightweight. Great for curls.</li>
    <li> I love it, my hair is colored and was very dry and fly away. After using this my hair was so much healthier looking and softer.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try this product on my African American 4C hair. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. This product semi softened my hair and detangled just enough to get the comb through but did nothing for my ends. I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the smell. Most reviews stated this product had a mild to no smell at all. It smelled bad to me. I&#x27;ll keep it and continue to use it so I&#x27;m not wasting $8. I&#x27;ll try to use it on braid outs with an oil. If I get better results, I&#x27;ll repost.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my 3C/4A natural hair. It&#x27;s just okay as a leave-in but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. What I didn&#x27;t like is the tube indicates the product is fragrance free. There are no perfumes or dyes added but there is definitely an odor in the botanicals and to me, it stinks. The first time I used it, the conditioner smelled so bad I rewashed my hair just to get the smell out. Thinking I used too much, I used less the next time but really, I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Apparently the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable when the hair is dry but it reeks until then.</li>
    <li> Works fine to get my frizz back into curls, but it is quite thick and a little awkward to apply evenly without globbing it on. I&#x27;ve had to take a washcloth after applying and rub down my hair at least once to distribute it more evenly.</li>
    <li> use it every time I wash my hair.  great for curly hair.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t even need a product to style when using this (depends on temperature, humidity, time of day, how much I have in my bank account...curls are so unpredictable!)</li>
    <li> This is a great product - I have very fine hair - this didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down - left it soft and easy to blow dry.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> one of my favorite leave ins for my type 4 fro. leaves it soft and i also mix a bit with water and glycerin in a spray bottle and use it as a spritz to re-moisturize.</li>
    <li> Best leave-in conditioner I have used. It mixes well with other products, does not create a buildup or film, and keeps my hair moisturized for days. My hair just feels &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; with this conditioner. I would love a scent to it, but that&#x27;s not too big a deal. I am sure I could just add a scent to it somehow if I really wanted.</li>
    <li> This product is not good, does not smell good, I don&#x27;t see any difference on my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product for my teen daughters with very long hair. Many conditioners with parabens and other nasty ingredients leave hair feeing oily or to heavy, but this one does not. Hair is easy to comb out and remains manageable after it dries. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> In the name of reducing the chemicals I ingest and use on my body, I was looking for a natural leave-in conditioner with a reasonable price.  I recently discovered the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database, and this is one of the most highly recommended products:  http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/499384/Alba_Botanica_Leave-In_Conditioner/.  Given the price, and reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I have fine, naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s very creamy, yet does not weigh down my hair.  It brings out my natural curl beautifully and gives my hair a nice fullness.  It has a very light coconut scent, not noticeable once the product wears for a bit.  Only a small amount is needed.  I prefer using it on dampened or towel dried hair.</li>
    <li> this is not a good product for me, while it may work from some others it left my hair feeling weighed downed.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance free conditioner! I use it as a detangler in my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it works well. A little of this goes a long way so the tube lasts awhile.</li>
    <li> I heard many rave reviews from my fellow natural curlistas and decided to try and see for myself.  Very moisturizing and is quite helpful with detangling my naturally kinky hair. This will be one of my favorite staples.</li>
    <li> Ok gel. Great ingredients</li>
    <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance and it seems to work in my hair well enough after having used it regularly for a few weeks now.  I air dry my hair so it can sometimes end up frizzy or too flat depending on the day.  This leave in has seemed to help me balance it out a little.</li>
    <li> You only need a little.  It goes on smooth, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.  The best part is that it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals that can damage your hair.</li>
    <li> Four and half stars.  Very good leave-in.  Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars because it was just okay. This product did not wow me as I had hoped. Alba leave-in  put some moisture in my hair but it didn&#x27;t last very long. Unlike other cheap leave-in conditioners my hair didn&#x27;t feel crispy dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this product if you were on a serious budget otherwise do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this because she has a low thyroid and has to avoid phthalates (found among other things in fragrance). The was a good choice on EWG.org. She loves it.</li>
    <li> If you have moderate to severe frizz, this stuff is the best of everything I ever used and I tried alot of products both organic and stuff that is prolly carcinogenic. It is thick and very moisture rich and is best applied to damp towel dried hair...even though it says to put on dry hair...leave in conditioners are always put on wet to damp hair for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels slimey when you put it on, but when it dries,your hair is silky.</li>
    <li> I really like this leave-in conditioner. It is botanical and has all natural ingredients in it. It is a really great moisturizer. It makes the hair feel good and look shiny and healthy. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I love Alba Botanica! This product smells nice and really helped get my hair texture back to normal after I&#x27;d dyed it several times in a row.</li>
    <li> Its alright, doesn&#x27;t make too much of a difference over the month I&#x27;ve used it. It has an earthy smell which is non invasive and definitely feels healthy and not chemical ridden like many other products I&#x27;ve used. Unfortunately its effectiveness is just alright.</li>
    <li> Although the smell goes away, just couldn&#x27;t get over putting it on my hair. Also, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t last as long as others. My hair dries out within a few hours.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Tried it for the first time and it really moisturized my hair without making greasy. I honestly have liked everything I&#x27;ve tried by Alba. I recommend this product for anyone that needs more moisture to their hair w/o the greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Pretty big fan of this stuff.  The ingredients are much more natural than most conditioners.  My hair has a tendency to be dry and &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;, or rather stick straight up.  Options to tame it are (1) gel, which has tons of polymers that probably only make the situation worse; (2) straightening fluid, which seems like similar chemical voodoo; or (3) leave-in conditioner, which isn&#x27;t quite as intensive as gel, but gets the job done.  This stuff isn&#x27;t greasy in its aftermath, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the ironic drying effect that other conditioners with tons of alcohol in them would.</li>
    <li> I bought ths product to use for bikram yoga. It helps a lot and my hairs stays put and feels softer</li>
    <li> I have environmental allergy and this is one of the few hair products I can use. Very good for curly hair use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Love...love this stuff, it makes my hair feel so soft and manageable!  And it doesn&#x27;t  have all the bad stuff.</li>
    <li> great hair creme! buy it again!</li>
    <li> I wished it had a light scent.  Otherwise, I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> A very heavy conditioning treatment so use sparingly on medium thick hair. Takes some trial and error to find the right amount for your hair but it is an effective conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite. I purchased for my daughter whom is 2 and has unruly curly hair. I was looking for a product that wouldn&#x27;t weigh her hair down and make it greasy looking like Coconut oil. This stuff is super thick. I use it now just to tame fly aways but I went with another product for her hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my fine, naturally curly hair.  I used to use Nexxus Humectress when it was able to be left in the hair as a leave-in conditioner.  When they reformulated it, I was looking for a great leave-in product that was fragrance-free, as I am very sensitive to soaps, shampoos, etc. that have fragrance.  I put this in my towel-dried hair, and it holds in moisture very well.  A little bit goes a long way, so don&#x27;t put in too much, so you don&#x27;t end up with greasy hair.  I hope this company does not reformulate this product, like so many companies do, because it is a great product as is.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal customer of this product. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy. My going grey hair loves it! It&#x27;s a bit chePer on amazon than I can find it in the store.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to smooth out drizzles and condition my dry hair.  This works like a dream and the price is right, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever invented!!!!!!! My hair feels and smells great! touchable and silky smooth! i would recomend this for anyone with curly hair who can&#x27;t stand the frizz</li>
    <li> This product made my hair soft and easier to detangle. It also helped me with my frizz. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love how this product can be used on wet or dry hair, as it is very helpful for taming flyaways.  Used sparingly, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my hair and I don&#x27;t need to wash my hands afterwards.  Instead, it acts like a lotion for my hands.  Plus, the ingredients are very good without any synthetic chemicals and the packaging is recyclable.</li>
    <li> My 22-month-old daughter has incredibly thick curly hair (she&#x27;s already had 4 haircuts).  This conditioner defines her ringlets, helps them coil nicely and keeps her hair soft.  It&#x27;s rated highly on the EWG database, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, not too greasy</li>
    <li> Great for my dry, frizzy, curly hair.  Only leave-in conditioner I found that works on my naturally curly hair.  I found that focusing the conditioner on the ends of my hair produces the best results.  It&#x27;s also organic, which is a plus.</li>
