      <li>I&#x27;ve used the body wash as well and it smells exactly the same!</li>
      <li>I like this product because it contains natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not joking when I say that the scent lasts about 15 minutes and then its completely gone.</li>

    <li> Bought this with the body butter &amp; they are great together.. The quantity could be better though.. But my guy noticed it right away &amp; loved it..</li>
    <li> I looked for this in the store and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I originally got it in a grab bag special from Burt&#x27;s Bees and loved it. Was glad to fing on Amazon. Great light scent without being too strong.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it contains natural ingredients.  Great to use as a mid-day freshener or after the gym, or after a hibachi dinner etc.  People have told me I smell like coconuts.  It&#x27;s not terribly good, nor is it terribly bad.  It&#x27;s pleasant.  I needed an inexpensive, portable, all-natural body spray and this totally gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a more vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;It only has a hint of vanilla with a kind of weird scent along with it.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion but this spray has absolutely no staying power. It was a waste of money cos I bought two bottles. I use it for spraying my bathrobe, pillows, etc., as it isn&#x27;t worth it as a cologne. Disappointing, but still love the scent.</li>
    <li> I have this in the spray and body butter.I would recommend this others. It smells good and the body butter is nice and thick. Luvs it!</li>
    <li> Very Gooooooood Smell! Likes it a lot and one of my favorite to is the lotion. Whenever i use it, everyone notices it!</li>
    <li> This really is a beautiful scent! Sweet, warm, and inviting. The only downside is that the scent tends to fade away in just a few hours. I wish it would last longer!</li>
    <li> I smell very little vanilla in this but VERY coconutty! I do happen to really like coconut but the title should be called coconut-vanilla. It&#x27;s very light but kind of reminds me of how a suntan oil would smell hence the 3 stars</li>
    <li> wonderful scent - cute packaging. use it constantly :-)</li>
    <li> Smells good! If you have the body wash and lotion, you&#x27;ll love this. The scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> The scent is great but very light. I&#x27;ll settle for a lighter scent if the product has better and safer ingredients. I used to get a body spray from a bath retailer (B&amp;BW) and while I loved the scent I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with their ingredients.</li>
    <li> by far my favorite smell! It&#x27;s the smell of vanilla with a mix of cedar wood. I absolutely love it, I use the shampoo body lotion and body mist smells so good and I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I take LONG rides on a motorcycle and it gets a little sweaty under the leather.  It&#x27;s nice to sit around the campfire smelling like Vanilla instead of a locker room.</li>
    <li> Warm and delicious. I enjoy this rich, warm scent. It doesn&#x27;t last a long time but while it does last, it&#x27;s really comforting and delicious. It hits on the warm notes of vanilla and not the foody ones.</li>
    <li> The product was very small for the price, and I felt like the scent wasn&#x27;t any better than bath and body work&#x27;s vanilla mist (which gives you a nice fragrance in a decent amount for a better deal). Also, the containing had scuff marks on it when it arrived and the cap was missing...</li>
    <li> I already had the body wash and lotion. the mist lets you smell nice long after the shower.  I love it !!</li>
    <li> I had bought the lotion before in the Vanilla Flame and really enjoyed it so I thought i would try the mist too. It smells so nice and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was larger than 3 fluid ounces but I guess its the perfect size to travel with.</li>
    <li> I do not care much for this product. The smell is ok. Not exactly vanilla. Like a tanning lotion smell. I&#x27;m not joking when I say that the scent lasts about 15 minutes and then its completely gone. Not happy with this one at all.</li>
    <li> love the lite smelling fragrqnce.</li>
    <li> The problem with synthetics is people start to think they know what something actually smells like, but what they know to be a scent is a synthetic version of it. This is TRUE vanilla. This is a natural product and it smells light, refreshing and actually like true vanilla. It&#x27;s not coconut, it&#x27;s nothing like coconut. If you think this smells like coconut, you don&#x27;t know what true coconut actually smells like. If you are into natural products this is a very enjoyable fragrance. I love this product, it is by far my favorite body mist of all time. The fragrance stays with you and is never overpowering. It&#x27;s my go to and I order it whenever I can find it. I&#x27;ve used the body wash as well and it smells exactly the same! Love love love!</li>
