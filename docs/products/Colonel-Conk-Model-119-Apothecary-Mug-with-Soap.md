      <li>This is a great example of old ideas being the best choices.  </li>
      <li>Need I say more!</li>
      <li>but I think it came with the soap too, which is the real important part.  </li>
      <li>but as mentioned before broke the mug and really liked it</li>
      <li>Soap fits nicely in the bottom of the mug and does not move around and when you make foam.  </li>
      <li>But nice mug to shave with.</li>
      <li>For the price it&#x27;s a nice apothecary style mug.</li>
      <li>Its also deceivingly lightweight, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>I can just mix the shave soap in its own container and on my face.</li>
      <li>The shaving soap that comes with it lathers up nicely.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold and the trumpeted opening makes it very easy to whip up a great lather.</li>
      <li>The soap works best and fastest for me when I build a lather directly on the soap in the cup.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable in your hand.</li>
      <li>The knob handle is very comfortable to hold while lathering up the soap on the brush.</li>
      <li>While the product itself is a good product, the apothecary mug is exactly that and quite nice,</li>
      <li>The soap is ok, I guess.</li>
      <li>Nice wide opening on the top and the 2.25 oz Col Conk shaving soap fits in perfect.  </li>
      <li>no handle, more like a soup bowl....</li>
      <li>Love the retro styling</li>
      <li>Again, this is an OK mug, could have been better, feel it is a bait and switch tactic.</li>
      <li>I love my Conk Mug.</li>
      <li>A bowl works much better for me.  </li>
      <li>I find this mug to be no lighter than most of the coffee mugs I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t bump your thumb and fingers any more and it is easier to keep the lather in the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it had been made of heavier ceramic or tempered glass it would have been a much better product.</li>
      <li>I love shaving with a brush and shaving soap, and this mug is a must-have for me.</li>
      <li>The size and shape were OK, but the ceramic is so light-weight that it breaks easily.  </li>
      <li>There are some runs in the glaze, something I expected to be perfect at this price.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold onto with plenty of room to create lather.  </li>
      <li>It holds shaving soap with ease, and is easy to handle and hold when using the brush to lather up the soap.</li>
      <li>This mug is easy to hold onto.  </li>
      <li>You can get a lather, but is is not as easy as if it had bumps or ridges.</li>
      <li>The mug seems pretty hefty and well-made, and the included soap has a light scent and creates a nice lather.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll keep it for a while, until I see something in person that would fit the soap cake</li>
      <li>, I was under the impression the soap would fit better/snugly in the bottom of the mug.</li>
      <li>Some reviewers have knocked stars off of this mug because it is too light.  </li>
      <li>it smells gross but lathers great.</li>
      <li>While this may sound trivial, it is in a way, but I used the logo as a decision point to buy this one.  </li>
      <li>the casting on the mug is cheap, there is a hole that goes through the mug into the handle that will collect water/ soap in the handle itself.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy using it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with a cheap cereal bowl I purchased at Target.</li>
      <li>Although I realize the apothecary style wasn&#x27;t originally designed to be one.  </li>
      <li>It heats up well in a sink full of hot water and then the soap lathers better.  </li>
      <li>The soap having all the sides and top exposed, leaves some soap build up all around, and I assume will wear out the soap pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>This one is fine, and the price was right.</li>
      <li>It is nice and heavy and retains heat well for nice hot lather.</li>
      <li>Nothing less than OUTSTANDING!!  </li>
      <li>The price is OK but not as good as a common mug from the dollar store (as I&#x27;ve seen recommended).  </li>
      <li>Nice and big</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just use it, as it would cost more in time and money to send back then what it cost originally.     </li>
      <li>The soap lathers up nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out quick.  </li>
      <li>Your standard coffee mug should hold up better.</li>
      <li>Nice to look at but not very sturdy.</li>
      <li>Having the smaller diameter soap means it will knock around in the bottom instead of fitting closely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>It is not quite as comfortable to hold as my old Burt&#x27;s Bees mug, but that has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>It is nice and deep and wide at the top.  </li>
      <li>I am age 63 and have tried many different  shave mugs over the years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than the misleading picture is is a good product if you are looking for a decent mug for shaving or other purposes.</li>
      <li>:  I found the top of the knob a little close to the rim to get a comfortable grip.  </li>
      <li>and since I have fast hot water, I do not have time to heat up things.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s low, squat, and allows me to mix up a lather easily with</li>
      <li>Larger opening makes it easy to lather up the brush.</li>
      <li>The large bowl/oversize coffee cup I was using had a ring type</li>
      <li>This is a great shaving mug, but I would like the handle a little larger.</li>
      <li>Really need the handle.    </li>
      <li>They really took every step to cut corners on this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I really like the shave mug</li>
      <li>Things I really like about the product:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>is very neat to use....</li>
      <li>mug.&lt;br /&gt;First, the mug is think which means it does not retain heat very well.</li>
      <li>the save soap bricks (standard rounds) fit in there.  </li>
      <li>It really destroys the look.    </li>
      <li>I am comparing this to a modern Van Der Hagen mug which I owned, but broke (my fault).</li>
      <li>so my lather does not stay warm enough long enough&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes it is light, especially when compared to the old shave mugs, but that is a symptom of our modern age of disposable products.  </li>
      <li>Handle is easy to grip and does not slip even when hands are wet.  </li>
      <li>I am going to order this (mainly just for the mug):</li>
      <li>I highly recommended this mug to any shaver.  </li>
      <li>As such, I am unable to have a truly hot shave, so will start letting the mug sit in the sink in hot water while I shower, thus allowing the mug to heat up and retain the heat need for a really good shave.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; is great!</li>
    <li> I received my shaving mug last night.  I like it as it is large and has a wide mouth.  Like a previous review, I ordered the green logo one and received a red lettered mug.  While this may sound trivial, it is in a way, but I used the logo as a decision point to buy this one.  If I had wanted the red, I would have ordered the red.  I&#x27;ll just use it, as it would cost more in time and money to send back then what it cost originally.     Regardless, it does what it is supposed to do and that is to hold the soap.  I shave out of the sink and since I have fast hot water, I do not have time to heat up things.  As such, I am unable to have a truly hot shave, so will start letting the mug sit in the sink in hot water while I shower, thus allowing the mug to heat up and retain the heat need for a really good shave.  Again, this is an OK mug, could have been better, feel it is a bait and switch tactic.</li>
    <li> I am NOT comparing this to an old school shaving mug. I am comparing this to a modern Van Der Hagen mug which I owned, but broke (my fault). This mug is easily half the weight, even has a hollowed out knob handle. They really took every step to cut corners on this product.  I can&#x27;t comment on the soap (I got a lime one) because I immediately packed this thing up and am sending it back to Amazon.  I am going to order this (mainly just for the mug): [[ASIN:B004L4EING Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set]]. I already have one but as mentioned before broke the mug and really liked it so I guess I am going to order it again.</li>
    <li> I received a different mug from the one pictured. no handle, more like a soup bowl.... Really need the handle.    Going to return.</li>
    <li> I got my mug yesterday after paying a premium price for it. It is larger than I expected and lighter. There are some runs in the glaze, something I expected to be perfect at this price. Secondly the size of soap puck I received was the 2.5\\&quot; not the 3\\&quot; as is pictured. Having the smaller diameter soap means it will knock around in the bottom instead of fitting closely.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending it back, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. I&#x27;ll just use an old diner mug.</li>
    <li> While the product itself is a good product, the apothecary mug is exactly that and quite nice, what is pictured is NOT what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the label on the mug is red, not green. Not a biggy but deceiving. One of the major selling points for me was the soap pictured. It is an almond scented soap. Not sure about the rest of you but I got a lime scented soap. it smells gross but lathers great. I think in the item description it should be mentioned you get a random soap or at least what kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the misleading picture is is a good product if you are looking for a decent mug for shaving or other purposes.</li>
    <li> I was using a standard coffee mug before getting this and could get nowhere near the lather I get with this. It&#x27;s easy to hold, heavy enough to know it&#x27;s there but not too heavy to form a lather.     A must have if you&#x27;re shaving with brush and soap!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an actual shaving mug before.  Although I realize the apothecary style wasn&#x27;t originally designed to be one.  It is nice and deep and wide at the top.  Easy to hold onto with plenty of room to create lather.  The price is OK but not as good as a common mug from the dollar store (as I&#x27;ve seen recommended).  You get a soap with it though which lowers the cost.  Get one.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently switched over to a DE safety razor to shave, and decided to get a dedicated shaving mug for the bathroom. The mug seems pretty hefty and well-made, and the included soap has a light scent and creates a nice lather. However, I accidentally knocked over the mug yesterday, and it fell around 5 inches into the sink and the mug broke in half. Not exactly sturdy, so would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this mug for my son for Christmas.  It reminded me of my Grandpa&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;mug when I was growing up.  My son loves this and the razor and the soap&lt;br /&gt;that i bought with the mug. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this mug thinking it was a little smaller.  You might have a problem getting it into some medicine cabinets.  Handle is a little tough to hold on to with wet hands.</li>
    <li> I love my Conk Mug. The one I received is not the one in the picture, I received the one with RED lettering. I still like it, but if you are picking this by color you will be disappointed. I would have rated 5 stars if I had received the one in the picture. I had chosen this one over the one with the red lettering for the green color, but received the red one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a coffee mug before, and this apothecary mug is made for making lather the way the side walls are shaped. You don&#x27;t bump your thumb and fingers any more and it is easier to keep the lather in the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try one, you&#x27;ll like it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great example of old ideas being the best choices.  Fits like a glove, and looks good too.</li>
    <li> I dont understand How i learned to shave without this! is very neat to use.... I dint give it a 5 star because its not a food item!</li>
    <li> Some reviewers have knocked stars off of this mug because it is too light.  Yes it is light, especially when compared to the old shave mugs, but that is a symptom of our modern age of disposable products.  I find this mug to be no lighter than most of the coffee mugs I&#x27;ve bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have given poor reviews because the mug broke - when they dropped it!  That is hardly the fault of the mug.  Nine times out of ten, if you drop a ceramic or stoneware mug on the floor, it will break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mug is, in my opinion, great!  If you show even moderate care, it will be with you for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boycott Amazon until they STOP using Fedex \\&quot;Smartpost\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I feel like I popped three balloons in a row at the carnival.  the casting on the mug is cheap, there is a hole that goes through the mug into the handle that will collect water/ soap in the handle itself.  not worth the price of shipping to send it back</li>
    <li> Handle is easy to grip and does not slip even when hands are wet.  Soap fits nicely in the bottom of the mug and does not move around and when you make foam.  Larger opening makes it easy to lather up the brush.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap mug for years, and have now purchased one for my son.  I am not the most \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; guy with my stuff, though I am not abnormally hard on things either.  This mug has lasted seven or eight years and two moves without any chips or problems.</li>
    <li> Amazon apparently makes this mug in red as well as green (although it&#x27;s not listed on the product page), and decides at random which one to send you, regardless of the $17 price tag. The red lettering looks washed out and takes the mug from tank to toy, in my opinion. I ordered this as a Christmas gift and was steamed to find that they shipped the wrong color of an item that only CAME in one color. I was given a deep discount (the whole order was off), but it ended up evening out as just a price adjustment to match the toy-like appearance of the mug. It really destroys the look.    There are runs in the glaze which present as darker spots, but nothing major. The make or break was really the pale red color.</li>
    <li> I had loved this mug while it lasted. I dropped it on the tile floor and it shattered. You need to keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t necessarily going to be a product you will buy for life. I would have expected something with a little better build quality. Your standard coffee mug should hold up better. I never did replace it because I figured out I can just mix the shave soap in its own container and on my face. It seems to work just as well and there is less overall waste of the product.</li>
    <li> My son and I each got one of these mugs.  The size and shape were OK, but the ceramic is so light-weight that it breaks easily.  Within a few weeks, my son had shattered his mug, and mine had a significant chip in it. So I now keep mine on the shelf were it sits as a razor holder.  If it had been made of heavier ceramic or tempered glass it would have been a much better product.</li>
    <li> This mug is easy to hold onto.  Enjoy using it.  The shaving soap that comes with it lathers up nicely.</li>
    <li> this is a great mug with a good handle and hand feel.  Fits the soaps my husband likes and holds a good lather.</li>
    <li> A short drop off the bathroom counter and it broke into pieces. Nice to look at but not very sturdy.</li>
    <li> its a shaving cup what mor to say a tad bigger than i thought it would be but it works great</li>
    <li> But out side of that it&#x27;s great. I use to use a coffee cut, maybe i&#x27;m use to the size of the coffee style cup. Might take time to get use to something big like that. But nice mug to shave with.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Its a mug.... the save soap bricks (standard rounds) fit in there.  It is nice and heavy and retains heat well for nice hot lather.</li>
    <li> This mug fits my hand rather well. It could have a little longer holding knob. My hand is rather small and my fingers fit very tightly between the mug and the holding knob. This could be difficult for a large handed person. Other than that I would say, it is a very well built and designed mug.  I would recommend it to another person.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my room mate, he prefers soap to canned shave cream. He uses it everyday.  Need I say more!</li>
    <li> Pros:  Looks cooler than a coffee mug.  Felt the profile and diameter of the rim made for good lather making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I found the top of the knob a little close to the rim to get a comfortable grip.  The large bowl/oversize coffee cup I was using had a ring type handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the shape of the mug, the shape of Conk&#x27;s soap, and that it was branded Colonel Conk, I was under the impression the soap would fit better/snugly in the bottom of the mug. The soap works best and fastest for me when I build a lather directly on the soap in the cup.  The soap having all the sides and top exposed, leaves some soap build up all around, and I assume will wear out the soap pretty quickly.  I have seen other cups where the soap cake fits snugly in the bottom, so only the top is exposed to water &amp; brush, and I would think that would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ll keep it for a while, until I see something in person that would fit the soap cake better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap bar itself, they sent me Lime.  So I can&#x27;t wait to get through the rum one I have already.  While I have only had a few other brush type lathers so far, I really like the lather this soap produces (providing I build the lather ON the soap, otherwise it takes forever to build up in a separate cup like some wet shavers suggest...)</li>
    <li> Its a good cup. I like the ever widening mouth as it gives you a great whipping surface to make the shaving cream. The only drawback is the handle which can be slippery when wet and all you are really hanging on to is a little ceramic stub.</li>
    <li> Its a mug.  Pretty simple but I think it came with the soap too, which is the real important part.  The soap lathers up nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out quick.  Note that part... if your soap dries out quick you&#x27;ll have a frustrating shave.  And one puck of soap lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than a few different bowls and mugs over the years and this one can hold it&#x27;s own!  Wide enough for a heavy brush and deep enough to hold on to your lather with minimum spill over. It may not be the high-end luxurious collectors mug, but for actual use it stands up rather well, especially considering the very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because I had no use for it since the shaving set I bought was not well made and I returned it.  Too bad because the mug was nice looking and seemed to be well made.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of griping about the color of the mug versus what was ordered. Well, I ordered the red one and got the red one. It comes with \\&quot;amber\\&quot; soap. The soap is ok, I guess. The mug is really nice though! For the price it&#x27;s a nice apothecary style mug. Oh, and remember when you are reading these picky reviews...it&#x27;s a mug.</li>
    <li> I use this daily. It heats up well in a sink full of hot water and then the soap lathers better.  The knob handle is very comfortable to hold while lathering up the soap on the brush.</li>
    <li> good price for product - husband was happy with it for a gift. Good for starter shaving set and for gift.</li>
    <li> I love shaving with a brush and shaving soap, and this mug is a must-have for me. It holds shaving soap with ease, and is easy to handle and hold when using the brush to lather up the soap.</li>
    <li> Nice wide opening on the top and the 2.25 oz Col Conk shaving soap fits in perfect.  You never go wrong with a Col Conk Product</li>
    <li> I like the style and coloring of this mug. You can get a lather, but is is not as easy as if it had bumps or ridges. I think the mug came with some soap, so that is nice even though it was the small puck that is much harder to get loaded than the large puck. It was basically a sample. The price is definitely a plus because it is half of what competitors charge. However, at least the Edwin Jagger mugs, for example, have bumps on the bottom to speed along lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, this mug is light, and the knob is hollow. Foam creeps over the sides. I would guess the heat retention is average for a mug, which isn&#x27;t much. The biggest disappointment for me was that there were no bumps or ridges on the bottom or sides of the mug to help with lathering. Instead, it is totally flat and slick. I will use this mug as a puck holder now or press some hard soap into it. I am looking at scuttles now to lather with instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Its a great bowl, I love the handle and the shape of it.  Its also deceivingly lightweight, which is nice.  The only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) was that it has a slightly larger diameter than the standard shave soap.  Even the Colonel Conk shave soap, which I started using with this bowl is slightly smaller than the inside of the mug.  Because of this, some of the foam created gets lost between the soap and the walls of the mug.  It hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it, but It is a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m stupid because even after dropping my last apoth-style mug (surely due to the awkward handle shape) I ordered this one as a replacement. I just like the apoth mug look I guess. But what can you say about a shaving mug. This one is fine, and the price was right.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mug.  Easy to hold and the trumpeted opening makes it very easy to whip up a great lather.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my complaints for the mug.&lt;br /&gt;First, the mug is think which means it does not retain heat very well. By the time I go to apply lather for the second pass it&#x27;s cold already.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the bottom of the mug is too narrow and deep. It makes it difficult for the brush bristles to reach and to swirl around to make the lather.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the handle is too short for me to really grip it effectively between my fingers like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with a cheap cereal bowl I purchased at Target.</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to build a good lather in this mug.  A bowl works much better for me.  I do like they way this mug looks though.</li>
    <li> Things I really like about the product:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice and big&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is a plus&lt;br /&gt;- Love the retro styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;- The ceramic is very thin, it does not hold the heat in well so my lather does not stay warm enough long enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the shave mug, I just wish it was a little thicker/heavier so as to keep my lather warmer.</li>
    <li> Nothing less than OUTSTANDING!!  Best shave mug I ever had.  I am always looking for that &amp;#34;better mouse trap&amp;#34; now I can stop looking. I highly recommended this mug to any shaver.  I am age 63 and have tried many different  shave mugs over the years.  But this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Do I  recommend  this mug....you bet!  You simply can not go wrong if you order this item.&lt;br /&gt;Sign.....happy shaver!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving mug, but I would like the handle a little larger. It is not quite as comfortable to hold as my old Burt&#x27;s Bees mug, but that has been discontinued. Not enough bees shave I guess.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the mug pictured. received &amp;#34;super shave mug #129&amp;#34;.  Not happy with what I received.</li>
    <li> This mug is big enough that it allows you ample room for making your lather but it&#x27;s not so big that it&#x27;s bulky. It&#x27;s very comfortable in your hand.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  It&#x27;s low, squat, and allows me to mix up a lather easily with it&#x27;s wide mouth that allows my hands to get down in the mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
