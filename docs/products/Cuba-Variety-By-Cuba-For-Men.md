<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cheap fake!&lt;br /&gt; Drop it in a trash bag or return immediately</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging. My husband actually thought they were cigars and was confused how I got Cuban cigars! They all smell good too.</li>
    <li> i think it&#x27;s a smoke, however, it&#x27;s liquid within it. i don&#x27;t like it. So i want to refund, but the item couldn&#x27;t be refund.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest not to buy it.</li>
    <li> I like these and the price is great !</li>
    <li> Balling on a budget. This cologne smells great and is very cheap. I remember buying these a long time ago. Glad I found them online. Must buy.</li>
    <li> These samples are pretty large and are glass, Tinted an brown color, the color of a cuban cigar as the name suggests, These samples for a little over 12 dollars are really good. You get 4 different samples ranging from bitter to sweet. My favorite in order is Gold, Orange and tied for last Blue and red. Blue is really girly while red as tobacco in it and is really bitter. The other two are in the middle between those which make them quite nice. Overall for 12 dollars you cant go wrong either way.</li>
    <li> they smelled good love them</li>
    <li> Took a gamble and bought this for my dad. He loved it and so did my brother. I&#x27;ve now bought this set for every man in my family :)</li>
    <li> I went throu two orders and never did get Cubian Cigars, but the calon has a nice fragrance so I kept the two orders and gave them as Xmas gifts.</li>
    <li> This variety pack is definitely worth it. It comes with different scents that I personally use. I use the blue scent on rainy days, which mixes well with the atmosphere, gold on regular days, red on hot days and orange on windy days.</li>
    <li> Great to give as a gift. Very inexpensive. As far as the scents, the Cuba line do copy-cats of popular colognes like Calvin Klein, Thierry Mulger, etc.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer service. I would highly recommend dscents I recievid an order with a problem and they immediately felt with it to my complete satisfaction product is great I gave it to my son as a gift and he loved it. This is one company that I would use over and over. In this day 100% customer service means a lot to me</li>
    <li> Great buy.....was perfect!!!!!!</li>
    <li> two of the tubes do not spray. they all smell nice. just wish they all work. Gave as a gift last night.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for friends that they live in another country but, the told me that enjoyed this colonge every day when they go to work.</li>
    <li> Great gift for the men who live cigars. They all smell good</li>
    <li> An excellent perfume. I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t more popular. The scent is unique. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> There seems to be very little distinction between the 4 varieties. But it makes for an elegant gift at a very reasonable price from amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This products are good. They smell very good, specially the cuba gold. They make good gifts as well. Recommended. There is not much in the bottles they 1.17 ounces. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of cigars, and these have an amazing scent. No strong, smells manly, and subtle cigar scent</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Ok. I love cologne. If I don&#x27;t reek of some sort of fragrance, I feel like I smell like cheese or feet. lol I wear everything from $100 Armani to $3 imposter Eternity. This was an awesome buy for $12. You get fruity to weird. Weird kinda smells like some old dude back in the eighties. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $45 (original price) though. If you can get it at $12 it&#x27;s definitely worth checking out.  I happen to like all four of the scents.  Makes me feel like some sort of European immigrant.  Hey! Its cheap cologne.  Don&#x27;t expect some awesome new Cool Water.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE NOT CIGARS…&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I got these thinking they were cigars…but no they are cologne.  My son was not too pleased at first but then he said actually they smell pretty good after we got over the laugh of my error.  So try it!</li>
    <li> The men in my home love these</li>
    <li> Of course all the men loved these.  IM sure ill b ordering more soon</li>
    <li> Not only did he love the cigar look bottle, I hoped he could at least like one scent, but he really likes them all, and I love them all on him. Great [[ASIN:B000C1UDPO Cuba Variety By Cuba For Men. Set-4 Piece Variety With Cuba Gold, Blue, Red &amp; Orange &amp; All Are 1.17 Ounces]]Gift</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift and my boyfriend loves it..</li>
    <li> I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY THE SMELL OF THE PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH,HOWEVER IT STAYS WITH YOU A VERY LONG TIME</li>
    <li> gave as a gift,luv luv it,I will definitely keep purchasing,great price and smells devine,they think you spent a bundle</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne all four smell really good</li>
    <li> Husband loved this gift pack. Use to erar years ago.</li>
    <li> The blue scent is really the only good one, but that is a personal opinion. Overall, the cologne was packaged well, looked nice, and was a good &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Off course ends are amazing my husband is very pleased with his gift!</li>
    <li> This set arrived safe &amp; sound in its packaging. It was used in gift baskets for the holiday in addition with other products. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier for the quality &amp; price of these colognes. In store they&#x27;re at least 12.00 a piece and I was able to grab 4 for $12 :). They smell great &amp; my nephews were happy. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nephew as a Christmas gift and he liked it. The scents are nice and not overpowering. It looks an elegant present as well. I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love it!  I will be ordering more soon. Excellent seller, Thank you.</li>
    <li> The cologne set was great and a big hit on father&#x27;s day</li>
    <li> A great variety of a true Men&#x27;s fragrances, also the cigar shaped bottles fit well in shaving kit when traveling.</li>
    <li> All good but the red one is sucks</li>
    <li> I love these colognes. I bought them for my husband and they smell great, they give him a nice variety.</li>
    <li> Two of these smell pretty good. Fresh, fragrant, deep smells. But, after 15 minutes, the scent is nearly gone. The last two, one is very mild, and the last will give you a major headache. Still, I give three stars because at its price, you can always ask your wife/girlfriend to carry it in her purse so you can re-apply as needed.</li>
    <li> i bought this last Oct just before going on my vacation. my friend highly recommended this hence bought it. the packaging was fool-proof &amp; absolutely loved the fragnance :D..Gifted 1 each to my relatives &amp; they simply can&#x27;t stop adoring it :D..Would be definitely buying it once again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like at all these fragrances, the one with the blue label and the one with the gold label were kind of decent, but the other two I didn&#x27;t like at all, so if you haven&#x27;t try these fragances you better try with something else.</li>
    <li> when i opened up the package. I was really surprised at the way they look. Good size and they look like real cigars.  Every last one of them smell really good. My woman tried to eat me alive (smile) You cant go wrong with this product. Thanks again Amazon</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e was dying to have these due to the fact that he has history with CUBA. He was ecstatic to receive these. They arrived before set time (which is pretty awesome). Great gift for The Men, would deffinetly buy more!!</li>
    <li> I bought Cuba Variety by Cuba for men to my husband. At first he tought it was cigars or chokolate but soon he found out what it really was. He was surprised of how good all four smells. The package is also unusual with 4 cigarshaped glassbottles.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a retired military I avoided odors for years.  In the field a soldier must avoid being easily detected.  Scented body products are common offenders.  Now that I am retired, I decided to look for products with an attractive scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuba Variety allowed me to test four scents. On my first test (a spray in the air), I did not like any of them.  They each reminded me of room fresheners  .Then I realized that any cologne will smell differently when it interacts with the human body.  So I tested each (one at a time over four days) and noted my reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Blue and the Red smelled to me like a sort of perfume and hence not as masculine as I wish.  The Gold smelled fine, but the odor  did not last long and reminded me of after shave.  The Orange lasted longer than the Gold, but smelled a bit like flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One concern may have effected my results.  I am disabled and not very active.&lt;br /&gt;Cuba Varity doesn&#x27;t work for me, but may work better for more active men.</li>
    <li> This cologne is good for those wanting to change it up sometimes... all the scents are good except for the red label... that one can easily be used as a manly air freshener though... has a little too much of a &amp;#34;Pine&amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; for me...</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my hubby. He likes all the different scents. So do I, because I can&#x27;t keep my hands off of him! And, the price for the four was a pretty good deal, too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as good as it did when I bought it in 06&#x27; but for $10 bucks who cares??? I do! This cologne does not last very long, I use the $4 old spice body sprays and they out last this product, this will be my last purchase. You&#x27;ll get longer lasting freshness out a bottle of BOD...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very original scents</li>
    <li> I WAS HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I really was happy with the pricing and the size of the cologne. I really like the box it came in. Will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I received it two days after I placed my order,well packed...The smell is very nice and the size is good...Smell lasts...For the price is a great purchase.4 stars because it&#x27;s not perfect but excellent.</li>
    <li> These would make a great gift. Awesome design and they smell wonderful...except maybe the blue one..it doesn&#x27;t smell as great. I ordered these and they arrived within 3 days! I&#x27;m thinking of buying 2 more for my brother and my dad.</li>
    <li> Cheap sh1t! In keyword Cuba cigar !! F@k I need real cigar not this piece of sh1t!</li>
    <li> My Dad loves cologne of any kind, so when I saw this on Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t resist. He loved the frangrance and felt emotional to see the cigars from his homeland.</li>
    <li> They smell surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> I LOVED HOW FAST I GOT THEM IN THE MAIL AND I LOVED THE PACKAGING. IT WAS A GOOD VALUE FOR ALL FOUR COLOGNES,THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Like it and at this  price it is recommended as you get 4 different fragrances , which are really good.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great gift for the men in your life.  Very high class, and impressive.  Therefore, I would strongly recommend the purchase of this product.  DAME HILDA</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY WITH DELIVERY &amp; PRODUCT</li>
    <li> my fav in this package is cuba red.makes me melt.enough said on that ,all the others smell verrrry well.cant go wrong on these no matter his age. You wont regret.</li>
    <li> thhis cologne  the very next  day and i used it so quick. all the cigar tubes have their own great smell. good cologne and came in incredible time</li>
    <li> I bought this gift based on the reviews I read and this is the perfect gift for the cigar lover. The items do smell wonderful, strong spice scent to them, not flowery at all. This collect also wears well, even after several hours of wearing my boyfriend still smells great.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles also closely resemble cigars and do no look cheesy! The bottles have a nice seal and spray out well.</li>
    <li> I have bought Cuba in the past for my hubby and son. It smells great and it arrived on time for Xmas!</li>
    <li> Cuba Variety by Cuba for Men was a big hit as a stocking stuffer this past Xmas.  It is a novelty item (Cuban cigars containing cologne) with nice scent.  Amusing and good value.</li>
    <li> this product is great each one smells great my personal favorite is red it has a great smell to it i would recommend this to any one</li>
    <li> Review Update - After wearing all the colognes, I am rating the product itself 2 stars. Fragrances might be good if they didn&#x27;t come off as mainly synthetic and alcohol based. The dry down is also the end of the fragrance. 1 hour MAX. Maybe 2 if someone has their nose on your skin. NOT the purpose of a fragrance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!!! PRIME 2-DAY SHIPPING DOES NOT APPLY!!! Yes, for those of us who are Prime customers, do not be fooled by the \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; logo next to the product. As you can see after you scroll down a little, the shipping is standard due to the product being labeled \\&quot;Hazardous Material\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Most of us who are \\&quot;Prime-Happy\\&quot; will probably just see the \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; logo and assume 2-day shipping. False. Amazon tricked me with this one. For the trickery, I rate Amazon (and thus the product) low.</li>
    <li> He&#x27;s not disappointed I gave this rating because this cologne is a Great bargain for 4 different Scents. They all smell Nice and I get many comments on what I might be wearing for that day. I have many choices from one day to the next. This product has met his Expectations! A friend of our has this Product and once I smelled them, I just had to have it for my husband. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Update March 23, 2014 his still loving this</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and great value I gave 2 to my brother and 2 to my moms boyfriend in their stocking! Win Win</li>
    <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends</li>
    <li> cuba is good brand. I take it as gift for my friend. but I think the package is normal and so so .</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, good aroma, and the packaged was really secured. Thinking about ordering another set just to have a backup. Good buy</li>
    <li> I PICKD ONE OF MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE. I LOVE THE SMELL ON HIM AND TO HAVE DIFFERENT ONES I LOVED IT.</li>
    <li> I got this for my stepfather for Father&#x27;s Day.  He loved it!!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Handy for travel, the Cuba Variety pack is also an excellent way to sample some of the various scents from Cuba at a reasonable price,and since I enjoy most of them and travel 200+ days a year, I&#x27;ve bought several, as well as larger sizes for home. I especially like the spicy Red, and the Brown and Gold wear well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m smelling good with this cuban cigars, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have problem with the smell I like it but the smell can&#x27;t stay longer enough, may be it will stay for 2 or 3 hours.</li>
    <li> These four colognes are very different. Cuba gold smells the best but, after 10 minutes you can&#x27;t smell it. Cuba orange has a long Longevity time and smells ok but smells cheap. Cuba blue and red are not worth the money. Red smells like bug spray and Blue spells like powdery perfume in my opinion. Nice bottles though.</li>
    <li> My husband was shocked when these came in the mail for him! But e couldn&#x27;t have asked for any better choices!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about buying cologne online without being able to smell it, but I am pleased with all four of these scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, it comes in cigar shape, so I should have known it would be awesome.</li>
    <li> All four I think smell like some old European guy who doesn&#x27;t shower. The red gold and orange all smell the same. The blue being the only one that doesn&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this if you&#x27;re into Armani Versace davidoff blue de Chanel etc. it literally smells like you&#x27;re rubbing different flavored cigars on your body.</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled to receive this.  And I am thrilled when he wears it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of all four fragrances but ONLY TWO of them work properly&lt;br /&gt;You actually get a finger work out to get them to spray</li>
    <li> its worth a buy. gift for my dad and he loves it</li>
    <li> So my rankings are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Red&lt;br /&gt;2. Gold&lt;br /&gt;3. Orange&lt;br /&gt;4. Blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red is the one I get the most compliments on.  The more I spray the more women like it. Gold is the first one I had and it is still good.  Orange smells good and the girls think so too but they aren&#x27;t jumping to tell me when I wear it.  Blue is ok.  Blue is the closest to all the other colognes that would be classified as day colognes or sporty or whatever.  I don&#x27;t like it that much but I&#x27;m sure it is still good.  These are the only colognes I own but they are great.</li>
    <li> So I got this for my husband and took the chance without knowing what they smell like. My husband and myself really like all of them except for the red one but 3 out of 4 isn&#x27;t bad. I gave it 3 stars because we didn&#x27;t like all the scents but the price and shipping were fabulous. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrances inexpensive and smell great</li>
    <li> It is smells good, and the price is so cheap.</li>
    <li> Thought these were real cigars upon ordering. Damn my over ambitious one click buying ass. Had i spent two seconds reading what it was i wouldn&#x27;t have ended up with 4 boxes of this.</li>
    <li> These kind of smell like an old rich man that hangs out at a country club bar all day, but who is good looking and can pick up ladies, if ya get my drift?</li>
    <li> Really nice, they smell so good I like it</li>
    <li> Great for gifts , two have the same scent</li>
    <li> I discovered the Cuba perfumes for men about two years ago around the holidays, the one I purchased as a gift was the cream/yellow sticker one for my lover and I loved the scent...he too really liked it and after that I could never find it again!!! So after a little digging around town for them and to no avail I gave up on trying to buy anymore until I was on Amazon one night and it came t mind so searched on Amazon and, not only did I find the one I had gotten him for he holidays, But I discovered that there is a men&#x27;s line of the Cuba Originals...I had no idea!!! well I took a gamble by only knowing of one scent and I decided to purchase the gift pack of the 4 different ones....well the gamble paid off and I am a big winner! The other three scents are great too! at least by smelling them from the bottle...now even though a,perfume may smell great in the bottle that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s going to smell good on the person....I think certain people wear certain perfumes in different ways then the next and so we&#x27;ll have to see how well my lover wears them. I think all four scents are very nice and I believe he&#x27;ll be able to wear them all. You get four different kinds and they are 35 ml or 1.17 ounces per bottle. The packaging was nice and they arrived on time. I&#x27;d highly recommend the fellas to give them a try and see what you think. Ladies if,your into your partner wearing nice smelling perfumes definitely get your man some Cuba Original. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone who likes to wear perfume.</li>
    <li> I personally really liked the orange and gold. They where a bit different and yet had a DIY of a unique quality to them. Blue I couldn&#x27;t stand it smelled like a fake Forrest to me. Red smelled like a fifty year old European should be wearing it. Though my brother liked the blue and didn&#x27;t mind the red. I guess it&#x27;s all preference. At this price you&#x27;re sure to get something you&#x27;ll like and they&#x27;re great for traveling or gym bags. The lasted 5-6 hours for me on skin. On clothes all day.</li>
    <li> Had a friend who used to wear this and I loved it then. Still do!</li>
    <li> This is a nice variety of scents. I purchased it for my son for Christmas. A really nice gift for a good price.</li>
    <li> This Cuba variety is something I will most likely buy again.  I have already decided I like the gold the best and will purchase a large one.  The others are also very good and will probably get bigger versions of all of them.  Can&#x27;t wait to give them as gifts to family members.  I only give things I love as gifts.  Purchase with this vendor was great.  Good price, prompt delivery and well packaged.</li>
    <li> You can individually wrap them as stocking stuffers. A variety of phenomenal masculine scents. Affordable price &amp; cute cigar like container. Simply love it!</li>
    <li> My dad had this in 2004, I have been looking for it ever since then but didn&#x27;t know which one it was so I ordered this set, after trying all four I easily identified the Cuban blue as the one I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product, delivery was fast and I like the fact that you have a variety of fragrances to choose from, I will recommended this product to others and may even purchase another one as a gift for someone. I like the cuba line of fragrances, they smell musky, mature and really last!!</li>
    <li> Terrible smell, and look. Wish i could return it but they don&#x27;t allow it....Would not waste my money again on this purchase</li>
    <li> MISTAKE!!!&lt;br /&gt;My brother sent these to my husband by mistake, thinking they were real cigars. What a NICE mistake, indeed! These smell great and I love them all on my husband. They smell like the expensive brands he keeps for date night and the office. It&#x27;s on par with the CK I buy him for $60.</li>
    <li> The blue label cigar and the black label cigar both smell really great. The other two (orange and red) smell like alcohol. Worth the money I guess.</li>
    <li> This product is great. My favorite scent is the one with the gold band and I always get compliments when I wear it. I mean honestly without fail. Also, for the price who wouldn&#x27;t want this in their collection?</li>
    <li> Great price for all four of them, they smell really good and their size is normal size. My husband loves them</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve been held prisoner at a Cuban tobacco plantation as the result of a business misunderstanding involving expensive cigars and the validity of supposed &amp;#34;blood diamonds&amp;#34; (my ass). I can&#x27;t complain too much, though; The food&#x27;s plenty and the people are nice enough for kidnappers. Anywho, there&#x27;s this girl who lives just out on the other side of the village that I&#x27;ve had the hots for. She&#x27;s the hottest danged Cuban chica I&#x27;ve ever seen, let me tell ya. I wanted to see her but I was conscientious about my appearance and presence. I have the suit I was wearing when I went to the &amp;#34;business meeting&amp;#34; and all, so aside from the dirt and sweat stains on it and me, I&#x27;m set in that regard. But I smelled something awful. The shower water here is hard and makes you smell worse than when you step in. I wanted to buy myself cologne but my captors confiscate it whenever I try to hide it. Then I found this product. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, really. It fit my needs perfectly. The bottles look just like cigars so I can easily hide it within the caches of stogies on the plantation. Not only that, but they all smell really nice, too. I&#x27;m going to put on the blue one tonight and I&#x27;ll head over to her house &#x27;round midnight so as to avoid detection from the guards. Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> this was ordered on accident. I thought thy were real cigars. That was my fault, but the cologn really stinks</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  One container is under TSA requirements so its easy to travel with</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf, he loves the scent. The gold an blue is his favorite.</li>
    <li> Very nice set ,did not think the set was going to be that nice .,would order again . Great stocking stuffer and all the sprays smell really good .</li>
    <li> The pack is a very welcome part of my collection</li>
    <li> My father loves this!</li>
    <li> Very good product but I like the one with the orange seal</li>
    <li> Which is better...box for show or scent? You decide. Good value regardless.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my dad for Christmas.  He smokes cigars and loves cologne and I thought this would be a great gift. . . . He LOVED it!  I was a little worried about the novelty of it but they were a hit.  I enjoyed each scent and the cigar shaped bottles are just fun.</li>
    <li> Great for small present for a man.  I got this for my son for Christmas, and I did not receive it until well into January which was over a month after I ordered.  That was during the UPS debacle and bad weather events.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a relative, and they enjoyed it so much, I bought one for myself.  Have enjoyed all of the scents, only issue I have is that they do not seem to last too long. Other than that, would have no problem trying more of their product.</li>
    <li> They are all good so just pick your favorite. Each has a distinct aroma that is fresh and not overbearing</li>
    <li> My boyfriend thought they were great and I love the way he smells!</li>
    <li> First bought this at a cigar shop in Ybor City! Was so glad to find it again along with all the other varieties ...they are all superb!</li>
    <li> Great for small gifts for men! Used for Xmas for the men with tshirt and it was a perfect gift.</li>
    <li> You will love the scents in this variety pack they all smell amazing and you will definitely want to pick up a large version the gold and red cuba cologne.</li>
    <li> Excellent ! Seriously 5/5</li>
    <li> Brought these as a gift for my son and he loves them. I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> My Boss really enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> use them for a car fragrance........</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these for my Uncles as gifts this year. Last year, I purchased a set for my boyfriend, he likes all but one of the scents, which he describes as an &#x27;old man&#x27; smell. I disagree, I think they all smell nice. It&#x27;d be better if the set came inside a more durable case, opening and closing the paper case it comes in ruins it over time. I used one of our Jim Beam rocks glasses as a holder on the dresser/ counter.</li>
    <li> I love every smell from this 4 pack, the only one I didn&#x27;t really like was the blue one because it smells like an air freshner like febreeze.</li>
    <li> Gifts for brother loves recommend good product</li>
    <li> Nice sampler of affordable cologne.  My nose picks up a couple of the fragrances better than others and some seem to last more than others but that might just be my nose.</li>
    <li> Great to try all smells.</li>
    <li> This product gives you four good sents for your everyday life.</li>
    <li> Been using this cologne for as long as I can remember. Its perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I should probably buy a truck load full of this stuff incase some evil person out there somewhere decides to discontinue this product.&lt;br /&gt;Hhhmmm. Good call. Great job me! ^-^/</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for my son for Christmas because it had decent ratings and was very inexpensive.  I really liked the Gold scent best.  I would rate it five stars if the scent lasted.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I bout this set for my hubby and only one smells good! This stuff smells like cigars in a tube nasty!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for all the sons in our family.  They all seemed to enjoy this!  Everyone had a different favorite scent!</li>
    <li> I love these scents, I will be buying more and more of this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really digging these scents. They&#x27;re not for everyone and some of the scents are clearly better than the others. They last longer than colognes I&#x27;ve paid $70 dollars for. Great value.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Valentines day present for my fiance and he absolutely loved it! This is his favorite brand of cologne and this is a super inexpensive product! Just be careful, it does break easily since it is glass. He put it on his dresser and it fell on the floor. But hey, made his room smell good!</li>
    <li> The Blue has a hint of my Prada Lunna Rossa but it&#x27;s soft (doesn&#x27;t Project well). I actually sprayed over ten sprays on me, I didn&#x27;t smell that much. The next evening I sprayed only twice on my wrist and I could still smell it the next day; it lasts, it&#x27;s just not that strong.  Cuba is not knockoffs, it&#x27;s quality made in France by the House Of Cuba.  A lot of the Cubas are low sillage, they&#x27;re not strong but they last! If you want everybody to smell you Cuba has a couple that&#x27;ll work (the orange, red &amp; Cuba&#x27;s Brazil work pretty good for that but I&#x27;ve only tried 11 so far. However, a lot of Cuba is for the intimate or those sitting close! Lastly, I think how Cuba is keeping the price low is most of fragrances I&#x27;ve tried so far are singular;  they smell of quality, just not a lot of depth and as soon as the carrier burns off it holds the same scent throughout the dry down! My top shelves I own are G. Guilty Intense,  D. Fuel For Life,  Prada Luna Rossa,  Drakkar &amp; Escada Magnetism. About five knockoffs (I&#x27;ve learned, save your money) and 11 Cuba&#x27;s thus far.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible and is a waste of money. They do not accept returns due to it being perfume. I tossed this in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love it, ordered and recieved 24hrs later!! Product in brand new condition, and as described.</li>
    <li> This is a bad review of a bad product. OK, I originally thought these were actual cigars and not some kind of cologne. Call me stupid. When I realized it was cologne, the order had already been placed and I thought OK I will re-gift them for Christmas or something. That was until I opened the package and accidently dropped one of the containers on my hardwood kitchen floor where it shattered. Not only did it stink, it took off the top layer of polish off my floor. I had to use a putty scrapper to get the worst of it off. Now I have to re-clean and re-polish the floor. Even after I showered, the scent wore on. Now it&#x27;s on my sheets as well. Good thing today is wash day. Hopefully that will work on the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the labeling and packaging were extremely misleading. This is a sucker&#x27;s purchase, and I hope this review will dissuade others that don&#x27;t always read the very fine print.</li>
    <li> Phew... smells like my grandpas vloset and cheap nabrers aftershave stinks</li>
    <li> not bad carry in my car in the console dosent last a long time but I still like the package...</li>
    <li> My buddy had bought one and I smelled it and fell in love soo that night I went on amazon and punched it in &amp; bought this 4 pack &amp; I tell u what I like (all) the (smell goods) that I purchased and looking now for different smells (thanks amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Again</li>
    <li> It was a big hit after we discovered that they were not cigars.&lt;br /&gt;A good laugh was had by all.</li>
    <li> My husband had bought these earlier just to try the fragrance of a not so costly perfume..&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the smell and the size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So when I was going to my hometown and had to get some gifts which dont hurt my pocket too much, I got like 10 boxes of these.&lt;br /&gt;The blue and gold fragrances are particularly good.&lt;br /&gt;It says \\&quot;Men\\&quot; but the fragrance is more or less unisex. Its not too strong or not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Its size is actually a plus for me.. since I can keep it my handbag and use it whenever I want. I gifted some to my friends and even they like to keep it in their bags rather than carrying a bulky deo spray or a roll on.&lt;br /&gt;There is a variant of this which comes in a tin cylinder, but its a single piece so I prefer this one over it.&lt;br /&gt;But advantage of that one is, you can even gift a single one, instead of the whole box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that was not so great was the pump of the spray.. I had to press it hard to get some good amount of perfume. But I dont want to reduce the rating because of that, as it could just be the case with my bottle.</li>
    <li> Almost all of them smell very good.</li>
    <li> The colognes were bigger than I expected and they smell amazing! My boyfriend wanted some good smelly stuff for Christmas, so I thought this was a good option because it gave variety.</li>
    <li> The gold label is a little feminine however the blue label was well worth buying all four. The blue label is a light and refreshing scent. The red and orange are pretty much indistinguishable.</li>
    <li> This was Cologne and not cigars but the recipient of the gift liked them a lot anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my husband for Christmas taking a chance (never smelled the colognes before). For a modestly priced cologne set, I was pleasantly surprised. The scents are far from &#x27;cheap&#x27; smelling, and are long lasting.</li>
    <li> Always have the woman asking me alot of questions on the days I put on any of the scents of cuba that came in the pack..........</li>
    <li> Make your purchase from Venezuela through Liberty Express the product was placed in a recent international mailbox in Venezuela could receive one of the perfumes is Broken, sorry I can not rate this product, not where claim.</li>
    <li> THIS IS FOR TRUE MEN. these colonge is the manliest colonge ever made in Man kind.  It smells so awsome. And I where it everywhere I go. BUY THIS STUFF</li>
    <li> Think  today of some expensive sets , &#x27;&#x27;CUBA&#x27;&#x27; prove are the best and practic anywhere we go .</li>
    <li> Great smell I would purchase again and again for my husband I love how it smells on him.</li>
    <li> I love the suttle sent of cigar mixed with a manly sent. I like that it has more than one fragrance and the price was very good. Ladies get you man some</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the womens perfume made by this same company and I definitely love the way it smells on her. So I thought I&#x27;d check out this variety set and see if she loved the mens version on me. She says she likes them all, but the blue one is her absolute favorite. So I&#x27;ll probably just buy that one from now on. Still I am glad I tried them all so I could find the perfect one!</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto, excelente presentacion recomiendo para otras compras a mi familia vere que otros producyo tiene este vendedor gracias</li>
    <li> Smells great. Well pleased</li>
    <li> Stick with Cuba Gold. I am not a cologne guy but someone bought me Cuba Gold one time and I always liked it. When I say they had other scents, I thought It might be fun to try them. Unfortunately they all smell terrible.</li>
    <li> I have been given this for three years and decided to pick up some extra. I found this on Amazon and got four tubes for the price of one in retail store cant beat the price and recieved in good shape.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the smells initially they are strong when applied but they mellow out real quick. I am also 26 and these smells make me think Grandpa.</li>
    <li> agradables y variados olores de acuerdo  a la ocasion. ideal para los hombres que les guste oler muy bien. lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad and well Amazon was careful with it considering it came 100% perfect no damages.</li>
    <li> One of the (red) it&#x27;s HORRIBLE smells like aold folks home for pimps</li>
    <li> Beautiful collection of different Fragrances, Strong scent and lasts Long</li>
    <li> Fragrance don&#x27;t last long but smells good.</li>
    <li> bought as a gift he loved it</li>
    <li> this will be a christmas present for my son in law.  i can&#x27;t wait to watch him grab his lighter.  lol  my daughter will not let him smoke.  when he finds out it is cologne......</li>
    <li> the Blue bottle was cracked and most of the cologne had leaked out. The other three bottles were fine. good scents.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim for my husband simply because I liked the packaging.  Boy was I surprised, they smell great! Even my my boss who is a cologne junkie loved these and wants me to buy him some. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The blue and the gold smell good</li>
    <li> wow. I love this stuff. 4 great scents that will last  for a bit. Similar but each different.</li>
    <li> My husband loves them-reminds him of his grandfather</li>
    <li> I am writing this approximately 20 minutes after opening the package. Overall, I am very satisfied with the scents and product. I am not an expert in cologne, but here&#x27;s how I perceive the four fragrances:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order of best to worst (though none of them were terrible):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. BLUE - Similar to a common, standard, and reliable scent that you&#x27;d find at Macy&#x27;s. In other words, as soon as I smelled it, I felt that I had smelled it before. That&#x27;s not a bad thing in my opinion since a cologne represents you and you want to avoid really off-the-path scents. Even though the scent was common, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. (TIE) ORANGE and GOLD - GOLD is also Macy&#x27;s-ish but a little more unique. I&#x27;d say it has a slightly \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; scent (hard to explain) and it also reminds me of a food scent I can&#x27;t seem to place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORANGE - is more light, citrus-y, and has some other tone that I just can&#x27;t place. It is probably the most uni-sex scent of the bunch. It&#x27;s more unique than GOLD or BLUE and I keep finding myself going back to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. RED - I&#x27;d place this one last, but not because it&#x27;s bad. It&#x27;s just strong and musty. My first impression was that I didn&#x27;t like it, but after a few more goes, I determined it&#x27;s something I would wear (just not as often as the other three). I see this one as a riskier play; a more polarizing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, one of the spays (GOLD) wouldn&#x27;t spray at first. I had to keep pressing it, but all that would come out where heavy drop of the cologne. I actually gave up, but when I went back to it later to make a better tester, it started working. All four sprays have a look of high quality (stickers and caps) and come in nice glass shaped cigars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this after my wife smells them (I won&#x27;t tell her I&#x27;m testing them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife liked all of the scents. However, I would now place Blue first, then Red, then Gold, then Orange. But again, it&#x27;s all subjective. I would knock this product down to 4 stars, because it SEEMS (could be wrong) that the fragrances don&#x27;t last more than 8 hours or so.ive.

    <li> Normally i dont write reviews but this product is really good that i thought of reviewing it.&lt;br /&gt;It come as set of 4 all of them are good but the blue one is Okay not excellent.All other ones are really good and comes handy for travel</li>
    <li> where are the products that zoom miami q told me I communicate with you to where they left the order</li>
    <li> This was for my uncle who loves to bathe himself in cologne. This was a nice bundle that carried different scents. Smells nice and was a great price.</li>
    <li> Classy package, creative design, four scents all suitable for men. I would recommend it as a good gift for someone who could use cologne but does not have very specific preference for scents~</li>
    <li> I love the smell of sweet tobacco and what could be better than a cologne with the scrumptious smell without the dangers of sweet tobacco? :)  I love this cologne!</li>
    <li> Make sure people know this is perfume (cologne).  We have a good laugh on Christmas morning when we realized that it was not cigars, but was cologne.</li>
    <li> A variety of Cuba fragrences for a teenage boy. He can wear a different one each day. For a social function, he actually sprayed a little of each one and made his own blended fragrence.They all sell delicious. No funky aftersmell that is usual in mens fragrences. Very fresh.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get some new scents for my husband to try. I had heard that Cuba Cigar was a good scent. This product gave me the opportunity to try 4 varieties. It was a great purchase. All 4 are similar with subtle under tones of spice. Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Great deal and great buy. The owners got the products to me in a timely fashion and I will continue to do business with them.</li>
    <li> Fun little gift; you can split them up among guys. Nice scents.</li>
    <li> This cologne is more than what I expected</li>
    <li> MY PICTURE TAKING PROPS!!!  GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I should&#x27;ve read the description closer.  It is NOT actual cigars, it&#x27;s perfume.  not at all what I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> Was a very good experience.  We use them again.</li>
    <li> My father uses Cuba religiously! I decided to buy this set for Christmas for him it looks fun and the price is very cool!</li>
    <li> All four of them are good, Gold being the best.</li>
    <li> This is manly stuff - it ain&#x27;t for girls! And I&#x27;ve got to say, Cubans have a wonderful sense of smell.</li>
    <li> Ive had this for about 3months now and the fragrance just keeps lasting, and it come in 4 variety so you have plenty of options to choose from. Cuba is the deal</li>
    <li> My Husband is very happy with this purchase, He really likes this Cuba, and wants for me to buy more for him I am happy you have this item, It arrived before the estimated date of arrival, we love this item and will continue to purchase from you, and will surely recommend to our family and friends.....Thank you....</li>
    <li> Very nice ...I like them</li>
    <li> tried this on a whim. Very happy with how they smell and the price. will buy this again and got to my house QUICK</li>
    <li> Great for travelers.  My husband likes a variety of his foo foo spray and these are nice fragrances.</li>
    <li> All my boys loved the scents and thought  they were getting cigars, that was funny.</li>
    <li> I love these colognes! They were gifted from my aunt last Christmas, 2013. I never wore cologne very much growing up, and being in my late twenties I was totally comfortable with that. These varieties of scents just compliment me in every social situation. The red and the orange sent are both light and crisp for maybe a day at work or running errands. While both the gold and blue are both more sexy and husky scents, the gold rings more &amp;#34;sex you down&amp;#34; where the blue rings more &amp;#34;I want to wake up with you in the morning&amp;#34; -- perfect opposites for meeting and greeting😉.&lt;br /&gt;These scents are the best. I still have a lot left after almost a year, and they&#x27;re the perfect size to throw one in my pocket for when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
    <li> My hubby and I both liked the scents. Lasts, at least on him.</li>
    <li> My father may he rest in peace used this they smell just like him</li>
    <li> My son loves all the scents. I like that none of them make him smell &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;. Great product and so inexpensive!!</li>
    <li> I smell like a god. Just kidding, but seriously these smells are strong, and will not disappoint you.&lt;br /&gt;My ratings of the smells&lt;br /&gt;1. Red - Its the strongest (to me)&lt;br /&gt;2. Gold - Very fresh smell&lt;br /&gt;3. Blue - Smells like amazing soap&lt;br /&gt;4. Black - Meh</li>
    <li> A well packaged fun gift for the guy in your life!  I&#x27;m unable to comment on the individual cologne scents until I receive feedback from the recipient.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this and let me tell you he is the pickiest man ever i always hesitate to buy him any cologne but he loved and asked me to order him another :) recommend for your husband</li>
    <li> Edit: I wrote this review nearly three years ago when I was first getting into fragrances. Now, I have over 60 quality bottles, designer and niche, in my collection. I have probably put over $10,000 into my hobby, buying and selling and buying some more. Cuba Gold is still magnificent. In reading my past review, it seems almost juvenile regarding how excited I got about these fragrances compared to what I have now, but I stand by it. Cuba Gold can go head to head with my vintage bottle of Amouage Reflection. I sold the other three, they&#x27;re worthless to me. Gold, however, still gets me tons of compliments, and, more importantly, I still enjoy it. It&#x27;s definitely not my favorite, but whenever I wear it I&#x27;m amazed at how underrated in my collection it is. Cuba Gold is truly a special fragrance and absolutely worth its great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM 2013 FOLLOWS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, $12 for four fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really impressed me. I am a collector of colognes/fragrances, and I am happy I bought this set. These look great on my shelf with their extremely unique bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this set for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first reason I bought this set was for the pure novelty. Just look at them! Cigar shaped bottles, very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason I bought them was purely for Cuba Gold. Cuba Gold has been compared to Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier. I love wearing Le Male, but it&#x27;s an expensive fragrance. So why not wear it for nearly 1/5 of the price? And along with that, I get three other fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third reason I bought this set was for the value. 4 fragrances for $12, which comes out to about $3 each. I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, which fragrances smell the best?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold: This fragrance has been compared to Le Male. I understand the similarity. It is very similar to Le Male. However, it is more subtle and there is less of a cinnamon note in Cuba Gold than there is in Le Male. Very soothing scent, and it has lasted anywhere from 5-8 hours on my skin. Smell: 9/10. Longevity: 5-8 hours. Projection: 6/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orange: This is a very citrusy scent, but surprisingly long lasting. It lasted about 4-6 hours on my skin. It smells like Sunny D. Smell: 5.5/10. Longevity: 4-6 hours. Projection: 5/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red: Tobacco. This is Cuba&#x27;s tobacco fragrance. Definitely the most mature smelling of the bunch. This is definitely a winter scent and not everyone can pull it off. Some people have compared the smell to Burberry London, but I don&#x27;t get that at all. This is a harsh tobacco fragrance, but not entirely displeasing. I wear it every now and then.  Smell: 5/10. Longevity: 6-8 hours. Projection: 6/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue: I never wore this fragrance. It smells very similar to Chrome by Azzaro, which I also have. However, this fragrance is harsher in the opening and smells a lot &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; than Chrome. With that being said, it is a summer fragrance. Since I never wore this fragrance, I can only rate the opening smell at 4/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Cuba Gold is the best. But why not buy the value set? It makes a great novelty, and the price simply cannot be beat. These are quality fragrances. I would have paid $20-25 for this box set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy/Try/Pass: This ranks as a definite buy.lasted anywhere from 5-8 hours on my skin. Smell: 9/10. Longevity: 5-8 hours.

    <li> I was looking for something other than the run-of-the-mill, and not expensive....and Cuba is both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 pack variety box looks like a Cuban cigar box...and even remotely smells of fine, cured tobacco...but these are genuine French colognes that will satisfy the wearer and those who come into contact with him.</li>
    <li> Only 1 out of 4 smelled good. The packaging and containers are neat though. My husband actually thought I bought him cigars for Chritmas.</li>
    <li> Some of the best scents I have purchased and I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift all the scents are great. I got it in just a few days after I order it I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> well received this and one of the vials was broke and I cannot return it due to amazons policies and box is differant then pictured&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so now I cannot return or get a refund or exchange as I cannot find anywhere to contact anyone about this. so money down the drain</li>
    <li> I have GOLD which is 1 of my favorite &amp; the BLUE 1 which is my least favorite but the other two broke on delivery the glass is very fragile but I did call supposedly getting a refund haven&#x27;t seen it yet though glass was everywhere in the box and the box smelled great</li>
    <li> Yes they look nice, but nooo they don&#x27;t smell good</li>
    <li> I am a cologne guy.  I know what I like and what my lady likes.  I tried all four of these scents.  I got a good review from my queen and that is what counts.</li>
    <li> My baby son loves Cuba spray.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I always like the smell of Cuba for men. Good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> smells great but when i got the package silver was broken and poured out everywhere, great collogne for the price just watch out for the thin bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th time I&#x27;m buying this.....&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a great product.....</li>
    <li> My son loved the design, packaging, and smell of these colognes they were an awesome gift, I received them ahead of time and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order from your company again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for such wonderful service.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing ,get complements all the time on it</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling cologne and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend it.  I like trying the different fragrences in this package. I like the gold one the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Vietnam Vet totally 120% disabled  but the VA takes excellent care of me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And back to Cuba  that is one of best bargains on here so  go ahead try all Four fragrances.  you will love them&lt;br /&gt;all....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about Amazon  well I am adicted to Amazon.com  i buy everything here..  Amazing Amazon.com  you gotta love it...</li>
    <li> This cologne smells fantastic and I love the size and shape, easy to throw in a car or briefcase, so pleased!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks</li>
    <li> These look like cigars but are not. I thought I was sending a cigar sampler and instead got cologne. And...it&#x27;s not returnable so I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was worried that because of the price they weren&#x27;t going to be good qualitity but I was wrong! Got it for a Christmas gift for my brother and really do love the different smells and box packaging. Its a great gift for any young adult boy (my brother is college age) and not too expensive if they end up breaking a bottle or not using it! Great to travel with too! Highly recommend! Also, it came very fast.</li>
    <li> They smell like s***.</li>
    <li> Hit with 20 year old son.</li>
    <li> Product came faster then expected and I really like the cologne.</li>
    <li> excelente buen producto</li>
    <li> it looks very cheap and smell too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I sent it to a friend for a gift. it is too shame.</li>
    <li> They all smell good but the best ones were the blue one brown and red. The orange one smells a little weird.</li>
    <li> This is a cool set. It has four different scents in containers that look like a mini cigar. I believe they all smell great.</li>
    <li> this cologne smells like ass one really smells like bad BO. and the rest are just bad wouldnt recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I purchased the product too quickly, I was trying to get last minute Christmas gifts and didn&#x27;t fully read the description, so this is not a product I would have bought.  Totally my fault, so I&#x27;m not complaining about the product.  Actually, it smells good.  If I had to complain it would be that once I received the product and realized it wasn&#x27;t what I thought, I then wasn&#x27;t allowed to return the product because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;hazard&amp;#34;.  Apparently, you can&#x27;t send back liquid items because it could be dangerous....  Again, TOTALLY my fault, so I&#x27;m ok with only spending $15 for a gift I won&#x27;t use.  It&#x27;s my punishment</li>
    <li> I purchased the product too quickly, so this is not a product I would have bought. Totally my fault, so I&#x27;m not complaining about the product. But, this product can not be returned!</li>
    <li> Was very surprised by the fragrances. They are all different, they are all very nice. I like this product a lot!</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone and I must say it really smells so good and it is also a noticeable scent too : )</li>
    <li> Good Buy..Cute dispenser ..I liked 2outta 4 fragrance. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are high quality..nor was I leaping outta my clothes aybthe smell!! My husband didn&#x27;t much likem they went under the sink. But for money its ok.</li>
    <li> 1 fragrance good, 1 ok at best and 2 are the worst smelling thing EVER!</li>
    <li> My husband gave these to his groomsmen as a gift!  They loved that there were 4 scents in there and all of them smelled really good!  You definitely can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> Amazing cologne. I would order again when I run out</li>
    <li> I gave these to my boyfriend for Valentines day and he loves them.  I love the fragrances on him and he has had fun trying different ones on different days.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am gonna give each one as separate gifts.  So 4 gifts for 12 bucks is not a bad deal at all  :)&lt;br /&gt;Hope they like them as much as I do</li>
    <li> yes I like the smell of Cuba colognes I first bought some when I was out in Vegas and after I received my product I ordered a bigger bottle of the Cuba gold and also another small container of Cuba  orange I think it is a very great deal for the price and I love the free shipping I will order one more bottle of Cuba I&#x27;ll probably order the Cuba red No I&#x27;m sure I will order the Cuba red Thanks it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift.  It&#x27;s exactly as described.  The cologne has a light clean smelling scent.</li>
    <li> Cute design, good idea, but, very stinky. Made me sneeze when my husband wore it.</li>
    <li> Now this is the truth: people receive you differently (better) when you&#x27;re wearing this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Two of them aren&#x27;t so hot, but then there are the other two... WOW. Women in church love to hug ya, and my wife stands closer and sits closer to me when I&#x27;m wearing these colognes. Boys, you gotta get some, and for the price- you can&#x27;t go wrong. WARNING: only two sweeping passes as you spray, because a little goes a loooong way.</li>
    <li> I gave this rating because this cologne is a Great bargain for 4 different Scents. They all smell Nice and I get many comments on what I might be wearing for that day. I have many choices from one day to the next. This product has met my Expectations! A friend of mine has this Product and once i smelled them, I just had to have it for myself!</li>
    <li> Great just cheap and smells good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother he loves it.</li>
    <li> For the Price and variety of fragrances offered... You really have a winner in this assortment of Decent mens colognes.  Buy it once and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.. everyone that I have shared these fragrances with seem to really like most of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten this pack at least 3 times in the past 2 years.  I gave a couple of the glass cigar atomizers away because friends loved them.</li>
    <li> I got it on time. It was a gift for someone and they liked it. I got exactly what was shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> sooo happy with this. smells really good.</li>
    <li> I was given Amazon gift cards for this past Christmas...I wanted to try a new fragrance ...so I picked a four pack of Cubans...lol..&lt;br /&gt;These are great scents..&lt;br /&gt;This are all glass bottles with spray pump tips and nice caps...&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with all four scents...the orange is my favourite&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 1/30/2015&lt;br /&gt;I must tell my Amazon co shoppers that I always get asked&lt;br /&gt;What is the name of the fragrance I am using&lt;br /&gt;Because they love the smell...nice</li>
    <li> As you would expect, these do not last for hours like the regular colonge, but damn they sure smell the same. 4 1oz bottles for $8 is really good, considering they only lasted me a few months, i perfer Cuba Blue. They usually last abou an hour if you are in a confined space, and about 20mins if you are outside. Would reccomend for somebody who wants this as a sampler</li>
    <li> Out of the four scents only one doesnt make me gag, I cant even remember which one it is because its at work and doesnt get used much</li>
    <li> Nice, clean scents. Great add-on gifts too!</li>
    <li> Hey its a cheap cologne and you can tell when wearing it. Maybe like one of the four scents but really dont plan on using this much more. Would recommend shelling out even 30 dollars for a half decent smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my fiance for Valentines Day. He thought the cigar bottle was fun and the scents were nice. He has been taking one when he travels for work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how you can go wrong with this.  Cute packaging, great price, 4 great scents!  My fiance loves it.</li>
    <li> Hate it but could not return.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return it, I was told that it is a flammable product so I had to deposed it accordingly...</li>
    <li> I like this colone because it comes separately packaged, easy to travel with smells really nice and mild. My wife likes it too.</li>
