      <li>That&#x27;s nice to know.</li>
      <li>, yes the dog now has his own ER GS 60s clipper...</li>

      <li>More correctly, my son gives it 5 stars but not because he cuts his hair with it..  </li>
      <li>life could be slightly better</li>
      <li>it did ok.</li>
      <li>The 1-10mm in 1mm increments was what made this product for me, since most clippers at this price either have no 1mm setting, or use 2mm increments.</li>

      <li>am completely satisfied with this product and plan to purchase more of them as gifts to grandsons this</li>

      <li>Much better than the charging cords of the others I have owned.  </li>
      <li>It is actually one of the best hair clippers I have ever owned.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Zero complaints. Good power, even trim, easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> This clipper would not charge after only two months. Worthless</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I like the multiple heights  and easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> Fantastic; great wet-dry option; excellent hair clipper; exactly what I have been looking for for years; and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Decent clipper that works in wet/dry modes but, could be cheaper</li>
    <li> More correctly, my son gives it 5 stars but not because he cuts his hair with it..  It&#x27;s ok for hair cutting; but my son shaves with it and loves it.  I bought it to cut my bedridden husband&#x27;s hair.  It gets the job done; but I could use a few more length options.</li>
    <li> The adjustable guard broke....and not from anything I did as far as I know. Not particularly useful anymore.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. Really need to keep working on my hair to cut it.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Panasonic ER-GS60-S because the website states that it is AC 100-240V (Automatic International Dual Voltage Conversion) but after opening it I discovered it is only 110-120V.&lt;br /&gt;http://shop.panasonic.com/personal-care/mens-shavers-and-grooming/mens-beard-hair-trimmers/ER-GS60-S.html?sc_mc&#x3D;sem_google-search_cov_beauty_brand_product</li>
    <li> since my husband passed away on 12/31/2014 and I can&#x27;t return this product, i want be able to use this product and it will be a sore in my side forever.</li>
    <li> this product by panasonic is great .. smooth performance and superb battery backup .. i charge it fully one time and can use it for more than 5 - 6 times for trimming ..</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as advertised. Excellent for keeping your hair short and clean!</li>
    <li> Broke in less than 3 months.</li>
    <li> I decided to cut my hair for the first time, and i was impressed with ease of use.  I had a 5 or 6 inch bush, and i cut it down to 4mm.&lt;br /&gt;You will need to run the cutter through your hair about 5 or 6 times to get even length. and you will also need to remove the attachment so you can take the hair out. otherwise it wont cut as well. Overall im impressed. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a barber or a hair stylist. I would not have thought it possible for me to cut my husband&#x27;s hair in a way that would make it look as good as a haircut from a barbershop or salon. But I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers go from 1 to 10. I used the 7 setting to cut his hair all around by pushing the clippers mostly upward, and I took off the plastic part at the top and used the 1 setting to create a straight line at the base of his neck. It was so quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers can also be used to trim a short beard or to get rid of unwanted body hair. The 1 setting leaves a little bit of stubble, so if you want a smooth shave, use a razor or shaver afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like we&#x27;ll be saving a lot on haircuts for my husband and son from here on out.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is very easy to use on wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just set the attachments at the preferred length. You don&#x27;t have to be a barber to give yourself a pretty decent crew cut or close cropped haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should pay for itself with the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price and really easy to use are it&#x27;s best attributes.</li>
    <li> Great clipper! Haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet (3 months?) and I trim my hair every couple weeks on 3 mm setting. Cuts evenly and quickly, great product.</li>
    <li> Works great for shaving my head.  I use it about every other week (in the shower) and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> great product.  would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> it shavs, but it has multiple draw backs:&lt;br /&gt;- charging base, one more thing to back while traveling, and it is too big&lt;br /&gt;- charging station rated at 120v, while i asked before buying and answers I got was 240, and the the panasonic site says 240v also&lt;br /&gt;- proprietary charging base; you can not even buy additional cables&lt;br /&gt;- without the head it does not shave close enough, i tried and had hairs too long, much longer than 3 mm&lt;br /&gt;- charging connectors&#x27; location means that it has to be vertical while charging, which means you can not but it on it&#x27;s side if you don&#x27;t have enough vertical space for it while charging&lt;br /&gt;- while charging, the shaving machine is heavy on the top, meaning that the slightest shake will tip it off on the ground and stop charging</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic beard trimmer bit the bullet a couple of weeks ago and was looking for a replacement. And given the service of my old Panasonic, I had to go with another Panasonic. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair with barber clippers for 20 years. However, I forgot to open it up to remove the hair that gets caught behind the blade, and it caught fire. (with my hair half shaved, of course.) So, I needed a new clipper. Technology has certainly advanced since 1992. No more cords, or various comb attachments, or balky design. This PANASONIC Wet/Dry Hair clipper does everything I&#x27;d ever want from a clipper, and then some. For starters, you charge it, so there&#x27;s no 120 volts of electricity in your hand, while you&#x27;re over a wet bathroom sink. Now I can stand barefoot on a wet floor, and clip my hair when wet if I want to, without receiving involuntary electro-shock therapy. That&#x27;s nice to know. Also, over time you always lose those comb attachments, that let you chose the length of your hair. I had two choices left to me with my old clippers--shaved off, and 3 mm. The PANASONIC \\&quot;MILANO\\&quot; clipper allows you to chose ANY LENGHT FROM 1mm (1/32\\&quot;) to 10mm (1/2\\&quot;), without ever removing the comb attachment from the clipper. That&#x27;s cool! Sometimes, I like my hair clipped close, and sometimes I like it grown out a bit. You just manipulate the comb settings on the clipper head, and its done. The package comes with a 1mm comb attachment, which you use if you are clipping long hair VERY SHORT. You might not ever need it, but its nice to know it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is a breeze. You run water over the blade, and let it dry. It comes with oil you apply to the blades each time you use the clipper. It also has a tiny brush, to help clean out bits of hair or dandruff that gets caught in the blade. You&#x27;ll most likely lose that within the first month. I use an old soft toothbrush to clean out my clipper, and it works great. As for charging, it takes 20 hours once the battery runs out. You&#x27;ll get 40 minutes of use per charge. Most batteries can be damaged if they are used until they are dead, so you might want to recharge your Clipper before it&#x27;s completely drained, or if you haven&#x27;t used it for awhile (6 months or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.  There&#x27;s no comparison between the PANASONIC Hair Clipper, and this old Oster clipper I&#x27;ve been using. With 10 different settings for hair length, cordless convenience and safety, and ergonomic design for ease of use, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to cut their own hair., or if you haven&#x27;t used it for awhile (6 months or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.

    <li> I have used this twice on our boys -- and it is by far the best hair trimmer we have owned in 16 years! I usually use sissors to cut, style and trim their hair, but these trimmers are fantastic for multi-styles, and not just a &#x27;buzz cut&#x27;. My guys get cute stylish cuts and this time I gave them short trims around the ears and longer layers on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my trimmer skills are elementary, for how we use these clippers -- they are fantastic. They don&#x27;t pull or drag like some of those I have used over the years on my boys. LOVE THEM! Now I need to get my husband to try them on his beard -- they would work great on the facial area too.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in years!  Works great, cuts very close, couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the guards since I cut my head low but works great and cleans good underwater.  The only thing I wish Panasonic would have had the red charge light turn a different color or just turn off when the unit is fully charged!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> I received this thinking I could cut my hair with it also. It is great for shaving your beard but not your hair. The reason why is it does not have speed adjustments and the speed that it operates on is very minimal. I would recommend something with more speed. It does work in the shower but at the speed it operates it falls short. Please rate my review below.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers on a weekly basis for about a month now. The clippers I was using before were tremendously loud. These barely make a noise at all! I love the fact that this is a wet/dry model and I can take it in the shower with me. It recharges at a docking station (so I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries). It has several settings, very easy to clean, and easy to adjust. This product also has a quality feel to it and is aesthetically pleasing. It would make a great gift.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic &amp;#34;Milano&amp;#34; ER-GS60-S Self-Hair Clipper, Wet/Dry works exactly as expected. It is very lightweight, it cut my hair, and it cleaned up easily when I ran water over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that the battery seems a little weak. I expected it to be running strong by the end of my haircut (shaving off two or three inches of hair down to the number 4 setting), but it had grown noticeably weaker. Because of the way it is designed, you can&#x27;t just plug it into the wall and keep going. It sits in a special stand, but ideally the cord for recharging would be separate from the stand and you could continue using it if the charge drains (my rechargeable razor works this way). It&#x27;s not a big deal for me (I&#x27;ll be cutting a lot less hair now that I shaved it all off), but if you have a family with two or three people who will use it, you might want to space out the haircuts.</li>
    <li> Not very good hair jams in blades, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Cuts like butter! Im from Perú and its my first clipper i love it! No more barbers for me!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see it it lasts, but seems very sturdy and durable... It is waterproof and has a smart system to adjust the comb length.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Easy to use , no wires and does the job.</li>
    <li> it works well, the only thing i dont like is i didnt find anywhere to see the last battery level</li>
    <li> I decided to go the really short buzz cut in my old age and this easily adjustable clipper works perfectly.  Easy to set different depths, easy to use and easy to clean.  Do it myself with a little help from my wife with the back and ears.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my husband. Just what he needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of beard clippers in the last few year.  Admittedly they were all cheap and you get what you pay for, but this one just exudes quality.  The clipper have a great feel in the hand and has an understated buzz for the way it powers through my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the power base that this comes with.  Much better than the charging cords of the others I have owned.  The guides work well although you need to press a couple of releases on the guide to change between modes 1-3,4-5, and 6-9. I&#x27;ve seen better solutions but the guides stay steady and like I said, it powers through hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have used it to clean up my neck and sideburns between haircuts, and again it performs admirably.  Its list price is higher than any trimmer I have bought in the past, but you get what you pay for, and this is a quality device.</li>
    <li> This device does an amazing job of giving you a professional looking hair cut, especially if you have short hair. Easy to adjust, clean and use. It makes me wish that I didn&#x27;t spend so much money for professional hair cuts. My friends can&#x27;t tell the difference between my do it yourself hair cuts and the pro barber ones.</li>
    <li> my 3rd panasonic clipper.&lt;br /&gt;much longer battery life.</li>
    <li> I needed a trimer and a wanted a hair cutting device this fits both my needs.  The charging stand is nice, you can leave the shaver off the charger for maybe two days.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this razor it&#x27;s actually very quiet.  Three star review is because it lacks the power off a corded trimmer.</li>
    <li> Had a Panasonic for more than 15 years that gave up on me. Now I have a new one. Different, but just as good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on excellent reviews.  It worked great for about 1 day, then stopped working entirely.  I threw out the box and now I&#x27;m stuck with a piece of garbage.  I would happily try another but there is no option for that.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Does everything that is advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Many length settings&lt;br /&gt;-Wireless&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life could be slightly better&lt;br /&gt;-More than one attachment to get all the length settings so if you are travelling, you would have to bring multiple attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow! Panasonic is truly head and shoulders over the competition in regards to their male grooming products. I have been cutting my own hair for years. The cordless adjustable functionality makes this a breeze to use. It can also be used in the shower. The build quality is solid. Looks and feels like an expensive product. A LOT of thought has went into this product design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the beard trimmer version of this for body grooming. The same applies to that product. DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER TRIMMER. The Panasonic range of trimmers is to male grooming what Apple is to technology. The undisputed leader...</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper so far.  I cut my hair about once a week on the lowest setting, 2mm.  I get consistent power throughout each hair cut and i like that its waterproof making it easy to clean and convenient to cut my hair while taking a shower.  The guard is adjustable so dont have to worry about finding the right guard.  Charging stand is nice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this product 5 stars now but ive only been using it for a couple months.  We&#x27;ll just have to see how long the battery will last.</li>
    <li> max lenght of cut much smaller than in previous versions. And it could be designed to stand vertical, allowing to store it easily in closet. Now it takes room to be left horizontal.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, easy to manuever and clean. Nice not having to keep track of seperate comb attachments. Quality battery with good life.</li>
    <li> I use the #2 for keeping my old white hair in good shape. The Panasonic ER-GS60-S is the best trimmer I have found yet!</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do. Do I wish the battery life could be longer? Sure, but it is adequate. Lasts long enough to get the job done. It is a bit bulky, and the comb on one side pops up a bit, and has to be pushed down occasionally. All that being said, I would recommend this product as an inexpensive grooming option.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quick exchangeable kits. Good stuff ! Reasonable price for a imported electronic ! Especially with the name of Panasonic !</li>
    <li> I purchased the hair clipper to replace the Phillips trimmer that didn&#x27;t cut well! The Panasonic did a good job. The rational for four stars is removing the cutter assembly after each use for cleaning and lube. I find it difficult  to remove (and re-install).</li>
    <li> Over the yrs I&#x27;ve had a lot of body groomers or what ever you want to call them and I will sum it up by saying this one is the best .</li>
    <li> Wow.  The convenience of wireless and waterproof is amazing.  I can now cut my hair while I&#x27;m showering.  No more mess.  Only bad thing is the charging dock.  A red light goes on when you dock the clipper but doesn&#x27;t go off to let you know it&#x27;s fully charge.  It would have been nice if the charger automatically shuts off when fully charge.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice clipper. It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is. Cuts hair great and my beard perfectly...</li>
    <li> I keep my hair cut close and had let it grow way to long.  This clipper made quick work of it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Good ergonomics, says my husband</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair clipper. It is very easy to use and clean. Its blades are sharp and not a single case of hair pulling.</li>
    <li> Not designed for beards or closely shaved heads. To use it with the blades exposed appears dangerous.</li>
    <li> I got it for my son and he absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> The package arrived today. I charged the clippers for about an hour and was able to give myself a hair cut. The form of the clippers are perfect for self hair cuts. I&#x27;m able to save money cutting my hair at home instead of mothy trips to the barber. The clippers require oiling so the blades don&#x27;t rust. I&#x27;m very satisfied with these clippers.</li>
    <li> Great clipper! Lightweight, NO CORD or separate combs to fumble with! Cuts my hair cutting time in half! Shoulda bought this a long time ago!</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Easy to charge, and easy to use</li>
    <li> Quite cheap looking, does the job ok.</li>
    <li> I have owned several clippers over the years, and this is the best one I have found (as of the time of writing). Problems I have had with other clippers: cutting unevenly, requiring many passes to get things right, accidentally adjusting the length while cutting, running out of charge while cutting. I have experienced none of these problems with the ER-GS60-S. Things I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cuts my hair and beard quickly, with good results every time.&lt;br /&gt;* Cutting length is easily adjustable on purpose, but hard to change by accident.&lt;br /&gt;* A single comb attachment serves all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;* Wireless, so there is no cord to get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;* Light and with a small grip, this clipper is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> works great. love that it&#x27;s wireless and waterproof</li>
    <li> Was stolen from me, now using a terrible shaver that rips my hair out and is painful. Was great, did exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Great battery life and it seems reasonably rugged.  Good for quick shaving and hair trimming, but not precise enough for a true fade.  Does not actually produce 1 mm increments in cut when getting into the 1, 2, and 3 mm settings.</li>
    <li> Have used this shaver at least a dozen times since buying it last year here on Amazon. It does the job I need it to do and is quieter, faster then my last one. I think it is quieter because it&#x27;s running at a lower speed/rpm, which is something I noticed almost all new shavers do. I bought a few before settling on this one and they all seemed to run much slower then my 15 year-old wireless Remington I had been using (and still operates today, believe it or not, just not as frequently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head to a #2 on my previous razor but this one I had to take off the adjustor and run it with the #1 adapter to get my desired length in a very close, yet not bare shave. It&#x27;s fast, charges fast and holds a charge for a very long time. Because I only use this device once every 4-5 weeks I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time. I have never had it die on me but I do recharge it about every 4 uses or so.</li>
    <li> I purchased this unit because the tech spec on Panasonic&#x27;s website indicated it could be used with 240v input. Here is the link: https://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/ER-GS60-S#&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the user manual that ships with the product it states that using anything other than 110-120v will create a shock and fire risk. So I emailed Panasonic customer support to find out which voltage range is correct. This is the response I received:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dear Valued Customer&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your inquiry&lt;br /&gt;Your case number is: 31550902&lt;br /&gt;We are sorry for any inconvenienced caused.&lt;br /&gt;The information that is listed in the owner&#x27;s manual would be the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting Panasonic&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the review I submitted to Panasonic&#x27;s website. It was refused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Product Not as Described, May Ignite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product looks great and seems like it would work well, but I wouldn&#x27;t know because I can&#x27;t charge it. The spec on Panasonic&#x27;s website says the input voltage may be 100-240v (Automatic International Dual Voltage Conversion), but the Owner&#x27;s Manual that comes with the product indicates the input voltage must be 110-120v or the unit poses a fire risk. I inquired about this discrepancy through their support link on the website. The representative said that the value in the Owner&#x27;s Manual is correct, i.e. this unit requires 110-120v. This product is smaller than I expected, which is a plus, and it looks very nice. The 1-10mm in 1mm increments was what made this product for me, since most clippers at this price either have no 1mm setting, or use 2mm increments. That&#x27;s all I can really say about it at this point in time.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a haircut, and a step down transformer may be had for less than SG$30 since this device requires only 0.7W. The clipper really is great. I  wanted it for the 1mm guard. The 2-10mm guard is awesome. It slides to a longer setting easily, but you&#x27;d have to really bang it against your head to get it to slip to a shorter setting while cutting. The clipper does not have power comparable to my corded Wahl clipper, but I doubt any cordless could match a corded set. The battery life is very long. I gave myself a fade with guards, did my &amp;#34;yard work&amp;#34; with guards, and shaved my arms and legs (triathlete) without the guard before the battery drained - roughly 30 min continuous usage. This product has a NiMH battery and when it starts to die, it dies fast! Stop cutting as soon as you hear the power decrease or it will likely stop with a mouthful of your hair in it. This clipper works equally well wet as dry for me; I have medium-thick, short hair. Cleanup couldn&#x27;t be easier, you simply remove the blade assembly and wash with water. After drying, apply oil to the lubrication points shown in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, other than the misinformation, this product is great. Note that the input voltage spec on Panasonic&#x27;s website is still incorrect.</li>
    <li> Nothing stops the motor / blades on this.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Keep it tight my friends.</li>
    <li> Ok..so I wanted a cordless clipper that had a charger stand/base and this unit has it.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a base charger over just a cord because I never remember to plug the cord in ..this way with a base you just plop it in..and it&#x27;s charging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the details..it is made well by a brand you know since childhood..Panasonic ..&lt;br /&gt;It cuts so well that I had an idea..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife and I keep,this unit in all places..the kitchen..why you ask..lol...&lt;br /&gt;Our Yorkie, Sir Benjiman, has hair, not fur, this means it grows in his eyes, face, feet ..you name it..&lt;br /&gt;So, yes the dog now has his own ER GS 60s clipper...</li>
    <li> This works well and is easy to use.  One caution would be to warn the purchaser that the numbers for the various length levels indicated on this trimmer DO NOT directly correspond to the numbers used by barbers.  Normally, I ask the barber to use a #2 setting and it&#x27;s just about right for me.  Using this trimmer set on #2 my hair turned out way shorter..  So just be aware of that and set the number higher initially.  Otherwise no complaints.</li>
    <li> So far, I like everything about my Panasonic. Of course, with my limited display, mostly an occipital hedge, there is no great challenge. My first outing produced a credible result. My second was even better. The battery has not required more charge. There is plenty of power. It is easy to adjust, oil, and clean. A very happy purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes so good, easy tu use. I recomended</li>
    <li> Works great and no cord</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two Panasonic electric shavers for a while now and their performance has always been excellent. I figured a trimmer by the same manufacturer would be a good bet, and I wasn&#x27;t wrong. Although I don&#x27;t cut my own hair, there are still times when I need to clean up a little but not enough to want to drop $15 on a haircut. This trimmer allows me to do that. It has ten different height settings, from 10 millimeters long to \\&quot;barely there\\&quot; short. I used it on my head and eyebrows, but if you&#x27;re one of those \\&quot;all over\\&quot; grooming types, I imagine this could easily be used in other body locales as well. (As it can be used both wet and dry, it is, in fact, particularly suited to body hair grooming.) Like my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]]the blades on this trimmer seem particularly sharp. The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t think I was even cutting anything until I noticed the short hairs sticking to the underside. That is to say, cutting is very even and smooth with no pull whatsoever. The device is quiet and light, the handle is a comfortable non-slip rubber, and the sliding adjustment mechanism for changing cut height is very simple and easy to use. The charging stand is the same type as for my [[ASIN:B008KEJ1US Panasonic ES-SL41-W \\&quot;Milano\\&quot; Men&#x27;s 3-Blade Wet-Dry Shaver with Nanotech Blades, White]]making it doubly useful for me to have both at the ready anytime I need them. There really is nothing I didn&#x27;t like about this trimmer and because I continue to be impressed with Panasonic&#x27;s personal grooming products, I give this trimmer the highest marks.</li>
    <li> The razor is everything the product description says it is.  It is actually one of the best hair clippers I have ever owned.  I have a full beard; a short one I grant you, but never-the-less full.  I have always had problems using the specialized clipper made specifically for beard care.  It is small, as they all are, which is fine I suppose, but it is difficult to get a neat trim between where the hair on my head melds with the hair on my face.  This larger clipper takes care of that problem quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this is a chargeable clipper and not one hooked up to the electric current coming out of my bathroom wall.  Like a previous reviewer has indicated - having an electrical appliance in our hand connected to 120 volts is a scary thing for me.  The battery does take some time to charge if it is completely empty but since I do not use this thing on a daily basis, this is not problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the attachments are removed - the combs regulating the length of the hair cut, it is ideal for touching up not only the back of my neck, but also the edge of my beard along the neck line.  This shaver is extremely comfortable to hold and while not overly heavy, it does have a nice heft to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it can be washed in water.  Cleaning one of these shavers has always been a problem and the ability to use water is extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with this product and plan to purchase more of them as gifts to grandsons this Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> These clippers are not oil-free. Our preference is definitely oil-free clippers. Something of a pain to clean hair clippers of hair stuck to the oil coating on the cutters. If using clippers for (short length) haircut, would also suggest purchasing hair clippers with a vacuum system. Vacuum system eliminates the mess of cleaning up after the hair is cut. Have been cutting hair at home for years. These hair clippers clogged up with cut hair much too quickly.</li>
    <li> Trimmer worked great, but the adjustable guard was cheap and poorly made.  This trimmer is prone to cutting sensitive areas of the skin without a guard.&lt;br /&gt;Speaking in the past tense as the guard finally broke, now the trimmer is useless.  Adjustable guard isn&#x27;t covered under warranty and there&#x27;s no replacement available from Panasonic or their parts supplier.</li>
    <li> Used this cordless hair trimmer for the first time and it is an excellent trimmer. This trimmer is comfortable to hold in one hand and cuts fast without any problems. I used to take 20 minutes to trim my hair (2mm) with my 7 year old beard trimmer but it only took me about 5 minutes to trim my hair with this trimmer! Easy to clean and oil. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and will buy another one when this one dies.</li>
    <li> I purchased another cordless Panasonic beard/hair trimmer, but no matter what setting I put the comb at, it would still cut VERY short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS wet/dry clipper behaves properly, lol! If you set the comb at a particular length, that&#x27;s the result you&#x27;ll get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that it was actually a wet/dry clipper. The previous one I mentioned could be rinsed, but could NOT be used as a wet clipper.</li>
    <li> Now I can cut my own hair. This clipper has saved me money because I don&#x27;t need to see the Barber every month. I have short hair perfect for these.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t have a great deal of hair, I still need to cut the sides and back. I usually have my wife do this every few weeks. Recently, I saw this product on the Amazon website and thought that I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the fact that this self-hair clipper operates without a cord, as it makes it extremely easy to use. It comes with 2 different templates, one for 1MM super short cuts, and another for a variety of cuts, ranging from 2MM to 10MM. In order to adjust the settings, you simply pull up on the template, than slide a switch to the appropriate level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, all you need to do is to run the template comb through your hair. I started by doing the sides, than proceeded to the back. In order to cut the back properly, I used a hand held mirror that was reflected off of my bathroom mirror. This enabled me to see the back of my head. While it does require a little bit of dexterity to cut the back of your hair correctly, it can be done successfully with this 2 mirror method. If you have any doubts, than just ask someone to help you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to cut a straight line in the back, I again used the 2 mirror method, and to my surprise was able to accomplish it with no problem at all. The entire process from start to finish took all of 10 minutes, and this was because it was my first time using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When done, I simply wiped all of the hair from the cutter with the included brush. Than, I removed the template, pulled out the steel cutter and applied a few drops of the supplied oil. The only thing left to do after thsi was to put the cutter back in the charging stand and clean up the hair on the floor with a vacuum cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a fantastic product and it does such a great job that you&#x27;ll no longer need to go to the barber. With the cost of haircuts, this will pay for itself after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I received this much earlier today and let it charge up.  I trimmed my beard, awesome...I shaved my head at the 1mm setting...pretty good and then I groomed my neck it did ok. I also own an Oster Classic 76. The Oster beats it in every manner of trimming/cutting. I&#x27;ll say though, the maneuverability of this thing is incredible compared to anything with a cord. It&#x27;s also very nice not to have to fumble with the cord...this thing is quick and seems to have a very decent motor.  Not near as powerful as the Oster but, I was surprised.  I&#x27;ve owned an older Panasonic that lasted years and years before it finally bit the dust.  If this lasts half as long, I&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just trimming hair, and not giving high and tights for a living...it should do you very well. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about five months now.  Everything is great on this clipper except battery performance.  After about two months the batteries became significantly weaker and lack strong endurance it once had.  It is  still very useable but you need to be sure that it is freshly charged and trim at least weekly or more often.  If you let your hair grow long and need to work this thing longer a single battery charge may not get the job done.  Also it operates slower than when it was new which is too bad.  Not sure how long this unit will last before the battery is useless.</li>
    <li> There was only one thing I thought could have been better on the milano... A guard with more teeth to catch body hair a little better but then again I&#x27;ve never tried any other razor to compare against. It did do what I wanted it to so I thought it was fine</li>
    <li> Bought it for shortening my beard, and it works as a charm- both dry and wet conditions. Highly recommended machine, very comfortable holding it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly happy with this clipper for a quick head buzzing.  I&#x27;ve now used it three times for my bi-monthly buzz cut using the number 2 setting and am getting great results.  I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time, have only charged it once and I have not run out of juice mid-buzz.  It is easy to use and I really like the fact that I&#x27;m not tangled in a power cable when using it.  Its cutting width seems to be noticeably smaller than my old-school Oster clippers, and I do find it more difficult to get around my ears with the adjustable guard.  I think if I were headed to a wedding or getting my photo taken for something important I might break-out the Osters, but this thing is now my go-to for a quick buzz.</li>
    <li> Best clippers ever purchased.  Everything from the design, build and quality to the informative manual, overall high quality one comes to expect from products made in Japan.    Pros:  - Relatively low price for high performance, quality  - Only 1 hair guide needed for 9 different settings  - Curvature of the handle provides useful leverage  - Can be used in shower/cleaned with water (no mess)  - Long run time (50mins++)  - Light weight    Cons:  - Tiny brush  - No carrying case  - Charging light always red - even after fully charged (should change to green)    Time will tell how well the battery holds up though considering Panasonic also manufactures Lithium Ion batteries for Tesla, probably won&#x27;t need to worry.    Only other item missing is a foil attachment for shaving.</li>
    <li> Works great, just don&#x27;t forget to use the oil before and after each use. Not as fast as a barber shop trimmer, but good for a cordless. The cleaner brush is incredibly tiny, I would not be surprised if that became lost. There is no way to tell how well charged the unit is, this is my only real problem with the unit. What do I do if it dies half way through a trim? Since I cannot tell how charged it is before each use, this is certainly a concern.</li>
    <li> This has saved me so much time in shaving my head. I really like it and would buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you&#x27;ll want to tie a lanyard of some sort to it so you don&#x27;t ~have to~ buy another one the first time you drop it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Lots of power and the cordless function is great.</li>
    <li> 110v only&lt;br /&gt;15h charging time&lt;br /&gt;Is Panasonic a cottage industry?</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM!  Used to have what I think is the old model of these.  These a lot better. Use them in the shower and they rock!</li>
    <li> Owned for about 6 months. I trim my whole head down to 3 millimeters every few weeks, and for that these are awesome. The adjustable head is nice, no more pile of different guides in my bathroom. They also work well for trimming a light beard. However, if I let my hair get too long,  they bog down alot and I have to switch to my corded clippers to speed up the job. According to the nameplate, these only have a 1.2v battery (probably a rechargeable NiMh AA), so there&#x27;s not much power available. Panasonic makes quality products, these are very light and the charge lasts for a couple haircuts, so if you have realistic expectations you will be happy. If you need to cut thicker hair, or you&#x27;re a professional, spend the extra money for something better with a lithium battery.</li>
    <li> I bought this clippers after my older (european) Panasonic died (they motor stopped working after 6 years or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to use it in the shower without worrying too much about water is great. The ergonomics and the charger itself are very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, the clippers lack of power so it can be a little uncomfortable to cut your hair/beard. The biggest challenge of this product is beard trimming though. In the position to leave the hair the longest (10) the results are still of a very short beard. It feels that the 11 positions are too granular and it lacks of a couple of longer positions for those of us who want to cut their hair longer.</li>
    <li> The best clipper.  Exactly what I wanted.  Does a perfect job.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, but the battery is dying on me after about only a year.  I use this just 1-2 times a week.  The handle is very small, so I imagine they could make it larger to accommodate a bigger / better battery, and it would not be annoying if a little fatter in the grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I figured, no big deal, I&#x27;ll just replace the battery. Unfortunately, no replacement batteries available on their website. So then I figured I&#x27;d just open it up, research the battery type online and buy one from another source. I have opened up many computers, perform most of my maintenance on my car, and have repaired small household items, and I&#x27;ll tell you, that this was one of the most difficult pieces of equipment to open up I have ever dealt with. It is extremely obvious that they have purposely made this difficult to open up and repair. After a while, I finally got the battery out (1100mah NI-MH Panasonic battery) to find that it is not a generic battery that can simply be swapped at a Radio Shack or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing didn&#x27;t even make it a year, and that&#x27;s completely unreasonable in my opinion.  I also wrote to Panasonic&#x27;s website to try to get this thing repaired under warranty, and after a week, they still haven&#x27;t gotten back to me.  Poor product, poor customer service, 1 star rating.</li>
