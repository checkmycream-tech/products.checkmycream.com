### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Practice makes perfect, and FTD gave me a perfect manicured look.</li>
      <li>I love this product!!!</li>
      <li>but I gave it s fair shot</li>
      <li>I love that my nails look so great.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more to give to my sisters!</li>
      <li>It works great and there are several you tube tutorials to watch to help you perfect it!</li>
      <li>It is perfect and beautiful!!!i love the product and learned how to do my nails by the very clear instructions.</li>
      <li>ok y</li>
      <li>it seems like a pretty good idea</li>
      <li>The package itself was shipped quickly, and is packaged nicely with all that is included.</li>
      <li>, you need firts to pour the paint into a container, then dip the kit, then paint your nails, you may be better off painting your nail tips free hand</li>
      <li>Cheaply made doesn&#x27;t work ;(.</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of it its super easy.</li>
      <li>It works OK, the edges are not as crisp as I can do</li>
      <li>Did not make clean lines.</li>
      <li>most of the tips are a bit large for me.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s right for you!</li>
      <li>Received this product much faster than shipping had said it would be delivered and got a free upgrade on this product.</li>
      <li>Amazing product i am definitely buying from them again!!</li>
      <li>This item is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>and man I was right.</li>
      <li>This is exactly as item described.</li>
      <li>Impossible  to have a perfect match and is messy even with many many practices.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work like it says.</li>
      <li>Leaves way too much polish</li>
      <li>The product is a good deal considering the numerous contents included in the package and as long as you have normal size adult nails.</li>
      <li>Clever idea but</li>
      <li>The trick is to LIGHTLY touch the tool your nail and pull down... works like a charm!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t curve the dipping tip, you may have to rock the tip from left to right in order to get the polish on your entire nail tip.</li>
      <li>so it would never dry.</li>

<li> I really dont like this product ita a waste of money!</li>
<li> This is by far one of the biggest wastes of money I&#x27;ve ever Spent!</li>
<li> Not clean french manicure at all.</li>
<li> Not what i expected.</li>
<li> At least I have one to use on my big toe</li>
<li> There have got to b a million other ways to waste your time.</li>
<li> Basically... and I feel super bad saying</li>
<li> But, huge peice of crap I gotta say</li>
<li> Not easy to use.</li>
<li> I have to use the smallest false nail tip as a dipping tool for my pinky nail &amp; the rest of my toe nails since there isn&#x27;t one small enough on the dipping tool.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little hard to use on kids nails..</li>
<li> Even when I just painted some paint on with the paint bottle brush it STILL left way too much polish AND the lines were also horrible.</li>
<li> The idea is genius but the actual result suffers.</li>
<li> Do yourself a favor and take a few minutes to watch an instructional video because if the tool is overloaded with polish your manicure will be sloppy and you can always apply another coat if needed.</li>
<li> I dont recommend it to anyone unfortunately.</li>
<li> Terrible item, hard to use, and complicated</li>
<li> You can place this just where you want it, unlike those annoying adhesive forms--if you put them in the wrong place</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>

    <li> Received this product much faster than shipping had said it would be delivered and got a free upgrade on this product. Daughter loves doing her nails and loves this product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as item described. It works great and there are several you tube tutorials to watch to help you perfect it! You can use the tool with any polish to make a look that&#x27;s right for you! I will be purchasing more to give to my sisters!</li>
    <li> When I received my kit, I went to a YouTube tutiorial to watch how it was done. After watching, I took my tool and customized the bend to my nail and began to practice. Practice makes perfect, and FTD gave me a perfect manicured look. The trick is to LIGHTLY touch the tool your nail and pull down... works like a charm!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to use on kids nails..</li>
    <li> Clever idea but most of the tips are a bit large for me. At least I have one to use on my big toe (: I have to use the smallest false nail tip as a dipping tool for my pinky nail &amp; the rest of my toe nails since there isn&#x27;t one small enough on the dipping tool. The product is a good deal considering the numerous contents included in the package and as long as you have normal size adult nails. Do yourself a favor and take a few minutes to watch an instructional video because if the tool is overloaded with polish your manicure will be sloppy and you can always apply another coat if needed. Also, squeeze the sides of the dipping &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; together to curve it and the polish will coat both sides of your nail tip. If you don&#x27;t curve the dipping tip, you may have to rock the tip from left to right in order to get the polish on your entire nail tip.</li>
    <li> When this came in the mail I took one look at it and thought..ok y the heck did I order this thing it doesnt even look like it would work but I gave it s fair shot and man I was right. This thing does not work at all. Leaves way too much polish so it would never dry. Even when I just painted some paint on with the paint bottle brush it STILL left way too much polish AND the lines were also horrible. Basically... and I feel super bad saying this bc it seems like a pretty good idea n everything. But, huge peice of crap I gotta say n I dont recommend it to anyone unfortunately. Doesnt do anything even close to what this picture shows.</li>
    <li> Terrible item, hard to use, and complicated, you need firts to pour the paint into a container, then dip the kit, then paint your nails, you may be better off painting your nail tips free hand</li>
    <li> There have got to b a million other ways to waste your time. Did not make clean lines. Sux poop</li>
    <li> You can place this just where you want it, unlike those annoying adhesive forms--if you put them in the wrong place you&#x27;re out of luck.  This item is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Once you get the hang of it its super easy. I love that my nails look so great.</li>
    <li> It is perfect and beautiful!!!i love the product and learned how to do my nails by the very clear instructions. Comes with everything in image and just as described!!!! Amazing product i am definitely buying from them again!!</li>
    <li> Not what i expected. Not clean french manicure at all.</li>
    <li> does not apply the nail polish like it advertises</li>
    <li> My kit didn&#x27;t even come will all the peices! This is by far one of the biggest wastes of money I&#x27;ve ever Spent!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made doesn&#x27;t work ;(. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work like it says.</li>
    <li> I really dont like this product ita a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Not easy to use. Very disappointed. The package itself was shipped quickly, and is packaged nicely with all that is included. The idea is genius but the actual result suffers. Impossible  to have a perfect match and is messy even with many many practices.</li>
    <li> It works OK, the edges are not as crisp as I can do freehand but it&#x27;s a different technique I guess.</li>
