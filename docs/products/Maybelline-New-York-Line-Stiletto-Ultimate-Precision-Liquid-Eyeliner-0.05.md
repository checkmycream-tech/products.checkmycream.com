<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow. I hate this. I really actually severly HATE this liner. The formula is so WET and it does not produce a neat opaque line. The tube itself is easy to hold and use but the brush part sucks and the liquid gets everywhere if you blink and its not dry. If you look at my picture the line is patchy, thats after two swipes and i let it dry before applying the second swipe. I do not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Good eyeliner, wish it went on a little more smoothly. But if you&#x27;re looking for a liquid, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Used this as a tracer for my face (went as a pop art character for Halloween) and it worked out perfectly!</li>
    <li> Pretty great, doesn&#x27;t last very long though.</li>
    <li> There are better liners out there. I found applying this that it would either be too dry or too wet. The fibers from the tip would also make application difficult as well too. I prefer a pen like applicator with the product continuously flowing through the applicator. Once on it looked good and dried matte, but I would have flaking on my inner corners which I haven&#x27;t come across with most liners.</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!!!!! delivery was really quick!!</li>
    <li> Overall thin tip pretty easy to apply. My only complaint is the liquid volume seems to be a bit too little, I haven&#x27;t really been using that much but have already noticed the liquid volume is getting quite low ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used pencil eyeliners. The first time I attempted a liquid liner I got it everywhere and swore to never use it again. For various reasons, I needed a liquid liner so I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush on this product is a felt tip, like a marker liquid liner but with more give which makes the liner much easier to apply. You do have to dip the applicator several times in order to line your whole eye, but the end result is a well defined, dark liner that accentuates the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only sad that I&#x27;m going to have to purchase another after just 3 months of use since mine is running out.</li>
    <li> Since the applicator was so thin I thought the tip would be extra thin and precise, I could not have been more WRONG. The tip is is just about as big as the rest of the applicator. If you&#x27;re looking for an eyeliner with a precise tips to form really fine lines like cat-eye wings then this liner is not for you. At best you can use it to apply somewhat of a thin line on your lid, but you can&#x27;t expect sharp edges or anything. The eyeliner is pretty black though I&#x27;ll give it that. When you apply this you&#x27;ll have to apply this A LOT. Though it&#x27;s very black, it doesn&#x27;t apply evenly so you&#x27;d have to go over the line multiple times, leaving room for lots of mistakes if you&#x27;re a beginner. It&#x27;s really an annoying liner tbh.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has lasted longer on my eye lids than pencil eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This really sticks and doesn&#x27;t smudge too easily. The fluid flowed from the felt tip on to my eyelids very easily and it was really easy to use and do make up. The felt tip is also very thin making applying it a lot more accurate and the base is thicker, so it was easy to use it sideways when I&#x27;m filling in a large area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner will not last a whole day with out touch ups. While it does stick a lot better than pencil eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, it still comes off on my fingers when I have to scratch an itch in the area, or when my eyes get itchy and I rub it.  Not too big of a deal as it will take a few times before you can see it really rubbing off and you have yo patch up the small area. So far, this is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve used! I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few complaints is the area of my eyes seems to get a tiny bit itchy while applying it, when it ks drying, and a tiny bit afterwards. Maybe there is something in it that is causing slight irritation. I have no idea, not too bothersome. Also when I went to remove it at night, my Neutrogena eyemake up remover seemed to smudge it around a bit before it will actually come off. It seems to be a tiny bit hard to remove. Still recommend this though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used this once. I will update my review as I use it more often.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner was dried out by the time i got it and opened it... I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner gives me life. People don&#x27;t even recognize me without my signature perfect cat-eye anymore.</li>
    <li> Less product than I expected, but overall I am very impressed. It won&#x27;t run, streak, or drip.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a makeup everyday person but this I will probably wear everyday it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was impressed at first with how easy it was to apply - the felt-like tip is very precise, and the color goes on nice and evenly. I had read a few reviews on here that said that it flake off, so I set it with a black eyeshadow. Still, when I checked back around lunch time, my liner seemed to be completely gone, despite the fact that I had been using that eyeshadow as eyeliner for years now, and it never comes off by itself. Too bad, this seemed like a good deal.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, color pay off is great, it&#x27;s super dark black, I wish there was more product in the bottle- it seems like it runs out quick</li>
    <li> No Problems! Fast Delivery! A++++</li>
    <li> Love it don&#x27;t have any problems with it drying out or the line to thick</li>
    <li> This used to be one of the best eyeliners I had ever tried since the tip is easy to use and has the perfect amount of flexibility for the perfectest cat-eye ever. However, the most recent times I have purchased it, Maybelline has appeared to have changed the formula. It is no longer as pigmented and matte as it used to be. Now it is very runny and splotchy. I often have to double coat my eyeliner to get it dark enough or set it with black eye shadow which is not something I want to have to take the time to do each and every time. This eyeliner also now smudges more easily and will run if your eyes water in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it used to be better. I would recommend the Master Precise eyeliner pen by Maybelline if you&#x27;re looking for the perfect drugstore eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it. I opened it up and it was completely dry...</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is my favorite! I usually buy high-end makeup but haven&#x27;t found a liquid eyeliner in Sephora I like as much as this one. The brush is very easy to use and my eyeliner looks flawless with every application!</li>
    <li> Very fine tipped applicator, smooth consistency, not too wet, dries matte. Great product all around.</li>
    <li> I was nervous because I had seen a few bad reviews but this stuff is great. I&#x27;ve tried many liquid eyeliners over the years and this is probably my favorite. The applicator really gives you complete control for a perfect line, thick or thin. Its a nice solid black (which I like) and really gets into your lashline for a beautiful look. I would really recommend this also if you have trouble getting a nice even line with liquid liners. I&#x27;m pretty practiced so I don&#x27;t, but I was amazed at how easy this applicator made it. Get it :)</li>
    <li> I personally prefer the gel eyeliner, but decided to try this because it says \\&quot;ultimate precision\\&quot; so i thought it might be easier to put on, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. by the time your going about to finish the tail it drys up. then you have to re insert it and shake because just dipping it doesnt cut it, its not the best yet not the worst, be aware!</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used...its build gives me the most control in application and it doesn&#x27;t run or anything crappy like that.  However, the seller took almost an entire month to get it to me...I was going crazy without it!</li>
    <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> This liner is perfect for beginners! Love how easy the felt tip makes applying. I get the perfect cat eye every time. The color stays intense all day.</li>
    <li> This is way easier to apply than most liquid eyeliner, but it does need occasional reapplication. Regardless, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I did not bought this product here, instead I bought it at a local store 2 days ago. I wanted to make a review at the store site, but I could not do so. I believe this site would be helpful to vent my experience with the product. Anyways, this is the worst low quality liquid eye liner bottle ever! The first day, I bought the product I opened it to see the wand. I was impressed by the thin wand, so I slowly put it inside the tube. The next day, when I was ready to apply my make-up, my eyes widened! The beautiful thin wand I was impressed with, was bent!!! I was so confused!! It was bent!! A brand new wand already bent! I sucked it up, and applied the liner. The color is jet black, which I  do not have a problem with it, BUT today when I was getting ready to apply the liner, guess what? THERE WAS NO MORE LIQUID!! The wand was completely dry, as if I left the bottle open all night. I am careful with my make-up, and this is by far one of the worst eye liner in my make-up bag. I can not believe the liquid dried out! IT is not even a week old! NOT EVEN A MONTH OLD!! I am staying with Lo&#x27;real products. I am a huge fan, of Lo&#x27;real eye liners, but since I like the Maybelline Lash Stiletto mascara- I thought I would give a try the Line Stiletto eye liner. Dangit, I was wrong! 0 stars to that brought. I was ripped off, and there is no way I&#x27;ll get a refund. :( I do know, I will never buy a Maybelline eye liner AGAIN!!! L&#x27;oreal eye liners IS THE BEST QUALITY PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This goes on very cleanly.  It lasts most of the day without smudging or coming off.  I think it does what it promises and I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Cracks and flakes by the end of workday, would not repurchase.  Not the fault of the supplier.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t bring much liquid but it&#x27;s really good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great eyeliner forever and this made the cut! It&#x27;s beyond perfect. Most people don&#x27;t like liquid eyeliner because it&#x27;s hard to apply or it is too liquid-y for them. I was on the fence myself but this is fabulous! It&#x27;s almost instant drying, smudge proof, and easily comes off with a moist face rag!(:</li>
    <li> Other than buying the wrong color, black, this product works well. The precision of the tip is good and it goes on smoothly. It also wears well so far. I worn it off and on for about a week.</li>
    <li> i like it;s easy to aply it has a nice stick but i have to put two strokes because it is not soooo black</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at the store but this time I was too lazy and bought it off here! I am pleased with the product, as always.</li>
    <li> This is great since the applicator is so thin. Unfortunately it dries out easily and flakes by mid day.</li>
    <li> The only liquid eyeliner I seem to like. Stays on, doesn&#x27;t drip or smudge if I sweat or it rains... I&#x27;m sure if I went swimming or something it might but, stays put for day to day life.</li>
    <li> The only liquid liner I would use ever! Precise, affordable and lasts me a while. On my third product.  I use Rimmel kohl pencil in black and run it through a lighter flame quickly to soften the pencil a bit , then apply on top of the liquid liner and is my favorite combo for bold matte eyes. Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s the easiest I&#x27;ve ever tried to apply correctly and straight without bubbles, unevenness or fading. It is so easy to apply, just like using a felt tip pen. Has really long staying power, and lasts all day and night. I have both the black for a more dramatic look or the brown for everyday/weekend afternoon wear. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try another brand again. Hope they never discontinue it!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite line I have high end and drugstore eyeliners and nothing beats this! Give a precise line and application is easy. It last all day!</li>
    <li> Purchased this as an add on. I&#x27;ve used it before and I&#x27;m happy with the consistency and felt-tip applicator. Makes it easy for me to create cat eyes.</li>
    <li> I really love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s the first one I ever used, and it&#x27;s simple and easy to apply. I kind of have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes a bit, so I usually only need to reapply it once, but other than that it stays on really well. If you&#x27;re just going about a normal day, then the eyeliner should last you all day. Honestly very easy to apply, would recommend it for beginners.</li>
    <li> This one of the few eyeliners that don&#x27;t smudge for me. I can&#x27;t work with gel and most pencils, but this won&#x27;t budge. Great buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product. I love how at the end of the day I can just wipe it with a wipe and most of it comes off right away. One of the few things I dislike about this product is that in order for it to be applied you have to shake it or else it won&#x27;t go on right. It also has a bit of a glare to it once it dries, so you have to put a bit of black eye shadow over it to get rid of the glare, but that&#x27;s not a problem for me. Easy to apply, but it doesn&#x27;t usually make a perfect flick because the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is a bit thick.</li>
    <li> I used to always used liquid eyeline but I stopped because I hated the eyeline I had. It smudged easily, was hard to apply, and grew tacky in the container after a week or two. Last week my twin sister was saying how muched she loved Maybelline Stiletto eyeliner. She let me try it and I instantly fell in love with it! I now use it everydays. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and make a nice wing and stays on all day. I will be sticking with this eyeliner until it discontinues. :)</li>
    <li> This brand never ceases to amaze me. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the tip is really fine. Lasts well too.</li>
    <li> This eye liner works great and shows very black. Didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this, but it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> it was a little dried out</li>
    <li> The item arrived in a timely fashion and it was not damaged. It was combined with my other items, which made it more convenient.  Not having to worry about my items being separated and lost. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I tried it on a whim, and now it is all I use. The tip is EXCELLENT for precision</li>
    <li> I was concerned this would take a while to get to me, but it got in so much earlier. It was packaged very well and not even bent. I loved every bit of it!</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner I have ever used!  The applicator makes a huge difference.  It&#x27;s spongey and tapered so the liner goes on accurately and most importantly, without any globs.  Another thing that sets this liner apart from others I&#x27;ve used is that it has a tiny bead inside the barrel of liquid to stir it up, like fingernail polish does.  This keeps it from separating and settling like some liners do.  Lash Stilleto gives you a defined, clean, and bold line.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is cheaply made... You can not see the line on the eye... the liquid quality is not consistent...  Applicator is good. It makes accurate lines but you can not see the lines as they are so fade....  It is not true black color..very fade color..need to apply 2-3 coats to make it look visible..  Not recommended at all!</li>
    <li> My friend uses this and it stays on her all day. But when I use it, it comes off during the middle of the day. Is it because of my skin? I don&#x27;t sweat. So I don&#x27;t know why it comes off. Is it the brand?</li>
    <li> Even though I have a monolid, it doesn&#x27;t come off easily. the tip also easily allows me to draw thick and thin lines without having to change eyeliner at all. I definitely will buy this again. I love this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a felt brush, and I can tell you, I don&#x27;t love it and probably wont be using/buying another one. I usually add a dramatic wing to the end of my eyelids and this liquid doesn&#x27;t give a smooth surface when applying it to the end of the eyes. The brush is too thick to get a good small wing at the end. It stayed on for most of the day, which is all I asked for. The price is good for what you get. I do like the way it sets on your eyes besides the wing so I would recommend it for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Its a good product just a little tooo liquidy. Fills in nicely but its hard to control how much comes out because it&#x27;s too wet</li>
    <li> I love it but i hate how the foam is a little soft but you get use to it and it becomes your best friend forever!!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and looks good.</li>
    <li> It was just as described.</li>
    <li> with this liner, if you get to thick, you can alway take away with a wet q-tip. I have to watch it because I am so fair. Otherwise this product gives a thin line for the average person with a lot of control. Great stuff, buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this liner thinking it was better than the liquid with the brush. Day one this liner fades and smudges on my eyelids and waterline. Day two I try to use the liner it goes on lighter like a greyish color. Then I realized that this liner had dried out even though I had tightly closed it the night before. This liner was NOT only expensive it dried out.  Maybelline you need to go back to your research center and creat a lasting liner like the one in the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s.</li>
    <li> The best thing of this Eyeliner is very easy to apply. If you never try a Liquid Eyeliner, you may find that isn&#x27;t easy to appy it on your eyelid. I found the same. I used pencil eyeliner before but it did not give me perfect lines. This eyeliner worked. Its wand is solid,shape. It is not waterproof eyeliner by the way.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner.  It works well for me.  Its the only eyeliner I use now, along with my MAC fluid line. When its a laid back day for me, it stays on all day.  When I&#x27;m out and constantly on the move it gets a little faint at the other edges of my eye at the end of the day, but its really no big deal. I like it even better than Loreal Lineur Intense (for me at least).</li>
    <li> I like the product because it was easy to apply, i like the wand but I would notice myself shaking the product several times before it came out black. I would have to do this several times, besides that, I do like it.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner lasts a long time.  I have used this product for years.  (Still trying to make sure not to paint my eye ball back but that&#x27;s not a product flaw - it&#x27;s just me.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a very girly girl, so I only use makeup for special occasions. With that in mind, when I do apply eye liner, I&#x27;m all about subtlety. I hate the thick obvious line that you get from many traditional pencils and crayons. I love this style of liquid liner because you can get a sharp and thin line that really makes your eye pop! My old liquid liner was discontinued, but in the store this seemed like a good substitute.    The product reminds me of a felt-tip marker. The tip allows you to draw a steady line any way you please- thick or thin. Unfortunately, unlike a few similar products I&#x27;ve used, the tip seems cheap and spongy- it doesn&#x27;t affect application (as far as I know), but it is a little annoying because it seems to leave little liner-covered fuzzies on my lids. I&#x27;m seriously considering switching out the caps so I can keep using the old brush.    My biggest problem is the product itself. My first liquid liner purchase was a $2 tube of NYC brand, which flaked off when dry. Since then, I buy the name brand stuff (Mabelline, Avon, etc), and for the money I expect quality that this product DID NOT deliver!    Although the packaging proclaims the product to be long-lasting, I found the single coat I applied to be rather chalky, and when I rubbed my eye later, I found the product had flaked off onto my finger. A few hours later, when I looked into the mirror, a significant amount of the liner had flaked right off of both eyes, making me look like I had applied my eyeliner in a dotted line (- - -)! While I will admit this product did not immediately flake, I want to apply my liner once- not three or four times- in a day!     Until I find my old brand, I&#x27;m gonna stick with this junk, but do yourself a favor and go with a liner that won&#x27;t crumble!</li>
    <li> This does not give you a dark line at all. You will have to apply several applications to get a black precise line. It does dry fast though and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m giving this product three stars because what I ordered and what I received are two different things I ordered the little lash what I received was precision I guess they ran out I really don&#x27;t know so far the precision is okay it is not waterproof but I do like the felt tip aside from that I get the product the stars it is it does get the job done but because it is not waterproof but usually comes off</li>
    <li> This liner is pretty good in a pinch, but it barely makes it through the first half of my day.</li>
    <li> not good quality , it dried right away ...</li>
    <li> I love this liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s a very dark black, and it&#x27;s just so easy to handle!  There&#x27;s two major problems I have with it. One; if you don&#x27;t put on a base it will smear, crease, rundown, whatever you want to call it, and no I do not have oily skin at all. Two; I usually curl my eyelashes one last time after my eyeliner is done, if you do this it will come off and you have to reapply.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this liner and have been buying it for years now. Lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t crack, peel or flake. Smooth, easy application &amp; lasts the whole day. I&#x27;m now on my 3rd tube :-)</li>
    <li> In the decade or so that I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup regularly, I&#x27;ve probably tried a dozen liquid eyeliners, and this is my standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a normal day I do a fairly thick cat eye. The pros seem to swear by gel + a fine tipped brush, but I seem to lack the necessary dexterity required to apply an even line and flick. A lot of people seem to swear by Stila Stay All Day, but I found that even with a high end primer (I use Urban Decay Primer Potion) the Stila would smear if I blinked within a minute or so of application. Additionally, the Stila would only last me about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Maybelline liner, on the other hand, usually lasts me several months. If I don&#x27;t use a primer I sometimes see a small amount of smudging by the end of the day, if it&#x27;s particularly humid or rainy, but with a primer this stuff STICKS. I&#x27;ve found that the felt tip gives me really good control -- I can do a fine line (though I rarely do) or build up for a thicker line, so it&#x27;s good for daily use and for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like to use this liner when wearing false eyelashes, to help blend them into my natural lash line.</li>
    <li> This product was my first foray into the world of liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;ve never been able to get nice definition with pencil eyeliners, but I&#x27;m terrified of using a tiny brush to apply liquid liner that close to my dear eyeballs, so my friend suggested I try a product with a marker-like tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hand was quite shaky at first, but it&#x27;s become much easier with time. I usually line only my upper lid, starting with a thin line on the inner part of my eyelid and widening out to a mild cat-eye on the edge. I do have to dip the tip back into the container once during each application to make sure it looks adequately dark all the way. (This liner doesn&#x27;t skip, but when the ink is running low, it applies sort of gray rather than black.) I&#x27;ve been using the liner for a few months, and the applicator tip has remained fine and creates lovely, defined lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it wipes off very easily with moisture. If the corners of my eyes get watery (say, from sneezing), the liner in that area will start to wear off. I will be eager to purchase a waterproof version :)</li>
    <li> This is an excellent eyeliner! It is very precise ,which is just what I was looking for. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because I was using a $25 liner and was curious if there was a less expensive alternative.  This worked as well as the expensive one!  Thin, dark line that doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target . I liked the fact that it has beads inside to mix up the product like nail polishes do. When I opened it, the applicator looks like a felt tip, which is a plus for me  I have been using the Physicians Formula felt tip liner which has just dried up.  The product seems to be very runny and I had to brush some of it off on the side. It does go on smooth but again I felt there was a lot of it on the brush and the result was a thicker line than I wanted. Then the product seemed to \\&quot;bleed\\&quot;. It lasted for about 2 hrs and then started flaking off. I do have oily lids and applied it without shadow. So I am giving it another try with eyeshadow and maybe the product would have dried up a little bit.</li>
    <li> Overall, this liquid liner is pretty good.  It&#x27;s easy to hold in your hands and apply to your eyes.  The felt tip is great. It&#x27;s actually a little bendy/flexible, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  At first I didn&#x27;t like that but after applying it 2-3 more times I got used to it and appreciated it; it makes it easier to go back over the line and build it&#x27;s lenght or smooth out any errors.  It also feels soft on your eyelids.  The product stays on all day and is easy to remove at night.  The packaging says this product is good for making thin, precise lines, but I found it easier to make thicker lines and create a wing-tipped look (but maybe someone with more experience would have more success with a thinner line).  Also, sometimes it gets on the tip of my eyelashes (like all liquid liners) but it doesn&#x27;t make them sticky and affect the way your mascara goes on, like other liquid liners I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted 1/2 a star because sometimes the color is not as dark and opaque as I like it to be; I mostly notice it fading when I pair it with a shimmery or color eyeshadow (like blue or green instead of brown or tan).  But from a distance my lashline still looks full and it lines my eyes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would reccommend this product.  It&#x27;s a great liquid liner that&#x27;s easy to apply because of the felt tip and handle.  It stays on all day and makes a great wing-tip.  I only wish it was not as expensive (almost seven dollars in some drug stores I think).  Although that my not be considered expensive by some, it is a little over my price range when I can get similar products for less.  But if it&#x27;s on sale, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy and I definitely think you should try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. I had the hardest time being active with sports and having all my eye makeup come off when I just got a little bit sweaty. This was problematic especially when I was cheerleading because I needed to be active but also needed my eyeliner to stay throughout the competition or game. I tried this eyeliner and was thrilled when it would stay on! If I did a winged eyeliner look, sometimes they winged portion would smudge off, but the main portion stayed on and I was thrilled! It is so easy to apply and gives a nice crisp and professional look. 5 years later, I still use it and I can put it on quickly and have it stay all day at work, even as I&#x27;m running around. It is great for all ages. The only issue I&#x27;ve run into is if I make a mistake and use some oil-based makeup removers and then tried to re-apply, the eyeliner would not apply until my eye was completely dry. Since I love this eyeliner so much, I just chose oil-free removers and I can reapply just fine! :) Definitely a great eyeliner option for makeup novices and gurus!</li>
    <li> This has the best tip on it I have tried, and I have tried several different kinds. It makes the flare possible. I got the black and it lasts through my entire shift.</li>
    <li> This is my first liquid eyeliner... have been using pencil for years and because of the awesome reviews, great add-on price, and my pencil starting to annoy me, I decided to make a change. Going from pencil to liquid is much more different than I was expecting so I am still adjusting, but it is a much better way to go for definition and thin lines without &amp;#34;skin-wrinkle&amp;#34; interruptions.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, and it got here way before expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of eyeliner since it first came out, and I absolutely love it!  I love how precise the lines are, ranging from really thin and natural looking to BAM BOLD.  If you buy this eyeliner you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! It gives me the perfect winged look for the corner of my eyes. It lasts and doesn&#x27;t smudge like other eye liners I have encountered. I just purchased another one for the future because I love it that much.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one that got 3 of them in my box!? I was expecting 1 only</li>
    <li> finally a liquid eyeliner i can control.  thin line, thick line, it is a magic wand in my hand.  stays put all day &amp; lasts a really long time.  very happy &amp; will buy again.</li>
    <li> If you are a teenager, then this product might please you. As an adult......you will think it&#x27;s OK. Good sharp, soft felt tip, but the liquid, I feel, is not thick enough for a nice dark cat eye line.....unless you layer it on thick.......throughout the day though, it might get crumbly.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold well to my skin...when I curl my eyelashes it comes right off, even after I let it dry.  At least it was cheap.</li>
    <li> This liquid eyeliner is very easy to use and is suitable for everyone to complete their dramatic evening eyes. The applicator is long and skinny but goes on well. Price is good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to see they sell this online, I can&#x27;t find it in stores around here anymore. I&#x27;m not very picky when it comes to make up but I always have a hard time finding a good eye liner. I loved this one, it just works for me. It&#x27;s easier to use and it&#x27;s simple. I give it a 5. But the stiletto mascara I was not a fan of...</li>
    <li> This looks good right when you put it on, but almost immediately starts flaking off. The formula is terrible for anything other than a few quick pictures.</li>
    <li> I know that I could just buy this at a store, but either way it is my favorite eyeliner and I&#x27;m glad with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This use to be my favorite product.  It was easy to apply, looked good, I could easily remove a tiny portion with a damp q-tip if I made a mistake... Now I will not buy it.  The last one I bought was terrible.  They have changed the quality and I no longer will use it.  It use to go on nice and dark.  Now, if I try to apply it, it looks like dark gray, instead of black, and there are streaks where I try to reapply over where I just applied, trying to get the look I am use to.  The fluid is much thinner.  I didn&#x27;t throw away my old one, and I considered that one to be well past it&#x27;s prime, and it actually performed better than my newly bought bottle!!!  I swabbed it over top of where I applied the new one, and it looked better and DARKER.  I am not the only one to notice.  I went to their website, and saw a similar review.  I didn&#x27;t leave a review there, because I didn&#x27;t want to have to make a log in, but I did send a comment to the company at my displeasure with their product.  They have lost my trust and my business.</li>
    <li> I love this liner. The only thing I&#x27;m still getting use to is the felt tip ( I&#x27;m used to brushes). I would repurchase again. Also I ordered this on my husbands profile, so just in case this is his wife. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyeliner after watching a YouTube video from leighannsays, and I am so glad I did. I was a little hesitant to buy a liquid eyeliner since I didn&#x27;t have any experience with them, but she said that the felt tip made it easier to apply. The applicator glided right across my eyelid without any snagging, and I mastered it on the third try. The color is indeed as black as it promises, and it has held up through light rain, tears, and exercise without running or smearing. What impressed me the most was that it didn&#x27;t transfer to my upper eyelid/crease area as most eyeliners do (thanks to my hooded eyes).&lt;br /&gt;One thing that some people might view as a con is that after it dries, it can flake off with rubbing or pressure. Personally, I like that it does that since I can flake off parts of my eyeliner with a Q-tip if I mess up; no makeup remover necessary.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and make straight lines. Smooth and does not get clumpy.</li>
    <li> My favorite liquid liner is Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7 liner in Perversion. When I ran out though, I didn&#x27;t have $18 to replace it at the time - so I went with this. In comparison to that, this liner isn&#x27;t that good (UD&#x27;s is super-jet-black and waterproof with a better brush). But on it&#x27;s own, and for a drugstore liner it&#x27;s pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;People who aren&#x27;t used to liquid liner may prefer the &#x27;brush&#x27; on this as it&#x27;s not a brush, it&#x27;s a thin piece of foamy material that has give. Sort of like marker style liners but more flexible. I personally don&#x27;t like it, having learned with a brush I find it a little bit of a pain. I dislike how i frequently have to redip and shake the bottle at least a few times per eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the liner is actually ON and done with though, it&#x27;s decent. If you don&#x27;t rub/touch your eyes or get wet or cry or sweat it should last... haha. For daily wear I don&#x27;t mind it, but for longterm (all night, through hot days, or something like that) you may wanna look else where. I&#x27;m trying not to be too hard on this product, given it&#x27;s cheap price, and regardless of my dislikes I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars. Would I buy it again in a pinch? Maybe. But I would be tempted to look elsewhere as well... but this is mostly due to preference rather than it being a &#x27;bad&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> This was the first eyeliner that has actually worked for me. I only use it for the top lids and it goes on smoothly and lasts all day. I&#x27;m never going to use another kind</li>
    <li> This is a great liner if you like liquid liner, it works great for a winged eyeliner look, and it stays on all day. I&#x27;ve worn this eyeliner for over 12 hours before and it didn&#x27;t smudge one bit. Very easy to use, and I&#x27;m planning on buying this again in the future!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the first time. I wanted to give a new product a try.  It worked out great!  It&#x27;s precise but the best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge onto my eye crease.</li>
    <li> Okay, bought this is brownish black accidentally and it worked fine.  I liked it so much that I went back to buy it in black.  But now I&#x27;m realizing that this is just not as great as I originally thought.  The black one flaked and smeared immediately after about 2 hours or so.  And now I&#x27;m finding that the brown one is doing the same.  It seems Maybelline has changed the quality of their liners.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of using a crayola-type marker. The color is not very dark and the line is hard to draw thin...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The tip is quite nice to make fine flicks, but the pigmentation isn&#x27;t strong enough that the points are consistently dark with the rest of the line. You have to flick and then fill it in to darken, which then doesn&#x27;t make it as fine. The liner itself stays put, but only when you leave it alone. At the tiniest amount of moisture or touching, it will smudge and disappear, which is annoying. Application and the fine point is nice, but it&#x27;s a weak liner that smudges, which is not optimal. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Im a total eyeliner girl, so I LOVE THIS LINER. It&#x27;s dark, and I don&#x27;t have to reapply! It last all day! One thing is that it can be super liquidy, but it&#x27;s easy to take off at night.</li>
    <li> The only eyeliner I have found that allows me to paint fine lines the entire life of the bottle. Tip doesn&#x27;t fray or blunt. Once applied lasts all day even through sweaty mid-day work outs! (I play work league sports at lunch). Great product!</li>
    <li> I used the Maybelline Unstoppable Eyeliner with this liquid eyeliner. The Unstoppable eyeliners goes on very smooth and provides a base (dramatic look). I use the Precision Liquid Eyeliner to define around my eyes and create cat eyes, etc points at the end. Very easy to use and I actually prefer it over MAC&#x27;s liquid eyeliner pen. Cheaper and works just as well.</li>
    <li> I like Maybelline and this product is easy to use and stays on for a long time and easy to take off.</li>
    <li> great product, excellent price, can use for a verry fine line and excellent control of same. lasts a reasonable amount of time with daily use</li>
    <li> Seriously, fine line?? The tip is barely even tapered. I wear a cat eye nearly every day and I was just looking to experiment with different liners and you cannot make a super fine line with this fat thing. No. Just no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times before and find the tip to be the perfect size and flexibility to easily create thin or thick lines and get the wings I desire. The thicker or less pliable ones never work for me. This easily covers as much or as little as you want on your eyes. After a few hours the wings do seem to disappear, I would need to reapply, but usually it looks just fine without them once they rub off so I keep as is. You could also easily carry it around to reapply, the bottle is small and would go anywhere with you in pocket or purse.</li>
    <li> This was my go-to eyeliner for years! Goes on dark and with ease, also very budget-friendly.</li>
    <li> It is like a dry eraser eyeliner!!</li>
    <li> Have you ever fell in love with something, but tried other brands of it to be SURE it&#x27;s the best? That&#x27;s Mabelline Line Stiletto for me. It lasts all day, and you don&#x27;t have to be an expert at applying liquid liner to have that pretty cat-eye look. Practice makes perfect, be sure to keep the sponge tip laying flat alongside your lashes, and you almost want it to touch your lashes as you drag out the line. I&#x27;ve tried about 4 other brands, including higher priced brands and this one is MUST in my make up kit.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  The tube has a comfortable feel in my hand, which allows me to put a smooth line, right at the edge of my eyelid.  The liquid liner is also excellent.  Very smooth and moist and never clumpy.  For some reason, this eyeliner has become almost impossible to find in any store that I frequent.  I&#x27;ve looked all over.  Thank heavens for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and a very dark black! Didn&#x27;t dry out like some people said. Didn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day. Very easy to use and not messy! Overall I love this product and will definitely be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Best liquid liner I&#x27;ve ever used. Easy to use.....just have a steady hand. Best price found on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item is as advertise. Beller good.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like the applicator for this eyeliner. I&#x27;ve been using liquid liner for a few years now and this applicator is the hardest to get the thin line I like.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to the fluidity you get with this liquid eyeliner. The brush applicator is perfect for building intensity without taking any product away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle in March 2013 and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> It works really well and is easy to use. It just  dried out faster than expected. I would recommend this to beginners trying to get that cat eyeliner look.</li>
    <li> This is my first liquid eyeliner. I was excited when I received this package. My first impression with this liquid liner is that the product is very watery. I feel like the brush (which is felt by the way) holds too much product at times and the other times, it hold too little product. The liner stays very well. It doesn&#x27;t flake or anything like that. It is not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush took away one star from the review. The brush is not thin at all. In fact, it is quite thick. There is no pointy tip to make a good cat eye. Instead, the tip is kind of a square, so it&#x27;s really hard for me to get a precise flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this eyeliner was okay, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner. So I usually use the felt tip Liquid Eyeliner pen from Victoria Secret but I needed a cheaper replacement. This has become more than a replacement! Its now in first place. I can do the &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look that I love to do a lot easier with this and the line is a perfect size!</li>
    <li> Great! The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is just a thin plastic piece - it is perfectly shaped for a thin, modest line.  Of course, you can make it as thick as you want. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product, it actually stays on even after a sweaty workout. It doesn&#x27;t clump but definitely be careful with the type of lotion you use around your eyes. It works best if you use a non-oily lotion.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is wonderful, I&#x27;ve been buying it for years!  Great control, fine line, and dark thick coverage.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Line Stiletto Ultimate Precision Liquid Eyeliner,. This eyeliner is very pigmented and last the whole day, I will repurchase it.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is okay.I would not recommend it, though. I constantly find myself dipping and dipping the felt tip back in the bottle, and in the end,it looks very messy.Get the E.L.F liquid liner instead for only $1!!! This eyeliner is a RIP OFF</li>
    <li> Really nice and very black but does not stay on long.</li>
    <li> Doesnt even stick to my eyelids properly!</li>
    <li> in don&#x27;t like it, it takes too long to dry and it smudges easily.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! I purchase this eyeliner on subscribe and save. They last a long time but I love having extras around to give to friends and family whenever they ask me for eyeliner recommendations. The liner applies so very dark and the applicator is flexible to create the perfect cat eye. Totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this eyeliner. There are steps to take to use the product correctly though. First you have to shake it properly and I&#x27;m glad the product has a ball bearing inside that you can actually hear. The formula is a bit watery but I don&#x27;t really have a problem with it because I have a steady hand. It&#x27;s opaque on the first application especially if you have eyeshadow primer on underneath but wait for it to dry and fill the line in with another layer and the black or brown becomes more distinct. I like it because it wears all day without flaking or smudging unless you&#x27;re one of those people that touch their eyes incessantly.</li>
    <li> Pigmented, black, and easy to apply. It has a felt tip applicator, which makes application a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Good quality item, very well packaged</li>
    <li> Delivery was good on time.But when i opened it was dried.Very disappointed with this item.m returning now.&lt;br /&gt;I took ultra maybelline eye liner in store.It looks good</li>
    <li> A good liquid eyeliner.  Goes on easy and smooth.</li>
    <li> worst liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> So far this is one of my favorite eyeliners the tip is perfect for precision my friends always ask me what kind of eyeliner i use honestly this is by far one of the best eyeliners ive ever used the color is nice and dark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly satisfied with this product. It does not smudge or disappear during the day, and it&#x27;s waterproof. Its also very easy to apply and you get a nice thin line. If you do make a mistake, you can simply use a dry q-tip to rub it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product to makeup experts or anyone who wants high quality eyeliner. It is a very satisfactory liquid eyeliner, but not superb or high end.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Leaves a fine line under or over.  Repeat customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very displeased with this product. After having read all the reviews I was expecting something great but was very disappointed. The eyeliner itself arrived very dry and when I tried putting it on it looked really bad. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Favorite Eyeliner of all times.</li>
    <li> Great liquid liner! The tip is long &amp; easy to use. Formula lasts all day!</li>
    <li> My favorite eye liner!!!</li>
    <li> Came out great I love using stiletto!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner but for some reason when I ordered it (instead of buying in store) the formula was thin, watery even. I would not buy this from online ever again. Buy it from the store, its worth it.</li>
    <li> My fave eyeliner ever!)!!! Works great!!!</li>
    <li> after a month this cakes up and becomes thick. Idont think I will buy this one again</li>
    <li> This is probably the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. When I use it, the lines come out perfect! It&#x27;s basically the easiness of the pencil and stays as long as regular liquid liner. Will probably buy more when I am running low!</li>
    <li> While this is called a liquid liner, it&#x27;s more of a marker. This is the only reasonably priced eyeliner I have which goes on so smoothly, doesn&#x27;t run&amp;won&#x27;t smudge. One can easily spend upwards of $20 on a good eyeliner but this is certainly comparable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great eyeliner, soft.</li>
    <li> not so good.I should use it more than 5l times to make eyeliner full on my eye</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sworn by this eyeliner for 5 years now and it has never done me wrong. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other types of liquid, but this always comes out on top. And plus, you can get it at your local drugstore! It&#x27;s a must if you want a sharp line. And it&#x27;s easy to take off with makeup wipes (and water if you&#x27;re in a desperate situation).</li>
    <li> This is barely pigmented! It moves all day long. It disappeared within 2 hours. You have to use several coats of it to make it look slightly black so atleast it looks like you have some eyeliner on. I was so angry when I went out confidently with a nice winged liner and looked in the mirror like an hour later to see one wing there, and one gone. horrible product. dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> This liquid eyeliner is terrific. it goes on smoothly and i absolutely love it! Im going to be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, glides on nicely.</li>
    <li> I normally buy this eyeliner at the store and it is the best!! BUT ---- i just received this eyeliner and it is very dry and flakey and seems old.</li>
    <li> Smooth application&lt;br /&gt;The applicator puts the liquid eyeliner on very precisely and with ease&lt;br /&gt;Dries instantly&lt;br /&gt;And is easy to take off at the end of the night without scrubbing,</li>
    <li> If you barely touch it. It will come off. Will disappear after 20 minutes from when you put it on. It goes on really nice but will not stay on.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get a precision line. liquid eyeliners aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> super great quality!!! Very good purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she likes it. She had to practice the application but got the hang of it pretty quickly. She likes this eyeliner and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted!</li>
    <li> I have been using this liner for a few months, and so far no problems. I also have oily lids as one other buyer mentioned, but for me this liner stays on until I go to bed. It isn&#x27;t thick, but I like that. I sometimes draw the outer line, and then fill in to the lash, and sometimes do it in one line. The applicator allows more control than something that goes on thicker. I have not had any problems with clumping, but I to shake the bottle each time that I put the brush back into it. There is a little ball in it that mixes the liner liquid and keeps it from clumping. I am glad to see it offered on Amazon at a subscription price. This also saves me a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed useing this one. I like the thin line and the prioce is good.  I ordered this one because of the prime shipping.If the shipping is added to the price it makes the total price too high.</li>
    <li> Pencil eyeliners never really work for me, and this was my first liquid eyeliner. It is very easy to apply, comes off when you want it to,, but stays when you want it to stay on. It lasts the day, makes my eyes bold without looking fake, goes on evenly, and is overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I tried out this eyeliner today, and I was not pleased with how I looked at all. As so many people have pointed out, it does not stay on very long - maybe 10-20 minutes if you&#x27;re lucky - and then it starts to flake off. Even worse, it&#x27;s hard to apply since the liquid is extremely runny. I will not buy this eyeliner ever again and I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It is great for blending real and fake eyelashes together, or used on its own. It really enhances your eyes and I recommend it as a top eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I love the way this goes on my eye but it doesnt last very long at all and it stinks!</li>
    <li> Best eye liner ever. I have brown eyes and with the black color my eyes have never looked better. The felt tip makes better precision so perfect every time. A++</li>
    <li> The applicator doesn&#x27;t seem to get enough product on there, as in your need a few layers for it to be opaque. When you do get it looking nice, it flakes off throughout the day and rubs off very easily. It will come off with the slightest bit of water. I&#x27;ve tried many liners and this is one of the worst!</li>
    <li> This is a rock star eyeliner! I love the width of the applicator and it is easy to apply.  The color is great and it goes on smoothly and stays put!  One of the best liquid eyeliners I have ever used and I plan on purchasing again in the future!</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this liquid liner because I have another liquid liner from Maybelline that is not so forgiving (http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Ultra-Liner-Liquid-Waterproof-135L-01/dp/B000052WYN/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361514282&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;maybelline+ultra+liner), and surprisingly more expensive, but went ahead and purchased anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the easiest liquid liner to apply that I have used and it lasted all day without peeling or flaking off, unlike their alternative product I listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this budget eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Goes on fairly smooth but I can&#x27;t tell which send holds the fluid to refresh the brush. Its not the same brush as the picture. What I received is more like a marker filament though much finer. Good product for and intermediate or professional.</li>
    <li> The bottle was like half full even though the package was intact, and it&#x27;s not waterproof at all! I think it might be a spoof.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it&#x27;s cheaper than in the store</li>
    <li> easy to use and great results</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to liquid eyeliner, so far this is the only one I have tried but I love it.  It&#x27;s easy to put on and stays on all day.  No smudges or running.  And I received 3 eyeliners,  not sure if that was correct or not bit is a great deal for 3.</li>
    <li> Precise in its tip.  However, runs and smears when coming in contact with water.  Doesn&#x27;t wear evenly.  Gel eyeliners might be a better buy.</li>
    <li> Very decent, liquid eyeliner. Stays on for a long time and is simple to apply.&lt;br /&gt;My only con was that after 6+ hours it flakes all over the place! Keep it handy to re-apply.</li>
    <li> Was not as black as I had hoped for and it dried out pretty quickly. Quite disappointed tbh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of the tip, but it works.</li>
    <li> doesnt go on eye smoothly and smears easily i got quite a few because they were cheap, but not good product  now just sitting in my make up bag not being use will not order again</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of liquid eyeliner because all the ones I&#x27;ve used smudged or flaked off. However, when I purchased this item, I was extremely happy. The eyeliner was very easy to put on as you can hold it like it&#x27;s a pen. the wand is perfect size, not too thin and not too big that will make a person draw on huge crooked lines. One thing about me is I sweat so it is hard for me to find any kind of make up. i apply this eyeliner around 9ish in the morning. I don&#x27;t take it off till about 2am and around that time, the eyeliner is still on perfectly, even when i sweat. This is by far the best liquid eyeliner that i have tried. Is this worth it? I&#x27;d say so. I read reviews of some and some say it doesn&#x27;t stay on. It stays on for me so I find that troubling to read.</li>
    <li> would not buy again&lt;br /&gt;do not like tip or thickness&lt;br /&gt;too faint&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;hard to use&lt;br /&gt;almost returned</li>
    <li> I was jacked on this product it was empty. Not even on the first time i got a decent line. I would never buy liquid make up again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it dried quickly</li>
    <li> Received the eyeliner on time, but when I opened it, the brush is missing so it is unusable. I would have to spend almost as much money as this costs to send it back for a replacement, so a $5 dollar eyeliner will cost me $10. I am so disappointed.  [...]</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Halloween party to complete a Mime make up.  I don&#x27;t normally wear make-up, so I am not sure what to expect.  So I just know that I had trouble making a continuous line, but that may have been me, not the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Good pigmentation, but the tip is not very precise and seemed to be cut off/blunt. I ordered two (by accident) but both had the same problem. Fortunately, amazon is awesome and refunded me for both, but overall I was not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Meh.. I have tried better , I guess its good for the price but there are better options in the same price range</li>
    <li> My mom and I love this eyeliner! I had one for the whole year! I&#x27;m surprised it lasted this long, other high-end eyeliners dry up so quickly in a month or two but not this one, this one is really good :)</li>
    <li> I wish there would be just a bit more fluidity to the actual eye liner.  It never seems like it&#x27;s liquid enough to give a perfect line.  Although this product is better than others I have tried.  I keep purchasing this, waiting for something better to come along, best I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I prefer liquid eyeliner that isn&#x27;t waterproof, because it&#x27;s much easier to remove at the end of the day. This is probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with powder and primer, it just slides a clear layer because the brush wipes all the pigment off. If you&#x27;ve ever written on a wet dry-erase board and noticed that the line is clear, except for the very very edges, which are pigmented? ...Yeah. That. No pigment transfer. If you moisturize your eye area, apply sunscreen, etc., this stuff will not transfer any pigment, and just slide greasily across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hunt to replace my discontinued not-waterproof Sephora eyeliner continues. :(</li>
    <li> I used to wear this all the time but stopped once a friend gave me a waterproof Sephora liquid eyeliner. I just recently decided to go back and give this another try. I am not so sure if I like it anymore, though. It doesn&#x27;t last the whole day and starts getting in the creases of my eyes after a few hours of wear. I don&#x27;t remember it doing that when I used to use it some odd years ago. It gets a little flakey as well. I am not sure when I&#x27;ll make time to stop by Sephora, but when I do, I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
    <li> It goes on dark and it brings out the color of my eyes.  It stays on and has not chipped and gotten into my eyes, like a product I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> the package came quickly. as for the product, i like it! don&#x27;t love it, and heres why. after supplicating the eyeliner onto the first eye, i guess it gets dry or something. because the second eye it just doesn&#x27;t go on as well. but it does look nice on and gives a high priced look. 4 stars!</li>
    <li> I am only rating this three stars because there isn&#x27;t much in the container at all. It lasted about five applications, using a thin line o  my upper lids. But, it never fades, so I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for years for a new eyeliner since maybelline discontinued the one I used since Jr high.  I absolutely love this eyeliner!! 👌👌👌</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! IS A BEAUTIFUL AND EASY PENCIL, LOVE THE BLACK INTENSE AND THE SHAPE OF THE BRUSH! 100% RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> used this to line my lids and create a winged tip bad idea!.. the label says its blackest black but its brown!.. I applied this on my arm and was amazed I said yayyy finally and after it was dry it did not budge but went in to apply it to my lids after I applied a gold coloured eyeshadow it was just a messy brown line and definitely was not able to create a wing so very very disappointed its 6 bucks WASTED.  I will try to use it again with no eyeshadow but then what is the point? chooops!</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use, even for a spaz like me.  The handle is  pretty long which makes it easier to hold, and the product lasts a while. It isn&#x27;t waterproof, but stays in place all day even when I am active. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got this yesterday and I gotta say, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product so far. The product goes on smooth, and the spongy applicator let me to hair-thin lines, like I like. A little bit of pressure at the end helped create a very slight wing. After seven hours out on the town, when I came home there was just a slight amount of flaking at the middle - I didn&#x27;t notice until I got up close with the express idea of checking how it was holding up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a couple other reviewers thought the product dried out too quickly in the bottle - I&#x27;ll continue to use this, and will update with a progress report in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for 2 or 3 years now. I absolutely love it! The only eyeliner that I will ever buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s officially my favorite liner. Really smooth, clean lines. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using liquid eyeliners and eyeliner pens all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is very easy to use and will make a very thin and fine line to enhance your lashes in a classy way. It took me less than one minute to finish both eyes, upper and lower eye-lid and I didn&#x27;t need to correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long it will last as I just started but for the Amazon price it&#x27;s well worth it, it&#x27;s more expensive in our local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Easy application wish tip was more skinny but still does the job. I would order again it looks very pretty and looks fresh.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner seemed to become empty almost immediately, I didn&#x27;t feel like it came with enough liner liquid and had to get a replacement within a month and I was alternating with another liner at the time, so that seemed really fast.</li>
    <li> I got this today, and I was really excited. I right away opened it up and ran to the mirror to put it on, and was right away disappointed for two reasons. The applicator is not nearly as thin as it looks in the photo, its actually kinda thick. This made using it under my eyes impossible because even with it barely touching the line was very think. I like a very thin line under my eye. Above my eye it looked alright but its harder to use than if the applicator was all one size. The 2nd thing I didn&#x27;t like was that you have to dip it, I didn&#x27;t think it would be a issue but I had to dip it about three times just to go over my eyes once. I am going to switch back to Maybellines master precise eyeliner, the only reason I switched was because this has more eyeliner in it and I thought I would get more bang for my buck.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner. Stays on, but easy to clean off</li>
    <li> My fav eyeliner.  Easy to apply with the foam brush and doesn&#x27;t swear or run easily.  Can be hard to find in the store. So I love that I can get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this eyeliner in the past. Tried many other liquid liners, including too faced, smashbox, tarte, but this is still my favourite go-to liquid liner. Very opaque and precise, doesn&#x27;t smear, and the little tube lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> This was the easiest for my teen daughter to apply when she was finally allowed to wear eyeliner after what seemed an eternity (to her).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to apply since the brush is literally just a point that&#x27;s kind of flexible. It doesn&#x27;t hold much eyeliner so you have to reapply to make it show. Since it&#x27;s liquid, applying or going over a spot more than once will sometimes remove the eyeliner put there by the brush so you have to just wait for it all to dry and reapply. It&#x27;s a bit tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to remove. Water basically gets it off without need of anything else.</li>
    <li> The color is deep and rich, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily. Good for on the go or any time.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect eyeliner.  It is easy to apply a straight line and stay on all day.  I love it.</li>
    <li> So much easier to apply than the liquid eyeliner of old.</li>
    <li> this is the only product i use for eyeliner, you can tell how much i love it. I tried tons of product, you name it, I tried it. But this is definitely the best one. It doesn&#x27;t smear, even if during a sweaty or work out day! Also it&#x27;s so easy to remove, just wet napkins would do. This is definitely best product that&#x27;s out there for the cheap price. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on all day long.</li>
    <li> Goes on great and is easy to handle!</li>
    <li> This is the first liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve purchased, and it works really well. Nice fine tip, I wear it a lot. Gets a little cracked after about 10 hours but I think that&#x27;s normal for liquid liners. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> i love this eyeliner its amazing its so easy to apply and it doesin&#x27;t hurt my eye when i apply it doesin&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> This is much easier to apply than a pencil eyeliner and it stays on all day. It looks very professional.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly how it was described. The line is dark and applies smoothly. I use this after I apply eyeshadow and do not have any issues with the liner smudging or rubbing off to other parts of my eyelid throughout the day.  Also dries very quickly and the sponge brush is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got a dried out one, so was very disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried this liner before and it&#x27;s great so I&#x27;ll stick to buying it at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> it is not fixed long time</li>
    <li> Very impressed, wasn&#x27;t expecting much based on the price and I am very pleasantly surprised. Ease of use, the color is solid and goes on smooth, once applied it&#x27;s set for the day. Been using it for about a month now, will often check towards the end of the day to touch up or reapply and always surprised that it still looks fresh. Will purchase again, would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely better than the Covergirl Line Exact which I purchased and reviewed favorably before.</li>
    <li> I only wear this kind of eyeliner. Its easy to use and it washes off nicely if you make a mistake applying it. It stays on all day without flaking.</li>
    <li> this liquid eyeliner is an absolute must. I love the brush, it makes drawing lines easy. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a person who loves wearing eyeliners; I&#x27;ll say this is one of the best. It lasts like most eyeliners and the best part is that it&#x27;s super easy to use. The color is bold, and I will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smear. I only use this everyday and it stays put through the whole day. Product came the next day too</li>
    <li> More liquid, ran out too fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!my fave i liner no mess getting it on</li>
    <li> The tip is flexible enough but too soft doesn&#x27;t help with control. Good liquid liner doesn&#x27;t budge and comes off with easily if wiped off. Not a good liner for beginners.</li>
    <li> i like it, its easy to use.. just seemed dried out when received...</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner Ive ever owned. Does NOT leave a crease on upper lid and stays put all day</li>
    <li> Only liquid liner I will ever use!</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time with the typical liquid liner but this one is pretty easy to use creating a consistent smooth line</li>
    <li> Works great I love it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my $1.00 elf Liquid liner works better than this. The brush really isn&#x27;t that thin like other liners I use. and its very flimsy easy to make mistakes. It was light and I had to try to build the color up to a solid line. It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth its like a water affect where it goes on and sort of separates. Its hard to explain but it just didn&#x27;t live up to the the reviews. I tried  it many different times, but it always needs to be applied over and over to get a semi pigmented line. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the felt tip that absorbs the product to much but it just seemed like there wasn&#x27;t much product in the container. Then if you put another coat over it can start to peel off. I will just stick with elf! it&#x27;s cheaper and I can get it at target so no shipping fee.</li>
    <li> Nice dark color, easy to use. No dragging like with some pencil liners or dry ones. This goes on smooth, it&#x27;s easy to make a thin or thick line and you can correct it easily before it dries. Once it&#x27;s dry, it has some lasting power, but I have noticed at times it&#x27;s worn or smeared off in areas. I use this and the gel liner with the brush to dip. I like both but think the gel has a better staying power. Any oil, even a creamy eye shadow will make this swear &amp; come off. The gel one hold on better. It&#x27;s a good product, cheap price, just not the best. But in this price range, it performs well.&lt;br /&gt;Jenn</li>
    <li> Its a great eyeliner. Does thin or thick lines i love it</li>
    <li> It perfect for my needs. I receive on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the best precision liquid eyeliner I have yet to find. The black color is a dark black and can be applied as thin or thickly as desired. Best of all, it only needs to be applied once for a work day. If you&#x27;re going out again at night, I would reapply a little bit on the end of the eye for a cat eye, but otherwise no need to worry about it. Also comes off easily!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is O.K. It is unforgiving if you don&#x27;t have steady precise hands to apply it.Being a sufferer with M.S. I certainly don&#x27;t.I got it for a great price with free shipping, so I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> Requires a steady hand but great product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite liner. It does a great flick at the edge of the eye, easily. I have been a loyal customer for a long time. I like it that much. Many cosmetics I change each time and try new stuff but this is one I always keep on hand. I hope they never stop making it. The applicator is just flexible enough and just thick enough to make a easy, everyday flick.</li>
    <li> This was a great fix for my oily lids. I had previously been using a friend&#x27;s Revlon liquid pen and loved it... but when I tried to buy my own pen the ink wouldn&#x27;t show up at all... It was fine on paper but once it touched the skin... nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff sticks to my eyelids all day long. I will admit it took some getting used to though.</li>
    <li> I have extremely oily skin, pencil liner smudges &amp; melts. I&#x27;ve tried other liquid eyeliner and they stayed on a good portion of the day. To be honest, I&#x27;m not too impressed with this. The stick is super fine so if you want a thicker line, be prepared to go over it a few times. Also, it tends to flake around the edges so I find myself reapplying constantly. It&#x27;s ok for a drugstore brand on a budget, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I hate the fact that once you do the line you cannot go over it or it will erase it. This should not be happening from a liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;ve never had this experience with any other company. But I can say that it stays on for a few hours</li>
    <li> LOVE, love the amazing long lashes results from this mascara, HOWEVER I can no longer wear it because it causes such intense itchiness and irritation in my eyes, so beware of that.</li>
    <li> Might be the ideal eyeliner for some but I found it just too thin. You have to wait until it dries to widen the line, otherwise you&#x27;re just smudging and fading the initial line.</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeliner but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so i ordered it off of amazon. when i previously purchased this item in stores it was a rich black but when i got this in the mail it turned out to be watery and faded. i have to apply several coats for anything to appear noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love this liner easy to apply</li>
    <li> This is my favorite liquid liner. It goes on very nicely and the applicator doesn&#x27;t dry up after a week like a lot of other products. The tube lasts for a long time so I feel like I get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> My favorite liquid eyeliner! I&#x27;ve used others like stila and tarte, but the felt pen tip eyeliners tend to dry out SO quickly for me. I like this one because I can easily wing my eyeliner and not dry up the pen as quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually good with liquid eyeliners but even I am able to use this one. It goes on smooth and looks great.</li>
    <li> I find that the markers work best for me when it comes to making wings and precise lines.</li>
    <li> love this product. been using it for years. but just changed to mac fluidline for extra precision. do go back and forth though</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. The problem, it came partially dry. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good product and less expensive than higher end products.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for the price. I use it when going out, not as an everyday where. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and looks very nice when on.</li>
    <li> Lets just say a girl from Mac asked me what liner I used because it looked so well done, even better than the ones they carry. The trick is in the felt tip. Best liner ever.</li>
    <li> Looks good for a couple of hours but it cracks and flakes off before the end of the day. Now I only wear this if I&#x27;m just going to dinner or a party at the end of the day anyway</li>
    <li> good product, good price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> My most favorite eyeliner. I use the blackest black, and it truly is black. The felt tip brush gives it amazing precision. I have oily skin so a lot of the eyliners I&#x27;ve used previously would smudge, leaving a line right above my lid. This one doesn&#x27;t. I recommend it to anyone who needs an eyeliner that&#x27;ll stay on and is precise when applying.</li>
    <li> This gives a nice clean fine line to your eyelids.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple years but found that the color was not as dark as I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine, I just bought it because I wanted to try liquid eyeliner, I think ill stick to pencil</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter only likes Maybelline!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this eyeliner. It is easy to apply and stays put all day.</li>
    <li> I have had this liner for a year now. And it is still working! It does not smudge. The brush in it is very good. I absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner! It is easy to use and very precise. It stays all day and I have used it with no issues every day for a couple years now. Easy to apply and to remove.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in 3 days with regular shipping, so that was great! I tried it on over eyeshadow and it wasent that good. It is really easy to put on, but I had to add 3 coats in order to get a nice cat eye. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again..</li>
    <li> been using this eye liner for year, does not clump, always goes on smooth. easy to apply to top eye lid or under eye. great amazon pricing!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It&#x27;s dry when I received it</li>
