      <li>It beats every drugstore skincare product for sure.</li>
      <li>The answer for most is “Yes, but...”</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Yummy scent and flavor, and no nasty chemicals or pesticides.</li>
      <li>it is perfectly safe to have a drop in a glass of water three times a day.  </li>
      <li>ok...</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this scent.</li>
      <li>Both turned out fantastic. :)</li>
      <li>I am excited :)</li>
      <li>If you use a recipe, a greater measure of both success and safety is more assured.</li>
      <li>This product has a very strong pleasant lemon smell and is packaged in a bottle that only allows a drop at a time to be removed.</li>
      <li>I have been buying NOW FOOD products for a long time now and found them to be very good.</li>
      <li>Smells and works super!</li>
      <li>Also great to add to home cleaning solutions or for essential oil mixes.  </li>

      <li>, I will certainly use this vendor again, it is unfortunately a rare thing to find competent, efficient customer service these days, so these guys get a gold star.</li>
      <li>Clean, fresh taste and scent.</li>
      <li>It is refreshing to know that this merchant cares enough to read the reviews, which I&#x27;ve only experienced perhaps 3 times in all the years I have been an Amazon customer.  </li>
      <li>it gives off such a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with how it rids away most bugs and spiders after a few days.</li>
      <li>I have had a lot od success with Now Fiids products, so I thought I would try this oil.</li>
      <li>you need a immune system boost, make hot ginger root tea, a drop or two of this lemon oil, and honey.&lt;br /&gt;It will sooth a sore throat quickly</li>
      <li>love NOW products, they are always fresh, natural and consistently excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price is right as I used this product along with my homemade cleaners...  </li>
      <li>and you have a crisp lemon flavor.</li>
      <li>I am not sure that this would be a good thing to do for more than a few days at a time though, so would research it before using it like this more than a week.</li>
      <li>Not for children under 6 years old; use with caution and in greater dilution for children 6-years old and over.&amp;#34; ~ excerpt from &amp;#34;Modern Essentials 4th edition&amp;#34; http://goo.gl/dMhwV0</li>
      <li>I fully rescind my negative merchant review and give them 5 stars for going above and beyond for excellent customer service and follow through.  </li>
      <li>While it is decent, it is not as strong of a lemon scent as Young Living.</li>
      <li>It has a long shelf life, so I look forward to many uses.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s much cheaper than spending it on bug spray.</li>
      <li>I had also purchased the Cinnamon Cassia oil, and it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, and the customer service was extremely fast in helping me fix the problem.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Lemon Oil is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for human consumption by the FDA (21CFR182.20).</li>
      <li>in regard to the daily, if you are lucky, bathroom duties...where was this product 69 years ago?</li>
      <li>I love using essential oils, especially the lemon scent.</li>
      <li>It is a highly concentrated oil.</li>
      <li>I purchase only NOW Foods essential oils when possible and I have been satisfied with their quality as well.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Lemon essential oil is very good placed in a glass of cold water or tea.  </li>
      <li>I love to put this in my diffuser jewelry as well, something about lemon scent perks me up and makes me smile at random times throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Very soothing, simply healing.</li>
      <li>and I bought to add to natural cleaning agents.</li>
      <li>A complete body tonic.  </li>
      <li>So far I have used the lemon oil in my homemade foaming handsoap and my homemade toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Its natural and organic.</li>
      <li>The only wish I had is that it was long lasting and strong like their peppermint essential oil.</li>
      <li>When I first opened this and closed my eyes-</li>
      <li>I use it for diffusing, mixing into my natural cleaning products for an extra fragrance, and just to sprinkle around.</li>
      <li>Essential oils are typically labeled For External Use Only as a warning to use them very cautiously, even such pure edible oils as those from lemon or orange peels.</li>
      <li>They were especially gracious even though it was my own fault for selecting the wrong cinnamon fragrance, not theirs at all.</li>
      <li>also put it in hot water for a clarifying drink in the am mixed with a spoon of raw honey.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this pure, organic lemon oil! Smells great in diffuser and i use about 6 drops in my 40 oz. water jug. I can tell its from the peel, scent and taste is amazing. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as lemongrass, but nice smell.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm...ok...gotta say it...it works, if you know what I mean...in regard to the daily, if you are lucky, bathroom duties...where was this product 69 years ago?</li>
    <li> I have actually used lemon in my car oil diffuser and works great.</li>
    <li> This has such a wonderful aroma and is so uplifting. I use this w/ my body lotion and love it!</li>
    <li> Great Value for this product</li>
    <li> This is a good quality essential oil.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I put a few drops in my blended berry breakfast drink.  It has delightful flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I also put it in hot water for a clarifying drink in the am mixed with a spoon of raw honey.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a immune system boost, make hot ginger root tea, a drop or two of this lemon oil, and honey.&lt;br /&gt;It will sooth a sore throat quickly and you are definitely getting health benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I have been very pleased with NOW brand oils.  Love that it is organic.  :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product can be used in baking.</li>
    <li> great product and price</li>
    <li> I bought it for my water-- it is not a strong lemon oil taste but very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A lot of people ask if our essential oils are edible. The answer for most is “Yes, but...” Essential oils are typically labeled For External Use Only as a warning to use them very cautiously, even such pure edible oils as those from lemon or orange peels. Essential oils are very strong and even non-toxic ones may be irritating or uncomfortable if not used carefully and sparingly. If you use a recipe, a greater measure of both success and safety is more assured. The book Aromatherapy for Everyone is co-written by a NOW herbal specialist.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Lemon Oil is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for human consumption by the FDA (21CFR182.20). Dilute one drop oil in 1 tsp. honey or in 4 oz. of beverage (i.e. soy/rice milk). Not for children under 6 years old; use with caution and in greater dilution for children 6-years old and over.&amp;#34; ~ excerpt from &amp;#34;Modern Essentials 4th edition&amp;#34; http://goo.gl/dMhwV0</li>
    <li> This is a good lemon and is organic.</li>
    <li> Excellent lemon aroma and flavor.  I love the product, but not the vendor, it was shipped in a small plastic bag which was not enough protection from the mail service, and the seal was cracked and the product leaked out all over the thin bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I love NOW products, they are always fresh, natural and consistently excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 01/02/2014&lt;br /&gt;Vendor read this product review and contacted me to amend this issue and delivered a full refund, deciding to tackle the issue of the broken product with the postal service.  I fully rescind my negative merchant review and give them 5 stars for going above and beyond for excellent customer service and follow through.  It is refreshing to know that this merchant cares enough to read the reviews, which I&#x27;ve only experienced perhaps 3 times in all the years I have been an Amazon customer.  Kudos to their customer service department for taking the time to handle a small order for just over $11, I will certainly use this vendor again, it is unfortunately a rare thing to find competent, efficient customer service these days, so these guys get a gold star.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help with nausea. It seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Just perfect addition to my collection.  The price is right as I used this product along with my homemade cleaners...  extra aromatherapy!</li>
    <li> Another great oil and smells great. Used in several blends and works great</li>
    <li> Wow! When I first opened this and closed my eyes- I felt like I sliced through a fresh organic lemon! I use lemons everyday in my water and salads. I love the smell of lemon! I intend on using this in my essential oil diffuser I use everyday. I am excited :)</li>
    <li> Smells like you just squeezed fresh lemon and work great in my melt and pour soap.</li>
    <li> This product has a very strong pleasant lemon smell and is packaged in a bottle that only allows a drop at a time to be removed. It is for aromatherapy purposes and I bought to add to natural cleaning agents. On the bottle it is stated that you should not apply to skin so I don&#x27;t think it would be wise to drink it.</li>
    <li> Quality of this essential oil is perfect! I purchase only NOW Foods essential oils when possible and I have been satisfied with their quality as well.</li>
    <li> Great quality and Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m using this oil in my kitchen cleaning supplies. it gives off such a nice clean smell. i like buying now foods oils.</li>
    <li> Great for seasoning... also use it to flavor my water.</li>
    <li> This lemon essential oil smells amazing! I have had a lot od success with Now Fiids products, so I thought I would try this oil. I was not dissapointed. The lemon oil is amazing. A little goes a long way. It has a long shelf life, so I look forward to many uses. So far I have used the lemon oil in my homemade foaming handsoap and my homemade toothpaste. Both turned out fantastic. :)</li>
    <li> Great quality lemon oil. I bought it for my wife, but since she likes the smell, I dab some on. We also use it in our diffuser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to Young Living oils, but I selected the Now Lemon oil as it was slightly less expensive. While it is decent, it is not as strong of a lemon scent as Young Living. If I use two drops of YL and rub it on my palms, the scent lasts for hours. This oil hardly last one hour before I could no longer smell it.</li>
    <li> Please use a hemp compound for lids</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I put it in my green tea with honey sometimes in the morning.  Also great to add to home cleaning solutions or for essential oil mixes.  I guess it is food grade.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with drinking a couple drops a day.</li>
    <li> This oil is of good quality. I use it in my water. One drop for every 8 ounces. It is a highly concentrated oil.</li>
    <li> I love using essential oils, especially the lemon scent. I use it in my hair and as a skin care regimen. The only wish I had is that it was long lasting and strong like their peppermint essential oil.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is definitely ESSENTIAL to my healthy/beauty regimen. I dilute lemon oil in grapeseed oil for skincare! It beats every drugstore skincare product for sure. I love to put this in my diffuser jewelry as well, something about lemon scent perks me up and makes me smile at random times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> i combine this oil with tea tree oil for an awesome scent i like to burn during my yoga sessions.</li>
    <li> wonderful&lt;br /&gt;good&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading online about citric oils diluted in water help with spiders and bugs in homes. I gave it a chance because I have child in the house and didn&#x27;t want any crazy chemicals that could hurt him. We went around the house with a spray bottle with this and some water mix and just sprayed all the areas of the house. I was very pleased with how it rids away most bugs and spiders after a few days. You have to reapply about 2-4 weeks depending on humidity/rain. Plus it obviously leaves a lemon smell over some disgusting bug spray. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Plus it&#x27;s much cheaper than spending it on bug spray.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fast shipping. NOW is my favorite brand of EO&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh taste and scent.</li>
    <li> Lemon essential oil is very good placed in a glass of cold water or tea.  Stir before each drink as the essentials do tend to float.  I have been buying NOW FOOD products for a long time now and found them to be very good.</li>
    <li> It arrived in perfect in perfect condition and on great time.  The oil is delicious smelling!  I use it for diffusing, mixing into my natural cleaning products for an extra fragrance, and just to sprinkle around.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to add to my homemade dishwashing and hand soap. Smells very nice! Someone asked if it is safe to drink. I believe you need to have &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; oil if you want to ingest it. But I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> this has a bright fresh lemon smell, and, as it is organic and therefore had no pesticides on the outer peel. it is perfectly safe to have a drop in a glass of water three times a day.  It is supposed to be liver cleansing.  I am not sure that this would be a good thing to do for more than a few days at a time though, so would research it before using it like this more than a week.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this for his mineral water and it is really refreshing. A few drops for a gallon and you have a crisp lemon flavor.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, simply healing. I will buy this product over and over.  The smell is as if you just cut a sweet lemon on a spring day. It clears my head of all worries--momentarily. Nice way to change the CD of the mind...</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I read that lemon oil was a good spider repellent.  I sprayed all around my screened patio.  Yes, the spiders ran away from it and it seemed to cut down the population, but a new application is necessary after rain.  I used this product so it would not be harmful to my dog who is in that stage of putting everything in her mouth.</li>
    <li> Awesome love it. Its natural and organic. I have used a few drops in my Pico De Gallo other then that I&#x27;m not sure if u can use it it drinkinv water.</li>
    <li> So happy.  This stuff improves any bodies health.  No toxic.  A complete body tonic.  Improves health, and removes toxins from the body.  But most of all it makes you feel great. The smell is like having a euphoric meal.</li>
    <li> Yummy scent and flavor, and no nasty chemicals or pesticides.</li>
    <li> A little thinner than I expected, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Smells and works super!</li>
    <li> I usually use the young living Lemon oil but wanted to get an organic oil since I use it for drinking and to make natural cough/cold medicine.  this stuff taste very different and has no effect as far as I can observe,  seems useless when I use in my cough syrup.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent. I even put it in my steam mop so the house is filled with a fresh, wonderful lemon smell. I had also purchased the Cinnamon Cassia oil, and it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted, and the customer service was extremely fast in helping me fix the problem. They were especially gracious even though it was my own fault for selecting the wrong cinnamon fragrance, not theirs at all. Not often do you find great customer service these days, so when I come across it, I want to tell everyone! Very happy customer, will buy from them again in a heartbeat.</li>
