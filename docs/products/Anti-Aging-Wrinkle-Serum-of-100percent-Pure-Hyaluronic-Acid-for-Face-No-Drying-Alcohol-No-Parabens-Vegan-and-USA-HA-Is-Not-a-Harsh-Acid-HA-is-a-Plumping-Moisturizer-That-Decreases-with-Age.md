<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Watts Beauty products for a few years now. I love the argan oil so much, for hair and skin you just can&#x27;t go wrong. Now that I&#x27;m trying to add some anti aging products to my skin care regimen I ordered the wrinkle filler. It works beautifully on damp skin under the Watts loose minerals and mineral veil. Just some eyeliner and mascara along with some argan oil on my lips for a little gloss and I&#x27;m ready.</li>
    <li> Love this product !! Highly recommend for any one !!</li>
    <li> Having been looking for a 100% hyaluronic and LOVE this product! I NEVER tell anyone to get a product EVER, but I emailed my gal pals about this one...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months, and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it is making a difference in my complextion. Maybe I will try another brand next time to see.</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with this product at all. I am not sure if the company changed their formula because a lot of people seem to have had a great experience with it. When I read up on this product, it was marketed as a wrinkle filler and I have to admit it did reduce the appearance pores and fine lines, but not nearly as well as other products I have tried. It has a thin watery consistency that makes it runny and when I went to pump it out of the bottle it squirted in the complete opposite direction making a mess. It didn&#x27;t have a great absorption factor and literally sat on top of my skin like oil on water for nearly a minute which had just been cleansed and dried. Once it finally absorbed, it felt unnatural like I had sprayed hairspray on top of my skin and it also felt a little tacky and sticky. I didn&#x27;t notice any sort of strange smell or discoloration like others have and perhaps this would work for someone who has deeper wrinkles and prefers a product that feels &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; and more oily, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Use it every morning and night and am liking the resulta.</li>
    <li> I just received this so I cannot review it yet. I will say, however, this is HMWHA (high molecular weight hylauronic acid) which is better than LMWHA (low molecular weight) so I am sure it will work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is based on the plastic bottle. I am concerned with packaging for foods, anything I use or consume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a #3 bottle, you can see from the bottom of the bottle. Numbers are always in a triangle at the bottom of the container. This is done so consumers can tell what it was made from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 is PVC (polyvinyl chloride). As you know, PVC plastics are used in building materials and other products as well as it is durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 is not the worst packaging but it is not the best either. I prefer to buy my beauty serums in dark colored glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark color protects what is inside and the glass is safer because it wasn&#x27;t made with harmful plastics, petroleum, chemicals or toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why my review is a only a 4 star and not a 5. I am hoping that the manufacturer will take this into consideration and change to dark colored bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that Amazon is selling this high quality HA serum and I will continue to buy it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will just have to take the time to pour the serum from their bottle into one of my own dark colored glass bottles and use their pump on the glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for this product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works or not.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!  The minute you rub the hyaluronic acid on your face, you see a huge difference.  The lines start to disappear and within weeks, you have a face that looks 10 or more years younger.  I use this with the MT Needle Roller.  After one week of hyaluronic acid and needle rolling, my face is line free.  I am 44 years old and the skin on my face looks like the skin I had when I was 20, no lie.</li>
    <li> I started using this product along with my micro-derm abrasion system and micro needle roller about a month ago. I love this product. My skin soaks it right up and feels very fresh. Being that my skin is on the oily side I find that most skin products were too heavy for me although I still used them. My skin also tends to break out. I have found that the Hyaluronic Acid just makes my skin look good. I&#x27;ve gotten complements on how my skin is looking which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh face. Works great with the other products: micro-derm abrasion system and micro needle roller. I would use it with one of these other products.</li>
    <li> I use this before I put my makeup in the morning.  I have dry skin around my forehead and use this before moisturizer and it helps keeps my face hydrated all day.  Great purchase and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive rosacean skin!</li>
    <li> I bought 5 bottles of this one since you could get a discount of $10 and also my sister and my friends also wanted to try this out.  We&#x27;ve read  many articles about how HA could help you to trap water into your skin, and it&#x27;s also a product that you should use when you&#x27;re using tretinoin (so it can prevent your skin from drying out). It was awesome. Really. It make my skin feel plump and smooth. But remember to use a cream moisturizer after applying HA to prevent it from evaporate.</li>
    <li> I received a free 2oz pump size through a promotion of purchasing other items. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and noticed the lines in my forehead are smoother and almost nonexistent. It&#x27;s difficult to tell if there is a difference due to this product, or whether I&#x27;ve been less stressed and haven&#x27;t been wrinkling my forehead as much. Also, the wrinkles in my forehead were not very deep, and were slightly noticeable, but now they are difficult to spot, even up close with magnification. The product itself is odorless and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. When applying it to my face, it feels slightly tighter if I use it alone. If I use it with my vitamin E moisterizer, then it doesn&#x27;t feel any different. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t seem to cause a reaction at all. I would recommend you give this product a try, especially if you can get some with another purchase, and see if you notice a difference.  I&#x27;ll still keep using it morning and night and once I run out, I&#x27;ll decide if I want to order more.</li>
    <li> I bought both this product and Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz. by Timeless Skin Care and I like this product much better. It comes in a pump bottle the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz. by Timeless Skin Care comes in a bottle with a dropper. I ordered the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz. by Timeless Skin Care on Dec.8 and the Watts Acid Solution on Dec. 10 and still received the Watts  by Dec. 15 the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure 2 oz. by Timeless Skin Care took more than twice as much time. Check out their reviews. If you don&#x27;t mind waiting for weeks and you would like a dropper then the products both work about the same for me. But I will always choose this product. They both come in a very small bottle and whenever you remove the dropper with the other brand it&#x27;s very easy to spill and at over $15.00 why take the chance?  To me the whole idea of computers and the internet is for convenience and speed and I will always choose the company that ships in a timely manner that is something the other company doesn&#x27;t seem to get.&lt;br /&gt;Part Two&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Watts skin care products for some time now and I am very happy with everything about this company. The quality of all of the products offered by Watts for the price is better than any other on Amazon. The Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free is a great product. The shipping is super fast and if a prime member it is also free.&lt;br /&gt; You should also check out Watts Beauty Retinol Optimized w/ Peptides / M3 Plus Copper &amp; Hyaluronic Acid Face Cream. I tried it and it is great. Look at the reviews.[[ASIN:B005SHEESY Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream 1.5% or 150,000 IU Per Oz / 4oz with Treatment Pump]]</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 2 weeks and cannot see any noticeable differences in the lines on my face.I am willing to give it more time since it took a lot longer for the lines to get there.</li>
    <li> Love this. great foundation for everything else I use.</li>
    <li> Love it! I noticed a difference right away! Ordering again!!</li>
    <li> BUY IT. Softer, firmer skin, less fine lines is what I have experienced with this little wonder. I put it straight into the fridge and it has been WONDERFUL. Only have had it a few days and already notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin moisture I&#x27;m pleased. Great hyaluronic accid It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Feel happy!  I will buy it again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after the good reviews online...I have to say that while I don&#x27;t dislike the product, I am not sure if it is all that&#x27;s is cracked up to be...the only thing I am going to try next is to use it with their Argan Oil and see if I notice a difference then.</li>
    <li> It is true this product adds moisture to the skin. Why spend money on expensive products if you can take a few drops here. I use it on my face. Use it especially for winter when the air is so dry</li>
    <li> Mix this with my DIY serums and it works perfect.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product a few days and I&#x27;m already hooked! My skin feels absolutely amazing after using this. It doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out and tight as it usually does. I have sensitive skin and this is gentle and I don&#x27;t feel any irritation at all using it. I have used similar items that cost more and and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel anywhere near as good as this does.I can&#x27;t say much about what it does for wrinkles as it&#x27;s still early in my experience but I&#x27;m pretty confident that it will work over time. I only gave it 4 stars as I have not fully experienced what this serum can do but I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just made 2nd purchase for this product.  That&#x27;s high praise for me.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my imagination that it&#x27;s not only making my skin feel smoother, but also improving the way my joints feel.  I used to think you had to take something internally for it to do any good, but now I&#x27;m coming to believe that many products are absorbed better through your skin, and they still have a systemic effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had contact Watts directly to find out that the preservative they use is fermented radishes, which sound good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: A few months later still using this product.  Basically all over my body.  I am a senior and am convinced that this hyaluronic acid is absorbed better through my skin than otherwise.  Love the fact that the only preservative is fermented radishes.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s too thick without adding a bit of water? It&#x27;s nice, dries quickly to a nice matte surface, great for using Bare Minerals or other powder like makeup. I had tried the Watts Beauty HA with vitamin C &amp; L Arganine. Turns out that one is loaded with chemicals...lots of long names. I immediately broke out with dozens of small red bumps with angry centers - almost like tiny boils. Nothing like that ever happened to me with any other product so I switched to the pure HA and all the little bumps went away immediately. Someone suggested that the Vit C in the other formula may have been the culprit Since I have pretty sturdy &amp; non sensitive skin I&#x27;d warn anyone with sensitivities to use this pure HA formula  and avoid the one that is mixed with Vit C &amp; other chemicals. If it makes my tough skin break out, I hate to think what it could do to someone with more delicate skin?</li>
    <li> after applying it holy s...it,my face felt super tight and dry,appear lots of little winkles,i don;t understand why,hyaluronic acid should keep and absorb  hydra for your skin,but this one isn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> After a week of using this product daily, I have not seen a dramatic change in my skin but there are subtle changes in the lines around my eyes and mouth. I&#x27;ve used it every night after cleansing my face and before applying my regular moisturizer. It is very easy to use and takes little time to apply. I like that there is no medicinal scent like other similar products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to update after a month of use and hope that there will be better results to report.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product handled my acne during that time of the month. The glow it gives is nice, too. I will be purchasing more when I run out, so I must like it, lol. I listened to another reviewer who uses this product with the Grace Antioxidant Organic Facial Toner. I LOVE it! Great find......</li>
    <li> Complitely dissatisfied with this product. Makes my skin very dry with absolutely no results that was mentioned by the seller. I wish I can returned and get my money back.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my skin , does it work miracles ? no but i keep ordering it because I like the product.</li>
    <li> COLOR CHANGED VERY QUICKLY FOR SOME REASON IT BECAME LIKE A DARK CARMEL COLOR, NOT SURE WHY.  I DID NOT NOTICE ANY CHANGE WHEN USING IT AND IT SEEMED WATERY.</li>
    <li> I am 56 years old and just got this product.  Only used for a week and no difference--not getting the results I saw others get but maybe need to use longer.  But it actually seems to dry my skin out horribly with 12 hours after applying.</li>
    <li> Still under review, so far liking the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> It makes the skin soft and radiant for some time. More time required to get result. one more month needed.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well, and the price point is great.  Simple, high quality ingredients at a bargain price.  I use this morning and night to keep my skin moist and reduce fine lines, and it works flawlessly.  I like the fact that the ingredient list is simple and contains no parabens or other unsavory chemicals.  I have tried numerous other brands, but always come back to this one.  It works the best, causes zero sensitivity (even around my eyes), and also has the lowest price.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> It burnt my face when it went on, I guess it is the radish root in it.  It is not pure it has natural preservatives and radish root in it.</li>
    <li> I like that t doesn&#x27;t contain all that artificial stuff.</li>
    <li> ... compared with another hyaluronic acid I used previously. I do like the container which puts out a nice little drop to mix with makeup.</li>
    <li> love love love this product.  have been using it for a month - it makes your skin feel amazing smooth and silky.  my skin feels perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this andh ave been using it for about three weeks now it I absolutely LOVE it! My skin feels so wonderful! I usually wash my face really good using my Sal3 soap followed by my microderm needle roller then I use this I let it soak into my face for about three or four minutes and then I use a light face moisturizer over the top my skin is great now! :)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I found out too late that hyaluronic acid absorbs moisture from the air (hence the reason it is best to use directly after bathing while skin is still damp and to seal in with perhaps a moisturizer).  I live in New England and have a wood stove.  After using this for a few weeks, the barely-there lines just starting to form around &amp; under my eyes are 10 times worse!  I look like I have aged 10 years in the space of 2 months.  It seems that as my wood stove has removed the moisture from the air so that when I used this product, the moisture was instead removed from my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using good skincare for years, but as soon as I began hearing about hyaluronic acid , I knew it was something I needed. However, the prices are crazy! What a find to find Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution. Not only is the price a bargain that I&#x27;m thrilled about, but the solution doesn&#x27;t have parabens or alcohol in it!! And wow does it do wonders! My skin feels like velvet when I put it on and my skin has already gotten more balanced and moisture then it was. I follow it with Retinol every other night and it&#x27;s working great. I highly recommend this!! Thanks Watts Beauty!</li>
    <li> I love this.  I like it pure and you can feel it.  I also really like it in a spray.  No complaints here!!  Seller was excellent in shipping and packing. The product sells itself.</li>
    <li> After using  it for few months, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have much difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this product. This product is suppose to be good for your skin.  I plan to use it as a scrub combined with sugar and also as a topical lotion underneath my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend.  Price was much less than she paid.  It&#x27;s a natural skin tightener.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and am happy with it, though effect does not last that long.  Still, anything that lessens wrinkles and tightens skin is a benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product.  In combination with proper face cleansing and (oil free) moisturizing, this product works well on fine lines and fair on deep wrinkles.  I am a man so maybe women will have even better results.</li>
    <li> When I pump the bottle it is hard to come out</li>
    <li> as you are misleading the public!!!  it is 1% of the volume in the bottle.  After doing research on the Hyaluronic Acid, I found that Hyaluronic Acid comes in a powder form not a liquid form.  This solution did nothing to improve my facial skin.  I did find that the solution is mixed with water, which the powder form is dissolvable in water which is all your product is.  I bought the powder which by the way costs 58.00 for one half ounce.  I use it in my face creams to help with moisturizing.  Hyaluronic Acid is not absorbed by the skin.  I use it at 2.5 % of my product that it is used in to help with keeping moisture to the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the pure acid solution for about 6 weeks. I use the Vanish eye cream first, then I dampen my forehead, face, neck with water and apply the pure acid solution, followed by the peptide complex (then Retinol Serum 5 at night), and Estee Lauder &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; cream for face and neck. My skin feels great but I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in fine lines, etc. However, my honey says my skin feels much firmer lately... and it &amp;#34;glows.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll give the credit to Watts! And I&#x27;ll use all the products till gone...then reassess!</li>
    <li> I used this religiously until it was all gone, and it made no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great skin care, After 60 my skin felt dry all the time, also travel for business all over the world nothing dries out your skin worse than air travel, After just a few days my skin was so soft and after I shaved no more sore skin. I liked this so much I ordered a bottle for my wife. My skin looks better everyday with each use. The product was delivered very fast as was my next order.  An update this company is the best, a small problem with one bottle and the sent another with no problem and offered a refund but this product is so good and really works fast. Thanks again[[ASIN:B00720ITUE WattsBeauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 30ml]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on top of my Emu oil at night to seal in the moisture. In the morning I notice that my skin looks like it does when I drink plenty of water and had plenty of rest, which is usually, but not always the case! I have pretty good skin but have noticed a few fine lines, now that I&#x27;m in my late thirties. This product seems to \\&quot;plump up\\&quot; those lines. If hydration is an issue for you, I would give this Hyaluronic Acid a try over your normal moisturizer. It seems to really boost it&#x27;s effectiveness. Why only 4 stars? I can detect a strange smell that no one can seem to smell but me! I&#x27;ve asked! LOL Other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my wrinkles but I mainly bought it for moisture. I have lived in the desert my whole life and have always suffered from dry skin, but I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin within the last week.  My skin feels more supple and I don&#x27;t have any of those flaky skin spots that are amplified after foundation is applied to the face.  However, I also purchased a warm/cool facial steamer that I have been using in conjunction with the serum and basic moisturizer such as, Ceravue PM and Cetaphyl 15 spf, so it could be a combination of all three things. The serum does not have a smell to me and I apply it using a fan brush, which helps me use less product.  I will continue using it, since I am noticing a difference in whatever it is.  Hopefully, when its time to order more, I&#x27;ll see less wrinkles too.</li>
    <li> It will save me a bundle on pedicures.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the high quality of this product.  I have been using it and notice a big difference in my skin.  I will be purchasing this again when I run out.  I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated my skin at all.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Have been using this serum for about 6 years and I always get compliments of how hydrated, clean, smooth and wrinkle free my face looks. I&#x27;m 40 now so that&#x27;s great that everyone notices.  For best results, I use immediately after I get out of shower while my face is still moist or as soon as I wash my face and let it dry, then I apply my moisturizer. I feel like I get the best results when I apply like that. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Thid product is easily absorbed and the skin feels much softer.  I have been adding some to CeraVe and find it a very ggod moisturiser.</li>
    <li> As a woman of over 6 decades old this solution has performed very well for me.  I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for four weeks now and rarely take the time to write reviews, but this one is worth it! My skin is relatively oily, and in my late 20s I still experience more blackheads on my forehead and the sides of my cheeks than I&#x27;d like. Although I can&#x27;t say whether this has made a difference on the fine lines around my mouth and eyes, I can certainly say it has improved my pores and decreased the frequency of pimples and acne. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because my skin is more moisturized and therefore less reactive, but the serum soaks into your skin quickly and leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth and soft without being oily. I recommend this to anyone who wants to moisturize without clogging pores and contributing to pimples or blackheads.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Only put on your wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been using daily and noticed a difference in about 2 weeks. I sent a bottle to my sister she noticed a difference around her eyes in 2 weeks also. I like it because it is all natural.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvements , been using this product for more than month every day ,combined with Watts Beauty Moisturizing Hyaluronic acid  (as recommended ) and Organ oil from the same company ,but it didn&#x27;t work for me and my face .I was waiting till all bottle is finished  to write this review</li>
    <li> I mix my own face cream and this is one ingredient I use.  By itself it is good also, I buy it regularly now and always will.</li>
    <li> Have seem much improvement! The wrinkles between my eyes have diminished,  and forehead wrinkles are barely there! Have only been using for less than a month!</li>
    <li> Literally a face lift in a bottle.</li>
    <li> THE HYALURONIC ACID GEL...IT HAS NOT BEEN A SUFFICIENT LENGTH OF TIME FOR ME TO RATE THIS...GOES ON SMOOTHLY AND DRIES QUICKLY..&lt;br /&gt;JOAN</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes my skin feel and look great.  I love the consistency.  I don&#x27;t smell any bad smell either</li>
    <li> I have seen results after only a couple of uses and like the purity of the product and compact size.</li>
    <li> I love Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution!  I put it on right out of the shower, let it dry a minute then put on my other oils.  I feel it makes my skin much smoother and ready to soak in the goodness of the other oils I use.  I have purchased this item from Watts Beauty 3 times and plan to keep doing so.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid is great for multiple screen usage. Great moisturizer, helps control break outs, tightens the screen around the eyes and long lasting.  Only thing is it makes your face a bit shinny.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a bit watery but went on easily. It absorbed well, and seems to moisturize. I have only used it a few days so I can&#x27;t say if it really &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; as claimed,</li>
    <li> While it is free of Parabens and most petro chemicals, it is not 100% Hyaluronic Acid. It is only a 1% Hyaluronic Acid  solution and the rest is a water based. It is a bit thin, but goes on smoothly and absorbs well. I have not seen any changes in my skin, but it might need to be used 2-3 times a day to seee any results due to the very low Hyaluronic Acid content.</li>
    <li> Really like this product</li>
    <li> I can tell that this solution tightens my skin.  I use a moisturizer with it so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry but then some of the tightness goes away.  I think it works like a mask, when you have it on your skin, you see a difference but as soon as you wash it off, your skin goes back to the way it was before you ever used it.  Good to use under foundation.</li>
    <li> It is not a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;; the product helps to keep the epidermis hydrated. As a &amp;#34;hydration&amp;#34; agent, the product is quite good.</li>
    <li> Was at first shocked at the watery consistency, but after the first application, I immediately felt my skin tightening.  I spritz it on everyday, before and after moisturing.  I have re-ordered this twice, if that further describes my opinion.</li>
    <li> Hyaluronic acid smooths and softens skin!  Medical versions used in eye and joint surgery! Not oily and used in cosmetics!  Actuallý is gentle and not acid!</li>
    <li> have been using this for a few months now. I have a rough complexion, but this has already started to make it clear and soft! After spending a fortune on philosophy and other products like it this is what finally is helping. Will continue to use, and be pleased with the difference it has made.</li>
    <li> wife loves it, said it feels like its working!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure what pure hyaluronic acid should be like, but this smells gross (one reviewer said it smells like spit so now every time I apply it...) and this leaves my skin feeling a little sticky/tacky after it dries. Doesn&#x27;t even feel like my face is moisturized.</li>
    <li> I USE IT ALONG WITH MY FACE CREAM TO HELP HOLD THE MOISTURE, PLUS I HAVE THE VITAMINE C WHICH I APPLY AFTER EVERY CLEANSING OF THE FACE.  I AM 75 AND GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY SKIN AND NO ONE THINKS THAT IS MY AGE.  I ALSO USE THE ROLLER DERM ABOUT ONCE A WEEK NOW - MORE OFTEN WHEN I STARTED BUT EXFOLIATION HAS BEEN EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin.  Oily enough that I use MANY oil blotting papers throughout the day and am still semi-shiny at times.  Luckily, the oil has kept me looking younger (seems like thin, dry skin wrinkles quicker) and since I&#x27;m older, I finally don&#x27;t break out like I was 17.  However, since I&#x27;m in my forties, I do realize that I still need to moisturize my skin to keep it looking fresh.  So, I mix a pump of this in with my serum and it works great.  That being said, it really isn&#x27;t great as a stand alone product.  It has a weird, semi-slimey texture--ON IT&#x27;S OWN--but is great when mixed with another moisturizer or product.  I can tell when I don&#x27;t use it; my skin starts to be a little drier but still oily and there is a huge difference between moisturized and oily!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I appreciate the size and value.  I use this product 2x per day (am/pm) and the results are fast.  The first time I used this, I noticed a difference within 3 days.  My skin was smoother and well hydrated.  I have also used this product on my knees and elbows that are a little discolored and they too are smoother, clearer and well hydrated.  This is a great product and a great value.  I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this without additives. This is just what I wanted. Goes on nicely and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Girls you have to buy this product. This is what is in all the spend face/ eye creams. I mix this with WATTS argan oil and my skin is doing just fine. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My 55-year-old skin is looking like I&#x27;m 40.  The pores on my nose are shrinking as are my wrinkles.  I use it with and without moisturizer.  It&#x27;s the perfect base for mineral makeup.  And the best part is that it&#x27;s manufactured in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> I love the moisture this brings to my skin!  I added it to my moisturizer, use it as a final step to seal in the moisture as well.  Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a year and am very happy with the result. Buying a 4oz bottle today.</li>
    <li> very strange texture on my skin. my skin got so dried and it looked soooo dried. everyone told me i got very aged with the wrinkles while i applied it. i used for a few weeks to see if it improves, but gave up. terrible, i discarded.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel after applying it it feel fulls firm and plump.</li>
    <li> this does exactly what it is supposed to do, and was priced accordingly.  I have no complaints and would repurchase this item in the future.  arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Hydrated my face in the beginning but now my face is used to the product and once again my face is dry!</li>
    <li> Love it, it&#x27;s light and most importantly not sticky.</li>
    <li> Goods just arrived.  I was supposed to get a free bottle of argan oil as part of a promotion.  The argan oil did not arrive.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My face feels so good after a cleaning and using this Hyaluronic Acid.  I leave a slight bit of water on my face before spreading the Hyaluronic Acid on, then let everything dry.  Sometimes I leave it at that, and other times I put on my night-time face cream, either way my face feels terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any dramatic results, but since I love the feeling of my skin after using it, I will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> I was worried because I have sensitive skin &amp; break up from lots of products. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with this. My skin seems to show less fine wrinkles. The price can&#x27;t be beat -a dermatologist, spa or salon would charge way more.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 3 months in conjunction with pure argan oil for my face. Immediately following a shower aI pat my face dry apply this solution then a small amount of argan oil. My face does not get oily throughout the day and it smooths out fine lines and wrinkles</li>
    <li> I tried this on half my face as one of the other reviewers had, just to see if I could really see a difference.  I knew going in that this is NOT a traditional moisturizer, so I put it on my skin, let it dry/soak in, then put moisturizer over it.  I use it twice a day.  After a few days I noticed a difference.  After a couple of weeks I started to look a little strange with one &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; side of my face and one &amp;#34;old.&amp;#34;  After a month of this, I started using it on both sides, but it took about three weeks for the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; side to catch up....&lt;br /&gt;This product adds volume to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it has had a huge positive impact on my undereye dark circles and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;Buying my second bottle now.</li>
    <li> I washed my face as soon as I got it, then applied it while still moist. I could feel tingling and my skin reacting favorably to it. I then applied my moisturizer and here&#x27;s why I loved it. This morning I woke up with a moist face to the touch! My face always feels dry, so imagine my joy!!!  I repeated the same process this morning and my face feels great. I don&#x27;t know about wrinkles yet, its too soon, but this definitely is promising....Thank you for this great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is remarkable! I have never used hyaluronic acid but it goes on nicely and leaves your skin feeling tight. I have already received a compliment from my sister. She ask me what I had done to my skin, as it had a very nice, glow and looked like I had some procedure done.</li>
    <li> I love Hyaluronic acid. I think the ampules by Reviva work much better than the serum. This serum did not plump up the skin as HA is suppose to. Will stick w/ the other brand.This was not worth the money as it did not work. I am a huge believer in HA but not the serum!</li>
    <li> Oh please, please DO NOT LIE when you write the title. it&#x27;s 1%. not 100%. who would think it&#x27;s 100% when you say &#x27;we contain 1% hyaluronic acid, but the 1% is 100%&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;ripped off. i wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if I knew better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer in both Hyaluronic Acid solution for skin, and this is a great way to get it. The serum feels so good on my skin and I can see a tightening right away. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few Hyaluronic  acid serums. I should have stuck with the one I knew works, but we all try to save a few dollars. ;(&lt;br /&gt; Their other products may or may not be good, idk, but this was a watery waste of money to me. I pay around $35 for a 4oz refill of another brand &amp; it&#x27;s thick, yet silky &amp; absorbs in skin with no greasy feel &amp; I noticed after my first use my skin was more plump &amp; radiant. This runs off your finger like WATER, &amp; seems to do about the same on your skin as H2O. It had many GOOD reviews so I chanced it? I&#x27;m sticking with what I know WORKS &amp; will save money on other things!&lt;br /&gt; Hope this helps someone who&#x27;s thinking of trying..  I can&#x27;t say if their other products are good or not?&lt;br /&gt;Jenn R</li>
    <li> Pure Hyaluronic. The other ones I bought had alcohol, and I did not realize it. I love this brand and I do believe it is helping with my wrinkles. The price is great and I will definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Actually does what it says it would. When I use this, it does tighten the skin, removing fine lines and tightening the deep nasolabial fold and under my neck, all signs of being in my fifty&#x27;s. The only downfall is the blackheads that I&#x27;ve gotten from it tightening my skin, trapping the oils (I guess this is the cause) inside. I had to go to the doctor (not that they were so bad, I just worry about things like that) to find out what they were and that&#x27;s what I was told. I don&#x27;t blame the serum, in fact, it worked just that good! I would recommend maybe washing your face very well before using. Also, splash cold water on your face and neck, and, leaving the water on, mix this in with the water, and let dry before adding any kind of makeup. The serum (which is thin as water), dries the skin as it dries, tightening it. Then put your concealer, foundation, etc. whatever you do. If you want something that will tighten your skin, this is it. If you expect your face to look as if you&#x27;ve just gotten a face lift, this is not your product. A facelift does that. Enjoy! I know I am.</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this on amazon and really like the way this makes my skin feel.  It softens my skin and helps to make some of my wrinkles smoothen out.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This made my face itch and I Discontinued use of this Product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I saw a huge different immediately.  And this keeps my skin hydrated.  What I&#x27;m doing is using 3 drops of this, spread on my face and neck, do 3 drops of argan oil, spread it, then put on my moisturizer.  Works great!!!!</li>
    <li> When added to my makeup routine each morning, this product has made quite the difference.  My complexion is looking much improved thanks to it!</li>
    <li> I had some products that were missing the hydration i was looking for. This made my $20 eye cream feel like a$100.00 eye cream. I&#x27;m a guy with three sisters who all asked me what I did, guess what everyone is getting for christmass this year. Lol</li>
    <li> So far so good. Really like the consistency and ya can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own eye cream, mix it with primrose oil to stay moisturized and keep your skin looking glowing!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with the texture of my skin. I really like it. It does not burn my face, and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for couple of years. Every day. I would not go one day without. Skin feels clean, subtle, fresh and a whole lot less wrinkles in a short period of time. I really see the difference !</li>
    <li> It was a yellowish water like liquid. I guess I was expecting more of a serum like texture. Smelt weird too. Used it twice. Noticed clogged pores where I used it. Threw it away. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am not altogether sure that any of the serum type products I use are actually making any difference but then I am sure they aren&#x27;t doing any damage..  I especially like this hyaluronic acid - it is very light, has no aroma and studies reveal it does make a real difference - perhaps over a longer period of time..  I would absolutely order from this seller again, the package was sealed (unlike other products I&#x27;ve ordered) and shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product for tightening my face &amp; neck.  Can really tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Terrific product !  I will return for more products in the future!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think that I just said all that you need to know. I shouldn&#x27;t be required to add&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;fill&amp;#34;  words so that my review will be posted !</li>
    <li> I like the product. Its thicker than water but not a gel. Goes on easy and seems to be absorbed well, actually it feels good. Since it has no other ingredients it is water clear. The pump doles out just the right amount.  Does it make me look younger? Oh well, I still like the product and maybe in time.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Goes on smooth and you can mix it with any moisturizer you use for face or body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a believer in this product.  It helps my dry skin absorb the moisturizer I use on it.  I use it in my hair to help it absorb moisture also.  I believe I&#x27;ll be using this repeatedly and regularly for the rest of my  life.  Satisfied customer here.</li>
    <li> I use this to thin out my SPF lotion!  Works great, non drying.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me with wrinkles, especially around my throat area. I like that it is not perfumed and has a great price. I use it twice a day - in the morning and before going to bed. I also put it on my hands under my hand cream.</li>
    <li> A fan of all their products</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about this product but saw it on Dr. Oz and thought I would give it a try. I think it is working to decrease my wrinkles and haven&#x27;t had a problem with a foul odor as some reviews stated. Mine doesn&#x27;t smell much at all but seems to be working so I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results of this serum. I am 56, from the south where we worshipped the sun years ago, smoked for 35 yrs (quit 6 yrs ago), so needless to say I have deep wrinkles around my eyes and upper lip. I read rave reviews on this serum but was still skeptical. After I received it I cleansed my face well, really took a good look at my wrinkles so I would be able to see any difference. First I applied a vitamin c serum (let that dry completely), then applied this serum (a little goes a long way), then applied my normal moisturizer. I waited 1 hour then looked in the mirror, I was shocked at the softer appearance of my wrinkles. It absolutely took ten years off my appearance, face is very smooth, even the deeper lines are barely noticeable. From what I have read this works synergistically with a good vitamin c serum so that is what I did. I used them both for the first time together so I am not sure which one gave me the great results but for me I will never be without either of the serums. Obviously, this is not a permanent fix but I will be quite happy to use this daily to get these miraculous results. The vitamin c serum I bought was from Amazon too GUARANTEED FASTEST Working 20% VITAMIN C + E + Ferulic + 11% Hyaluronic Acid, Natural &amp; Organic Skin Repair Serum.</li>
    <li> I tried this first based on all the reviews. For me, it did not work at all. It seemed very watery. I am 45, with fair, dry sensitive skin. This winter was brutal on my face--it was literally peeling. Gave this about 6 weeks with no relief. I then tried the Oz Hyaluronic acid, and I really like that, and it seems to work! So skip Watts, and try Oz!</li>
    <li> I purchased hope it would help with my dry skin. After using daily for a month, I can see it&#x27;s not absolute nothing to help my skin. I started using a different moisturizer and finally saw a difference...</li>
    <li> Well, I had never used watts products and since I am allergic to everything under the sun ...I had to test it out first ! I am in shock! my hand that I used the hyaluronic on it looks several years younger then my other one....and I have only used this stuff 3 times on it!!! I cant believe a such a product so reasonably priced works this well.....if you have sensitive skin and are tired of spending a lot of money with no results try this...the crape look is going away and my hand looks plumper and for someone that washes her hands a lot I would think this would not be possible....YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and a very small amount is needed so my 2oz bottle will last months!!!Oh!!! don&#x27;t forget to leave your skin a little wet before applying it or use a moisturizer also.....and I love this company is ran by a women...cause women are more understanding to what we want....</li>
    <li> Not sure it is doing anything, been using regular, but have not noticed any change.</li>
    <li> Skin care salons charge amazing amounts for this same solution so I thought, why not try it.  At worse, it will be a waste of a few dollars instead of a waste of $49 as in the case of a jar of L&#x27;Oreal or similar that really didn&#x27;t make enough of a difference to spend $50 a month.  While my results have been measurable, I have to say I follow up my twice daily applications with a moisturizer (Mary Kay replenish serum and Mary Kay Gel Moisturizer - one for day, one for night).  This is because Hyaluronic Acid attracts moisture.  I stay well hydrated internally and constantly make sure my skin is well moisturized as well - my normal routine but now I have this solution I also use.  My skin has changed for the better, retaining moisture longer and appears much smoother and, yes, more youthful bit by bit each week.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it&#x27;s like over the winter without sun exposure!</li>
    <li> love it need to order more so I do not run out.  use with viamin c cream they sell it is amazing</li>
    <li> I love this product! For the money, you cannot beat it. For maximum effectiveness, you should first use a Vitamin C serum. The effects of Hyaluronic Acid are temporary, while the effects of Vitamin C are permanent. Hyaluronic Acid works by filling up the fine lines of your face. In dry climates, it will actually pull moisture from your face to achieve this plumping effect, which is not great, so be sure to always use a moisturizer when you use this product. When you stop using the product, the effects will gradually go away, so it isn&#x27;t as miraculous as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have its place in a beauty regiment though. In the morning, thoroughly clean your face, leaving it slightly damp, and then apply a Vitamin C serum (not mixed with Hyaluronic Acid). Let that dry, then use this serum. Let the serum dry and then apply a moisturizing cream to keep the Hyaluronic Acid from pulling needed moisture from your skin. Then apply your makeup as usual. Hyaluronic Acid fills up the fine lines giving the appearance that the lines are no longer there. At night, I skip this product altogether and just use the Vitamin C and a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> love the product love the feel on face, neck, chest, scars from recent surgeries, use it every nite and the softening and fading of a facial scar over 40 years old is simply amazing</li>
    <li> Best to use this type of product in a cream you find in a jar</li>
    <li> Incredible results , super fast delivery! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle. Thanks to all the people who reviewed the other brands, i was able to pick this one with confidence and love it. No drying alcohol in it. Feels like a serum.  I use a nice moisturizer after I apply it. I think it helps prevent wrinkles, not take them away. Listen ladies, if you already have lots of wrinkles ,there is no magic bullet to remove them, you can only slow the progress.  This is one way to keep some plumpness in your skin.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff and would bathe in it if I could. Try it and you will not be disappointed. Use moisturizer immediately afterward for best results.I have referred it to others who also love it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, and considerate seller.</li>
    <li> I used it every night under my night moisturiser. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a Flaky substance on the face like face dandruff or flaky skin.  I won&#x27;t buy again...</li>
    <li> For me this product definitely needs something over it, it is not much of a moisturizer.  If you have super oily skin you could use a hydrating toner and then use this while your skin is still dewy and that would probably be perfect.  I ndo not have dry skin at all, more oily and I find that I always need some kind of hydrating toner with it and then a moisturizer or rosehip seed oil goes great with it.  I honestly havn&#x27;t seen a huge difference but am going to continue the bottle and see what happends.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.  I have combination/dry skin.  Hasn&#x27;t softened a fine line on my forehead that my normal moisturizer does.  I use a gentle cleanser, rose water spray, this product, and my cetaphil.  I have broken out a little since using.  Unsure if it&#x27;s related.  Will use until the bottle is empty and update.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to add to my homemade facial moisturizer.  It works beautifully helping to minimize wrinkles without adding any unwanted texture to my cream.  It has no smell and does not adversely affect my sensitive skin.  I like this product a lot and will reorder when I need more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing but it&#x27;s very watery so if you prefer a thicker gel like consistency get another brand. Better value than most other HA serums.</li>
    <li> This product makes a difference in the hydration of your skin. Best about it - no fragrance or frills. Pure.&lt;br /&gt;Not simple though. I wet moisten clean skin, apply a thin amount, let it dry and then apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;lots of extra steps. So, I don&#x27;t always bother with it.&lt;br /&gt;But it is well worth it to add to your regimen.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little watery. But at least it&#x27;s not too viscous. This would be a good, non-comedegenic moisturizer for people with problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;For Dry Skin, add moisturizer to seal.</li>
    <li> This is my second Watts Beauty product. I like it. This Hyaluronic Acid hydrates my skin without leaving any sort of greasy feeling behind. It&#x27;s 100% pure. I&#x27;m sure I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little over a week and feel that it has helped to re-hydrate my very dry skin.  I also use it along my upper lip and I feel it plumps up the wrinkles throughout the day.  I use a DMAE Vitamin Serum after I let this product soak in, because it does create a little bit of a tight feeling.  I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of days, but I&#x27;m already sold. I don&#x27;t know if it will get rid of fine lines, but it is definitely helping balance out my combination skin. I usually get a lot of oil in my t-zone and on the sides of my cheeks. Since I have been using this, my whole face seems to have balanced out. I used to need to use blotting paper several times a day, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it once since adding the Hyaluronic Acid serum to my routine. I apply it all over my face and let it dry, then I apply my Aubrey Organics vegecol lotion on top of it. The lotion absorbs much faster when I use it in combination with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the 2 oz pump. It only takes two pumps for my whole face, so I expect this to last a long time, even using twice daily.</li>
    <li> This is both lightweight and softening, I use it under a light daily moisturiser in the mornings. My pores look smaller. I do see a difference in the wrinkle depth (and I am happy to say they are not as deep). It isn&#x27;t a miracle eraser by no means, but it&#x27;s better than putting absolutely nothing on your skin and allowing it to dry out.</li>
    <li> I had VERY VERY dark under eye circles from heredity and lack of sleep.  I am a full time college student and have 3 part-time jobs. I have very little time for sleep or to try a bunch of products to help my unsightly under eye circles. This product WORKS!  I have only been using it for about 4 days, but I see a significant improvement already.  I put the acid under my eyes on the morning and at night.  I also pt a eye cream over the acid.  I suggest rubbing it in really well.  It really does work. Also, the consistency of this product is fabulous. It is like a gel.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as clinical grade acid I have used in the past. This is quite watery. Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I have taken before and after pictures to compare efficacy.</li>
    <li> The consistency is a little watery.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it really does add moisture to the skin. It is one of the moisturizing ingredients in aveda&#x27;s facial toner which is why I decided to try it. Immediately my skin was super hydrated. Unfortunately I have acne prone skin. I use several medications to keep my cystic acne at bay and this product made me break out like crazy. If you have a problem with acne, be careful with this stuff. Otherwise it is a must have for mature skin which loses it&#x27;s ability to retain moisture as we age. Either way, give it a go.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the moisturizing power of this solution to be unparalleled, and maybe, if I were to invest more money into a Hyaluronic Acid, it would be. However, you will not find anything special here.</li>
    <li> I have tried quite a few serums and most of them have done some good. I expected this to be the same. Was I ever surprised!! The very first time I put this on mu face and neck I saw an immediate difference. I realized I had come on to something a lot better than what I had ever used before. I am OLD OLD AND I have trouble with a &amp;#34;creepy neck&amp;#34; I had gotten so frustrated and was to the point of believing I would have to live with it. Well, much to my surprise this is working wonders. IMMEDIATELY. I am so glad I got this and will continue tpo use it. It makes my skin look tighter and refreshed too. I have no wrinkles oin my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product for around my eyes and my forehead. I have really dry skin and this helps to soften my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been spending spending lots of money over the last 4 months on a face care system to try and undo the damage that I had done by not caring enough when I was young to protect my face against sun damage. I&#x27;ve had success with an expensive regiment of products to get rid of the dark sunspots on my face and eliminate lots of wrinkles. This line, that I won&#x27;t mention by name, has a new set of products that they recommend I switch to for long term skin maintenance. I know that they make great products but to the tune of approx. $100 per month.Now that I&#x27;ve said that, here is where I am going with this....Now that I&#x27;ve used Watts Beauty Anti Aging Wrinkle Filler of 100% Hyaluronic Acid, I&#x27;ve decided I will forego that expense facial care line and stick with this instead, in conjunction with 100% Argan Oil to moisturize, followed by sunscreen when going outdoors. I already have bought Watts Beauty 100% Argan Oil and now this for wrinkles. I feel fortunate to have stumbled upon these two quality products. I did receive this anti aging product at a discounted price for my honest review but I&#x27;m a happy camper. Even when I reorder this at the regular price, I&#x27;ll still be saving bundles of money for a face care system that works, instead of spending the big bucks on the system I was planning on buying.</li>
    <li> first time user so i just started in using it, the skin where i put the cream is very smooth soft, but i bought it more for my mum so im waiting on what she has to say</li>
    <li> Watts makes a good product and is priced well</li>
    <li> Really nice pure product. Good airtight packaging. An excellent value.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.  I use in conjunction with vitamin C lotion.  It works great on dry heels as well.</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this removing some fine lines on my face but after using for a month or so I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, at a good price.</li>
    <li> Really didnt make a difference in my skin or its moisture level. Was really hopeful about this. It may work for others, just not me. I have really picky skin that doesnt like much, and this is no exception. Will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this and am using. I believe it is helping.</li>
    <li> I really liked the gel texture, much more than the the Timeless Hyaluronic Acid (which seemed way too watery). Also, the Watts has an easy to use pump dispenser.  However, I only used it for a week because it had an  unpleasant scent/odor which I could not tolerate. Decided to try it again after a couple months and noticed the color had changed from transparent clear, to a transparent pale yellow, and it was still smelly. Since there was nothing mentioned about the scent in the product description or reviews at the time that I bought it, I just figured my bottle was contaminated. I dont like to leave bad product reviews, but it would be better if the seller had included a comment about the fragrance in the product description.</li>
    <li> I have bought this item two times in the last year. My first purchase was a gel consistency, worked very well, did not have any odor.  The most recent order was about a month ago. I started using this bottle two weeks ago (two weeks after purchase). From the beginning I could tell this bottle was different. Its consistency was closer to water, it smelled a little off. Now I found this morning a yellow discoloration on the bottle dispenser area, and there are particles floating in the bottle- like the liquid is separating and the liquid&#x27;s color is changing to a yellowish tinge. The product was not altered in any way. I will be contacting Amazon to try and get a discount.</li>
    <li> It works alright, but make sure you have a non-greasy moisturizer as this will dry your skin out somewhat, espeacially in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different serums and moisturizers for my face over the past few years.  I started using the following combination for the past month: 25% vitamin C serum followed by Hyaluronic Acid solution then Argan oil mixed with my moisturizer (oil of olay).  My face looks incredible.  It is brighter, smoother, more even and soft.  It was a very subtle change but I have now started to go without makeup (if I did that before someone would comment that I looked tired or questioned if I was sick).  I have recommended the protocal to my close friends.  I had to adjust the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid.  Only use a few drops of each and let each dry/settle before going to the next step.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a year, and now I have included the Watts Peptide Serum in my morning &amp; evening regiment my now 57 year old skin has dramatically changed.  I started with before pictures, selfies, last year and will be burning them in fear of someone seeing them including me.  You will notice a change in a few weeks and dramatic change within 3 months.  No more saggy jaw lines. No more sun.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think it has any anti- aging or ability to fill wrinkles as a topical but it leaves no film or oil on my skin and keeps my skin supple during the cold weather.</li>
    <li> Over the last 5 years I face has really started to age. I am almost 48 and my fine lines were becoming more pronounced, my lips less plump and my neckline saggy. I had read somewhere that Hyaluronic Acid was good for wrinkles and decided to try. I purchase this brand from this seller because I had purchased Watts products from them in the past. It is probably the single best beauty choice I have ever made!!! Combining this with Watts Argan oil as well as both Bliss Firm Baby Firm eye cream and Clinique Laser Focus eye cream has shown DRAMATIC results on my eyes, face and neckline. Everything is firmer and softer. I noticed the difference in my eyes right away. After about three weeks of use my lips began to plump up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product two ways - on top of argan oil/eye cream and under argan oil/ eye cream.  I prefer under my other products best - I see more results this way. I apply it twice a day religiously - after my shower while my face is still damp and at night after I wash my face. I have ultra sensetive skin and dry eyes - I suffer from Rosacea too. I am very careful of what I put on my skin. None of the above products bother my skin or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that I used the eye creams and Argan oil prior to purchasing the Hyaluronic Acid but it was only after adding this to the other products that I truly began to see a visible difference!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it. It seems to plump the skin. I apply it right before my moisturizer (emu oil or red palm oil).</li>
    <li> Only used on face. After couple of days, made face very very soft to the touch, almost baby skin. No 5 stars, as I was thinking,  mistaken I guess, that helps in closing face pores, it did not.</li>
    <li> I have finally cleaned out the 20 different skin care moisturizers that clutter my vanity. Some were for warm weather, some for dry cold, some I mixed with potion 2, some I rarely used...you get the picture.  I don&#x27;t even remember how I found this, or why I tried it, but I do know that three pumps of this and a drop of argan oil has completely changed my moisturizing regime *FOR EVER*.  I no longer have an oily T-zone and cheeks that look like they need a good sandpaper treatment..Instead I have the balanced skin that every single product I just threw away promised me...I&#x27;m not a scientist, and I don&#x27;t play one on TV...but I do love this product and Its icing on the cake that its so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have the usual age related wrinkles and loss of firmness. I started using this product and saw definite changes. Wrinkles diminished. Skin tone improved. A slight lift where skin sagged. Really very impressive. I tried using this in tandem with Cera Ve but the cream caused breakouts every time I applied it to my face. Alone, the hyaluronic acid is truly wonderful. The only negative is to maintain the results you have to use it for the rest of your life, i.e., the effects are temporary. If you&#x27;re willing to make a life long commitment, this product does work.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I love this product by Watt in the 2 oz size!  I&#x27;ve had troubled, red, acne prone skin for most of my life.  I add a few drops to my lotion and it evens out my skin tone and calms the redness.  Give it a few days. It&#x27;s not a miracle potion, but I&#x27;m impressed enough to use it daily and I&#x27;ll be ordering more. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I saw another review that said this product smelled bad, but mine doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hydrating, I love to mix it in with my lotions, foundation and even concealer to make them more hydrating. Also works as an eyelash treatment! I love this stuff and will definitely be repurchasing. I bought the 2oz pump size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchase the smaller 1oz version before which was better than the 2oz version. The 2oz version turned an ugly urine color and the consistency was more like water and had an awful smell than the 1oz version which had a thicker consistency. I believe I had a bad batch. Don&#x27;t trust that more is better.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pure, natural and completely gentle to any skin or skin problem. I use this on my skin if it is irritated from dermarolling or Retin A and needs a deep hydrating, soothing product. This stuff keeps skin ultra hydrated, plump and comfortable. It can be added to any moisturizer or skin care product to add additional hydrating benefits. A little goes a long way. I put a drop on my whole face and neck and then spray thoroughly with rosewater [[ASIN:B0001TMDF0 Heritage Flower Water Rose 8 oz Liquid]] to hydrate the skin. Hyaluronic Acid attracts and holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water so it is very hydrating. It also needs water from the air or from something added to the skin surface or it will pull it out of your skin dehydrating it. It&#x27;s like a liquid sponge so do keep it moist. But it does an amazing job to keep moisture where you want moisture to be, on your skin and in your cells.</li>
    <li> Recommend by my facialist, like the product, great size for travel.</li>
    <li> But, it didn&#x27;t.  Duh, it&#x27;s acid, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be too drying.  It was.  I still have it and may put it in a cream, but right now, it&#x27;s sitting in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product before when it was in the glass bottle with the dropper and my children spilled it. I thought out would be great with the pump but the plastic container doesn&#x27;t preserve it as well. I can&#x27;t use it alone because of the odor.</li>
    <li> If you use it just by itself, I almost guarantee it&#x27;ll dry out your skin and make matters worse. You have to put it over a layer of something else. It basically makes a barrier and keeps the moisture in longer. I&#x27;ve been alternating between my st. Ives collagen lotion and just coconut oil. Then I put this formula over it. Smile lines are significantly improved and the over all texture of my skin had gotten better.</li>
    <li> Love this serum, before I started making my own, this is the product that I ordered, really good and pure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times (in 2 days) but I swear, my face looked less lined, firmer, and glowier today... and this was my reflection midday in the car mirror! I may be in love.</li>
    <li> All I can say is this is wonderful stuff. You will love how it makes your skin feel. I combine it with my regular face product at night and my skin is so much smoother, less deep wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product several months ago thinking the spray application of the pump would be the best method of application.  Although I like the product the applicator which is a spray pump seems faulty and is wasteful.  When you press the top of the pump it releases the product in one big spurt sending the liquid in every direction but where you want it.  I have tried holding it very close to where i want it but the force with which it comes out then causes it to splash and go everywhere no mater what I do. My only solution after wasting half the liquid is to open the bottle and use the plastic tube connected to the pump like an eye dropper which leads to contamination of the remaining product. Good product but I would not recommend buying it in this bottle.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing &amp;#34;hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; as a main ingredient in some of the high-end face creams and serums in my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I have sensitive skin, but am also in my 30&#x27;s.  I was looking for a product that would moisturize well but not cause any reaction to my skin.  This product has been wonderful! My skin feels amazing after using it, is more supple, and in using it for almost a year I have not had any reaction.  I use this and argan oil as my daily routine and constantly I have people ask what products I use.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizing product and anyone who suffers from sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has  horrible psoriasis and excema.  In two weeks, her skin has cleared up so much  that she told me she looked into the mirror and started to cry. She  said that  she feels beautiful again.  I am so happy to have found  something that  actually works for her.  What a wonderful  product!</li>
    <li> I think this has helped my skin, especially with the hot summer weather which usually makes me breakout. Slathering this on in morning and night under my regular moisturizer seems to help</li>
    <li> ON GOING USE  -  SO FAR SO GOOD</li>
    <li> I just received this a couple of days ago.  The directions are to apply morning and night.  I have very high hopes based on the other reviews about this product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more results than I got using this product. Maybe I was using it wrong but I ended up with skin that saw no visible difference. The upside is that I didn&#x27;t have to overpay to try this product out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for cellulite on my thighs.  No big difference, but it did keep my skin moist.  It smells like spit.</li>
    <li> I really see a difference in my skin. I get the lines between my breast and this product has helped so much.Instant lift on my face and smoother lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
    <li> Great for my DIY Vitamin C Serum</li>
    <li> i use this regularly, so love it</li>
    <li> Based on other customers reviews I purchased this item.  However, I am very disappointed because the product is mostly water, not as claimed by the seller 100% Hyaluronic Acid.  Perhaps there is some other acid in it because it dries my skin.</li>
    <li> Good face products include hyaluronic acid. I use this product directly on my face, then apply my night or day cream. I love it, especially since it is very affordable, unlike many of the face creams out there today which have ridiculous prices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read almost most of the reviews for this product and the other one that has the Vit C, etc. Honestly,  Im not hearing a whole lot&lt;br /&gt;that makes me want to go out and get this although I&#x27;ve been reading about the H Acid. Reading peoples comments about a urine smell...well maybe theres Uric acid in there for one thing. Also seems like a lot of people dont just use this alone but with other&lt;br /&gt;moisterizers so how can they tell the effects of this product.  Also a lot of people really have not experienced any visual change&lt;br /&gt;they can really shout about.except for some acne help..urine would do that.......so here again, another skin product...maybe cheaper but.....another no real resulter!!!</li>
    <li> Terrific product for a terrific price. Have purchased several bottles both for myself and as gifts. Quality is wonderful. Recommend Watts line as a whole.</li>
    <li> This works really well for smoothing out my budding wrinkles on my forehead! If I don&#x27;t use it for a few days, it&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference. I religiously use it morning and night now. Since I&#x27;m vegan, I like just buying the pure stuff instead of dilute creams that may be tested on animals or contain non-vegan ingredients.</li>
    <li> Need to use everyday. But softens nicely. After a month or so you can see differences in fine lines. Use day and night.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to make a difference on my skin. I mix it with Virgin Argan Oil and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help with my dry skin as much as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Well i finally tryed this after a few raving reviews from customers who have used it, well im sorry but i just didn&#x27;t see a difference on me at all. The only thing it did do was make my face a little softer after application and i did use a moisturizer right after as someone says to lock it in, and nothing. No difference, well just because it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for others, afterall we all have different reactions to products. I was so hoping it would work to smooth out my skin texture and maybe fill in the few lines but oh well!</li>
    <li> I mix this with the lotion i use around my eyes  It makes my skin very soft &amp; seems to diminish wrinkles.  The pump applicator is great, you get just the right amount</li>
    <li> I like it I just don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it a lot so maybe that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t seen results</li>
    <li> THIS is what my skin has been waiting for. I have dry, semi mature, weird acne breakout prone skin and this stuff is magic.</li>
    <li> Rediscovered Watts products, they are still great products that won&#x27;t break your budget. I compared this to different brands at the Ulta Store, nothing there  comes close for the price. I will buy this again. This product is almost like water in consistency, so I use the dropper and put a few drops into the palm of my hand, then spread it on my face and neck. I honestly believe it has helped lighten some light brown spots on my cheek. I am using it with vitamin C oil, first the Hyaluronic acid, then the C.</li>
    <li> Great skin moisturizer without the greasy feel!!</li>
    <li> I have very ruddy cheeks that are due to the blood vessels being close to the surface. I&#x27;ve NEVER in my life found something that actually makes the redness subside other than having stomach illnesses. I also have very dry skin, which has led to premature fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth. I&#x27;ve been using retinol creams, face oils, and things that have all made my skin fairly hydrated and helped, but I am always looking for something better (who isn&#x27;t?). A MUA recommended I try this and Amazon was the first place I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by washing with a cream cleanser and Clarisonic Mia, then patted 2 pumps of this on my still damp face and then covered it in face oils and creams. My skin was a little stickier and softer. I enjoyed using it and would already repurchase, but nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this morning I woke up and looked in the mirror and could not believe my eyes. My red cheeks, which have been part of my face daily since I was a kid, were almost gone. My face WAS NOT RED. The fine lines on my forehead? Nearly gone. Even my boyfriend, who doesn&#x27;t notice anything, could tell a serious difference. I am still in total disbelief. My cheeks are not ruddy anymore and my lines are invisible. I look like an 18 year old instead of a 25 year old and like a normal person rather than one who is embarrassed all the time. You MUST try this stuff. Outstanding. I keep getting up and looking in the mirror to make sure it&#x27;s not some kind of trick. My pores even look smaller. After just 12 hours I have the BEST looking skin I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. It&#x27;s ASTONISHING.</li>
    <li> Although I really wanted to love this serum, it caused a reaction to my skin.  Granted, I did the love effect I was having prior to the reaction.  Skin seemed lifted and plumped...so I am really dissapointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin.  But, I ended up with contact dermatitis - did go to the Dr. (not pretty).  This was the only thing that I changed in my skincare routine.  So, just be careful and do a test run before trying it all over (like I did) because you never know.  Just to be fair, maybe it was a combination of my skincare items and not just this one item?  I can&#x27;t be 100% sure...but did pretty much attribute the reaction to this product as it was the only thing that changed. Good luck.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do what I expected.  I have used it for several months now and can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
    <li> 62 years old and my neck doen&#x27;t look like an old lady neck.  Using this on my neck and some portions of face for 2 1/2 months.  Neck area wrinkles are reduced, I just have 2 large ones that I can&#x27;t expect anything to fix.  I use 2 small pumps every morning and evening.  I looks and feels like water, but certainly doesn&#x27;t act like water.  I have used neutrogina wrinkle products in the past and may use them when I want something heavier during the dry winter months, for summer this is great.  I will continue to use and repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> I like Watt&#x27;s Hyaluronic serum very much; it&#x27;s soothing, hydrating, and refreshing. I like that the ingredients are simple as well. I find it&#x27;s best applied to damp skin.  It does go well under makeup but you MUST apply your liquid foundation when this serum is still damp otherwise your make up looks  \\&quot;funny. \\&quot; this serum is perfect for delicate skin that needs moisture, but doens&#x27;t want or can&#x27;t tolerate oils! Years ago, I purchased Hylunia hyaluronic serum which appears to be the same ingredient wise. After searching, I found it on Amazon for 55 dollars. Watts is just as effective for 1/5 the price!  With hyaluronic serum, I recommend mixing it with a drop or two of jojoba oil for the colder months when skin becomes dryer.</li>
    <li> It did not show any difference.. I use different brand</li>
    <li> I have bought expensive serums with hyaluronic acid in them and I cannot say how happy I am to find this one.  I see the same results if not better.  My skin is smoother, smaller pores, softened lines, and brighter.  I am very happy and will be buying more.  I love the gel consistency and there is no smell in mine which I am glad because I am very sensitive to fragrance in face products.  I use it with argan oil with wet hands and just love it.</li>
    <li> I had used a lotion with hyaluronic in it years ago that moisturized much better than this does.  I know it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer per se but using it and using the jojoba oil and almond oil on top should be helping and it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite,,,,,I must say it has been an asset to the look of my skin..i apply it morning and night time...tightens and tones making fine lines disappair...I purchase this product always from Amazon...the price is great and the product diffenitly works.....sharon si ny</li>
    <li> This shipped  very quickly and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It was what I expected and helps my skin look better.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Feels just like the expensive stuff from my skin care professional. Do wish they would just include the sprayer and send a conventionally lidded and sealed bottle; or better yet, ask if you want the sprayer included for free.</li>
    <li> will update once i&#x27;ve used the whole bottle...unsure yet if it works or not.  But am hoping that it will work.&lt;br /&gt;OK, tried it til bottle was empty, did nothing...for me.</li>
    <li> This product has eliminated a few age spots due to the sun!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is another wonderful Watts Beauty product, I love how this product makes my skin feel and look. I have not had any reaction to this product where I have had issues with other brands. My skin can be sensitive at times and this product is just lovely. I even apply this to the tops of my hands as they arent as youthful looking as they used to be and I definitely notice a difference a transformation. This is also an amazingly priced product as are all Watts Beauty products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the Vitamin A/retinol/hyaluronic solution at the same time.  While I&#x27;ve leaned towards using the vitamin A combo more often, I love both of these products.  And they really do work.  I put this one right after cleaning, right out of the shower, and while my skin is still damp.  Then my under eye cream or skin moisturizers go right on top.  Then, while both are still a little damp, I use a small dab of BB cream, and now my 49 year old face needs nothing more!  With one use, you&#x27;ll notice how well your skin retains moisture...within a few weeks, you&#x27;ll see smaller pores and better toned skin.  With the added healthy moisture to my skin, it hasn&#x27;t broken out and small blackheads are simply disappearing.  Very much recommended.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin look good and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I was paying a lot more for this as an esthetician and its my go to product! I use this every day and the price and consistency is perfect! If you hate the feel of lotions or creams I highly recommend you snag this gem. If you aren&#x27;t sure what hyaluronic acid does it provides continuous moisture to the skin by binding up to 1000 times its weight in water. Most skin is lacking water or moisture so this really plumps its up.</li>
    <li> I like it! I started applying this to my face approx two weeks ago. I use a tiny amount before a 10% glycolic acid cream and I noticed a more youthflow glow and even skin tone within 3 days. I can&#x27;t honestly say if it is this product or the combo of the two but regardless I&#x27;m liking what I see in the mirror. I&#x27;m 35, my skin is combo and acne prone and I haven&#x27;t had a single break out. I don&#x27;t have many lines so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I&#x27;m simple satisfied with the tone of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a pin drop size, a little goes along way.The texture reminds me of a watered down gel. I&#x27;m not crazy about the texture against my skin but covering with the glycolic cream helps.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent wrinkle filler, got it for my friend who is starting to get some wrinkles (she is 10 years older than me) and she would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> wonderful product! No alcohol,No parabens,gotta love it! Because other Hyaluronic Acid(HA)products use parabens,alcohol&amp;other chemicals we dont want or need on our face as preservatives,I chose THIS one by Watts Beauty&amp;I&#x27;m HAPPY I did! From reading other reviews I was aware that some ppl were not happy with product because they thought it was expired/old. My bottle came with an expiration date sticker on the invoice sheet that I promptly peeled off&amp;attached to the bottle,then it went into the frig for an EXTRA MEASURE of security,I mean Summer IS almost here&amp;it can get pretty hot in my house at times,so why take a chance on this amazing product being ruined when by putting it in your frig you not only help to keep it fresh but in the coming hotter months do you know how refreshing that nice cold HA will feel?!O YEAH!!! Product arrived before estimated delivery date,was packaged appropriately&amp; was in pristine condition upon arrival..What more could you want/ask for!?Thanks to Watts,Direct2uWholesale&amp;AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seeing any difference yet. Only thing I can say, that I have a very sensitive skin and was hesitant to use Hyaluronic Acid on my face. To my surprise, no problem. Which is great for a start.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My pores are smaller, lines are remarkably reduced and not as deep, skin feels more firm. I am 57 years old and this has helped get rid of white head blemishes and even jowles are better! Order this not one with alcohol and glycerin, I ha</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands which are really dry.  It moisturizes better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this a year ago and it was great-then I bought another bottle and it has since turned yellow!!! it doesn&#x27;t smell like some people say but I&#x27;m afraid to use it now. Hyaluronic acid is great for skin and you can take it orally for joint stiffness and to lubricate your eyes. I think there was a bad batch though. I am gonna buy another one since its so cheap and see how that bottle holds up. People should also try Synthovial Seven oral formula-its more expensive but its works wonders on my cracking knees and fingers. I am 45 years old and arthitis is kicking in and Hyaluronic acid definitly helps!!!!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!! Since I&#x27;ve been using this I have noticed a smoother, healthier face.  Its retaining moisture, and I must say I look fabulous!  Lol.  This will be a staple in my beauty repertoire.  First I wash my face, the witch hazel with cotton pad, then vit c, then hyaurolic acid, then, anti aging sryum..spc.., followed by a moisturiser. Ta da.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> very fast shipping, great price, makes skin nice and soft you only need a little so it last for long time and I loves that it is alcohol free</li>
    <li> Feels so silky.  Hyaluronic Acid is the best....very hydrating love it!</li>
    <li> Some reviews say that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize and some reviews say that it does.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the product, but I do know that I like what it does.  I realize everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this formula alone seems to have a tightening and calming effect on my skin.  It makes my pores look smaller and gives my skin a nice finished look.  Now when I add a couple of drops of argan oil with  this.......holy cow, my skin is awesome.  I have to admit that the two together go hand in hand, and I like the fact that I did buy them separately so that I can decide how much of each I want to mix together.  If my skin is dryer, then I add three drops of argan to my HA, but normally it&#x27;s one pump of the HA to two drops of argan and it&#x27;s perfect.  A little goes a long way with this stuff, so don&#x27;t over do it, or you might not be happy with the results. In this case using less is more beneficial. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been awhile and I have to admit I was curious to try a couple of different brands on e-bay because they have some different things added  to the hyaluronic acid, like matrixyl 3000 and or vit C etc.  However, I still find myself grabbing for this stuff. Like I said, I&#x27;m not sure what is in this solution, but I just love the way my skin feels.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product but so far so good! Feels really nice on my skin and no breakouts on my super sensitive face! Excited to see more results</li>
