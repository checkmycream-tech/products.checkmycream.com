### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I forgot I even ordered-but the price is great!</li>
      <li>This is a great primer!</li>
      <li>this primer covers everything with no problem and just blends perfectly.</li>
      <li>Very happy!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very good but sometimes make my face looks oily</li>
      <li>I never would of imagined this product to be so great</li>
      <li>Love love love love this product!</li>
      <li>I mix it with a primer for better dispersion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been able to skip the concealer and just use my mineral foundation on top of my primed skin.</li>
      <li>, I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this correcting primer.</li>
      <li>But this product is liquidey and feels dewy (not oily) and spreads easily &amp; evenly.</li>
      <li>The price it fantastic.</li>
      <li>Nice product, surprisingly fast shipment.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work good on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Be aware!</li>
      <li>Looks more natural.</li>
      <li>The price was certainly worth trying</li>
      <li>I have tried various correcting cover sticks and primers, and this is hands down the best for providing even coverage.</li>
      <li>A little watery for optimum coverage.</li>
      <li>Lovely light, non-greasy product that came faster than expected!!</li>
      <li>this primer covers redness very well and evens out my complexion.</li>
      <li>, I got excited to purchase this, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I use it daily over my moisturizer, and then follow with a tone matching blended foundation for a clean, clear finish and an even-toned complexion.</li>
      <li>product arrived way sooner than I&#x27;d expected and it even came with 3 little gifts and a note wishing me a lovely day!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll add bronzer afterward during the day, but at night I prefer a pale look so it works out fine.</li>
      <li>so my checks are always red, and I&#x27;m worried that I&#x27;m using too much mineral concealer to hide it.</li>
      <li>It completely blends to an invisible but bright/light look (no glitter).</li>
      <li>It tends to slide around the face a bit, so its difficult to get a nice, even application.</li>
      <li>(I have normal to dry skin.)</li>
      <li>I am sure I could purchase a better make up base cream for the other brands with the same price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use this over the areas of my face that I have any redness or if I have any blemishes. It deffinettly helps even out skin tone without having to layer on tons of makeup. Looks more natural. The price it fantastic. Does not irritate skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried various correcting cover sticks and primers, and this is hands down the best for providing even coverage. Unlike some of the other products I have used, this has no impact on my skin condition at all--it&#x27;s neither drying nor nourishing. It simply does the job it is intended to do: it covers my splotchy redness, preparing my skin for foundation. I use it daily over my moisturizer, and then follow with a tone matching blended foundation for a clean, clear finish and an even-toned complexion.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll do. A little watery for optimum coverage. It tends to slide around the face a bit, so its difficult to get a nice, even application. I mix it with a primer for better dispersion. It will hide redness but given the consistency you need to work with it a bit and build.</li>
    <li> The container looks so much smaller than I expected! I was very disappointed when it first arrived and saw this little container. I am sure I could purchase a better make up base cream for the other brands with the same price.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea so my checks are always red, and I&#x27;m worried that I&#x27;m using too much mineral concealer to hide it. Hence, my search for green face primer. So, I did an internet search for green tinted face primers and this came up. (It&#x27;s a Korean brand so no box or  instructions ladies.) The price was certainly worth trying this little rated, practically unknown product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I love it. Other green concealers I&#x27;ve used have been too thick and did not blend into my skin, leaving uneven patches of green. But this product is liquidey and feels dewy (not oily) and spreads easily &amp; evenly. (I have normal to dry skin.) It completely blends to an invisible but bright/light look (no glitter). I&#x27;ve been able to skip the concealer and just use my mineral foundation on top of my primed skin. The red is virtually concealed! I&#x27;m even using this primer on my eyelids, putting my urban decay primer aside. Who wudda thunk it?</li>
    <li> completely cover red uneven skin tone..</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good but sometimes make my face looks oily</li>
    <li> This is a great primer! It&#x27;s a little thick, sort of like a light moisturiser. It does lighten my skin tone a little so I&#x27;ll add bronzer afterward during the day, but at night I prefer a pale look so it works out fine. It also lasts throughout the day; I&#x27;ve no need to reapply. No discernible smell. Also, as long as you exfoliate and moisturise properly it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to get it to go on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived way sooner than I&#x27;d expected and it even came with 3 little gifts and a note wishing me a lovely day! The gifts I received were samples of BB cream and serum and a little package of dried seaweed snacks. I would definitely repurchase this item from the same seller!</li>
    <li> I love this correcting primer. I am very pale (NC10) with redness/uneven tone and some acne marks. this primer covers redness very well and evens out my complexion. I have combo skin, some dry patches but oily later in the day. this primer covers everything with no problem and just blends perfectly. I just use my fingers.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. Only need a tiny bit. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or make your face oily. Definitely helps with my red cheeks and some recent pimples that were still a bit red. Delivery took weeks so I forgot I even ordered-but the price is great!</li>
    <li> Nice product, surprisingly fast shipment.</li>
    <li> Be aware! I just receive a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup base.  As you are putting in on you can instantly see it reduce the redness.</li>
    <li> Lovely light, non-greasy product that came faster than expected!! Very happy!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from redness, and this only reduces a little... from the other reviews, I got excited to purchase this, especially for the price. Will keep using, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love love love love this product! I never would of imagined this product to be so great(: it reduces redness bc of the green base but also smoothed the skin like I&#x27;ve never seen any other product do!! It also minimizes pores dramatically!!! Definitely a must buy!!</li>
    <li> i like but i want a bigger sizes container..</li>
