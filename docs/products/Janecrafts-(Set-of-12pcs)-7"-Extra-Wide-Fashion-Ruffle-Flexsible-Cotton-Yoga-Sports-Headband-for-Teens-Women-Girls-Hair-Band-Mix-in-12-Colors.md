    <li> Not very well made....lots of runs in the nylon type material used before even wore</li>
    <li> Love them. I have fine hair and they stayed in my hair!  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are super thin, but stretch and cover sides and front of your hair. Loads of colors, only thing is they snag, so be careful.</li>
    <li> Very thin, almost a pantyhose type material.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and cheap, not durable or thick.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors, and nice width, but the material is not what I expected. You might as well have cut some nylon stockings and wear them as headbands. I wore the black headband twice and got a run in it!!!</li>
    <li> Flimsy and don&#x27;t stay in place. Three of them had holes in them. Won&#x27;t last through two wearings</li>
    <li> super cute. but be warned, are very thin and the seam is exposed.&lt;br /&gt;but very pretty and look great with styled hair.</li>
    <li> Did not know they were (sheer) see through</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re more transparent than expected, and must NEVER be put in the washing machine as they fall apart there.</li>
    <li> Just as they advertised.</li>
    <li> I have an average size head and these were just a little too big. Otherwise, beautiful colors!</li>
    <li> These are so fun. They are made of light weight nylon so they&#x27;re perfect for the summer. And you can wear several together.</li>
    <li> Great colors and great style</li>
    <li> These are synthetic, not cotton. I bought them to cover bald scalp when wearing a hat.  One band does not cover well as they are quite thin and somewhat transparent.  They are wide enough to fold in half and thin enough to double up so they do work as cover-ups.  I like the vibrant colors.</li>
    <li> I got these headbands 2weeks before the estimated delivery date despite the shipment from China. They used the EMS service. I&#x27;m very happy with these headbands. They are not made of very strong fabric and they look flimsy. But they are fairly stretchy. It might be easy to rip them but if talking cautions, they should be good for long. It is nice that there are 12 different colors. It&#x27;s like 1.1 dollars each so it&#x27;s worth the quality. I wear it under my scarf and I have different colors to match my scarves! Overall it&#x27;s very satisfying. Will buy more in the future. I also recommend these for hijabis if someone comes up with this product.</li>
    <li> Not great! Very pretty colors might be ok for a child or thin hair but very cheaply made, not at all what I expected especially for the money!</li>
    <li> Not great quality but for the price it&#x27;s ok. I think if it was cheaper than it&#x27;d b GOOD! I&#x27;m In area w/limited stores &amp; limited hair products. It fits loose on my kids but w/their hair down it&#x27;s cute. The material is like panty hose material but I have hadn&#x27;t one mess up and I&#x27;ve even washed them. So 4 star for what it&#x27;s for a soft headband, lots of colors. Don&#x27;t over spend for it tho.</li>
    <li> Comfortable!  They do not slip. The variety of colors is very nice. The fit is just right; just enough stretch to easily slip on and off.</li>
    <li> This item said something about being cotton. Nothing about these headbands are cotton. Flimsy, ultra thin panty hoe material. Polyester and slippery. Colors were not even as advertised. I just use them to keep my hair back to wash my face. I really wish that they were Cotton!</li>
    <li> These fit pretty good, keeps m hair out of my face.</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty, they are really light weight though.</li>
    <li> They smelled really bad when they arrived. I washed them a few times. I was unhappy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived way before the expected arrival date.  Beautiful colors. A lot thinner than expected.</li>
    <li> They are sheer I thought they&#x27;d be more solid but I still like them okay. Plenty of colors to match whatever your wearing.</li>
    <li> They are very thin!!!&lt;br /&gt;not what i was expecting&lt;br /&gt;but overall a good product</li>
    <li> They are not 100% cotton and made poorly. It was not what I expected.</li>
