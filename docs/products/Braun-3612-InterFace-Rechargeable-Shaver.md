### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I think Braun is the best shaver on the market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used foil shavers for about 10 years now but have never been impressed with the way they can&#x27;t cut my neck hair.</li>

      <li>This product has given me the best shave, out of every product I have used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and best of all it can be used cordless, or with the cord attached.  </li>
      <li>This product has been a very good asset to me.</li>
      <li>The Braun 3612 Razor Shaver is great.  </li>
      <li>so an electric razor is great.</li>
      <li>For the price this is a great shaver.</li>
      <li>It does a great shave job on the head too.</li>
      <li>All in all its a nice razor and gives a close shave!</li>
      <li>For the money, this is a good deal for people who travel.</li>
      <li>And at a good price.</li>
      <li>My 2-day stubble is a good challenge for any electric shaver.</li>
      <li>It gives a good shave in both modes and, if you are not myopic, the trimmer is no problem at all.</li>
      <li>Otherwise its a good deal.</li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
      <li>it is fairly good for the price.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this model.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>got sucked into the good price, but honestly, you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>It was always kind of \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>This was a really nice shaver that was so good that I ended up buying three of them before they all went kaput.</li>
      <li>As others have noted, this is not the best, but pretty decent/good for the $s. &lt;br</li>
      <li>How nice.</li>
      <li>Cord/cordless option is nice, though.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
      <li>The problem with this model is that the cutter has a safety guard that effectively keeps my hairs from getting cut.</li>
      <li>I think the fellow that said this shaver is &amp;quot;a piece of junk&amp;quot; was way too kind.</li>
      <li>Fine razor at a good price.  </li>
      <li>hi i had ordered this product online and in 4th day it is in my hand by free delivery.it is totally new and excellent service and product to me.  </li>
      <li>I love that you can use it corded or cordless.</li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver last year was very happy.  </li>
      <li>foil head-- better than dual</li>
      <li>Have been using this model for many years.</li>
      <li>, I love the thing.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d have something better and my wife threw this one out without asking me.</li>
      <li>Put you money towards something better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Braun and Remington shavers for more than 20 years.</li>
      <li>If you have more money to spend, I might suggest going for a dual foil design, but if this is the price range you are in -</li>
      <li>I got this as a gift and love it.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this shaver for more than four years.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t purchase this shaver at any store, since Braun had discontinued producing it,  so was glad to find it online.</li>
      <li>It needs more power.</li>
      <li>Very affordable and still delivers great results.</li>
      <li>Unlike the one I am reviewing now, it is able to get at those close growing neck hairs.</li>
      <li>This shaver was much better than the Inferface and had much better quality as well.</li>
      <li>The Braun 3612 requires you to go over and over and over the same area in order to get, at best, a still stubbly shave.</li>
      <li>If you want one for home get a 5614 or better.</li>
      <li>but it is used mostly as a travel shaver now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s all the more reason.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s at a pretty good price...</li>
      <li>Good service and fast delivery:</li>
      <li>Oh and I like being able to just stick it under the faucet and clean it off.</li>
      <li>It seemed like a good idea since it works like my older Braun model, which allows you to push the trimmer up so that it can cut longer hairs before they reach the foil.</li>
      <li>But if you need a basic, durable, and easy to carry shaver, this one is great.      </li>
      <li>They should improve the trimmer and offer a free replacement or coupon to owners of the 3612.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the most powerful but it gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>I gotta push the shaver practically into my skin to get a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight.</li>
      <li>The good news is that you can select &amp;quot;foil&amp;quot; and it becomes a regular foil shaver which works suprisingly well (better than my dual foil model in fact).</li>
      <li>This shaver offers good value for the price.  </li>
      <li>I guess I should have kept it in the nice soft case, but still, this is definately not the most durable shaver out there.  </li>
      <li>I guess it was pretty good for the price, but it never gave a really close shave.</li>
      <li>I lost the original one, tried a rotary (and wept from the pain), then bought this one again.</li>
      <li>As long as you don&#x27;t want a super close shave, this is a great electric razor.</li>
      <li>This shaver does not give a real close shave, but it has great features like automatic universal voltage adapter, combination shave, 1 hour recharge, easy cleaning, and an 18 month cutter block life.  </li>
      <li>One charge lasts for a full weekend.</li>
      <li>durable &lt;br /&gt;Recharges quickly &lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good as the first Braun shaver I had over 10 years ago, but its good enough to please me with that very low price.  </li>
      <li>It is small, great for travel, and it is easy to handle....</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Takes twice as long for a good shave &lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives a good close shave and the battery holds its charge for a long time.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is OK for long hairs, but your better off going to a blade if the foil can&#x27;t handel it.  </li>
      <li>in the case of my walkman,it&#x27;s amazing how such a magnificent piece of electronic engineering can be rendered so user-unfriendly by poor interface</li>
      <li>This is the only shaver I have ever liked.</li>
      <li>A nice German made shaver with a pivoting head.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned at least 5 older Braun models (all excellent!)</li>
      <li>Has pop up device for long hairs, pop up trimmer for side burns and moustache, and gives a very good close shave in third position.  </li>
      <li>Weighs next to nothing, charges quickly and shaves OK.</li>
      <li>This shaver is great for travel, its small and its cord, verses a stand, furthers reduces packing.  </li>
      <li>The plastic foil guard attachment isn&#x27;t much use since it doesn&#x27;t secure over the foil very well but nevertheless seems to stay on the razor if the razor is in its zippered case.  </li>
      <li>thanks amazon 4 offering me such a nice price.</li>
      <li>Shipping Very Very Fast.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>My first was when I was 23 and it lasted me for years.</li>
      <li>This was the first electric razor I ever owned.</li>
      <li>I might add this is my first electric shaver</li>
      <li>I got my first Braun in 1989.  </li>
      <li>The razor does exactly what I want and need.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Since the replacement would have cost [$] and I only paid [more money] for the shaver, I decided to trash it.</li>
      <li>so the shaver stays useful even without replacing the batteries when they get older.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Unless you are a teenager trying to shave off a little peach fuzz, the 3612 won&#x27;t do the job.  The motor is so weak it almost stalls out on anything heavier than even a moderate overnight growth.  The small foil will most likely wear quickly due to it&#x27;s small surface area and is a joke compared to my old Braun 2000. Using the 3612 makes me long for my old 2000 back, too bad they don&#x27;t make those anymore.  Braun has discontinued the 3612 and I don&#x27;t think I will shed any tears over that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these shavers for several years and recently adopted it as my primary shaver again.  The foil works wonderfully.  The trimmer is OK for long hairs, but your better off going to a blade if the foil can&#x27;t handel it.  The trimmer is basically useless.      This shaver is great for travel, its small and its cord, verses a stand, furthers reduces packing.  It holds a charge for 2-4 days depending on use.      It doesn&#x27;t look high tech.  Nobody will think you&#x27;ve spent $200 on your shaver, and it doesn&#x27;t look beatiful sitting by the bathroom sink.  But if you need a basic, durable, and easy to carry shaver, this one is great.      Highly recomended for college dorms.</li>
    <li> I think Braun is the best shaver on the market. I&#x27;ve had two Braun shavers in my life and I&#x27;m 60 years old. My first was when I was 23 and it lasted me for years. I don&#x27;t have a real heavy beard so an electric razor is great. No cuts or scrapes to worry about and I shave in about 3 minutes. Good service and fast delivery: Oh and I like being able to just stick it under the faucet and clean it off.</li>
    <li> This product has been a very good asset to me. This product has given me the best shave, out of every product I have used.</li>
    <li> I think the fellow that said this shaver is &amp;quot;a piece of junk&amp;quot; was way too kind. The Braun 3612 requires you to go over and over and over the same area in order to get, at best, a still stubbly shave. I&#x27;ve owned at least 5 older Braun models (all excellent!) but this one is a joke! I even replaced the foil and cutter block after about 5 uses and it&#x27;s no better. The 3612 razor is a waste of MONEY and your time... unless you have 20 minutes to kill irritating your face with this &amp;quot;shaver&amp;quot; each morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for more than four years. I have nothing to complain about it, this is goog stuff. In fact, I bought this last one as a present for my brother in law, because of the good quality of the shaver.    On the other hand, it is pretty easy to find spares for it.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 of these in my life so far and they last a long time. the batterys hold up for years. The only weak link is the foil and it lasts a long time but expensive to replace. I wish the foil was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I previously had a Braun and wanted to get another. This is an excellent shaver, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! It keeps a charge for several days/uses without the need to keep it plugged in.  Not sure what the combi shave setting is for.  The combi shave setting snaps out the horizontal trimmer that you usually use to trim a moustache or sideburns. How do you do both?  Not important for me, I just use them individually. This feature is an added feature that I don&#x27;t use.  All in all its a nice razor and gives a close shave!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 3612 for almost 2 years and works well.  I might add this is my first electric shaver and I shave my head with it but not my face, I use a de razor for my face.  The only part that disturbs me is a new foil and cutter cost more than the shaver itself did so I may be buying another one when the foil wears out(it&#x27;s already starting to crack around the ends.</li>
    <li> Clean, close cut but very slow.One charge lasts for a full weekend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver last year was very happy.  I have a very difficult neck to shave, and this was the first electric shaver that really got the job done.  For that reason I&#x27;d have to rate it just about as high as you can for a shaver under $50.  It looks like Braun has changed to a snazzier color and dropped the price $5, so that&#x27;s all the more reason.  My only complaint is last week I did a routine drop off my bathroom counter (3 feet) and that was enough to bust the shaver.  I guess I should have kept it in the nice soft case, but still, this is definately not the most durable shaver out there.  Also the head is not washable and the popup trimmer is very short, so if those features are important, check out the 5600 series.</li>
    <li> When evaluating this shaver, I had to take the price into consideration.  It&#x27;s not the most powerful but it gets the job done.  It does not feel as sturdy as my 10 year old Braun, but for 30 some dollars - what do you expect?  If you have more money to spend, I might suggest going for a dual foil design, but if this is the price range you are in - I recommend this shaver.  It&#x27;s lightweight, and best of all it can be used cordless, or with the cord attached.  That means that when the battery inevitabley decides to quit, the shaver is not done.</li>
    <li> Pros: &lt;br /&gt;Cheap &lt;br /&gt;Very durable &lt;br /&gt;Recharges quickly &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Takes twice as long for a good shave &lt;br /&gt;Beard trimmer is awkward/difficult to use &lt;br /&gt;Battery loses power quickly after long-term use &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got sucked into the good price, but honestly, you get what you pay for.  Have had it for about a year, and now that the foil broke, I think it&#x27;s time to try a different model.  As said in other reviews, I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate like a rotary shaver, but you have to go over each spot several times (quadruple that for under the chin) to get a patch-free shave.  After 1/2 year I&#x27;ve had to shave with it plugged in since the battery loses power very quickly, and consequently, loses shaving effectiveness (which was bad enough already).  The beard trimmer is wickedly sharp but awkward to use - I&#x27;ve seen better setups for this feature on many other models. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - it does the job, but if I didn&#x27;t have to use it everyday I would reconsider replacing it.</li>
    <li> Lot of mixed reviews here...  but they generally paint an accurate picture.  I&#x27;ve owned a lot of braun shavers over the years-- dual heads, single heads, pivioting, etc.  As others have noted, this is not the best, but pretty decent/good for the $s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros:   &lt;br /&gt;Single foil head-- better than dual &lt;br /&gt;Nice solid construction &lt;br /&gt;Good power/ charge &lt;br /&gt;Clean close shave &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons:  &lt;br /&gt;Long hair trimmer does not project far enough past main head-- bad for precision trimming. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bonus tip: one of braun&#x27;s best shavers is the AA-battery powered 375 travel shaver.  Get one of these and you may just ditch the conventional \\&quot;home\\&quot; setup completely!</li>
    <li> The Braun 3612 Razor Shaver is great.  It only costs about 20 dollars, will shave you close for years, and is very reliable.  The shaver will last at least 5 years, though you might have to replace the blade and screen every year or 2 (which costs almost as much as a brand new entire shaver unit).    I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s way less expensive than the fancier Braun products, is more reliable, and doesn&#x27;t have useless features (who really shaves in the shower?).</li>
    <li> The razor does exactly what I want and need.  And at a good price.</li>
    <li> As a long-time Braun fan, I was appalled by the quality of this shaver. I don&#x27;t have any kind of problem skin but the shaver painfully tugs at my beard stubble, leading to a lot of \\&quot;ouch!\\&quot;s. The shaver irritates my skin and my skin develops red blotches. After about 50 shaves, the foil developed a large hole. The usefulness of the long-hair trimmer is very limited because when deployed it extends only about half an inch from the shaver at a 90 degree angle, which means you have to hold the shaver so close to the face that you can barely see what you are shaving. The only positive quality of this shaver is its light weight.</li>
    <li> I received this shaver about a month ago as a gift. This is the first electric shaver I have owned, so I can&#x27;t really compare it to any others. The overall shave is okay, but the 3612 does have a few problems. The floating cutter is almost completely useless, as is the trimmer. I use the foil by itself, and it gives a fairly smooth shave, although I have to go over my face several times to achieve this. As i said, overall it seems like a decent shaver, but I can see myself purchasing a sturdier, more powerful model in the future.</li>
    <li> Purchased a new one as it was about the same amount as buying a new head. It works better than the old one and gives the shave that I expected. It arrived 4 days after purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the real Deal. Awesome porduct for the price. Shipping Very Very Fast. Will Shop here again!!!!</li>
    <li> I have owned three of these shavers. Mainly because it is about as cheep to buy a complete shaver as it is to replace the cutter head. But show me a cutting head any cheaper.  This is the only shaver I have ever liked. The hair on my neck lays flat and the cutter bar helps to pick it up to be cut. Especially when I go a day without shaving. Show me another shaver that does that and I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
    <li> Ever since Gillete bought out Braun, their razors have gone downhill. The trim edge tends to dig into your face. And to add insult to injury, the replacement blades cost half the price of a new razor. I suggest spending a few extra dollars and getting the better 3 head Braun model.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not shave.  If you push super hard you&#x27;ll get better results but you&#x27;ll also irritate your skin.  The only way to get a decent shave is to spend an extremely long time going over the same areas again and again.  I do not recommend this product at all!</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great shaver. I love that you can use it corded or cordless. I&#x27;ve used foil shavers for about 10 years now but have never been impressed with the way they can&#x27;t cut my neck hair. I tried one of those &amp;quot;lift and cut&amp;quot; shavers and it was extreamly painful and didn&#x27;t even cut. So I took the &amp;quot;lift and cut&amp;quot; back and bought this one. And in so doing I finally found one that I can cut my neck hair without popping out the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Not a very good one if you have sensitive skin, but it is fairly good for the price.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Braun shavers of various types. This is not the best, but it is certainly far from the worst. It gives a good shave in both modes and, if you are not myopic, the trimmer is no problem at all. It is, in my opinion, well worth the price, especially if you plan to use it for travel. If you want one for home get a 5614 or better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for 4 months now. It does a great shave job on the head too. Every four days and voila! time for the Braun. An awesome product that&#x27;s saved me mucho dinero on going to the hair stylists.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Takes longer than blade shaving (I have to go over face several times) but shaves me closer and with less irritation than either 3-blade wet cartridges or rotary shavers.  Charge lasts a long time, and re-charge is quick (&amp;lt;1 hours).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My beard is somewhat heavy and grows at peculiar angles on my neck and adams apple.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive rotary shavers, but they tear up and burn my face badly.  I got this as a gift and love it.  I lost the original one, tried a rotary (and wept from the pain), then bought this one again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I never use the trimming devices and don&#x27;t need to; the regular foil head cozies up fine to my sideburns and even trims my nose hairs by just sort of pushing it up against my nostrils. How nice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and travels well.  It&#x27;s light weight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Minuses:  The plastic foil guard attachment isn&#x27;t much use since it doesn&#x27;t secure over the foil very well but nevertheless seems to stay on the razor if the razor is in its zippered case.  The recharge cord ought to be longer -- it&#x27;s coiled and kind of short -- but no big deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the thing.</li>
    <li> I picked this shaver up for $25 at a major retailer.  I have been using a Rotary head shaver for years.  My face has never gotten used to the rotary design, and I can&#x27;t get a close shave without severe neck irritation.  I am very pleased with the performance of this model.  It is a completely different experience than a rotary head model.  With my beard, the Braun shames me as close as a blade and with 0 skin irritation.  I am pleased with the combo floating trimmer/foil mode that makes short work of stubborn throat/neck hair that has gotten longer from being missed during my 5 minute get ready for work weekday sessions.  All in all I am very pleased.  I like the cord/cordless design so the shaver stays useful even without replacing the batteries when they get older.  The company offers a 30 day, no questions asked, satisfaction guarentee so how can you go wrong.  If you don&#x27;t like it, get your money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun and Remington shavers for more than 20 years. My 2-day stubble is a good challenge for any electric shaver. This shaver gives me a close shave. I like the combi shave feature. The trimmer is useless. It reminds me of my dog&#x27;s dew claws (I had those removed). I&#x27;m disappointed that Braun didn&#x27;t pay attention to the trimmer. It means I have to have another tool to finish the job. They should improve the trimmer and offer a free replacement or coupon to owners of the 3612.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see... It does not give a close shave, so you press harder, at which point it irritates your face and leaves the beard behind. I returned it. I would give it 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> hi i had ordered this product online and in 4th day it is in my hand by free delivery.it is totally new and excellent service and product to me.  thanks amazon 4 offering me such a nice price.</li>
    <li> I got my first Braun in 1989.  It lasted until 2002 or 2003. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then I got this and I cussed at this shaver every dang day. It is sooo poor at cutting that I just gave up and bought blades for the past 2 years.  If you want to take the weekend off, come Monday morning you&#x27;ll be sorry.  Put you money towards something better. I&#x27;m really disappointed in Braun on this one. I&#x27;m thinking Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This shaver offers good value for the price.  I bought it a couple years ago at Target to replace my older Braun, which I used for almost 10 years! At this price, you don&#x27;t buy replacement part, you buy a new one.  I can use it anywhere in the world!</li>
    <li> After using this shaver a year it became time to replace the screen and blade. Since the replacement would have cost [$] and I only paid [more money] for the shaver, I decided to trash it. I was never really happy with it anyway. It seemed to be low on motor power and had a tough time on a thick beard. This was unlike most of the other Brauns that I had owned. I am afraid they had cheapened this low end model to the point it was made in China. I decided to replace it with a &lt;BR&gt;Braun 5414. A nice German made shaver with a pivoting head. This shaver was much better than the Inferface and had much better quality as well. Unlike the one I am reviewing now, it is able to get at those close growing neck hairs.</li>
    <li> The Braun 3612 InterFacce Rechargeable Shaver has the basic needs for shaving. Its no Norelco, but for the price it will get your shaving done. Only one thing. It needs more power. I gotta push the shaver practically into my skin to get a smooth shave. Otherwise its a good deal.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a good deal for people who travel. Weighs next to nothing, charges quickly and shaves OK. I&#x27;ve traveled with one for years and needed new blades.... the entire shaver cost about the same, so I replaced it. Not up the the standard of Braun&#x27;s Synchro (which I use at home), but easier to travel with.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t purchase this shaver at any store, since Braun had discontinued producing it,  so was glad to find it online.</li>
    <li> This was the first electric razor I ever owned. I bought it in 2002 and used it till 2009. I guess it was pretty good for the price, but it never gave a really close shave. It was always kind of \\&quot;good enough\\&quot;. My in-laws got me a Remmington R4130NB for Christmas so I&#x27;d have something better and my wife threw this one out without asking me. The Remmington was a complete piece of garbage making me miss this mediocre shaver. I just finished buying the Braun 340 and I&#x27;m thrilled with it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend that as an alternative as it&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks it&#x27;ll cost you.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m secretly hoping it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;As in the case of my walkman,it&#x27;s amazing how such a magnificent piece of electronic engineering can be rendered so user-unfriendly by poor interface design.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is good enough to keep once you&#x27;re paid for it, not bad enough to justify buying a new one, but I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer projects out less than half an inch, about an inch down from the top, which makes it cumbersome at best, as you practically have to hold the side of the whole razor against your face and barely see what you&#x27;re doing. (The last Braun I owned had one that projected a full inch, near the top, allowing you to direct the cut and still see what hairs you&#x27;re cutting)&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is extremely rugged (so it&#x27;s unlikely to break anytime soon, I&#x27;m afraid), well shaped for use, and recharges superbly.  The so-called cutter is useless, but the main foil section works beautifully, so if you don&#x27;t need a quality beard trimmer (as I do) then it&#x27;s a good value.  And it&#x27;s at a pretty good price...</li>
    <li> The previous review is right. I just bought this 3612 and immidately found that the trimmer is too short, thus very inconvenient. I am going to return it tomorrow and get either a Braun 5610 or a Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not give a real close shave, but it has great features like automatic universal voltage adapter, combination shave, 1 hour recharge, easy cleaning, and an 18 month cutter block life.  It is small, great for travel, and it is easy to handle....doesn&#x27;t vibrate your arm off.  It&#x27;s not quite as good as the first Braun shaver I had over 10 years ago, but its good enough to please me with that very low price.  As long as you don&#x27;t want a super close shave, this is a great electric razor.</li>
    <li> Third Braun foil razor I&#x27;ve owned (5564, 5510 also). I was disappointed with the razor overall. The &amp;quot;floating cutter&amp;quot; works poorly. It seemed like a good idea since it works like my older Braun model, which allows you to push the trimmer up so that it can cut longer hairs before they reach the foil. The problem with this model is that the cutter has a safety guard that effectively keeps my hairs from getting cut. The only way to make it work is to apply a lot of pressure to the razor, which results in getting your skin pinched and cut--ouch! The good news is that you can select &amp;quot;foil&amp;quot; and it becomes a regular foil shaver which works suprisingly well (better than my dual foil model in fact). The pop out trimmer works well on sideburns too.</li>
    <li> Single screen is just not enough -- takes a long time for a close shave, even on a light beard.  Must shave everyday with this model or plan to spend 10 minutes going over and over your face.  Trimmer cuts TOO close -- one slip and you&#x27;ll lose an entire sideburn.  Trimmer ejects at an awkward angle, making trimming difficult.  Cord/cordless option is nice, though.</li>
    <li> Fine razor at a good price.  I&#x27;ve bought two -- one to use at home and one to carry on business trips.  Gives a good close shave and the battery holds its charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two cutter blocks for this razor, each lasting about 2 weeks and they both break the same way. A little plastic arm falls out and renders the razor useless. I called Braun. They dissavow any chronic failure with this razor and their only concession would be to send you 1 new cutter block assembly. These cutter blocks cost as much as the razor does. I would NOT recommend this razor to anyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Willy Evans &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  This is the second unit that I have purchased - the first one lasted about 8 years and I replaced the foil/cutter twice during that time.  The rechargeable battery finally would not charge to full potential and a new foil/cutter was needed, so I purchased another unit thru Amazon for not much more than the cost of the foil/cutter at Walgreens!  I would highly recommend this shaver for anyone who wants a rechargeable men&#x27;s foil type shaver.</li>
    <li> Excellent, flexible shaver.  Has pop up device for long hairs, pop up trimmer for side burns and moustache, and gives a very good close shave in third position.  Have been using this model for many years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the shave for the price.  Very affordable and still delivers great results.</li>
    <li> This was a really nice shaver that was so good that I ended up buying three of them before they all went kaput. actually one is still working but it is used mostly as a travel shaver now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, they no longer make them anymore. But I can still dream, can&#x27;t I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Exactly what I wanted. Hard to find.</li>
