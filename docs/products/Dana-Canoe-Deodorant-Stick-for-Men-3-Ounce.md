<li> It is very difficult to find the deodorant stick in this Canoe fragrance, could only find it at Amazon.  </li>
<li> If you want to have people come up to you all the time amd ask what cologne you are wearing, try it you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <li> The first 1/4 of the stick fell off the minute I removed the cap...lousy product.</li>
    <li> No burning, no staining, aluminum free. pleasant scent. Been using for 25 years plus the after shave and cologne. Last the daty.</li>
    <li> Loved finding his favorite!</li>
    <li> IT BROKE &amp; WAS TOO SMALL</li>
    <li> I have used canoe for many years and like it very well. It has a pleasant smell an not to strong.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a full stick but found out it was hollow with a dry looking stick inside container.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent but it does not work as a deoderant</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my best guy.  He&#x27; s been using this  product for years and  won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  It is very difficult to find the deodorant stick in this Canoe fragrance, could only find it at Amazon.  My husbands underarms are very sensitive and he has to be careful what deodorant he uses to keep it from irritating his skin.  Canoe does the job, no irritation, wonderful smell, and keeps him dry.</li>
    <li> Beware. This is not the original Canoe deoderent  that is made by Dana. This smells nothing at all like the Canoe deoderent I have, and l&#x27;ve been using it for years. I should have realized something was to good to be true by the price.</li>
    <li> Deodorant appears to be old or not stored properly. By the time it was delivered, the stick had shrunk to half its size.</li>
    <li> Been looking for it for year.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Fragrance clean and fresh, but not overpowering. Stick last longer than Gillette gel products. I am moving to all Canoe Products.</li>
    <li> Needs a better design container.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant. Most solid stick deodorants will rash me in time so I usually use clear gels, but so far so good with this one. Glides on easily and carries the same great sent of Canoe cologne.</li>
    <li> I have been using all Canoe products for over 20 years.  I&#x27;m not sure why it is so hard to find on the store shelves today. I am glad it is still available today thru Amazon. If you want to have people come up to you all the time amd ask what cologne you are wearing, try it you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Brings back memories....Canoe has always been my favorite, and my wifes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for another after shave and cologne and saw Canoe - I used to wear Canoe when I was in Jr. and Sr. High School and when I first started college (1969). I always loved Canoe - didn&#x27;t know it was still around. I am so glad that I saw it and ordered it. I love the scent and so does my wife of 44 years. I splash on the Canoe and it&#x27;s like I am headed out to a dance all over again. I bought the after shave, the cologne, and the deodorant and I love them all. Five stars for sure.</li>
    <li> This is NOT real Canoe - it&#x27;s the same soapy smelling counterfeit that&#x27;s everywhere. Most disappointed - DO NOT BUY THIS if you want Canoe.</li>
    <li> strong scent to begin with but mellow out then it is nice.that it from there it goes on wet and caused some iritation i left the top off and it shrank to almost nothing and now the whole thing fell apart would not recomend this product</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great and I love it, however I got this product today and was not pleased at all. Usually when you open a stick deodorant it is convex not flat, this product was flat. It may because the piece was defective or used. I would not recommend this product, buy from someone else.</li>
