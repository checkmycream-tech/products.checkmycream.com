      <li>This is a handy Water Flosser to use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to look at the models that plug in or attach to shower head even though it would be nice to have the convenience of a portable unit.</li>

      <li>This is a great idea, if you are like me and use your own dental picks in-between dentist visits then you will love being able to rinse while cleaning with power.  </li>
      <li>This one fits the bill and I would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to save money, is easier to use than floss, and keep your gums clean (and thus, your dental hygienist happy).</li>

      <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
      <li>comfortable!  </li>
      <li>It holds so much more water than a rechargeable style.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think its just ok.</li>
      <li>The water tank has ridges along the sides to accommodate fingers and allows for a better grip, also.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product hoping that it would help my son floss better with his braces.  </li>
      <li>really helps him greatly with his flossing routine.</li>
      <li>so you can be sure water does not leak in and the batteries are secured and won&#x27;t fall out.</li>
      <li>and I am pleased with it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for traveling and handy to just leave it sitting by the bathroom sink for an excellent way to quickly and comfortably clean your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using it daily and have noticed a difference. Not only are more teeth perfectly flossed, but it helps with bad breath too!</li>
    <li> This is a handy Water Flosser to use.  It is lightweight, even when completely filled with water.  So, you can access places in your mouth that are hard to get at otherwise.</li>
    <li> Oral Irrigator very nice, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Been using string floss for years and HATE it.  Always sticking between my teeth and breaking.  Ugh.  The Oral Irrigator is a blessing.  It&#x27;s easy to use and you can feel a dentist clean, when you are done.  Makes you want to floss more,  not less.  Received product quickly and the price was right.  Thanks for a great product.  A+++</li>
    <li> I previously owned the Panasonic brand and while it worked ok, I decided to take a chance and buy this one when my old one broke. Based on the reviews for this model, I was expecting it to out perform but It did not.  I prefer the design and the water compartment over the Panasonic, however the power is not as significant. And, I purchased brand new batteries and twice replaced them in a week.  Either I got a dud, or it zaps the battery juice way too soon.  I give it a 3 for the design.</li>
    <li> Great value, great product.</li>
    <li> After using the flosser, my family&#x27;s mouths felt refreshed. It really does seem to do a thorough cleaning between the teeth without any discomfort. It seems a little bulky for travelling and packing though and you have to be careful to turn it on and off while it is still in your mouth-unless you want water sprayed all over the bathroom. Overall, it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted!  I love that it is easily cleaned and doesn&#x27;t use a rechargeable battery (that doesn&#x27;t last).</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work,,, water didn&#x27;t come out.  No directions but tried everything.  Batteries worked.  Did get a refund,,,, I hope.</li>
    <li> Works well.  I was concerned about the pressure but it appears to be about right.  Not too hard or too soft with the pressure set on high.  It is a little bit cumbersome and might be a problem for someone with small hands.</li>
    <li> Love it is amazing it actually removes tartar and cleans in areas where the tooth brush won&#x27;t make the full job.&lt;br /&gt;However at first the spray nozzle wans&#x27;t sending the water, just air. So i pinch it with a neddle and it starting sending the water.&lt;br /&gt;If you are new using the supply at first you might find it messy but it is just a matter of using the right technique.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that i totally love plus it is perfect to travel with.</li>
    <li> The unit is easy to use, easy to fill and kinda grosses me out to see what was in-between my teeth!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Broken, not worth the postage.</li>
    <li> I just tried out my water flosser and I am pleased with it.  I am getting ortho braces next week and ordered it early to make sure it would work.  It is great!  I have my sinktop flosser, but I needed something I can travel with.  This will do the trick.  It is as powerful as my sinktop flosser as I don&#x27;t need anything too powerful.  The low setting does the job for me, now, and as my gums get stronger I can still go up to high.  Only wish it had a case.</li>
    <li> Incredibly disappointed.  Used it once right after I bought it.  Went to use it again, turned the switch to low and high and nothing.  I put in new batteries, tried again, nothing.  I would chalk this up as a terrible waste of money.</li>
    <li> The force of the water stream from this unit is like swishing water in my mouth.  I expected a stronger water stream.</li>
    <li> Excellent waterpik! My grandma loves hers. She recently got braces and it helps keep her mouth hygienic!</li>
    <li> I am use a water pick flosser at full setting twice daily. It however has to be plugged in. I took it with me on a mission to Haiti. I never used it because there were not outlets in the bathrooms, and I did not carry an electric cable with me. So I knew enough not to bring it with me during a recent trip to Africa. This was the only battery operated option I could find. The water jet, if you can call it that, is so weak it would hardly tickle a new born baby&#x27;s gums. I mean, a few particles of food became dislodged from between my teeth, and that is why it is getting one star. The second star is for a good attempt at making a battery operated portable water-pick. But that&#x27;s about it. Give it some kick and will buy it every time.</li>
    <li> great irrigator for use with mouthwash recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> Bought this to take on a trip out of the country to clean ALF dental appliances and it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to be at all effective. I&#x27;d do better swishing water through my teeth! At home I use a water pik and this doesn&#x27;t even have the power of that, set on 1 (out of 10). 30 days had passed by the time I got home so too late to return this useless item.</li>
    <li> This is my first water flosser and I love it! I&#x27;ve always hated flossing, but this makes it quick and simple.</li>
    <li> Product did not work, put batteries in and nouthing....  Walked away for a few minutes went back to look at it again, the battery compartment was so hot could hardly hold on to  it.  Immediately took batteries out and contacted Amazon, am sending it back for a refund .</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the water-pik I had. It&#x27;s easier to use and because it&#x27;s battery powered I can use it on travel overseas.</li>
    <li> Works great for kid with braces.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as my water pic but was easier to pack for vacation.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love the portability of the irrigator and the fact that it takes batteries.  We had no issues using it any place in the world!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok - it works, but not much pressure.  I&#x27;d consider it more of a strong rinse....</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product!!  It is an overwhelming 5 stars!  I needed something to supplement my brushing and flossing to reduce tartar and this is the answer to my prayers.  It is easy to use, light weight and fast.  I love it so much I am purchasing another one for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for such a wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now and it is very good so far. I really like that it does not hurt my gums as it happens when flossing, even when using it on HI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really like for it to to be rechargeable but as I&#x27;m using it with rechargeable batteries that is not a problem.</li>
    <li> Not as forceful as I thought it would be, but works great.</li>
    <li> This is a great water flosser. I&#x27;m finally able to floss my teeth and not irritate my gums. The nozzle is long enough to reach the back of my mouth and the tank is large enough to floss my entire mouth without having to refill the tank. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like using traditional string floss.</li>
    <li> Awesome, light-weight, strong enough pressure for my sensitive gums, great item!</li>
    <li> Message: This product is quite amazing.  I&#x27;m a lazy flosser but taking this thing in the shower and filling it with room temperature or warm water preferably mouth temperature.  Makes qwick work on the gross buildup and plack deposits in my gums. The dentist was impressed I go once a month for orthodontic treatment.  I got this on amazon for a great deal and will be looking to buy some more for my family and friends. Thanks.</li>
    <li> great compact size and cleaning action, very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Works great on my teeth. Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> With traditional flossing that involves the dreaded strings, I often find myself failing to get around to doing it and it is not enjoyable at all. My gums often bleed and I end up only flossing a couple of nights before the dentist visit. I have been wondering if there has been another way to get the benefits of flossing without the troublesome process, and I stumbled upon this water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, it is relatively quick to assemble and it feels sturdy in the hand. It has a little bit of weight to it, but, in my opinion, that makes it more comfortable and easy to hold onto. The water tank has ridges along the sides to accommodate fingers and allows for a better grip, also. The water nozzle simply slides into place along the top. I like the fact that the battery compartment has a little slot to unlock it so you can be sure water does not leak in and the batteries are secured and won&#x27;t fall out. The tank holds a good amount of water, but I end up going through two tanks. For some reason I over clean my teeth. I brush four minutes at a time, and I guess I floss them thoroughly, also. But that is okay. It is extremely easy to fill with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is that it is so much faster to floss with this water flosser. I can have my teeth flossed in 2 minutes using the high setting, as compared to 5 minutes with string floss. The high setting gives enough penetrating power to get through the cracks of the teeth without damaging gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I quickly learned with the irrigator is that you need to keep the nozzle in your mouth at all times with your mouth closed, and you need to spit out the water often to ensure the water stream is getting in between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am loving this device and I am glad that it has taken away my need to use string dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> great product easy to use</li>
    <li> Mine did not work!  Returning immediately.  Will buy a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have used the oral irrigator a little over a week now and would rate it as superior to my previous Water Pik model.  A 5 on the scale of 1 to 5</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist suggested I use this to help my gingivitis.  After only using a week my gums already look and feel better.  I love how easy it is to use and the clean feeling my mouth has after I use it. I hate using string to floss but don&#x27;t mind using this at all.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product!  Of course, no one likes to floss their teeth.  But I find myself looking forward to using this flosser every day.  I take it in the shower with me.  It has become a part of my daily routine.  I like that it is portable and battery operated.  It is very easy to use and not too strong for my sensitive mouth.  Why would anyone need something more powerful as I think that would hurt your gums and teeth instead and helping.  My mouth definitely feels cleaner, my breath is much, much fresher, and I feel that my gums are getting stronger.  I love this thing!  I have NEVER flossed this regularly before in my life.  I hardly miss a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once in my life, I am looking forward to my next dental appointment, as I feel I teeth and gums are doing so much better.  This is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,</li>
    <li> This product has exceeded my expectations.  After 3 days of low setting I was on the high setting.  The unit allows me to change from low to high quickly and easily.  The water container is conveniently located and easy to remove to clean.  Plenty of power, and really gets the gum line clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see and feel the device working.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love it because it is simple and easy to use. Mostly, I use is when I&#x27;m in the home, but sometimes I take it to my office and use this after lunch. then I feel very fresh right after the teeth brushing. It uses 2 AA batteries as power resouce so it doesn&#x27;t need any recharge equipment with cables. The size of water tank is not so big, but It is acceptable for me.  Finally, if you have other nozzle, you can share this Oral Irrigator body with family by changing nozzle only.</li>
    <li> After several expensive water irrigators I - finally found one that is inexpensive, small and compact, convenient and easy to use, easy to store and does the job efficiently.</li>
    <li> Lasted 2 weeks of uneventful use.  It also seemed like the flow of water was way too weak to clean between teeth unless they are well-spaced.  I would waste the money again, and I got it on a Lightning Deal.</li>
    <li> I have used the irrigator only a few times.  So far, it has about the the same water force as the WaterPic portable. (Neither has nearly the force of the AC WaterPic.). sirobert</li>
    <li> This item sucks did not get anything out of my teeth I had to switch to a different model that I already have a home just to get the steak out of my teeth this item is absolutely horrible do not you dare spend any of your money on this item</li>
    <li> Love this oral irrigator.  Hubby just had gum surgery &amp; this really helps him greatly with his flossing routine.</li>
    <li> I imagined this would be a great tool for oral hygiene had my toddler and 4yr old not gotten ahold of it and began using it as a powered squirt gun. I can comment on the fact that it does seem to make an excellent fully automatic squirt gun, and can empty the cartridge in no time flat.</li>
    <li> did not work, sent it back</li>
    <li> This product is just ok.  I bought it as a prime special.  The batteries wear out quick.  I was suppose to receive free tips and I have not as the time I am writing this. I have had this Irrigator for about 3 months now.  I would not buy again. I will buy one that I can recharge.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this Oral Irrigator.  I had been thinking for awhile that I wanted to purchase one.  For some reason, I dislike flossing and although I try to do it daily, I don&#x27;t always do it. I thought this would be great to use especially on the days I fail to floss.  Upon opening the box, I was happy to see it had easy to read directions.  The batteries were easy to put in (I used rechargeables), I snapped on the tip as directed, filled in the water reservoir and tested it out.  It worked. For me, the low setting did nothing for me, so I turned it to high.  High was better and I used it until all the water was emptied out. I was able to move it around my entire mouth before it was empty which was great. You must do this over the sink to let water dribble out of your mouth until the water is empty in the unit or until you want to turn it off. An on/off button would be better than a slide for on/off but not a big deal. After using it a few times now, I wished that the water pressure was a lot greater. I am not sure how much benefit I am getting from this unit.  We washed off the head and my husband tried it too and agreed that the pressure needs to be stronger.  Since I haven&#x27;t tried other oral irrigators I don&#x27;t know if this amount of pressure is typical.  I did received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The packaging was simple, but the product was kept intact.  I immediately began assembling. The directions were clear and easy to follow.  After my first use, I can say that my teeth, gums, and overall mouth feel cleaner. I was also very excited to learn the oral irrigator came with a free 1-year warranty.  I have already registered.  On a scale of 1-5, I would give the pure enrichment oral irrigator a 5.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy to use water pic and it’s a nice alternative to traditional flossing. Very simple and easy to use. I would rate the product&#x27;s quality 5. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Pure Enrichment Oral Irrigator is awesome. The water pressure is great, even on low. I use it for my braces so it is great to have something so portable I can rinse anywhere, anytime. On a scale of 1-5 it is a 5.</li>
    <li> My son loves this, he thinks he is using a water gun but at the same time he is cleaning and making his gums much more healthier.&lt;br /&gt;It is very powerful, I need to get one myself.</li>
    <li> I use this daily.  It does a good job of getting things cleaned up but it could us a stronger stream of water.</li>
    <li> I had never used a product like this before, but after my last trip to the dentist I was informed by my dental hygienist that I apparently wasn&#x27;t flossing &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34;. Now, I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I get the food out from between my teeth with floss it seems like that&#x27;s the &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; way to do it. Apparently not. But this compactly sized, easy-to-hold device has enough power to both remove the food from between my teeth AND &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; give my gums the massaging they so deserve. I was looking at a few different models and wanted to save as much money as possible while still getting a quality product. This one fits the bill and I would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to save money, is easier to use than floss, and keep your gums clean (and thus, your dental hygienist happy).</li>
    <li> Easy to use, water pressure is good. Compared to more expensive brands it is equally effective.&lt;br /&gt;No charger makes it great for travel.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ever using a water flosser. To be honest, the whole idea of flossing with those strings isn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;exciting&amp;#34; to me. I find it to be tedious an annoying, and so often I skip flossing. My dentist suggested that I look into water flossers to make the whole process easier. I was really excited to receive this item in the mail and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out and hopefully get on a regular routine of flossing. Upon receiving the flosser I noted that it was super easy to set up and get started. It was very easy to insert batteries into the device and getting started was pretty much common sense. The easiness of start up is a definite plus! On my first use I turned the flosser on BEFORE putting it in my mouth, which was funny because water sprayed all over the bathroom! But after that, I learned quickly not to turn it on until it was in my mouth. I have been using the flosser for a few weeks now and I am very happy with the results!! It is very easy to use and takes less than 5 minutes of my time to clean my entire mouth. I am currently using it on the high setting, although it does also have a low setting too for those that are more sensitive. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with bleeding on the high setting personally. I love to use this after I brush my teeth at night, and I can truly say there is a big difference in the freshness of my mouth overnight due to using this flosser. I especially like that it is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t require any cords or anything. The device is appropriately sized and the water canister holds a perfect amount of water for my personal use. Usually I have a little extra water leftover. The water canister actually detaches from the device, making it very easy to fill and empty. I am a petite woman and I don&#x27;t find this device heavy to hold after filling it with water, which is also very nice. It has little ridges for your fingers so you can hold it easily. Overall, I am truly happy with this purchase. My mouth feels much fresher and cleaner, and I&#x27;m sure my dentist will be very happy too!

    <li> I&#x27;ve use a Water Pik device since I was 13 and had braces. The last portable one I purchased from Amazon lasted 7 years and I am sad to say that it is no longer available. I wanted to replace it, but didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg. Looks like I should have, because this didn&#x27;t work straight out of the box. The batteries powered it but no water comes through the hose. I turned it on and off several times thinking it needed to warm up.  It never did.</li>
    <li> Just thought it would have a lot more force.  And, don&#x27;t forget to put in warm water unless you want a brain freeze from hell.</li>
    <li> I waited a few days to do this review.  Initially I was not sure I had made a wise choice, but within 3 day I loved the pure enrichment Oral irrigator. I now unhesitatingly rate it a 5.  Very glad I purchased it.  SO convenient</li>
    <li> This product works great and takes up very little space!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find your product. I had one that was similar years ago. Yours is lightweight and easy to use. I have small hands and this one is not awkward to use</li>
    <li> Would not turn on. Refund process was easy, though.</li>
    <li> Very convenient, except you cannot tilt it for good inner-lower teeth, otherwise water will not flow.</li>
    <li> We received our oral irrigator yesterday.  It seems to work well so far but haven&#x27;t used it yet after eating.  I&#x27;d like to know if we could use mouthwash in it like some others I&#x27;ve read about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial rating of this item is a 5.  This is the first one I have used and assume it is doing what it it supposed to.</li>
    <li> Really amazed at how well this does flushing food material out of my back teeth.</li>
    <li> The first Irigator I received didn&#x27;t work.  There was a customer service email address for the company so I wrote to them an email on Satureday, the day I received their Oral Irrigator.  To my surprise I received a reply email with instruction on how to possibly solve the issue.  Turns out air can sometimes get into the pump system.  Anyway, I tried their suggestions ... several times ... and nothing worked.  Shortly there after I received another irrigator in the mail, directly from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s excellent customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The irrigator works well.  Not as powerful as the Oral B plug-in that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I didn&#x27;t expect a battery powered irrigator to be as powerful as a plug-in.  However, I can now take this one with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever using a Oral Irrigator, I love it!!! I will recommend to family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> Love that I can take care of my teeth better when I am on vacation.</li>
    <li> Not a lot of power and already stopped working</li>
    <li> We purchased the Oral Irrigator because we are going on an extended vacation and we didn&#x27;t want to bring our water pik which would be too bulky. This is a perfect tool. It is easy to use and quite compact. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This water flosser is lightweight, looks good out of the box, and seemed like a great product. The water reservoir is removable and you can fill it two ways. The irrigation tips are thin and easy to install and remove. Although I own a water flosser that has a charger, it was nice to find one that took plain &#x27;ol AA batteries too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oral irrigator seemed like it had all of the basic functions implemented in a thoughtful way, but mine did not work properly because it didn&#x27;t squirt water. No comments can be made about the water pressure since the unit I received didn&#x27;t work. It made the noises, but no water came out. Very disappointed. Item was returned for a refund since that was the only option available. Will not re-purchase. For the price, you can get a water flosser that has an adjustable water pressure with waterproof design, that also travels well.</li>
    <li> The oral irrigator works great. I am happy with its performance. I will definitely buy another one in the near future.</li>
    <li> I purchased the oral irrigator a few days ago, and after using it I&#x27;ve realized that it is so much easier than using standard string floss to get between my teeth. It almost feels like a massage for my gums while working double duty to eliminate left over food between my teeth. I would have rated it a 5 out of 5 but the only downside is the actual size of it, which would make it hard to pack to travel with if need be. Quick note: Make sure your mouth is almost closed when you turn it on or else you will have water everywhere!</li>
    <li> From a scale to 1-5 compared to my other irrigator from Philips I&#x27;d give it a 4. Works well, has enough power and batteries are a good option on one hand but I like the recharging function of the Philips irrigator as well.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oral irrigator. It holds so much more water than a rechargeable style. It works great and very portable. Would love to see an orthodontic tip available. This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Defective, turn on but water does not come through tip</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out a new water flosser and this was reasonably priced so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I liked the size and handle had grooves for easy holding. Here are some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive (If u are not looking to invest big bucks in a flosser, this one is moderately priced. I have seen flossers go for rather expensive)&lt;br /&gt;-Battery Operated (Love that it takes just regular AA batteries, easy to put in, easy to change)&lt;br /&gt;-Water Tank Accessibility (There is a flip door cover on the water tank and its very easy to fill. The clear window lets you see the water level)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Everything Plastic (This might be a pro for some, because they don&#x27;t want the glass tip on other models to break in their mouth or cause cuts or anything, but I prefer the glass tips. This unit is completely made of plastic)&lt;br /&gt;-Water Tank Door (The flip door that closes the water tank is not secure. It doesn&#x27;t snap into place securely and if this was ever stored sideways or anything other than upright, the water will all spill. So FYI if you plan to travel with this, remember to dump all water out.)&lt;br /&gt;-Power Button Is Stationary (This means once you turn it on to either &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, it is consistent flow. I had a problem with that because I didn&#x27;t know if I should put it in my mouth then turn it on or turn it on then try to catch it in my mouth before I sprayed my face with it, either way it was a mess)&lt;br /&gt;-Power (Even on the highest setting the unit just didn&#x27;t give out a strong enough stream of water for it to be fully effective. Its not even a steady stream of water, its more like a pulsation of water. There are very tiny pauses between water flow. Low setting is useless because the high felt like a low on other models I&#x27;ve tried)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think its just ok. If you don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t invest in a better one then this is better than nothing but in comparison of some other ones I&#x27;ve used, the power of thisone doesn&#x27;t do a good enough cleaning, water flow is way too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*This item was purchased at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion)</li>
    <li> Easy to handle.  Portable.  Does the job it is intended to do.</li>
    <li> I bought two. One for myself and one for a gift.  It was just what I wanted.  It works well.</li>
    <li> I am returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Takes AA batteries so you can easily swap them out. Waterproof (I rinsed off the whole unit multiple times). Water reservoir is removable for easy filling and it is large enough for most people to get through one complete session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wouldn&#x27;t travel with it when it&#x27;s full of water or store it sideways. it&#x27;s really annoying that it has a switch rather than a button, water is gushing out of your mouht all over your hands and the sink and you have to try to flip this switch off with wet hands while the thing is still in your mouth because it will spray everywhere if you take it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this would have been fine with me, but I&#x27;m returning it because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough pump. It may work for getting stuff out of braces, but it probably doesn&#x27;t have quite as much power as a small squirt gun. I&#x27;m going to look at the models that plug in or attach to shower head even though it would be nice to have the convenience of a portable unit.</li>
    <li> The oral irrigator is very easy to use and the portability is super important as I&amp;#34;ll be carrying it with me on an extended vacation.  The force of the water stream is just right and adjustable. I like this irrigator better than the one I used before that was rechargeable.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for to clean between teeth in addition to regular flossing. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and easy to fill with water. It sure beats the electric ones! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Worthless..the stream of water is far too powerless to achieve the goal.</li>
    <li> I ordered your product for my son because he just got braces and an appliance.  The water pick works great for getting food particles out of the appliance and for cleaning between the braces!</li>
    <li> It was very excited to find an oral irrigator that was battery powered and not rechargeable like Waterpiks.  I used it for four days and changed the batteries twice.  There was absolutely no water pressure.  I returned it.  I then found the Panasonic Portable Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A for the same price, also double A powered.  IT IS AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> Very prompt delivery.  Product avoids problem of batteries that won&#x27;t recharge.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product hoping that it would help my son floss better with his braces.  It absolutely does!  It is easy to hold and easy to use.  It is very efficient in flossing teeth - I think more than traditional floss.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I had to get braces as an adult and this helps so much!</li>
    <li> great to hold and water reservoir is just enough.  Didn&#x27;t think I would like a battery-operated one, but it works well.</li>
    <li> I received my oral irrigator quickly and in good condition.  Light weight, portable, and just enough power to make my gums feel good and clean the food out of my teeth.  So much of an improvement over the old models where you were hooked to a basin on the sink by a tube!  Love this model.  Cleans the wax out of your ears too!</li>
    <li> This is a very easy to use water pic and it’s a nice alternative to traditional flossing. The tank holds a good amount of water and the pressure is perfect, not too rough. Sometimes I’ll throw a little mouth wash in the tank as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with how quickly I received the Oral Irrigator.  The lower speed is not very effective and the higher speed, although feel good on my gums, really isn&#x27;t effective in dislodging any food particles.  It needs to be more powerful.</li>
    <li> I LOVE our oral irrigator! I have gingivitis and it&#x27;s helping so much.  The only improvement I can think of is if the tips were different colors so my husband and I could keep ours separate.  Thanks so much for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Have.new dental implants and this tool is great to keep up the hygiene!</li>
    <li> I just received my oral irrigator and I love it! My teeth are very sensitive so I was a little scared but no problems at all. My teeth and gums feel so clean.</li>
    <li> Works well and better than the rechargeable ones that loose the ability to take a charge.</li>
    <li> This is worst product Bought from Amazon. It works only a few times and only works with a few brands of battery. I need to buy different from other electronic mall. It should be sold in Amazon which will degrade you.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent service, good price.</li>
    <li> Stop working in 2 weeks. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This battery operated oral irrigator is exactly what I was looking for.  I previously owned a Panasonic battery operated oral irrigator but the water receptacle was not removable so I was unable to disinfect it periodically.  This oral irrigator is powerful, easy to use, easy to clean yet easy for transporting.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and would rate it a 5!!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, if you are like me and use your own dental picks in-between dentist visits then you will love being able to rinse while cleaning with power.  Easy to hold, easy to use.  The company even offers 2 free extra water picks.  Quick fill, easy clean and ready to go in seconds.  Two settings, for more intense or just a light rinse.  Enjoy your extra clean mouth feeling.</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed because it takes practice not to shoot water everywhere.  But after awhile, I got the hang of it and now really like it.  The price is right and it&#x27;s simple to use.  I use it all the time now because I really needed something like this.</li>
    <li> very handy &amp; easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;i have fixed bridges and the water jet/pulse is doing a very effective job of flushing and flossing too.</li>
    <li> Makes noise only, no water came out, bought this mainly for the good reviews. Had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Very week flow. Not a great purchase.</li>
    <li> great!  comfortable!  it&#x27;s really helping my bleeding gums.  easy to use and actually some great customer service.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to replace flossing with this product but after I use it floss still gets stuff out. Also hard to get the hang of not making a mess and the switch is hard to flip one handed</li>
