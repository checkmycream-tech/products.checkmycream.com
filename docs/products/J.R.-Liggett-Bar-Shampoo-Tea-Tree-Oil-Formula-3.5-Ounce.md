<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really wanted to like this product.  I was so excited reading all the positive reviews.  I got it and tried in for a month and unfortunately I did not have a good experience.  I got a lot of dandruff even with Apple cider vinegar rinse and my forehead and head broke out pretty bad....</li>
    <li> I was really excited to go no poo but this bar just left my oily hair very greasy and waxy. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to cut my shower time down and I figured this would be a great way to do it. It does clean hair, however it dries it out soooo bad! I also have a problem with an itchy scalp and this hasn&#x27;t helped AT ALL! I&#x27;ve used it fora week and i have to say I&#x27;m probably done using it.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this and she loves it. She has very thick, wavy, sometimes frizzy hair and this shampoo works really well for her (my hair is buzzed, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter what I use on my head). We switched to using this to decrease the amount of waste we create and to switch to using something that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals and we are very happy with it.</li>
    <li> It definitely was just a waist of money for me. It left my hair feeling terrible. You know how it feels when u wash it with shampoo and don&#x27;t put conditioner? That&#x27;s how it felt I used it for days hoping it would work out for me and it did not. Left my hair like paste and extremely waxy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> First time trying a bar shampoo, and I love it.  Easy to use, tea tree oil feels great on the scalp.  Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!</li>
    <li> Left my scalp feeling wonderful and flake free. My hair became thicker and hard to manage, I definitely needed to follow with conditioner, or alternating between the bar and normal shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t like this, I&#x27;m not sure if it left a residue, or if it just couldn&#x27;t remove residue from conditioners and products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I tried using a clarifying shampoo then I used this again and my hair still felt sticky.</li>
    <li> Ever since I received one of these shampoo bars as a gift, I haven&#x27;t used any other shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of oil, so your scalp doesn&#x27;t overproduce oil and make your hair oily.  I have thin hair, so oily-looking hair is an issue.  I also noticed that my hair had more volume with this shampoo than any other.  Having thin hair, I&#x27;ve always struggled with my hair going flat, and have used many volumizing shampoos and products.  Nothing works better than the J.R. Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars.</li>
    <li> Great all around hygien product. Good size for traveling with travel kit.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to that crappy bottled stuff you&#x27;ve been using all your life. Good size and weight - only takes a little to get the job done so should last a while. Slight tea tree scent, but won&#x27;t leave you reeking of anything. Leaves a nice clean feeling in the scalp and hair without stripping all the natural oils. Also good for naturally reducing dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love this for travel.  I&#x27;ve been able to use it without conditioner and my hair looked great.  I keep it with my travel supplies and also put it into our emergency packs.  I have rather dry skin and hair and I found this to work well, with no extraneous chemicals to irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked fairly well, although I find that sometimes it does not lather enough and I wind up missing parts of my hair, and they get greasy.  Decent shampoo for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months, and I can say it&#x27;s one of the best out there. Very happy with the way it makes my hair feel/look. Great job on providing this great product. Got to appreciate the natural bar shampoo.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the way my hair felt after using and my scalp couldn&#x27;t seem to adjust...but it has a lovely smell. I passed it on to a friend so it wouldn&#x27;t go to waste and she loves it.  Her scalp isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine and her hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I left a more detailed review on the peppermint version of this product.  Both seem equally good.  Won&#x27;t dry your hands. Last a long time, lathers quickly and rinses out easily.</li>
    <li> Super handy for travel and lasts a long time. You barely need to rub any of it in your hair to get a nice lather.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I enjoy all the varieties. The lather is amazing also. What I&#x27;m doing now is cutting it up, putting it in an empty shampoo bottle, adding water and making a very nice liquid version. I&#x27;ll be getting my whole family on it soon.</li>
    <li> It get&#x27;s your hair clean, but you will look like you didn&#x27;t rinse all the way by the end of the day. I used the full bar to give it time to \\&quot;work.\\&quot; It didn&#x27;t.    If you have oily hair, this product make it look like you don&#x27;t bathe every day and may give you dandruf. At least that&#x27;s what it did for me.</li>
    <li> This is great shampoo. You only need a very little. Rub the bar once around your head and you get plenty of lather. Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Im gonna keep this short. This stuff works for me. Hair and skin problems are practically gone. It&#x27;s just worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have colored hair and this shampoo bar made my hair super dry. I love the idea of it- no wasteful packaging, easy to use bar etc. but I quickly had to switch back to my regular shampoo... probably works well if you don&#x27;t have highlighted hair?....</li>
    <li> Update: My hair has never looked this good! I love this! I added it to my shower routine ( I still use shampoo and conditioner) but after doing so my hair got a softer, shinier look. I smile at it in the mirror! Healthy waves! I also noticed it isn&#x27;t as frizzy as before and fly-aways have been tamed! I am stocking up on this! I am going to build a castle of soap bars and claim it my kingdom!   This soap is amazing. It does wonder to your hair. My hair feels soft, supple, I love touch it. As I asked, you can also use it on your skin, but it won&#x27;t last as much. I regret not having gotten more than 2 bars... Now it is out of stock from Amazon.com directly. I prefer to buy from Amazon.com than from other sellers are the site, so I am hoping they restock it soon and I will readily buy 10 bars. If the bar is new, and you try to use it as body soap, it won&#x27;t glide as easily on your body at first until it loses certain layer of resistance. After that, it is a joy ride spreading its natural goodness all over your body. Since I have been using this soap, I noticed my face also looks cleaner, healthier. Can&#x27;t wait to have more of it. Love the smell too.</li>
    <li> Once you go to this stuff you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> Great idea, but not for me. This bar of shampoo lathers great and is a very good deal, but it made everyone in my house who used it break out with massive pimples on our faces or backs. If you have a history of acne or simply have sensitive skin, I recommend another shampoo bar brand like Beauty and the Bees or Apple Valley.</li>
    <li> Works great for scalp and skin irritation... I highly recommend giving this a try! I keep my bar in a plastic snap lock soap dish and use it either in the shower/bath or sink.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because I&#x27;d heard most shampoos strip oils from your head causing excess oil production and greasy hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months now. My hair used to be really oily and needed washing every day. After a transition period I can now wash every other day with this and it doesn&#x27;t look bad.  my hair has great texture. I did start noticing a residue on my scalp with the original formula bar, but this one doesn&#x27;t have it as much, I think because it is more moisturizing with the tea tree oil. Smell is not very strong. One bar has lasted over four months. Much better deal than pricey shampoos.</li>
    <li> Little smaller than I thought, bit works well as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really like but also like the regular shampoo they make.  I will definitely continue to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this shampoo. It was hard to lather and my hair felt so greasy after using it-like I never even washed my hair. At the same time, my hair looked flat and dirty later. I really tried to like it but it was not for me.</li>
    <li> See my other reviews about Liggetts shampoo bars. I gave this one to a friend and she is raving about it. No conditioner to use. She has short hair and loves it. She owned a beauty shop for many years so knows hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about shampoo bars.. I use it daily - makes my shower time a lot shorter and leaves my hair silky. When I was not feeling well for a couple of days I did not wash my hair and it felt a bit gummy. I attribute it to the oppressive heat I live in, having oily hair and laying around more than usual. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair again! By the way, none of their products strips your hair of it&#x27;s natural oil. This would be a super gift - a stocking stuffer, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing - leave the bar to dry on an uneven surface - otherwise it will stick and be very hard to dislodge.</li>
    <li> I. Noticed a little of hair growth, and it lathers up good. I would recommended this product. Its at a good price, too.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for traveling! I use it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s leave in conditioner. Works great!</li>
    <li> With TSA liquid restrictions in effect for the foreseeable future, I decided to look into replacing my liquid shampoo with a bar replacement. I tested this bar at home for a week and discovered this bar&#x27;s formula not only cleaned better, but was gentler on my scalp and didn&#x27;t cause as much dryness as my shampoo. At its current rate of use, the bar looks like it will last much longer than the 12 ounce shampoo bottle. After all my shampoo is used, this bar will be used going forward.</li>
    <li> I like this better than regular shampoo. It makes my hair and scalp feel really good. Its a great product, all natural and it lasts a long time. (If you put it in a dry place after you use it...if not it just melts away.) Love it, can&#x27;t see going back to regular shampoo. This is just too easy.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. I have been using it for several years. The hair is not over dried. The hair does not feel oily either. You can use it every day or as often you need and the hair feels and looks wonderful. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a shampoo bar, and I was concerned that it would have a similar effect on my hair as bar soap, which is to say harsh, stripping every bit of moisture from my hair. Well, it did, but I don&#x27;t see it as such a bad thing anymore. I&#x27;ll try to sum it up with pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Produces a lot of lather. I can basically run the bar across my head twice then put it down, and it produces a ton of suds. You don&#x27;t have to rub the thing all over the place, you just need to get a bit of it onto your hair and then it&#x27;s sud-city, so I presume it will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s very potent in its cleaning. My hair is super squeaky after using it.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a pleasant, subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-This thing strips everything off my hair. It&#x27;s rather unforgiving when it comes to leaving any sort of moisture behind.&lt;br /&gt;-Because of the above, I pretty much have to use conditioner afterwards. That&#x27;s no big deal, but because of it I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about the fact that it&#x27;s a bar, but I wanted to try it because I&#x27;m so tired of having all these plastic bottles, buying really expensive shampoo just to keep flakes away, and going through those expensive bottles within a month. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the shampoo I had. It really did a great job getting rid of my stubborn dandruff, but I figured this has tea tree oil in it too, so I&#x27;ll give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all am I sorry I did so. The bar is small, but I imagine it will last a long time because it actually lathers nicely. You don&#x27;t need much to get sufficient scalp and hair coverage - which is something I was really worried about. Obviously, due to lack of SLS, it doesn&#x27;t lather like a regular shampoo, but it has enough. Seriously. I was also worried the oils would weigh down my hair, but quite the opposite! And I like that my hair feels hydrated after I rinse it out. I was debating whether or not conditioning was necessary. I did it anyway, but my hair has never been that moisturized after shampooing. And it&#x27;s still moisturized the next day. It&#x27;s not even a bit oily near the roots, just clean and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winning event for me was that my husband, who doesn&#x27;t notice ANYTHING, said: &amp;#34;Wow, your hair looks awesome today!&amp;#34; Sold.</li>
    <li> Smells great, sort of messy if you have no where to put it in the shower but overall I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> I like this bar shampoo thats is a fact. I took off one star because its price for its size I feel it little high.  The shampoo bar gets small quickly around our house sees lots of use .The product works well leaves my hair clean the family likes this product. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a few days, but i really like it. I washed my hair with it, no conditioner and when i got out of the shower and brushed, i realized, i dont need conditioner when using shampoo bar soap! Love it! We are getting away from all shampoo bottles as i dont like the chemicals and crap in shampoo and conditioner and the plastic bottles are such a waste! Since i decided to make my own soap with the cold process method, the soap takes 4 weeks to cure, so i decided to buy a bar to hold me over. This is great! my hair is shiny, soft and beautiful. Will be using on my two year old twins also as i want EVERYONE in the house to be free of shampoos in bottles! Again, love it. Also, tea tree oil is great for itchy scalp relief and dandruff, also helps prevent lice! Will be helpful with my older kids who are in school!</li>
    <li> great product and price, much much higher quality than shampoos in bottled packages</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Helps great if you have an itchy head.</li>
    <li> I really do like the way this shampoo left my hair. I will certainly buy this shampoo again once I finish the bar that I have now.</li>
    <li> Good lather and loved it on my natural hair. I used coconut oil as a leave in and my hair was quite responsive. The only complaint... a surprisingly small bar but I have used it 3 times and it still holds up. I think I will get more shampoos from this little bar than I will from a bottle of my usual shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am never going back to normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dye my thin, very blonde hair regularly to a medium brown. It helps cover the thinness at the front of my hairline. This shampoo helps my hair feel great and I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often. Added bonus of not needing conditioner. Yes you read that right, I no longer need to use conditioner. Its fantastic. My hair feels healthy, its shiny and manageable. What more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 weeks, and there is barely any noticeable difference in the size of the bar. I&#x27;m expecting this to last for a while. It also smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this shampoo bar. It has a nice mild fragrance, but with my fine hair I have found this shampoo creates a lot of build up in my hair. It also leaves a thick residue in the shower unlike regular shampoos. You will need to scrub your tub more frequently when using this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, lathers well, cleans well.</li>
    <li> Cleaned my hair and was easy to travel with. Not a fan of this particular scent</li>
    <li> Finally, I can move away from sodium lauryl sulfate (possible carcinogen) found in liquid shampoos. I was impressed, by how well this little soap bar builds a foamy lather.  And, lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - excellent service</li>
    <li> I was really hopeful after reading the other reviews that this would be a great shampoo and would allow me to wash my hair less frequently - definitely not the case. I tried it several times because i just wanted it to work so bad but it left my hair oily and icky each time. What a waste.</li>
    <li> I have been using Shampoo Bars for about 6 months now.  I really like them a lot.  They lather nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have talked a few other people into trying them :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slowly converting the world!!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo bar. Gently rub on your scalp and watch it lather nicely</li>
    <li> so glad I discovered this at health food store yesterday.  normally I get the gallon of Miracle II liquid soap and have not found a similar alternative for years, until this J.R. Liggett&#x27;s tea tree and hemp oil soap bar.  Im using it for face and shampoo/conditioner.  So happy, light weight and affordable. Hopefully all will work out.....</li>
    <li> Definitely will purchase again. it cleans my hair so well. i have been using this brand for about 4 months and its great now my hair stays clean for a week+.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll not go to a different brand ever again. I use the tea tree 3 times a week and then the balancing bar once a week. Probably not NEC, but I like both of them. Dandruff and itching relieved, soft healthy shiny hair in its place. Lathers well. I got the traveler kit once. It comes with a pouch to keep the bar in. Great for travel, camping, and healthier hair! Will be a ligget s user for life!!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this shampoo from another site because I needed to add a few bucks to my order to get free shipping.  When it came I put it aside and didn&#x27;t think much about it.  After a couple of months the wife and I went on a road trip and I decided to take it along.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how much lather this shampoo makes!  And my hair feels squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done, more so than with other shampoos.  Being a guy I don&#x27;t normally get excited about shampoo but I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about this stuff.  I even ordered several bars from Amazon to give as gifts.  If you travel through airports and don&#x27;t want to check a bag this shampoo is just the thing to bring.</li>
    <li> I liked it but found its a novel product and not good for long term use.  I bought them for Christmas presents for eco minded family and friends.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It smells awesome, and it makes my hair feels really good. Note that I have short hair, so it can&#x27;t really comment much about how truly effectively it is with longer hair, but the shampoo does feel well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On that note, does make sure it does not get to your eyes. This thing can bite your eyes.</li>
    <li> Works great. Smells great. Makes travel easier. Stores well. Lasts a good while. Lathers really well if you use it right - just rub the bar on your wet hair a bit then work into lather.</li>
    <li> If you happen to have healthy non-processed hair (virgin hair), your hair and scalp will probably love this shampoo.  But if you have processed hair (bleached, dyed, perm, etc), you might want to stay away!  The low ratings for this bar comes from people with very hard water or mostly from people with processed hair which caused this shampoo not to wash out correctly creating gummy/waxy hair residues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my sister and I started using this shampoo at the same time, my virgin hair loved it!  My sister hated it (she have heavily processed hair, dyed every 3 months or so)!  I don&#x27;t use conditioners at all and this makes my hair extremely soft and easy to comb.  This shampoo should be very quick and easy to rinse out.  Right after you rinse it, your wet hair feels very slick and clean.  Don&#x27;t comb it right away, but wait until hair is almost dry (I always air-dry my hair) and comb it, by this time, it should be soft and extremely easy to do so.  My hair has never been so soft and easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo made!  Love it.  I have short hair, relatively dry skin and scalp and was so happy to discover that this soap is all I need.  I don&#x27;t need expensive and toxic shampoos or conditioners anymore - all I need to maintain healthy happy hair is a single bar of soap.  The soap lasts a long time.  I put it inside a shallow bowl and I think I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months??  maybe more?? and still have soap left to go.  My hair is soft, it shines, and my scalp feels wonderful.  I changed over to this because I have so many allergies and sensitivities to other products.  I can&#x27;t tolerate the toxic chemicals in traditional products and have found that even the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products must contain petroleum because of how my body reacts when I use them.  After two days of using this bar shampoo, the little lumps and bumps and itching in my scalp all disappeared!  And using it saves a lot of water too.  I only wash once and rinse and that&#x27;s it.  LOVE IT Love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy it. My hair seems to take longer to feel greasy, and I only have to wash my hair about 2 times a week. Doesn&#x27;t take much, and suds like crazy.</li>
    <li> All I ever use.&lt;br /&gt;There are people reviewing this who say that it strips the oils out of your hair or ultimately damages it, but I have been using this for the past several years and have never run into an issue like this.&lt;br /&gt;(My hair is pretty short, but these bars clean it and makes it so very soft -- it can be bristly if I don&#x27;t use one of these bars on my hair).&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have used one of these bars for my body, and even once as shave soap when I didn&#x27;t have any of the real stuff. (It&#x27;s not made to be shave soap, though, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this for more than a day or two).</li>
    <li> So far so good. ive recently changed my hair regimen to all natural. all the articles ive read say to give it 3 weeks to see change, im at week 1.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and instead of conditioner ive been using jojoba oil, awesooome</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you don&#x27;t remove this bar from the shower after you&#x27;re done using it, it will turn into a soapy squishy blob stuck to the side of your bathtub.  I&#x27;ve never seen a more squishy &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of soap</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is great. I use it in my hair and for m beard. I have extremely dry hair and this shampoo makes my hair soft without the use of conditioner. It suds up like crazy with very little shampoo and this bar should last at least 4 months or better. I will be using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely cannot believe how much I love this shampoo bar.  In fact, I had never heard of shampoo in a bar until I did a search on &amp;#34;tea tree shampoo&amp;#34; and this item came up.  I was surprised at how little effort it took to achieve a full head of lather with this bar ( I wear my hair very short, and do not color or treat it).  It dries soft and full (I have thin and thinning hair)--again another surprise.  Some tea tree products have a very strong odor:  the fragrance is very very mild, most pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple scents/formulas.  I think the herbal bar will be a wonderful treat.  And if you have scalp conditions, the peppermint &amp; jojoba one is for you (tea tree &amp; hemp is a good second choice for milder conditions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent years in &amp;#34;shampoo hell&amp;#34;, unhappy with this one or that one, spending TONS of money.  But I have found redemption and satisfaction in a little $7 bar of shampoo.  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, this is the real deal.  I hope the Liggett family never stops offering this magnificent little bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bid you peace.</li>
    <li> I purchased the three pack of the tea tree and hemp oil kind when it was still available on here for about $16.00 (though strangely enough the price randomly dropped since then). I&#x27;ve been trying to find a good alternative for my particular hair/skin type while being an all natural shampoo. I have adult acne and my hair gets greasy very easily, so I&#x27;ve always had difficulty with skin sensitivity and buildup on the scalp. To be specific, my skin is actually combination (oily and dry in some places), which complicates things all the more. That being said, if you don&#x27;t have the same skin/hair type as me, then this may or may not apply to you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to find a good enough alternative that it wouldn&#x27;t matter if I skipped a day of hair cleaning (to keep some good natural oils in my hair) like a lot of people with non-oily skin can do. This is my first time using an all natural shampoo, let alone a shampoo bar (everyone I know looks at me like I&#x27;m crazy when I mention its form but I still like the idea), and I was intrigued enough after reading a lot of reviews on here and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m about halfway through my first bar and it&#x27;s not quite met my expectations. It was ordered on June, 15th and I received it only a few days later and have used it up until this point every day or every other day. The bar does melt quite a bit even if you have it sitting on a surface where it&#x27;s not submerged in a stagnant pool. A dry area. Instead of being the semi-solid form it was when I got it, it now has a waxy appearance... like golden melted wax formed into a halfway melted square shape. Melted beeswax is the closest comparison. This might not be unusual, since it&#x27;s mostly oils, but it changes the way it feels when putting it into my hair. Also, I&#x27;ve found that it hasn&#x27;t done anything to clear up the buildup on my scalp. Again, this could just be my own hair type, but it is strange that all these natural oils haven&#x27;t done anything to help my dandruff. If anything, it may be slightly worse. Still, if you don&#x27;t take your time in rinsing it out (emphasis on this right here), then it will leave most of, if not at least some of your hair very oily, which you&#x27;ll notice when it dries. I&#x27;ve found the best way to do it is to let it sit in your hair for a good few minutes, then take a good five or so minutes of just rinsing, making sure to get everywhere more than once, since it does coat. I was wondering why my hair ended up oily a few times using this and discovered taking your time rinsing really does show the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the good, I&#x27;ve noticed it does lather more than I expected despite no foaming agents, which I like. All you have to do is run it for a few seconds through each part of your hair and you&#x27;re golden. Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. The light smell it does have isn&#x27;t half bad. Despite not showing too much improvement with my hair&#x27;s condition versus store bought shampoos, on the bright side, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and at least it&#x27;s all natural, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I clean it all out, unfortunately my hair isn&#x27;t super luscious and silky smooth (someday...). It is soft though, but still fluffy. At least for the first 24 hours. Again, my hair gets oily easily, so I&#x27;m going to guess that this might just be the wrong combination of oils or perhaps I should stop putting off that visit to a dermatologist. Once I get through the three bars, I&#x27;ll order a different kind of J.R. Liggett&#x27;s and see if there&#x27;s any improvement with a different kind, but for now, this is an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; buy.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Absolutely no issues with it, and the bar lasts a while.  It really lathers well, hair feels clean long after using it, and I never would have thought I could have a shampoo that was in bar form.  I used it camping, as then I could avoid the liquids, and it performed perfectly.  I plan on using this all the time.</li>
    <li> Thumbs up!  Please read my review of J.R.Liggett&#x27;s Bar Shampoo, Old Fashioned Original formula.  I am 100% happy with both formulas.  The Original formula has a slight rose scent, and the Tea Tree &amp; Hemp Oil Formula is almost unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to add in the other review that some people use an apple cider vinegar rinse after shampooing with these bars.  I have not tested this approach, but plan to use the vinegar rinse the next time I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> This is all I ever use. Gentle on my hair! Natural.</li>
    <li> I will be traveling overseas this summer so in order to avoid trouble with the TSA, I am trying to minimize the items toiletry items. I decided to try JR Liggets bar shampoo so I would not have to carry a bottle. I love it. I cleans my hair nicely and leaves it feeling fresh. I also use it as a body and facial soap and it works well for that too. One review I read indicated that it could be used as a shaving soap, so I tried that--no go! It makes a terrible shaving soap and left my face sore and torn up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JR Liggets bar shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great shampoo that also works as a body and facial soap. Easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Small size means that you get a little over 6 weeks use from one bar, when used as both shampoo and soap.</li>
    <li> 3.5 ounces goes a long way. I bought the shampoo about three weeks ago and, while both my girlfriend and I use it, only about half an ounce of it is gone. J.R Liggett&#x27;s shampoo leaves the hair feeling heathy and smooth and it&#x27;s all natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting weird chemicals onto my body. I&#x27;ve received many compliments about how nice my hair looks since I started using it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo bar started to work well after one week or two. The first several washes were horrible, my hair was sticky and oily, yet very dry at the same time. I am using Aussie 3 minute miracle with the shampoo now, it is working pretty good. But I started to have some splits on the end of my hair. NOT HAPPY. I NEED A WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. And, the soap goes so FAST. My hair is no where near long, but I still need a whole bar for ONLY ONE MONEY. It turns out to be much more expensive than liquid shampoo now!</li>
    <li> Great for travel. A more natural product too!</li>
    <li> BEWARE: This bar contains almond oil even though it&#x27;s not listed on the ingredients here. If you&#x27;re allergic to almonds, look elsewhere. Not a fun surprise.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but after using for 3 weeks now, I love it!! Never going back to regular shampoo. I have thick, wavy hair and this stuff is just great. It doesn&#x27;t strip the oils and my hair feels wonderful and healthy. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for mothers day. She likes more natural products so I figured this was a good gift idea for her. She hasn&#x27;t mentioned if shes used it but I love bar shampoos in general and we both love the way it smells. The one thing I will say is that it&#x27;s smaller than I expected, but considering the way it&#x27;s used I still see it lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  I will try one more time.  The first time, it may have been used by others in my home as soap, and not shampoo.  So, I will be more protective this time!</li>
    <li> great smell &amp; natural oils...works great with my texture of dreadz..size could be a lil larger but its a good buy</li>
    <li> As far as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; soaps go, this one is the best I&#x27;ve used. It lathers, no residue, no drying effect. I must say though you might want to use a vinegar rinse or regular shampoo occasionally. I have slightly oily hair and I live in an area with hard water and while it cleanses my scalp, it doesn&#x27;t do seem to cleanse my ends very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-lathers&lt;br /&gt;-no drying&lt;br /&gt;-no residue&lt;br /&gt;-no weird smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- not Great at cleansing hair ends ( if you have hard water)&lt;br /&gt;- drys out quickly if you don&#x27;t wrap it in a zip lock bag between washes</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, so so for dandruff and dry hair.  It&#x27;s amazing how just a little bit of the bar can be used to lather up the whole hair (I have short hair).  No artificial ingredients make it safer than most shampoos in this price range.  The only downside I guess is that it uses up your soap bar tray, so that you have to use liquid soap to wash your body.  Unless you use this product to wash your body.&lt;br /&gt;Since this contains tea tree oil, I thought it would be good for my dandruff.  So far it was performed pretty poorly for that.  Probably performing similar to that of the cheaper natural shampoos that have tea tree oil in them.  Which means it is better than nothing, but still not up to par with more expensive tea tree shampoos that have higher concentrations of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is still a great shampoo though.  If you don&#x27;t care for tea tree oil treatment for dandruff, I&#x27;d still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It makes my hair squeaky clean, lasts a long time and smells good. Also easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical, &amp;#34;a bar for your hair? But it has oils in it!&amp;#34;.I received it from my sister as a Christmas gift, and she said &amp;#34;try it for a week, if you&#x27;re not in love throw it away and you&#x27;ll never have to see it&amp;#34;. Purely for the reason of not hurting her feelings (and a little bit of curiosity) I tried it. The first few days were kinbd of rough, I have(or at least HAD) oily oily roots, with very dry/frizzy ends, and curly hair that wasn&#x27;t so curly anymore(just poofy). I&#x27;d tried almost everything to tame it, but no luck. Until this amazing product!!! After those few days of transitioning(be prepared to wear hats!) I had my curls back, softer and better than ever! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and your hair just gets better and better! My hair stylist asked me if I had been &amp;#34;cheating on her&amp;#34; with another salon! I also use no products in my hair besides this, and my hair has been growing much faster than before. Plus there&#x27;s the added bonus of only having to wash your hair  2or 3 times a week (max 3, min 1!)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s all natural and has a light scent. I have a sensitive nose and I wanted something that would just clean my hair and not really leave a scent. You can still smell it while you&#x27;re hair is wet, but once it&#x27;s dry, just smells like clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is also good if you use a lot of hair products. Sometimes, it&#x27;s hard to get that stuff out (I use hair spray a lot). The natural oils in this shampoo cleans the hair really well, but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to switch from shampoo.  And this bar was better than using baking soda and apple cider vinegar.  But overall I think it was a bit hard on my hair.  My hair didn&#x27;t have  a nice texture and dried out a bit while using this, it also seemed more oily.  It also seems like my hair was lightened while using... Maybe with shorter hair?  It did last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Easy to use. No tangles. Soft. Shines. Planning on using it a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great! Will order again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found this to be a miracle product, but I will continue to give it a shot.  I like that it isn&#x27;t chock full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> Very nice, takes some getting used to but I enjoy it. The bar doesn&#x27;t last very long but I have long hair so its probably different for others. It feels good to be nice to your hair.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; shampoo is fantistic.best shampoo ive used. Bar none no plastic to dispose of. And it clean and rinses completely with no need for conditioner,....a mighty fine product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost 20 years now.  After the local stores stopped carrying it, and then no longer able to special order it, I turned to Amazon.  If used sparingly, it will last 6 months.  Buy 3 or 4 at a time and store the extra in the freezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Rub on wet hair until suds appear and then put away. It washed dirt out but not essential oils.  I prefer the Tea Tree &amp; Help oil, personally.</li>
    <li> VERY AWESOME PRODUCT!!  I am a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I love this, my dandruff has almost disappeared and I currently have my husband using this product as well. He has really bad scalp issues and skin issues and has found this product very helpful.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Initially, I&#x27;d purchased one bar, I&#x27;d never used shampoo bars, and I was curious. My head and scalp feel great after using this product. I have to say that while my hair is wet it feels strange, and I can&#x27;t run my fingers though it at all, but after it&#x27;s been towel dried all is wonderfully soft! I went back to my shampoo after finishing that first bar, and couldn&#x27;t stand the way my hair and scalp felt. Since that first bar, and venture back to my regular shampoo, I&#x27;ve purchased multiple bars of this stuff and it&#x27;s great. No more bottled shampoo for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the claims that you can use this as a shampoo.  It felt like any other bar soap used as &amp;#34;shampoo,&amp;#34; and I had to wash my hair three times to get rid of most of the waxy feeling.  It took several days for my hair to recover.  It was disgusting.</li>
    <li> Lathers great, leaves hair feeling clean!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve switched to bar shampoos to avoid SLS&#x27;s and all the other nasty chemicals found in liquid shampoo.  The ingredients in this bar are all natural and just a few swirls on my head creates a ton of lather.  If you haven&#x27;t used a bar shampoo before, it will leave your hair feeling a bit slick.  It also has a very mild, but pleasant, scent to it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old granddaughter had this on her wish list.  I&#x27;m sure it will be all she thought it would.  Transaction end couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It works without all the FDA approved toxic chemical additives. My hair is naturally dry. I find a conditioner isn&#x27;t necessary. It cleans my hair leaving a fresh clean smell. I can travel and go camping with it. And like another reviewer, I keep it in an emergency pack and I don&#x27;t use it for shaving. It is wonderful. I don&#x27;t like it as an all-purpose soap. For that purpose I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Soap Bar. And, I do use it for shaving. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap can also be used for doing hand laundry. I swear by both bar soaps. I love them, because they are clean and natural and do not come with the toxic and harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars for over a year now. I first discovered them in the Duluth Trading catalogue. I will still use typical store bought shampoos at times, but none seem to clean as gently and thoroughly as the Liggett&#x27;s bars, or to feel as healthy, fresh, and comfortable afterwards. The bars last a pretty long time, so you get plenty of washes out of them.  A fine product I&#x27;d recommend gladly to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo !!  It really makes my hair grown fast !!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the bar shampoo for my son and husband as their scalp itches alot.  My husband said his scalp felt really good.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Have oily hair. Gets it nice and clean. Be aware. It strips all oil. If u have longer hair. I can see using conditioner. Lathers very well. Only lasts about 3 to 4 weeks for me. But I double poo every shower. Have very short hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is doing so great with this product. Good for texturized/relaxed hair!!! I love it! Glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair very shiny and it feels very healthy. It takes a little getting used to. I just rub it on the roots of my hair then work it up into a lather with water from the shower head. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair in a waxy texture.. others shampoo bars leave it smooth and silky. Guess it depend on the hair texture</li>
    <li> Definitely feel a difference.  My hair is lighter and softer.  My scalp is much less oily.  Definitely how nature intended hair to be cleaned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. I have very bad dandruff and this is the only shampoo that I can find that will do a good job of cleaning my hair but not irritate my scalp. I have been able to reduce my use of (prescription strength ketoconazole) dandruff shampoo by over 90% since I began using Liggett&#x27;s. The only problem has been that, if it gets soggy, I use it up too fast. So I keep it in a soap dish which has holes in the bottom and is in a relatively dry place in my shower, so it stays solid. I use it every day and get about 6 months out of a single bar, so it saves me money too.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking I was just going to use for after workouts &amp; hockey games.  Now I use it almost all the time.  It doesn&#x27;t make your greasy at all, the bar seems to last forever and there is no parabens, chemicals or weird ingredients in it.  It&#x27;s a vegan product which I like and it&#x27;s a great product.  I plan to buy it many more times</li>
    <li> I am in love with these bars. I&#x27;ve seen reviews left by people who say they leave/turn their hair greasy. This is a natural transition your hair goes through when &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; from chemical laden shampoos. Give it a couple weeks and you will be amazed. My hair is so soft and bouncy and has a natural shine I haven&#x27;t seen since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar really suds up my hair and leaves it squeaky clean. I usually rinse with apple cider vinegar and water sometimes mixed with lavender essential oils or I use a Lush conditioner when it feels a bit dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bars seem small but they last me 1 1/2 to 2 months. They are awesomely portable. I found a Liggets travel container/bar combo here on Amazon that makes it even easier to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to conventional shampoos.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product after researching travel tips at onebag.com. I wanted to minimize the liquids in my bag to remain TSA compliant while at the same time avoiding the need to check a bag. I decided to try this product and have found it to be a great solution not only for traveling but as a full time replacement for my previous shampoo. Based on using this for several weeks, I fully expect this 3.5 oz bar of shampoo to last a LONG time. Granted, my hair is relatively short (finger length). But, I am very happy with the way my hair feels on top of the future savings I will enjoy by avoiding the higher priced shampoo I had been using previously.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  It is good for both oily hair and dry hair, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I do like bar shampoos much more than traditional shampoos.  however, my wife has bad dandruff or rosacea and this stuff did not help nor did the one that was supposed too.</li>
    <li> I buy this for camping and backpacking, because it washes, conditions, and doubles as soap. Plus, it does not have a strong scent that might attract bears! (For those of you hoping for that tea tree smell, it is very faint). This product still leaves my hair a bit icky after repeated use, but it is still the best shampoo bar I have found and perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all left a coating on my hair!!!!! Won&#x27;t buy again had to put a lemon rinse on my hair to get build up off after 2  shampoos</li>
    <li> This shampoo bar lathers really well and rinses out clean. I did use an apple cider vinegar rinse afterwords as my conditioner. My hair felt a little bit different (more waxy or tangly) than with regular shampoo but when dry, I could not tell the difference. Gave four stars rather than five because it was a little bit smaller than I was expecting, but a little bit does go a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product so that I could pack it for travelling, and have one less liquid item I&#x27;d have to worry about bursting open in my bag.  I wanted to test this product out a few times before giving a review, simply so I could get a more definitive conclusion.  In the end, I have to say that this product works pretty darned well, and I may start using this as my shampoo at home as well as on vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, it was disconcerting at first because, at least for my hair, when I first wash using the shampoo, my hair feels really straw-like,  and I don&#x27;t use it as a regular soap because it makes my skin feel really dry in the shower.  HOWEVER, once my hair/skin dries, it feels so nice and soft and silky - and I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner (in fact, I *can&#x27;t* use conditioner with it because when I do, my hair comes out looking greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons to this product, for me, are minor ones - a) I don&#x27;t like how my hair/skin feels when it&#x27;s still wet after using this product  and b) I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, which reminds me of hospital soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All-in-all, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> J.R.Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar may not be for everyone, but it is an excellent product!  I found that it lathers far better than bottled shampoos, for me, and is not overpowering in aroma.</li>
    <li> I was given a heads up about this bar from the Paleo blogosphere. I use it because I have plaque psoriasis - since using it there is a noticeable difference in the skin and the texture of my hair. I&#x27;m not saying this is a cure-all, but it curbs the ugly symptoms that come along with the disease. Very calming.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly pleasant to use. Much better than a lot of shampoos I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I actually bought it as a shampoo for travel.  I like it so much I use it now as a body soap in the shower too. I am trying to steer clear of sodium lauryl sulfate which irritates my scalp and skin.  This stuff clean well and doesn&#x27;t have strong perfume smell like most other mainstream body washes and soaps. The only caveat is don&#x27;t leave it in the shower. The bar will disintegrate fast if left exposed to water!  I have shelf outside the shower with soap dish where I put the bar after use to let it dry out.</li>
    <li> i was so excited the first time around when i found jr liggetts shampoo. then i found this version of it and it blew the original version out of the water! great natural product that is great for flying and lasts a long time. great value, great product.</li>
    <li> Really deep cleans without stripping natural oils.  Hard to believe you can clean your hair with a soap bar and feel so fresh.  The more you wash, the better your hair feels.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, light to carry for a vacation, easy to use, gentle on hair, no harsh chemicals, PERFECT, we,ve adopted it.</li>
    <li> I have used these bars on and off for years. I have really terrible allergies, so I can&#x27;t use any product for very many days in a row, so I have several facial/body moisturizers, several shampoo options, different makeup options etc. Yep. It&#x27;s a pain. I also live in a hot, humid climate that lends itself to all kinds of rashes and breakouts. A little background on what brought me back to this bar in particular. A couple of years ago I developed a scalp condition that caused my hair to fall out in clumps. I had been tinting and straightening my long hair for years, I had a stressful job, and I wore my hair in a knot on the back of my head most of the time to keep it off my neck, and the first signs of the condition appeared under where I would gather my hair. I tried every fancy shampoo and treatment in the book. My stylist did her level best to cure my head, and we talked to a doctor and a dermatologist. Everything would work for a couple of weeks but the symptoms would return (I would scratch my head to distraction) and I couldn&#x27;t keep ahead of it. Long story short (too late!) I wound up cutting my hair practically down to my scalp and leaving it short for a couple of years (I also stopped coloring it, and I didn&#x27;t have anything left to straighten). This helped, but not all the way. It could still flare up pretty easily. In January of this year I started rotating the no-poo routine (baking soda in water and ACV in water) in with my other shampoos. A couple of months later I cycled in this bar. Now 8 months later I do no-poo about 2x per week, Neutrogena residue removing shampoo 2x per week, and this Tea Tree bar with an AC vinegar rinse 2x per week. I have no more symptoms, my hair has filled in and I am letting it grow again. I don&#x27;t know how this will work for someone who has treated hair, as I only used the original bar on my treated hair (and it worked as well as anything else), but for my hair and in relatively soft water this bar has been great. With this routine I have not had a flare up in months, and if I get a little flaking sometimes I do an extra day of baking soda or Neutrogena. My hair and scalp are happy and healthy, lots of body and shine.  No more scratchy melon :-)</li>
    <li> rub a small amount on your hands and work into a lather rubbing your hands back and forth before applying. really good stuff and will last long if you dont store it where water will be washing it away.</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work for me, but it didn&#x27;t. Hair felt like straw, it left a lot of residue in my hair and made my hair freeze straight, as in my daughters would pull on my ponytail to make it stick straight out and laugh at me. I have fine, straight hair and used this with Dr. Bronners citrus rinse based on another reviewer, it was a mistake. Tried a full 3 weeks and used exactly to package specifications. I would NOT recommend. My thinking is that the positive reviews are all compensated endorsers. I was really hoping to forgo traditional shampoos and conditioners for health, and this is my second attempt at trying, and it was yet another fail. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I think the shampoo is great for travel because it is not a liquid.  However, I feel I still need a conditioner after shampooing.  So far, I don&#x27;t know if there is a conditioning bar of any sort for travel.  I have my max of liquids to carry on planes and not bringing liquid shampoo and conditioner would be great these days of TSA restrictions.</li>
    <li> Great product... the company I bought it from shipped it sooooo slow.... so I will never buy anything from them. But the product is great! Easy to travel with. Basically does the job of 3 products. It is a GREAT &#x27;shaving&#x27; cream and a really good Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this bar shampoo for travel. It&#x27;s now become my full-time shampoo that&#x27;s much less expensive and works better than other types.</li>
    <li> Absolute ONLY shampoo I use now. Bought it on a lark at this mega local grocery store in my area because it was super cheap and really natural (my two favorite things) and it turned out to the the ONLY shampoo that actually HELPED my dandruff and didn&#x27;t strip my curls. It&#x27;s just easier for me to get on amazon.</li>
    <li> first time using shampoo bar,  and I am in heaven it leaves my hair super soft and bouncy and shiny and just amazing really. I washed my hair twice back to back,  my hair was left clean, moisturized and fresh smelling. There was no waxy build up that many people have complained about. An amazing experience, I will be buying again. Also the shipment was quick and easy,  this changes everything and I am in love.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but after one use, my scalp itched terribly! I started flaking and ended up throwing all of my jr liggett bars away.</li>
    <li> This product left a residue on my hair even after two rinses with water.  I&#x27;ve given it several chances, even knowing that this type of product will not feel like a shampoo with a sulfate.  The smell is nice.  I&#x27;ve given it to my husband.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo bar, it cleans with no residue, I get good hair shine, good clean smell and the price is right.</li>
    <li> great travel shampoo.  No more 3-1-1 baggy at the airport.  Does a nice job on my hair, and it really only takes like 3 swipes of the bar over my head to get enough shampoo.  It should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend NOT storing it in the shower but on the bottom of an upturned cup on the counter or something so it stands a chance at drying.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to travel with because it is small, vegan, lasts a long time and does not require conditioner. It is literally giving me dreadlocks. My hair is constantly an oily mess and could NEVER be considered clean. This product is making it dirtier than it was before I wash my hair with it. I do NOT recommend this shampoo. I do not normally have oily hair and now it is just a wreck. I need to find new shampoo ASAP to save my hair from dreading up completely.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I have recently moved to the south and have been fighting humidity and skin changes. Nothing I have tried has helped. I found this while searching for tea tree shampoo. I love the scent, or lack there of, and the clean lather. You just rub it over your wet hair and work up to a lather. It&#x27;s easy and feels relatively low maintenance as you can use it for hair and skin. The only thing stopping me from rating it 5 stars is how my hair feels after rinsing. Like a squeaky clean that makes it difficult to run your fingers through. But once dry it&#x27;s soft, manageable, light and clean. Some days I use a conditioner after. As a pro my frizz has dramatically decreased and my scalp itchiness has also lessened. Cons would be that I feel it is harsh on my color and I would benefit more not using it everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 1 month into using only this shampoo bar and an apple cider vinegar rinse and I will never go back!! My hair is becoming way more manageable. It&#x27;s as soft as my 1 yr Olds baby curls! I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product. My hair is literally transforming. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using the product for longer. If your having issues with it here&#x27;s a few tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▪If you have hard water use a baking soda water mix on your hair before your regular tap water. It will soften the water and help the shampoo wash out easier.&lt;br /&gt;▪Make sure you rinse your hair thoroughly. I use a brush in the shower to help rinse. Be gentle or hair will break.&lt;br /&gt;▪Make sure you suds the shampoo enough. It takes a lot of water and scrubbing but that gets it clean. The wetter the hair the better it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;▪if your hair feels dried out try an apple cider vinegar rinse. 1 cup apple cider vinegar to 3 cups water. (Adjust to desired outcome) More vinegar&#x3D; more conditioning. Keep in mind a little does condition very well.&lt;br /&gt;▪washing may not be necessary everyday. Try a hot water rinse between washes to keep hair fresh looking.</li>
    <li> Love this soap so far. Posted full review on balanced shampoo bar page, but so far this soap has been great for my fine/thin/greasy hair, and I plan to keep using. The tea tree slightly tingles on scalp making it feel extra clean. For the price - haven&#x27;t found a better shampoo yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain it doesn&#x27;t lather well or leaves a waxy feeling on hair. I have not found this to be true at all - the shampoo lathers well and my hair feels almost squeaky clean after. However, we do have a water softener in our house and this may contribute.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo by looking for anything to help keep my beard from flaking. I read a review about this shampoo soap that was used with apple cider vinegar rinse. Normally I would never try that but itchy, flaky beard left me no choice. It really does work, but I don&#x27;t use the vinegar everyday. Maybe once a week but the tree oil and hemp leaves my hair really clean even without the vinegar. I also have oily hair and skin and it takes out the oil and leaves my head squeaky clean. I wish I could get this stuff from Walmart so I could always get it anywhere but it&#x27;s still worth it to wait for shipment. Bottom line is if you have a beard use it.</li>
