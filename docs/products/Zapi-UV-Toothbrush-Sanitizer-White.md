### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>perfect, have used it every day for about a year</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>it was the perfect gift.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clean and sanitized...feels really good!</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m using it for a kind of electric toothbrush where the heads don&#x27;t fit in those kinds so this was the best option on the market without buying a new toothbrushing system.</li>
      <li>I love being healthy.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and the packaging (box), since it was a gift, was great.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t work most of the time.</li>
      <li>It makes me feel better about using my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I love the Zapi, I don&#x27;t have to plug it up, and I can bring it with  me on a trip.</li>
      <li>I love this device.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much, I ordered this one as a replacement from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Gave it to my folks for a present and they LOVED it!</li>
      <li>Works great and love that it runs on batteries - no extra cord to find a place to plug into.  </li>
      <li>Love the idea of the sanitation, however the solar powered brush just doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth.</li>
      <li>The others worked fine at that point.  </li>
      <li>The Zapi UV sanitizer is fantastic and a must have.</li>
      <li>The exterior button light would turn on and light up</li>
      <li>even though the exterior light would come one.  </li>
      <li>but I have to tap the unit for the UV light to even turn on.  </li>
      <li>Only gripe is that the UV light shines through an unprotected path and in theory could damage your own body&#x27;s cells (skin, vision, mostly).</li>
      <li>I wished they would have worked as the idea was cool.  </li>
      <li>Have been looking for one of these for a few years and happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>still worth carrying it by all means.</li>
      <li>Kept the tooth brushes fresh-</li>
      <li>I got this thing and put in a set of fresh energizer batteries</li>
      <li>&quot; Sometimes the outside light turns on, but the inside UV light doesn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
      <li>It broke within the first week of use.  </li>
      <li>Only worked for a couple of times and now the light doesn&#x27;t come on at all!  </li>
      <li>There is nothing more gross than a dropped or germy toothbrush since it can be quite a walk to the latrines to brush your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and takes up little space, which I love.</li>
      <li>So I dont care how fast it uses batteries...</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I bought another which was shipped from Amazon and, while it was the same great product (different color), the clear, plastic packaging was less desirable (particularly for a gift item.</li>
      <li>I had one previously and dropped it and broke the UV light inside.  </li>
      <li>It is only 4 months old.</li>
      <li>What a colossal waste of money.</li>
      <li>and you toothbrush can get germy if you don&#x27;t let it dry completely and air out.</li>

<li> Since using the Zapi there have been no snotty noses despite all the sick patients and kids around us.  </li>
<li> This is the worst!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> perfect, have used it every day for about a year</li>
    <li> I bought this Zapi UV Toothbrush sanitizer and I have returned and received 2 replacements and it STILL does not work.  The exterior button light would turn on and light up but I have to tap the unit for the UV light to even turn on.  Sometimes that does not work either. I would have to open the battery housing, rotate the batteries in its place, and then it works sometimes.  That is a sign of POOR quality... and for what they charge for it, it&#x27;s a piece of junk.  I tried to live with the 3rd unit I received for a while in the hopes that, with constant use, it would be broken in and start working properly.  I&#x27;ve lost my patience.  SAVE YOUR MONEY and do not get this!  You will just be frustrated.</li>
    <li> I love the Zapi, I don&#x27;t have to plug it up, and I can bring it with  me on a trip.</li>
    <li> The Zapi UV sanitizer is fantastic and a must have. Easy to use and takes up little space, which I love. Knowing everytime I use my toothbrush it&#x27;s clean and sanitized...feels really good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Zapi toothbrush sanitizer for 3 weeks and changed the batteries 2x already.  The only thing it appears to be zapping is the life out of the batteries.</li>
    <li> We bought three of these (one blue, one orange, and one white) for Easter.  The white one arrived broken; that is, it would not light up inside (the santatizing part) even though the exterior light would come one.  The others worked fine at that point.  Amazon sent a replacement white one, and it worked for a while.  Within a month of use, the blue one stopped working.  We replace the batteries, but it never worked again.  The next week, the orange one met the same fate, and this week, the white one broke for a second time.  I don&#x27;t ever recall when 4 separate copies of the same item lasting less than 2 months, but there appears to be a defect in the manufacturing.  I wished they would have worked as the idea was cool.  Unfortunately, I wasted $90 instead.  I would stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> Only gripe is that the UV light shines through an unprotected path and in theory could damage your own body&#x27;s cells (skin, vision, mostly). UV cleaners that close around the toothbrush entirely seem to have a filtered window. However, I&#x27;m using it for a kind of electric toothbrush where the heads don&#x27;t fit in those kinds so this was the best option on the market without buying a new toothbrushing system.</li>
    <li> This is the worst! I got this thing and put in a set of fresh energizer batteries and it never worked.....enough said!</li>
    <li> Only worked for a couple of times and now the light doesn&#x27;t come on at all!  I&#x27;m not sure what can be done and I feel as if it was a rip-off</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews.  The Zapi does go thru batteries.  We bought the white and the Hi-Yah.  We change the batteries in the white every 4 weeks and every 3 in the Hi-Yah.  Other reviews talked about build up...read the directions...the toothbrush has to be dried with a towel before putting it in the Zapi.  We buy the batteries from the dollar store, they last just as long as the others and they are only a buck, cant beat that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not been sick since we started using the Zapi.  Prior to using the Zapi we were sick all the time because we work in a medical office and have toddlers and school age children in our life.  Since using the Zapi there have been no snotty noses despite all the sick patients and kids around us.  So I dont care how fast it uses batteries...I love being healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military and brought this for a deployment. There is nothing more gross than a dropped or germy toothbrush since it can be quite a walk to the latrines to brush your teeth.  You have to put your toothbrush away to keep dirt and dust off of it and you toothbrush can get germy if you don&#x27;t let it dry completely and air out. Its small and travels easily but with 4 double A batteries it was a little on the heavy side for its side--still worth carrying it by all means. I used it twice a day every day!</li>
    <li> I love this device.  I had one previously and dropped it and broke the UV light inside.  I loved it so much, I ordered this one as a replacement from Amazon.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works great and love that it runs on batteries - no extra cord to find a place to plug into.  Have been looking for one of these for a few years and happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and the packaging (box), since it was a gift, was great.  I bought another which was shipped from Amazon and, while it was the same great product (different color), the clear, plastic packaging was less desirable (particularly for a gift item.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my folks for a present and they LOVED it! Kept the tooth brushes fresh- my mom is a bit of a germ freak... it was the perfect gift. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space. It makes me feel better about using my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It broke within the first week of use.  I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews!!!</li>
    <li> Keeps tipping over. Love the idea of the sanitation, however the solar powered brush just doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth. I use it, then go back over my teech with my Arm &amp; Hammer Spin Brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. He&#x27;s a germaphobe, so he uses it at least twice a day. I need to buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> The product never worked properly from the beginning.  Tried fixing it, and working with it for some time, but in the end, it just wasn&#x27;t working properly.  Colonial Medical Devices refused to take it back saying the return period had expired.  It is only 4 months old. Bad customer service, don&#x27;t order products from Colonial Medical Devices!!!</li>
    <li> I bought 5 of these at Christmas for each member of my family. What a colossal waste of money. The batteries constantly need changing. They don&#x27;t work most of the time. My kids are always running to me \\&quot;it&#x27;s not working again.\\&quot; Sometimes the outside light turns on, but the inside UV light doesn&#x27;t turn on. I know it&#x27;s not burned out because it might work a few days later.  Also, the egg design is poor. The bottom isn&#x27;t heavy enough and it constantly falls over and makes the bathroom look sloppy.</li>
