      <li>This stuff works great and the peppermint is actually quite refreshing.</li>
      <li>I has a strong sent.</li>
      <li>nice smell and really works!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in my feet since I started using it.</li>
      <li>so it cleans and exfoliate the skin little bit better!!!</li>
      <li>it gets your feet really clean on the bottom.</li>
      <li>You will need a lot of strength to squeeze the scrub out of the bottle, even while still full.</li>
      <li>It works very quickly and there really isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; involved.</li>
      <li>I love the peppermint smell, not to mention the results of super soft feet.</li>
      <li>The product itself is okay, even quite nice and smells great, but the packaging is really bad.</li>
      <li>Much prefer Curel Foot Therapy Cream and Ms. Pedicure Foot Scrub as my feet were smooth within days.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it feels really good on my skin and its a little cooling sensation from the peppermint and the sugar granules are a bit tougher than salt</li>
      <li>I use it daily and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Love how my feet feel after using this product, I use it with my pumice stone in the shower daily.</li>
      <li>I found it during a recent trip to Hawaii and bought five more off Amazon for family and friends.</li>
      <li>If you use it first in the shower it&#x27;s easy to transfer the strong peppermint near your eyes which can burn slightly.)</li>
      <li>but there isn&#x27;t much oil in the mix.</li>
      <li>I always buy different scrubs from different labels,  and have never seen her this thrilled,  </li>

      <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I not only use it on my feet, but also a couple times a week as a face scrub and for a special treat, an occasional all over body scrub!</li>
      <li>Nice on my achy, tough feet.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a scrub that will leave your feet feeling soft and silky, this will probably not meet your expectations.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft without toxins/chemicals.</li>
      <li>Leaves my feet soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>In fact, my feet felt pretty dry afterward.  </li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t have the strongest hands, but there is clearly some scrub left in there</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just right to keep those dry feet in check year round</li>

<li> This is a small bottle (which is my only complaint).  </li>
<li> Just apply, rub it in a little and you&#x27;re done.</li>
<li> , I have to step on it to squeeze a little out at a time.</li>
<li> so you&#x27;d have to squeeze the bottle really hard to get it out of the bottle.</li>
<li> it is so hard to get the scrub out.</li>
<li> I felt the scrub was too thick</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s not easy to get the scrub out of the bottle because it is a very thick paste</li>
<li> Be prepared for a serious punch of peppermint.  </li>
<li> BUT doesn&#x27;t seem to heal feet or make them softer, and mine aren&#x27;t that bad of shape to begin with.</li>
<li> Makes me crazy!!!!!</li>

    <li> nice smell and really works!</li>
    <li> Simply the best foot scrub I have ever used. It works very quickly and there really isn&#x27;t much &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; involved. Just apply, rub it in a little and you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Leaves my feet soft and refreshed. I love it! I couldn&#x27;t find foot scrub in the store anymore so I started buying this regularly stuff online.</li>
    <li> It feels very good on my feet i rub in well.  once washed off you can see and feel the difference.  How great is that.</li>
    <li> OMG!! This product is really great! I like this product because it feels really good on my skin and its a little cooling sensation from the peppermint and the sugar granules are a bit tougher than salt so it cleans and exfoliate the skin little bit better!!! I love all of Tree Hut products keep making this magic in a bottle. :)</li>
    <li> The product itself is okay, even quite nice and smells great, but the packaging is really bad. You will need a lot of strength to squeeze the scrub out of the bottle, even while still full. They should have put the scrub in a tub instead.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Nice on my achy, tough feet.  Highly  recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Tree Hut brand. Costco had it last Christmas, but no this year so I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s great. Leaves your skin soft without toxins/chemicals.</li>

    <li> What a wonderful, GREAT smelling treat for my feet!</li>

    <li> Works great after soaking me feet. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of peppermint I would not purchase. I has a strong sent.</li>
    <li> I like the way my feet feel once I rub the scrub into my feet.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this stuff is great!  It smells wonderful and is the best foot scrub I have ever used.  I would highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s the perfect home remedy for getting your feet ready for sandals and summer.</li>

    <li> My nail artist loves this scrub! I always buy different scrubs from different labels,  and have never seen her this thrilled,  she&#x27;s always like &amp;#34;Where did you buy this!?&amp;#34; Lol. Im really glad I found this product, washes off easily,  and smells super nice.  Loved it</li>
    <li> Great foot scrub. Works well.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint smell and makes my feet feel great!</li>

    <li> Love how my feet feel after using this product, I use it with my pumice stone in the shower daily.It smells good too!!!</li>
    <li> I Order it often.  It is a good price and works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good foot scrub. But it&#x27;s not easy to get the scrub out of the bottle because it is a very thick paste so you&#x27;d have to squeeze the bottle really hard to get it out of the bottle. And since you&#x27;ll be in the shower you&#x27;ll have wet hands and water pouring on you while you try to squeeze the life of this bottle.Not for me.</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff every other month and love it.  The smell, the feel, the way it works - everything is great. I not only use it on my feet, but also a couple times a week as a face scrub and for a special treat, an occasional all over body scrub! I buy this along with the Tree Hut Soothing Foot Cream, Aloe and Peppermint, 5.8-Ounce and the two make a great pair. I let my friends sample the product(s) and they agree. I highly recommend this product AND the Foot Cream.</li>
    <li> This smells good and scrubs the feet well but there isn&#x27;t much oil in the mix. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foot scrub, hands down.  I regularly use it with the coordinating foot cream and, honestly, it is one of the best and most affordable on the market.  The peppermint scent is not at all overpowering, and your feet will appreciate the care and attention.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> By far the best but scrub I&#x27;ve used yet</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and the peppermint is actually quite refreshing. I found it during a recent trip to Hawaii and bought five more off Amazon for family and friends. The foot cream goes perfectly with the scrub - not greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this it&#x27;s just right to keep those dry feet in check year round</li>
    <li> After and good soak on my feet and using this product my feet feel so good</li>
    <li> This is a small bottle (which is my only complaint).  I use it daily and absolutely love it.  I would like this item to come in a bigger bottle, but I buy two at a time.  (Hint -- use this last.  If you use it first in the shower it&#x27;s easy to transfer the strong peppermint near your eyes which can burn slightly.)</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of grit, and not oily like some other products, but still soothing. Love it! Gonna get some more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in my feet since I started using it.</li>
    <li> superb foot scrub relaxing</li>
    <li> Be prepared for a serious punch of peppermint.  Lovely scrubbing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I use this on my pumice stone and it works great.Nice minty scent.If you go barefoot alot it gets your feet really clean on the bottom.</li>
    <li> The positives:  It&#x27;s smells wonderful and sure feels great when it&#x27;s being massaged in.  The negatives:  Not much emollient/moisturizing action at all.  In fact, my feet felt pretty dry afterward.  If you&#x27;re looking for a tingly, great-smelling sugar scrub, this will probably work for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for a scrub that will leave your feet feeling soft and silky, this will probably not meet your expectations.</li>
    <li> This has been an excellent addition to my foot care needs. I love the peppermint smell, not to mention the results of super soft feet.</li>
