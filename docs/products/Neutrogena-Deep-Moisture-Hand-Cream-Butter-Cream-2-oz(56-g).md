      <li>works effectively, but smells not as good as i expected,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that problem with the original Hand Cream.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easily and is absorbed so quickly that I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for a tissue to wipe off the excess, because there isn&#x27;t any excess.</li>
      <li>But it would be much simpler for the manufacturer to come up with a better design.</li>

      <li>This is the first time I have ever used a hand cream and have seen immediate results.&lt;br</li>

      <li>This comes pretty close.  </li>
      <li>Love their regular product.  </li>
      <li>but I get too much out at a time when I use it.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps, if enough of us write in about it, the company will see fit to begin production of it again.  </li>
      <li>You;ll be much happier.</li>
      <li>I really like the hand cream</li>

      <li>I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this and one of them stated that the container is small and they&#x27;re right</li>
      <li>The trick is to only use a small dab in order to get your monies worth since it is a bit pricey for the size of the container</li>
      <li>Buy this only if you have mild dryness and aren&#x27;t going to wash your hands for at least an hour.</li>

    <li> I have enjoyed using my Neutrogena Comforting Hand Cream daily. This size easily fits into my purse.</li>
    <li> Love their regular product.  This one is not as good. Go with the other one.  You;ll be much happier. I am.</li>
    <li> I really like the hand cream but I get too much out at a time when I use it.  I&#x27;ve tried to control it to less amount but I invariably get too much.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with the original Hand Cream.  I wish they would alter the dispensing method a bit.</li>
    <li> My favorite item in my purse. This hand moisturizer works great. I highly recommend this product to battle dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is simply the only hand cream that actually makes my bends feel hydrated and keeps them that way through winter (without applying several times a day).</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  The last time it was purchased for me it was $7-8.  When I bought it this time I didn&#x27;t realize it was $16.  Had I known I would not have bought it.  I realize Neutrogena products are expensive but this was a overpriced.  Learned my lesson; read and reread everything!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you’ve spent hundreds of dollars on hand creams looking for the perfect one.  This comes pretty close.  It is absorbed by your skin almost immediately and performs to almost perfection.  It has a subtle and pleasant butter cream smell.  One problem: there&#x27;s quite a lot left that won’t leave stays the tube voluntarily.  Yes, I know that trick about cutting off the end and sealing in a small plastic bag.  But it would be much simpler for the manufacturer to come up with a better design.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;m so sad it was discontinued. That&#x27;s why I stocked up! Thanks for helping me find it !!</li>
    <li> works effectively, but smells not as good as i expected, if you don&#x27;t care the smell, this is a good product the you can consider to buy</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry. This is very rich and I like it. It&#x27;s good for dry-skin people in dry whether like winter.</li>

    <li> I ran across this hand cream a few years ago, and I absolutely loved it then and now! It goes on easily and is absorbed so quickly that I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for a tissue to wipe off the excess, because there isn&#x27;t any excess. I&#x27;ve gone through countless tubes of the stuff, and now I find myself worrying what I&#x27;m going to do when Amazon runs out of their supply!  It isn&#x27;t listed any more on the Neutrogena website.  Perhaps, if enough of us write in about it, the company will see fit to begin production of it again.  I can only hope!</li>
    <li> I trusted Neutrogena to make a good product. It is a very good hand cream but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for. My hands are severely dry since I wash my hands several times a day. This washes off within a few washes. Buy this only if you have mild dryness and aren&#x27;t going to wash your hands for at least an hour.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used a hand cream and have seen immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;My hands are smoother and wrinkles are gone.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is the best!!! Even better than those super expensive ones I used. Absorbed in a few seconds and smells so goooooood!</li>
    <li> I really like this hand cream it makes your hands feel so nice and not greasy.  I thought I was getting a good deal unitl they charged me $2.99 per tube shipping fees.  That I thougth was a little rediculous for such a small tube.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream. I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this and one of them stated that the container is small and they&#x27;re right BUT.....this hand cream is concentrated so, just a small dot goes a long way. I&#x27;ve always hated rubbing my hands together when putting hand cream on because I always tend to wash the inside of my hands to get the lotion off. With this hand cream I put a small dot on top of one hand and then I just rub the tops of my hands together so, that way the insides do not have any hand cream on them. I&#x27;ve used this daily for about two weeks and I can see a noticeable improvement. I was looking for a hand cream that would moisturize my hands to see less wrinkles and it works. The trick is to only use a small dab in order to get your monies worth since it is a bit pricey for the size of the container but it works :)</li>
    <li> This has the best consistency. Not greasy, sinks in very well. It is about the best hand cream I have come across in a long time. A little pricey, though.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It feels good, has a light and pleasant fragrance, and is not greasy. I leave a tube in each car and one at my desk. I carry one in my pocket if I will be out all day.</li>
