      <li>This brush is excellent.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an awesome brush, this is it.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly for what I need.  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s awesome about this hairbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing great.  </li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a brush that was good for my hair.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s 100% Boar bristles, so it&#x27;s actually good for your hair!</li>
      <li>Great, strong bristles.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a lot more to it, and a lot of information online, so do some research as it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind buying 3 in a pack to receive the same type looking brush that I&#x27;ve always been very happy with.  </li>
      <li>I think it is okay, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
      <li>It is helpful in brushing out my hair and keeping it silky, but I would like to see it spread the oil from the roots to the tips a bit more.</li>
      <li>Now that I am used to how it feels I love that it doesn&#x27;t tear through my hair.</li>
      <li>Love the boar bristle bushes..</li>
      <li>There are a couple bristles on the brush that might be boar&#x27;s hair, but 99% of the bristles appear to be plastic, as many of the newer reviews are mentioning.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>this would be a good cho Choice for going straight.</li>
      <li>it works, our hair is still clean, our hair is still healthy, and no, we don&#x27;t stink.</li>
      <li>its an amazing brush soft and sturdy at the same time, the edges are perfectly curved and the durability is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as oily, it detangled it, it spread out the oils evenly, and it gave my hair a nice shine!</li>
      <li>Durable plastic makes it easy to thoroughly clean.  </li>
      <li>Of course, this product and review has nothing to do with Amazon; they are fabulous, as always.</li>
      <li>Dropping the star rating to 2 stars to reflect an otherwise good brush, but completely misleading product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my old favorite is at home and still works fine / better.</li>
      <li>Nothing like the original Ace brushes.</li>
      <li>Lacquered wood heads don&#x27;t clean well.  </li>
      <li>but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable and it was shipped rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>I bought this expecting it to be like my other one that I love and can&#x27;t find any more, made by another manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much and thought a backup might be useful.</li>
      <li>Not only does it thoroughly brush the hair and remove tangles, but it effectively spreads natural oils essential for healthy and strong hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased this brush, and, when it wears out, I hope to get the same to replace it.</li>
      <li>I search for the exact same brush at many stores</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact model of brush for over 10 years now and am veryhappy to have found it again now.</li>
      <li>I felt at first that it wasn&#x27;t doing an efficient job, it was.</li>
      <li>I had previously brought one of these brushes a long time ago, I loved the brush so much that I was thinking if I lost the brush would I be able to get another.  </li>
      <li>I would have bought a natural boar brush, but I&#x27;m cheap, so I bought this one, and I must say that the first time I used it, I was completely floored.</li>
      <li>I bought a boar hair brush because I was told they were great for that, but this has left me wishing I would have bought a more expensive brand.</li>
      <li>I really like the way my hair has felt since using this brush</li>
      <li>It was reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>It feels gentle on my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>difference between the older brush and the newer brush is the ACE markings on the bottom of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;the older version had a gold bumped \\&quot;ACE\\&quot; like the one amazon put in the image description(but</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made brush with stiff plastic bristles.</li>
      <li>when it arrived it was the exact same brush that I have, now I have a backup.</li>
      <li>Well the backup I just received is a cheap imitation of my old brush.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would criticize is that the brush is kind of small.</li>
      <li>Product quality is as expected and with natural boar hair bristles is priced right.</li>
      <li>The other reviewers are right, there&#x27;s almost no boar&#x27;s hair bristles in these brushes.  </li>
      <li>I have thinning hair and it is easy on my scalp but firm enough for my hair.</li>
      <li>this created a static in my hair not a good choice for me for maybe a courser texture of hair</li>
      <li>It has very long bristles, so it can reach my scalp and really give my hair that extra shine and softness.</li>

<li> A few strokes in my hair and it was like new!</li>
<li> so I only use on travel trips i.e. if I loose no big deal...</li>
<li> Cheap lousy brush.</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t go back to the other brush.</li>
<li> In fact, I bought 2, thinking what a great deal that was, but it is 100% boar crap!</li>
<li> I have very long hair, and when I first saw this compact brush, I was skeptical.</li>
<li> and I won&#x27;t use any other brush.</li>
<li> For those of you who haven&#x27;t heard of the no shampoo, or \\&quot;no-&#x27;poo\\&quot; method, it&#x27;s a method where you choose not to use shampoos and conditioners, (either because you&#x27;re earth or health minded, you want to save money or time, you are a survivalist and want to minimalize your dependence on the unnecessary, or whatever), and instead you allow your hair to go back to it&#x27;s natural state by allowing it to stop overproducing sebum-oil (which it&#x27;s forced to do when we strip it dry with shampoo).</li>
<li> AND it was thick enough to get through my medium-thick hair!</li>
<li> I have long, thick hair.  </li>
<li> /&gt;But when i purchased 10 of them for myself 3 years ago, I was shocked to find out that the bristles were more tough  and felt like plastic, and they had sharp edges.</li>
<li> Another case of Amazon letting outside vendors sell pure crap.</li>
<li> It took a few times to get used to how it feels brushing my hair.</li>
<li> I should have known not to waste my money.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s got stiff nylon bristles and just one or two boar bristles.</li>
<li> The bristles seem to pull my hair and they also don&#x27;t get through my thick hair well.</li>
<li> I have very thick, waist length hair</li>
<li> This brush will not penetrate my hair so really useless.  </li>
<li> The other points I make about the brush still apply, but I&#x27;m very disappointed about</li>
<li> Bad quality No boar bristles</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> s*** quality, especially for $10. Nothing like the original Ace brushes. Sellouts!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these maybe 20-25 years ago and have used it to this day. I like it very much and thought a backup might be useful. Well the backup I just received is a cheap imitation of my old brush. The bristles are only plastic and quite scratchy. Another case of Amazon letting outside vendors sell pure crap.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  The other reviewers are right, there&#x27;s almost no boar&#x27;s hair bristles in these brushes.  I wrote the review below based on one of these brushes I&#x27;d purchased over 10 years ago from a local store.  Now that I&#x27;ve received the 3 I purchased, I need to update this review (and star rating) to reflect the misleading product description.  There are a couple bristles on the brush that might be boar&#x27;s hair, but 99% of the bristles appear to be plastic, as many of the newer reviews are mentioning.  The other points I make about the brush still apply, but I&#x27;m very disappointed about the \\&quot;100% Boar Bristles\\&quot; claim the vendor makes.  Dropping the star rating to 2 stars to reflect an otherwise good brush, but completely misleading product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve emailed Amazon (as of June 10, 2012) to ask them to fix the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for this hairbrush for years now.  Every hair salon and supermarket I go to I look for it and no one carries it anymore.  So now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon, I&#x27;ve ordered 3 before they disappear again.  What&#x27;s awesome about this hairbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  Boar&#x27;s hair bristle.  You probably already know enough about boar&#x27;s hair bristle or you wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this brush.  It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)  One-piece plastic head and handle.  Lacquered wood heads don&#x27;t clean well.  The lacquer flakes up, the wood holds moisture, creates a breeding ground for mold, bacteria, and parasites.  Plastic one-piece leaves no gaps between handle and head for dirt, etc. to get trapped/accumulate.  Durable plastic makes it easy to thoroughly clean.  You can also drop it on the floor, smack it on the counter, stuff it in a bag, and not worry about it getting gouged or damaged in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.)  Square head gives you corners for doing precision touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of how to improve this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this exact model of brush for over 10 years now and am veryhappy to have found it again now.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, and when I first saw this compact brush, I was skeptical. But, my doubts were soon allayed. This brush is excellent. Not only does it thoroughly brush the hair and remove tangles, but it effectively spreads natural oils essential for healthy and strong hair. I am glad I purchased this brush, and, when it wears out, I hope to get the same to replace it.</li>
    <li> Love the boar bristle bushes.. I have thinning hair and it is easy on my scalp but firm enough for my hair.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an awesome brush, this is it. I love that it&#x27;s 100% Boar bristles, so it&#x27;s actually good for your hair! I have very thick, waist length hair and I won&#x27;t use any other brush. It has very long bristles, so it can reach my scalp and really give my hair that extra shine and softness. A must buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a boar bristle brush.  So, I chose this one.  It was reasonably priced.  It works perfectly for what I need.  It feels gentle on my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> My father purchased 3 of these brush&#x27;s for me around 20 years ago. its an amazing brush soft and sturdy at the same time, the edges are perfectly curved and the durability is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I still have 2 them, and have used them every morning for the last 20+ years&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 2 of them for my sister, around 8 years ago, and was amazed how the quality was still up to standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when i purchased 10 of them for myself 3 years ago, I was shocked to find out that the bristles were more tough  and felt like plastic, and they had sharp edges. It looks like they lowered there standards on quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the older brush and the newer brush is the ACE markings on the bottom of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;the older version had a gold bumped \\&quot;ACE\\&quot; like the one amazon put in the image description(but its not the one they sell you)&lt;br /&gt;and the newer version has a silver \\&quot;ACE\\&quot; stamp on the handle.</li>
    <li> Note the title states Boar Bristles Hair not Boar Hair Bristles. Very cheaply made brush with stiff plastic bristles. This is not a boars hair hair brush.</li>
    <li> What a crock - but then maybe the boars in China grow nylon bristles.  I bought this expecting it to be like my other one that I love and can&#x27;t find any more, made by another manufacturer.  In fact, I bought 2, thinking what a great deal that was, but it is 100% boar crap! If you get out your magnifying glass, you might detect one or two boar hairs in there some where, maybe. Of course, this product and review has nothing to do with Amazon; they are fabulous, as always.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush based on the reviews. I wanted a brush that was good for my hair. It took a few times to get used to how it feels brushing my hair. I was used to a brush with plastic bristles and feeling it go through my hair/against my scalp. I felt at first that it wasn&#x27;t doing an efficient job, it was. Now that I am used to how it feels I love that it doesn&#x27;t tear through my hair. I really like the way my hair has felt since using this brush and it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s very gentle and I can&#x27;t go back to the other brush. The only thing I would criticize is that the brush is kind of small. I would absolutely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to use with my &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; shampoo method. I think it is okay, but I&#x27;m not in love with it. It is helpful in brushing out my hair and keeping it silky, but I would like to see it spread the oil from the roots to the tips a bit more. I bought a boar hair brush because I was told they were great for that, but this has left me wishing I would have bought a more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> For those of you who haven&#x27;t heard of the no shampoo, or \\&quot;no-&#x27;poo\\&quot; method, it&#x27;s a method where you choose not to use shampoos and conditioners, (either because you&#x27;re earth or health minded, you want to save money or time, you are a survivalist and want to minimalize your dependence on the unnecessary, or whatever), and instead you allow your hair to go back to it&#x27;s natural state by allowing it to stop overproducing sebum-oil (which it&#x27;s forced to do when we strip it dry with shampoo). It sounds like a strange thing to do as it goes against the social norm, but just so you know- it works, our hair is still clean, our hair is still healthy, and no, we don&#x27;t stink. There&#x27;s a lot more to it, and a lot of information online, so do some research as it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was still in the \\&quot;transitional phase\\&quot; of the method (where hair is getting used to not having to overproduce sebum), I needed to find a brush that would even out the oils around the part in my hair, where it tended to gather. It was suggested over and over that I try a boar bristle brush to help, so I bought this brush. I would have bought a natural boar brush, but I&#x27;m cheap, so I bought this one, and I must say that the first time I used it, I was completely floored. A few strokes in my hair and it was like new! My hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as oily, it detangled it, it spread out the oils evenly, and it gave my hair a nice shine! AND it was thick enough to get through my medium-thick hair! I&#x27;m still using it now, and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This brush is a joke. It&#x27;s got stiff nylon bristles and just one or two boar bristles. Cheap lousy brush.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Have used Ace products for years.  Use brush daily.  Product quality is as expected and with natural boar hair bristles is priced right.</li>
    <li> The one I wanted is smaller then this one but it will do</li>
    <li> this created a static in my hair not a good choice for me for maybe a courser texture of hair this would be a good cho Choice for going straight.</li>
    <li> Bad quality No boar bristles</li>
    <li> Nothing great.  Works okay but nothing special.  Could have lived without it. The bristles seem to pull my hair and they also don&#x27;t get through my thick hair well.</li>
    <li> Great, strong bristles.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS....</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair.  This brush will not penetrate my hair so really useless.  I should have known not to waste my money.</li>
    <li> I have this same manufactured type of brush that I&#x27;ve been using for 40 years.  When I saw this one on line... I didn&#x27;t mind buying 3 in a pack to receive the same type looking brush that I&#x27;ve always been very happy with.  Upon receiving, the brush hairs were not as soft as the one of 40 years - seemed to be made from a harder type of hair... so I only use on travel trips i.e. if I loose no big deal... my old favorite is at home and still works fine / better.</li>
    <li> It was a replacement product that I couldn&#x27;t find locally in any store.  The price was very reasonable and it was shipped rather quickly.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I had previously brought one of these brushes a long time ago, I loved the brush so much that I was thinking if I lost the brush would I be able to get another.  I search for the exact same brush at many stores and I couldn&#x27;t find it.  However, I did find it on Amazon and I ordered it, when it arrived it was the exact same brush that I have, now I have a backup.</li>
