      <li>I should have known much more.</li>
      <li>It has balanced my skin and cleared it up better</li>
      <li>I have used many brands of glycolic peels bought from Amazon.</li>
      <li>moisturizer is more like an exfolliant  </li>
      <li>My boyfriend and my stepdaughter have stated that my skin is glowing more and looking better.</li>
      <li>so I made sure to order this one from them again too.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the tingling and reddening of the skin</li>
      <li>It sat on my dresser for days, I went on amazon and read more reviews trying to build up courage to use it.</li>
      <li>This kit included a fan brush and much more gauze 2x2&#x27;s to use with the toner.</li>
      <li>She said it works better than when she goes to the office.</li>
      <li>very easy to use directions easy to follow,i paid $125.00 for a spa chemical peel and after kit.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t to keen on doing a series of skin peels right before or during summer since I knew I&#x27;d be spending a good amount of time outdoors.</li>
      <li>They have high concentrations of it which I may try but 50% - amazing!</li>
      <li>and i have tried several of the peels amazon sells and had very good</li>
      <li>and yes they sting, but it is helping my acne scars smooth over better as well as the discoloration.  </li>
      <li>I started off by 3min and worked my way to a full 13min!</li>
      <li>I need to dig around and find the one I used with my original kit because it worked much better.</li>
      <li>I appreciat that its easy to use at home</li>
      <li>this peel is strong and burns recommend a otc pain med when doing it.and fan the skin while the peel burns if it does&#x27;t</li>
      <li>This percent is WAY TOO STRONG too.</li>
      <li>If you use the right level of sunscreen and exercise caution I&#x27;m sure it would be okay</li>
      <li>It was my first time using this kind of at home peeling kit</li>
      <li>The toner was fine.</li>
      <li>I use to go to my derm for this but for what I paid &amp; sessions I was able to have, it is DEF worth the money.</li>
      <li>so far so good</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>That was the first bottle I bought because I wanted to make sure my skin could handle it.</li>
      <li>and my face feels clean and balanced</li>
      <li>this product works very well more so when you build up a tolerance to about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>so do not know yet the full result   ..</li>
      <li>Overall, good product for the price</li>
      <li>but I recommend this to anyone who wants to wakeup there face !!</li>
      <li>Great little peel kit.  </li>
      <li>This is a light peel, easy to use and no down time.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve had many compliments how clear my skin has gotten.</li>
      <li>For the price you get great results and no or very little downtime.</li>
      <li>I previously ordered the 30% peel from the same seller and was very happy with it</li>
      <li>I was lucky to have everything ready.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was lucky to have the baking soda water ready.</li>
      <li>The product does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I did it for the first 5 days,</li>
      <li>I would not be as pleased obviously.</li>
      <li>It says superficial peel, not so much!</li>
      <li>That being said the results are just below the results from similar products,  bit with this you get more.</li>
      <li>The first use of this&lt;br /&gt;peel</li>
      <li>I wash my face with regular face wash first, then I use the glycolic face wash which is more like a cream cleanser that I let sit on my face for about a minute before rinsing off and using the toner.</li>
      <li>I just used it for the first time tonight.</li>
      <li>this is your face people, the first thing people see, learn from me please dont by this product</li>
      <li>One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that this peel feels like it has a higher burning sensation</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure if the bottles were bigger the products would be bound to expire.</li>
      <li>If you can&#x27;t follow directions though, don&#x27;t use it because you have to follow them EXACTLY.</li>
      <li>OK, so I used it a week later to see if it would be different.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just make sure that I can wear a hat the next day or</li>
      <li>Then to top it off my face looks no different.  </li>
      <li>I give it one star because it burned my face, I followed the direction, and the first  time I used it for one minute I had burning sensation I washed of after one minute</li>
      <li>(first time I used the product).  </li>
      <li>My skin was kinda dark.its like burn the first layer of the skin</li>
      <li>I wash my face with regular face wash first, then I use the glycolic face wash which is more like a cream cleanser that I let sit on my face for about a minute before rinsing off and using the toner.</li>
      <li>When I first received my kit</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more of a personal preference for me!</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve done many other types of acid peels before on my skin, I did not wait a full 14 days.</li>
      <li>and so far I am excited with the results.</li>
      <li>so I might have to use it with my makeup, but I felt it was too large to use with something like this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this product works very well more so when you build up a tolerance to about 7 to 10 minutes. I would recommend just being careful as it can burn and the next day you may look a little oddor like someone who got a lot of Sun. I just make sure that I can wear a hat the next day or if its really sunny out then no one would know the difference. Definitely lotion up because it does make your face very dry, after all you are getting rid of essentially a layer of skin and rejuvenating your skin by having a new layer grow.</li>
    <li> great product,  every thing you need at a great price.  easy to read directions no hassel application.  will purchase again , recommended to friends and family and co-workers</li>
    <li> I did it for the first 5 days, so far NOTHING happened. I still having my horrible spots.  I read that after the 4th time of use somebody saw results.... i will keep trying  hopefully something good happen.</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of glycolic peels bought from Amazon. This brand gives you a decent peel with extra supplies. I wash my face with regular face wash first, then I use the glycolic face wash which is more like a cream cleanser that I let sit on my face for about a minute before rinsing off and using the toner. Great for people who are now beginning peels or intermediate peel users. It did work well for my skin type and I was very happy. It did make my patches lighter and my pores seem less visable. That is such a plus. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Product is as described..moisturizer is more like an exfolliant  so I use it as a night cream not under makeup....I have not finished the treatment so do not know yet the full result   ..so far so good</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t the same as a salon glycolic peel but it&#x27;s alright. I completed the peel as directed and I got blisters all over my face afterwards. It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone.</li>
    <li> Great little peel kit.  Using it every week or two seems to give me a good peel as long as you don&#x27;t scrub too hard before applying which can lead to some hot spots.</li>
    <li> This is my second week to use this product. I can tell a difference already. It does sting but that is normal. My skin is softer looking. Looking forward to using this over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> I read reviews. I used this product and have experience with tca as well. This is a light peel, easy to use and no down time. My skin is fair so I had some splotching for a couple hours.it didn&#x27;t hurt like people were claiming. The baking soda gives a fizz and sting. It probably has to be used for six months weekly to reverse major sun damage but it makes a nice glow. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> very easy to use directions easy to follow,i paid $125.00 for a spa chemical peel and after kit.This peel kit is actually stronger than the spa peel I got and I saved a $100.00 and was able to do it on my own time. this peel is strong and burns recommend a otc pain med when doing it.and fan the skin while the peel burns if it does&#x27;t burn you aren&#x27;t getting a good peel.this is a great peel and the best deal you can get and i have tried several of the peels amazon sells and had very good luck.this one is the best and you do not need to buy anything else everything you need is in the bag you should get at least 10 peels from this kit.</li>
    <li> It works will order again! :-)</li>
    <li> I like this product. The bottles are small but the content is potent so I doubt anyone will use such a huge amount so often and I&#x27;m sure if the bottles were bigger the products would be bound to expire. It&#x27;s 50% GA and really stronger than the 70% I bought and within 2 days my face was flaky and dry but its 5 days later and its almost all cleared up and I look rejuvenated. Good buy. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love how my face feels after using this! It feels so clean and refreshed and my skin looks really good. Applying it is pretty easy and doesn&#x27;t take much time, usually do it at night after I take my shower. You also get quite a bit to use with this package so it lasts a pretty long time. Definitely going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I applied this product as directed and felt the stinging then removed it after 2 minutes as suggested.   My face was a little pink which went away in an hour or so.  My skin never peeled anywhere.  A week later I tried again and left it on longer.  Same thing happened a little pink and no peeling or even dryness occurred.  I was hoping to save money with this product - however, off I go to the spa for a real peel.   Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to have the baking soda water ready. Within a mine my skin started to melt and bubble. It was scary and awful . DO NOT USE THIS! I was lucky to have everything ready. I do not think this should be sold to the public ike this. I did not know enough about it, and my research was not vast enough. I should have known much more. It was terrible and the stress reaction I had because of this had me sick for days. It was very scary and left my skin blistered and awful. It has since healed, but was not worth it. This is something that could damage your face badly! Please leave this to professionals. DO not try this at home. This percent is WAY TOO STRONG too. Scary that this can be purchased online. It says superficial peel, not so much! I don&#x27;t think people really understand how dangerous this is.</li>
    <li> The chemical peel as a first time user I purchased 50% big mistake as a person with darker skin. When the product arrived I was way to scared to use it. It sat on my dresser for days, I went on amazon and read more reviews trying to build up courage to use it. I came across a story of lady who used a different chemical peel on amazon, who damn near died. After reading that I sent the chemical peel back, I wasn&#x27;t going to make the situation worse.Still even if I purchased a lower % I think I would still be too afraid to use it.Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I am currently using the %30. That was the first bottle I bought because I wanted to make sure my skin could handle it. My skin has definitely improved. Hardly any acne, not nearly as oily as it was, better, even colour and scarring is lessening. I use it once a week and have for months. My bottle is nearly empty, so I am going to go up to this %50 bottle now that I&#x27;m used to it. I imagine I will have more dramatic changes with the higher content.</li>
    <li> This is only my first week. I will be back</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product! I used it in my stretch marks and really helped me. Became a client of IQ Natural...</li>
    <li> But I think it will do the job! Burns a bit, but that was expected. Have high hopes for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week and I can definately feel it working.  I would recommend it for regular use or even occasional use as the next day your skin looks and feels like you have had a facial.</li>
    <li> AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING product! I started this in Oct.2012 and by Xmas, my pores have minimized! I have Asian skin and I am dark complected w/large pores &amp; I am oily - this did amazingly well on my skin. GREAT improvement since Oct2012, I&#x27;ve had many compliments how clear my skin has gotten. I started off by 3min and worked my way to a full 13min! It was burning like no other but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do - I love it! They have high concentrations of it which I may try but 50% - amazing! I use to go to my derm for this but for what I paid &amp; sessions I was able to have, it is DEF worth the money. If you&#x27;ve never had a peel before, don&#x27;t try to do this - educate yourself if you are a newbie! I knew what to expect &amp; I am VERY HAPPY with the results!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t any difference whatsoever after using this product several times it was a waste of money don&#x27;t waste yours</li>
    <li> Poor will burn off skin go to a doctor for a peel will leave burn marks I used to much to fast and had to seek medical care&lt;br /&gt;my scars are gone that I planed on doing but if you have sensitive skin stay away or water the product down.</li>
    <li> I have been going to spas for years paying for monthly peels that run me about $125.00 on average.  I gave these up about 6 months agao when I could no longer afford them.  A friend suggested I shop on Amazon for an at-home kit I could use.  I was skeptical, but thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away!  Not only does the product work really well, the cleanser, toner and moisturizing cream are amazing!  I have used this peel once a week for two weeks now and my skin is glowing!  No more lumps and bumps.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great quality! works as well as a high service salon! My skin has improved 10 fold! When I;m out i will definitely order this product again!</li>
    <li> i really like this product my face did not pill till about the 4th time.  I really have not seen any improvements yet but Iwill buy this product again</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.It was my first time using this kind of at home peeling kit and i was kinda scared to use it.I think it did work but i kinda stop before i get to the last procedure.My skin was kinda dark.its like burn the first layer of the skin but i guess thats the idea so when the first layer peeled off,the new skin will resurface.But all in all i think it was a good at home peeling kit.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. No product should make your skin break out like this did. It. warns of rash and possible reaction. I test patched as directed no reaction on test area. However, when I appiled as directed it was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;It took my skin days to recover from rash. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a licensed Cosmetologist, I expected the product to actually worked... it did burn like the dickens, however it did no visual peeling!</li>
    <li> I give it one star because it burned my face, I followed the direction, and the first  time I used it for one minute I had burning sensation I washed of after one minute but it did not burn my face and a week later I tried again for three minutes and my face burned I have blisters all over my face .50% is way too high should only be used in a doctors office</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t use that brush for this. I just cut the gauze in half and use one half for toner and the other half for the acid.  Since I&#x27;ve done many other types of acid peels before on my skin, I did not wait a full 14 days. Now I do them about once a week and yes they sting, but it is helping my acne scars smooth over better as well as the discoloration.  My boyfriend and my stepdaughter have stated that my skin is glowing more and looking better. I will keep using this product.  If you can&#x27;t follow directions though, don&#x27;t use it because you have to follow them EXACTLY.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit back in March. I just used it for the first time tonight. I wasn&#x27;t to keen on doing a series of skin peels right before or during summer since I knew I&#x27;d be spending a good amount of time outdoors. If you use the right level of sunscreen and exercise caution I&#x27;m sure it would be okay but it&#x27;s more of a personal preference for me! When I first received my kit I noticed that the packaging was upgraded from the last time I ordered. I previously ordered the 30% peel from the same seller and was very happy with it so I made sure to order this one from them again too. This kit included a fan brush and much more gauze 2x2&#x27;s to use with the toner. All looked good! Fast forward to tonight... I started of using the cleanser and right away noticed the consistency was different that the gel-liquid cleanser that came in the 30% kit. Its much creamier and thicker. I started to wash my face with it and immediately realized it was the consistency of a lotion. It made my skin very slippery and didn&#x27;t lather and when I tried to rinse it off I could still feel a slickness on my skin and lips. :/ I ended up using a glycolic cleanser that I already had and continued the process. The toner was fine. Normal consistency and it smells good like lemons! Then on to the peel. The solution works very well. I was pleased with the tingling and reddening of the skin I was getting(that&#x27;s how you know it works people!!)But the fan brush was a total miss. Its too large to get a careful and even application around the eyes and nose. I need to dig around and find the one I used with my original kit because it worked much better. I believe I ordered it from another seller. Its a nice quality brush so I might have to use it with my makeup, but I felt it was too large to use with something like this. The last step was to rinse and moisturize. The moisturizer was  a little thinner consistency than I remember so I added a little water with some to see if it would lather thinking the lotionand cleanser got mixed up but nope, It&#x27;s a moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this purchase because I like doing glycolic peels and I do trust this sellers products HOWEVER if I didn&#x27;t already have a glycolic cleanser to use and had to wait until I could buy one seperately I would not be as pleased obviously. I waited so long to use the product that I am not going to contact the seller about it and will just continue to use the cleanser I have. BUT it is something for future buyers to take note of!</li>
    <li> I have used this twice and so far I am excited with the results. i cant wait to see my long term results. I appreciat that its easy to use at home</li>
    <li> My wife had peels done in the doctors office. She wanted to go more frequently but@75.00 each not possible. I researched and found this product she loves it. She said it works better than when she goes to the office. I Al&#x27;s bought the neutralizer and it works great too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why my face isn&#x27;t peeling?  It burns like hell as I suffer thru the 2 mins. Then to top it off my face looks no different.  I hate the brush and purchased a different one on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never getting another professional peel again! For the price you get great results and no or very little downtime. I never comment on all the crap I buy on Amazon but this peel kit is pretty impressive!</li>
    <li> I can deal with pain but this stuff is extremely hot but after wards the results are great !!! I used it once a week and my face feels clean and balanced I don&#x27;t have dry skin or oily skin but with the weather changing my face didn&#x27;t feel the same so before I let someone else do this I will try it myself it&#x27;s best you try and do a test first so you can see how much intensity you can take . I&#x27;m very picky and skeptical about purchasing things for my face online so at first was scared but I recommend this to anyone who wants to wakeup there face !!</li>
    <li> Great product but...I would have probably gotten the lesser strength - maybe 30-40%.  I have gotten these peels before at my cosmotologists office and it didn&#x27;t sting like this one does.  I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now (over a couple months) and I still only leave on for 3-5 minutes max!  Also, do NOT do any needling/dermarolling within a few days of using this product as I did and it actually burnt away the skin on the bridge of my nose (first time I used the product).  This was my fault.  Overall, good product for the price and it sure beats the $75 my cosmotologist charges!!</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of glycolic peels bought from Amazon. This brand gives you a decent peel with extra supplies. I wash my face with regular face wash first, then I use the glycolic face wash which is more like a cream cleanser that I let sit on my face for about a minute before rinsing off and using the toner. The brush is useless, I use it to apply highlighting powder and bronzer makeup. If you use the brush it will streak and not apply the peel evenly. Just use the guaze that comes with it, I cut one pad in half and use 1/2 for the toner and another half for the peel solution. One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that this peel feels like it has a higher burning sensation then other peels I&#x27;ve used. Even the glycolic unbuffered 70 percent peel doesn&#x27;t sting my face as much on application as this one. That being said the results are just below the results from similar products,  bit with this you get more. Great for people who are now beginning peels or intermediate peel users. Just be prepared for the stinging.  this stinging usually goes away once you&#x27;ve washed it off however.</li>
    <li> This is a product for someone who has experience with chemical peels. If you MUST know what you are doing. The product does exactly what it says. It has balanced my skin and cleared it up better then I have had it done professionally. The burn is not pleasant and if done incorrectly can burn your skin, but done properly will have great results. I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> i did EXACTLY what it said to do 4 different times and each time it left hole on my face. plus you have to make your own solution out of baking soda to get the acid off, which by the way suckers..now i have scares and have to go to a professional to get them taking care of. this is your face people, the first thing people see, learn from me please dont by this product its terrible no matter how well you follow directions, the end result will still be the same. plus 20% is the legal percent ur allowed to sell to regular people. anything higher can only be sold to licensed person. some of these products people make at home. dont buy please!!</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to the reviews that said this item was garbage!  Indeed it is.  The first use of this&lt;br /&gt;peel did absolutely nothing, no peeling, etc.  OK, so I used it a week later to see if it would be different.&lt;br /&gt;NO, absolutely nothing.  I ended up throwing it away, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product to fade away my stretch marks and so far so good. I have been using this product for about 3 months straight and I already see some results. I will definitely be buying more soon. Plus it arrived on time.</li>
