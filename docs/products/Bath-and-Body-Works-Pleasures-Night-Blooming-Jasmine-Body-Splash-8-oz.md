      <li>I wish this was still available in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I get a lot of men approaching me wanting to know what I am wearing and telling me how great I smell.</li>
      <li>I am searching for something comparable, and more reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>But it is very, very concentrated!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how they can discontinue such a popular item.  </li>
      <li>The fresh scent stays with you and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>

      <li>I got this right away, along with the Shower Gel and Body Lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is a beautiful smell, but if I had to order again I would order a different scent that is the regular price, apparently this is discontinued and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more $.</li>
      <li>Love the fresh smell and it last al day.</li>
      <li>I refuse to pay such an inflated price, even though I do love this scent.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure this fragrance will be no different.</li>
      <li>Thanks for shipping a quality product in a speedy response time!</li>
      <li>exactly like real bushes of fragrant  Night Blooming Jasmines</li>

      <li>i am glad BBW changed their bottles though, the old bottles leak a ton and i have lost entire bottles that way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the 2nd product I&#x27;ve tried and my favorite by far.  </li>
      <li>We were both surprised that the product is exactly as displayed and described.</li>
      <li>This was what I&#x27;ve been looking for -- something that actually smells very much like night blooming jasmine.</li>
      <li>Its femenine and soft, everybody likes the way I smell.</li>
      <li>I would live to purchase more, but unable to find it.</li>
      <li>It was probably old and sat in the heat too long or something!</li>

    <li> I could never get it at the store which is so disappointing! So when I saw it here I bought it immediately! It smells really nice. Not strong and not weak. Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had people ask me what perfume I was wearing. I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments about this body spray. I absolutely love it! I heard they&#x27;re discontinuing it in the store. I nearly broke down in tears at the store! I have very sensitive scent receptors and this is the one that doesn&#x27;t have that annoying scent that makes me want to gag.</li>

It is so nice to find scents and products that are no longer being sold by the original source.  I got this right away, along with the Shower Gel and Body Lotion.  It&#x27;s a triple pleasure!</li>
    <li> I have used this body spray for years.  It&#x27;s the only scent I wear, and it is discontinued by Bath and Body Works.  I don&#x27;t know how they can discontinue such a popular item.  The price has soared from $10 a bottle to $50 and upwards.  I refuse to pay such an inflated price, even though I do love this scent.  I am searching for something comparable, and more reasonably priced.  What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> This was always my favorite scent and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued. Thrilled I found it again.</li>
    <li> I love this and am disappointed it was discontinued. I paid a lot for my last one!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and I love the body splash concept, it isn&#x27;t as in your face as au de cologne.  Unfortunately Bath &amp; Body has discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time. A lot of people have been complementing its fragrance.Too bad Bath and Body has discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I had smelled this on a customer at work, when I asked her about it she was sad because she said the Bath and Body had discontinued making it, however she told the name and I found some !! It is a light, clean fragrance, I like it, I would buy more, and recommend it !!!</li>
    <li> Ok I use to LOVE this fragrance when it was carried at the store.When I received it it smelled &amp;#34;AWFUL&amp;#34; like tanning bed burnt skin! It was probably old and sat in the heat too long or something! I tried ordering it later from another website and it smelled HORRIBLE! Ladies,I would recommend you wait till Bath&amp; Body Works brings it back to there stores.Please do not waste your money!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and liked it and this is the reason for ordering it again.  The fresh scent stays with you and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I like bath and body works products and this one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Eighty dollars for this? Really? No way! Too bad. This splash is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product and bath and body works no longer makes it. I would live to purchase more, but unable to find it.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh smell and it last al day. Its femenine and soft, everybody likes the way I smell. I recomend it.</li>
    <li> to ask $60 for a bottle of body splash worth $18 is outragious!!!!! Please don&#x27;t buy this. Amazon should be ashamed that this is on its Website.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite. I used it in my car and it made it smell so fresh. But to ask $60 you are out of your mind! Even Ebay is asking that much if not more! Just because it&#x27;s discontinued doesn&#x27;t mean the product is new. After sitting for a while the alcohol in it tends to take over. So there&#x27;s no guarantee of what it will smell like. Very disappointing. Thinking about buying the plant just to have the smell around.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite body spray for the spring! i am glad BBW changed their bottles though, the old bottles leak a ton and i have lost entire bottles that way.</li>
    <li> I wish this was still available in the stores.  But, thrilled to get it at all.  I get a lot of men approaching me wanting to know what I am wearing and telling me how great I smell.</li>
