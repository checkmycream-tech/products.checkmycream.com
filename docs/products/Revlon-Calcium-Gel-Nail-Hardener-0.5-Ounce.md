      <li>This is a great product for nails that are thin, easy to chip or tear.  </li>

      <li>it is a wonderful product for weak nails!</li>
      <li>I am trying it for the first time.</li>
      <li>(I hear that this comes with being a &amp;#34;senior citizen.&amp;#34;)  </li>
      <li>Very effective product, just as are the base coat and top coat!  </li>
      <li>and I really needed something to make them stronger.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>

      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>I do a lot of gardening, scrubbing and home improvement, and this has really kept me from looking grubby and nail-bitten.</li>
      <li>so much I order it often.  </li>
      <li>Now my nails grow so fast that I literally have to cut them like almost every two weeks.</li>
      <li>dries fast .</li>
      <li>They all really strengthen the nails.</li>
      <li>Delivery is fast via US mail.</li>
      <li>I heard about this product a few years ago through a media release and really liked it.  </li>
      <li>So glad Amazon still carries this, as a previous souce discontinued it.</li>
      <li>When I found Revlon Calcium Gel - this product is terrific and started to work quickly.</li>
      <li>I have bought more expensive hardeners and they don&#x27;t work any better.  </li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be  sure that it does really strengthen nails</li>
      <li>I will continue to use Revlon Calcium Gel and I highly recommend it.</li>

      <li>The beginning process kind of sucked because I was not really familiar with what products were out there to promote not only ail growth but offer certain ingredients to make your nails a lot harder to break...</li>
      <li>Finally a nail product that really strenthens brittle nails.</li>
      <li>Use of the Revlon Calcium Gel Nail Hardener has completely stopped my nails splitting and flaking.  </li>
      <li>I had an old Revlon Gel Nail Builder product and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>

      <li>My nails looked so thick and they felt strong.</li>
      <li>I have very soft nails which split and regular nail polish</li>
      <li>If I had to say anything negative it would be that it takes longer then most polishes or treatments to dry.</li>
      <li>With only one coat, they felt significantly harder, and it dried very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have to cut my nails down now because they get so long so fast!</li>
      <li>The only drawback is that it loses its sheen quickly.</li>
      <li>I thought the shipping and handling fees were a little high!</li>

<li> I like to apply 3 coats of the hardener on bare nails or use 2 coats as a base for polish (but be careful, it takes a long time for polish to dry on top of it).&lt;br</li>
<li> nails are healthier and a bit harder .</li>
<li> problem is I have to apply it every other day for results, and it takes forever to take nail polish off.</li>
<li> After about 4 manicures my nails started to brake down.</li>
<li> I started using it and EUREKA, my nails start groing again long and hard</li>
<li> only complaint is that it seems to have a very subtle yellowish tinge, so when I wear it without colored polish, my nails look a tiny bit yellower than they otherwise would.</li>
<li> Really works on weak nails!!</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical of nail hardeners - I doubted they&#x27;d make my nails any harder than regular polish.  </li>

    <li> Great product,stays on</li>
    <li> GOOD NAIL HARDENER AND HELPS THEM GROW FAST</li>
    <li> Really great product......nails grow and are very strong!!!</li>
    <li> Use of the Revlon Calcium Gel Nail Hardener has completely stopped my nails splitting and flaking.  Only wish it was obtainable in the UK.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product as described and it sort of works, but not that well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Dang, this stuff is awesome.  I recently removed a gel mani that destroyed my nails and I really needed something to make them stronger.  I was a little skeptical of nail hardeners - I doubted they&#x27;d make my nails any harder than regular polish.  I was wrong.  With only one coat, they felt significantly harder, and it dried very quickly.  I like to apply 3 coats of the hardener on bare nails or use 2 coats as a base for polish (but be careful, it takes a long time for polish to dry on top of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it seems to have a very subtle yellowish tinge, so when I wear it without colored polish, my nails look a tiny bit yellower than they otherwise would.</li>
    <li> So good for nails. Keeps them strong and healthy</li>
    <li> received quickly, this stuff works great if u change it every three days. Two light coats and your nails will start to look better. Wish I could find it at a store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months, and so far Im satisfied with it. problem is I have to apply it every other day for results, and it takes forever to take nail polish off. unfortunately, price has been increased from $5 to almost $8 within three months. other than that, its great.</li>
    <li> Best nail hardening product I have ever used. dries fast . great by itself or under nail polish. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I love this product. Makes my nails strong. This product is not sold in stores no more that why i buy from amozon. When i wear my nail polish it looks like i have strong gel nails on.</li>
    <li> I decided almost 2 years ago to start wearing my own nails. The beginning process kind of sucked because I was not really familiar with what products were out there to promote not only ail growth but offer certain ingredients to make your nails a lot harder to break...

    <li> I purchased three bottles. When I received the package, one bottle was broken. I contacted the seller and a new bottle was mailed to me. Thi is a great product for those of you who want to strengthen and grow your nails.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product a few years ago through a media release and really liked it.  I have very soft nails which split and regular nail polish makes them worse.  This product does not harm my nails and makes them look a little more attractive with some sheen.  When I could no longer find it in the stores I was very happy to be able to purchase it through Amazon.  It would make me, and several people I know, happy if Revlon put this SKU back into production.</li>
    <li> After Many years, looking for something that make my nails grow, some one in a pharmacy this product Washington very good. I started using it and EUREKA, my nails start groing again long and hard I am facinated</li>
    <li> Ordering process was easy and item arrived in perfect condition when promised! I thought the shipping and handling fees were a little high! Even though I ordered two identical items each was an additional charge! There was no discount for combined items!&lt;br /&gt;The gel goes on easily and works great! it is a wonderful product for weak nails! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I started using this product last year &amp; bought it local &amp; all of a sudden couldn&#x27;t find it in any store I was so glad to find it on amazon I have weak nails &amp; this made them stronger &amp; grow faster. I bought several bottles &amp; gave them to friends and now they are all hooked too. I have tried all the others but this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> This Revlon hardener seems to keep my nails from peeling or splitting.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone having trouble with their nails.</li>
    <li> This product is so great I can&#x27;t say it enough. This product thickened my nails in just 3 days and my nails looked soooo different, like salon level manicure. My nails looked so thick and they felt strong. My nails used to break a lot, but they don&#x27;t now. This hardener makes them very hard while adding a very nice shiny coati on top so they look attractive! Love it! This will be a permanent part of my nail care routine so I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I had an old Revlon Gel Nail Builder product and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  This is a nearly perfect replacement and sooooo cheap.  My nails get so brittle in the winter and start chipping and splitting.  I use a moisturizing base coat and follow that with this nail hardener.  It has really helped my nails get stronger and stop peeling.  And, it isn&#x27;t a gel product that requires soaking in acetone to remove.  Regular polish remover takes it right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it enough to re-order.  Delivery is fast via US mail.</li>
    <li> Really works on weak nails!!</li>
    <li> very happy with the prompt delivery. The product was recommended by my podiatrist. I am trying it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this nail hardener.  It keeps my thin flexible nails from breaking and cracking.  it is also priced to purchase.  I have bought more expensive hardeners and they don&#x27;t work any better.  I recommend this nail  hardener.</li>
    <li> This is either discontinued in stores or very hard to find.  I like it so much I order it often.  It doesn&#x27;t peel off, makes my nails hard and works well under polish or alone for a slight shine.  It dries super fast too.  By far my favorite nail product.</li>
    <li> Great product for weak nails or after using gel polish to renew surface!!  I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Says that it hardens nails after just 4 days. Been using for couple of weeks now and my nails are still breaking.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this base coat so that when SI painted my nails with darker colors, my nails wouldn&#x27;t stain. I normally don&#x27;t wear base coats, and my nails are healthy in general. After using this base coat, my nails have become dry, brittle and they peel at the tips. This product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Use this gel all the time.</li>
    <li> Item was what I wanted. This is the only place I can get this item now</li>
    <li> I ordered the Revlon Gel Nail Hardener but received Revlon Cuticle Remover instead. I sent an email informing them of the mistake and was told the problem would be corrected. It has been almost a month now with no reply or product. I have ordered from another site and received the Gel Hardener within 3 days. I love the Revlon Gel Nail Hardener because my nails are brittle and makes my nails like normal again. I recommend Revlon Gel Nail Hardener to anyone with weak or brittle nails. A great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff -- it really works to keep my nails strong, which has always been a problem. I do a lot of gardening, scrubbing and home improvement, and this has really kept me from looking grubby and nail-bitten. No point in getting a manicure if your nails are all broken and splitting, but I can get by with a &#x27;natural&#x27; look now, and get a nice manicure when I feel the need. I hear it is hard to find, so I ordered two bottles, just in case.</li>
    <li> It lasts a week but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be  sure that it does really strengthen nails</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using that product as base coat and already see a real difference.&lt;br /&gt;My nails are healthier and a bit harder . I &#x27;m gonna keep on applying it regularly and i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll get real satisfaction !</li>
    <li> I have brittle nails &amp; have used Mystic Nail polish as a strengthener but Mystic Nail isn&#x27;t in production anymore. My nails grow but break &amp; split. This gel hardens them. I use it as a base &amp; overcoat. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with yellowing either. I love this polish!</li>
    <li> Very effective product, just as are the base coat and top coat!  They all really strengthen the nails. Unfortunately, cannot find the calcium gel in the stores anymore and don&#x27;t understand why?</li>
    <li> This is a great product for nails that are thin, easy to chip or tear.  Finally a nail product that really strenthens brittle nails.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and what a huge difference in the strength of my nails! I use it as a base coat or when I want to keep my nails nude and only apply it about once a week. I have to cut my nails down now because they get so long so fast! If I had to say anything negative it would be that it takes longer then most polishes or treatments to dry. Otherwise this is a must have for healthy nails!!</li>
    <li> I had heard about Revlon&#x27;s Calcium Gel Nail Hardener. So glad Amazon still carries this, as a previous souce discontinued it. I have a severe problem with my thumbnails splitting. (I hear that this comes with being a &amp;#34;senior citizen.&amp;#34;)  This product is working!! I put on 3 coats. It will take a while for my thumbnails to grow out, so I plan to remove the present coats with polish remover, and keep reapplying this every week or two.. Even when my nails are no longer split, I plan to use this as a base coat. Glad I purchased 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found which will actually help my nails grow.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I was getting a french manicure every 3 weeks using gel polish. After about 4 manicures my nails started to brake down. So I stopped getting the manicures and looked for something that would help my nails be strong again. When I found Revlon Calcium Gel - this product is terrific and started to work quickly. I have been using it for about 2 months and my nails are stronger then they were before all of this happened. I will continue to use Revlon Calcium Gel and I highly recommend it.</li>
