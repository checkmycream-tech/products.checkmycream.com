      <li>I saw results very fast and the service was great as well.  </li>
      <li>At first, I thought this product was great.  </li>
      <li>because up until a week ago I was that happy with the first bottle that I also splashed out on the eye cream.  </li>
      <li>If its too good to be true?</li>
      <li>Has a nice scent, works pretty good  making your skin glow.</li>
      <li>Will see about another product that may work better</li>
      <li>Love the product and I have told all my friends  </li>
      <li>These Company&#x27;s aren&#x27;t in business to keep you healthy.</li>
      <li>I THINK I NEED TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT MORE TIME</li>
      <li>Just orded 2 more.</li>
      <li>The magic elixir it is not,</li>
      <li>I just threw out 3 of these products and wont order any more.</li>
      <li>I am 45 and had been a smoker and sun worshipper most of my life.</li>
      <li>cream is ok......</li>
      <li>so it may be just the perfect combo of low retinol...</li>
      <li>love this stuff...use it every day under my eyes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay about sums it up...</li>
      <li>Is this product SAFE?</li>
      <li>I love the way that it smooths my lines without downtime .i</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>At 36, I look a decade or more younger&lt;</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The $10 DMAE cream I got at Walgreens works better.</li>
      <li>The product&#x27;s claim is that it is supposed to make your skin produce more collagen on</li>
      <li>I think the Anew night time moisturizer works better than this product.</li>
      <li>This ones doesn&#x27;t effect my skin like most.</li>
      <li>When I read reviews, mostly fine lines were effected, but I was hoping it would help my deeper ones more.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff, pretty effective on mouth lines if used consistently - affordable.</li>
      <li>Like most products this is a quick fix but not permanent like most.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
      <li>NEEDED MORE PRICE IS RIGHT LOVE</li>
      <li>Once again I am glad that I did not pay full retail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but my skin has been fine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and it did nothing for my fine lines.  </li>
      <li>The product is light and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>My skin is peeling off and I have a mass of wrinkles where my skin was fine before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And, it is a huge lie.</li>
      <li>I received fast and courteous shipping and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have just completed a 28 day free trial for Avon using the A-F33.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i commented how great her skin looked and thought she looked younger.</li>
      <li>I think I may have tried it once and went back to my fave - triAktiline which I buy at Kohls and never seem to have a discount coupon, but it&#x27;s that great.</li>
      <li>I noticed great results in only 1 week.  </li>
      <li>It is a light cream.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be fantastic because of all the reviews I&#x27;ve read</li>
      <li>It is not a rash because they are filled and needed to be drained (eeww).</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Since sellers on Amazon have it for a much more reasonable price, I will buy again, mostly for my neck and to help &amp;#34;keep things in check&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Ordered, came right away and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for, but most importantly, AT THE RIGHT PRICE!  </li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>I guess you have to try it yourself as everyones skin is original.</li>
      <li>I originally bought from a friend who sells Avon.  </li>
      <li>if you will find it for $8 or less;or save your time, nerves, and money, go to eBay and find a serum for $5-7 that will give you the same results (pleasant smell, texture, moisture, etc).</li>
      <li>To really see that improvement you need to have a microscope instead of an eye :).</li>
      <li>So, those people who see results on next day or after just one week, they really flatter themselves and see what they want to see, or just in love with Avon products (good for them).&lt;br</li>
      <li>After four days of using this product, two different people commented on how good I look.</li>
      <li>Full toxicology is still not known but it&#x27;s a substance that \\&quot;accumulates\\&quot; in the organs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cool bottle</li>
      <li>I had great expectations about this product, having read other reviews.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, softening the lines so far, havent used for very long so heres hoping it will do the trick :)</li>
      <li>And shipped to me really quickly.  </li>
      <li>quick smart!&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a really good deal on this item through amazon!  Was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what was promised.</li>
    <li> Best treatment I have used. Would recommend this to all women.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m indifferent about this product .Maybe I have unrealistic expectations but anything that takes more than a week for visible results sorta annoy me. I&#x27;m just wondering if a dermatologist can prescribe something more effective.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best product I have used to treat the lines around my lips,  It is working, but soooo slowly.  But, it is working.  I don&#x27;t know how long  it will take until I am satisfied, but I will keep using this in hope that more wrinkles will go away.  However, no one is saying that I look better, but, I notice it! Oh, I just had a birthday and turned 76.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I read all of the wonderful reviews for this product and was so looking forward to using it. I used it exactly how they said. I am 52 and have frown lines. This product did not change anything after using the whole bottle. If anything, it dried out my chin and made it worse.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and was less expensive&lt;br /&gt;than buying from a Avon representive.  I purchased 2&lt;br /&gt;so I could stock up.  Will do again.</li>
    <li> Ok but never ordering again!</li>
    <li> This product really softens my skin and gets rid of the wrinkles.  I use it twice a day - in the morning before I put on my makeup and in the evening before I put on my night cream.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, but most importantly, AT THE RIGHT PRICE!  And shipped to me really quickly.  Very satisfied and will use this method of purchase from now on to get this product.</li>
    <li> I think I may have tried it once and went back to my fave - triAktiline which I buy at Kohls and never seem to have a discount coupon, but it&#x27;s that great.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been using for about a week now and don&#x27;t really notice a huge difference, but there is some slight change in the few lines I do have. Really wish I could find the line eliminator pen. That one worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over a year.  I&#x27;m 48 and have not really seen any great results in minimizing my lines, however it is easy to apply, does not dry or become greasy on the skin. It&#x27;s not the &#x27;wonder cream&#x27; it claims to be.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Avon product 2ce. It worked briefly, but nothing like the claims. So I will not order it again.Never left any visible changes.</li>
    <li> The problem with this product and several other Avon products that I tried after seeing glowing reviews is that at first it seems to be helping then after a couple of weeks you notice that your skin is more dry and duller looking than it was before you started using it. I just threw out 3 of these products and wont order any more. The thing is that I have very good skin. For it to look worse after a couple of weeks, it has to be the products.</li>
    <li> The product is light and easy to apply.  As warned, it might sting a little around the eye area, which is where I wanted to use it primarily after some lines began to appear after recent traumatic illness.  The lines have been affected but not to the degree I would wish.  I am still hopeful that it will continue to work if I use it for the next few months!</li>
    <li> This products does make the lines around the eyes, lips , and forehead when they start to appear&lt;br /&gt;much softer,they are not as visable..  I would try it on my neck also</li>
    <li> I tried it, but I didn&#x27;t see any results. It did not change anything.  Good thing it didn&#x27;t get worse :-)</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this product, I currently have a red patchy face which has more lines than before I started and thread veins which weren&#x27;t there before.  May be good for oily skin but not for my combination/dry skin.</li>
    <li> I finally found a serum that plumps up my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me any redness or irritation.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve never seen my skin look so hydrated and glow-y.  I&#x27;ve tried so many skin products from the shopping channels, department stores, and drugstores and they either were too drying or didn&#x27;t hydrate enough.  I am in my 70&#x27;s and this is about as close to a younger skin miracle as I&#x27;m gonna get.  I apply the PRO Line Eraser Treatment first and then apply Avon Anew Platinum Night Cream or the Platinum Day Cream over it.  I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin is looking.  I am extremely happy with this serum and will not even bother trying anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, but there are a few lines I wanted to get rid of before my wedding next year so I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it twice a day as advised, my skin dried out and turned red after 3 days, and hurt unbelievably. I have slightly sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve never used a skin cream that brought me to tears before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using it once a day instead, it still stung a bit but was otherwise ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, only a slight visible difference (which I could easily have been imagining), and the pain/dryness came back with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it for 2 days to allow my skin to heal, and the lines became worse than they were before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you want to be tied into buying/using this product indefinitely, you have a high tolerance for pain and only want vague results, I&#x27;d give this a miss.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff works, I have been using it for 5 days. I only have small wrinkles in my brow and they are almost already gone. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in four weeks. Maybe I am too ar gone!</li>
    <li> I am so please with this product and the reduced cost.</li>
    <li> This product was great I saw results very fast and the service was great as well.  I will re-order this product again.  Avon Anew Clinical PRO Line Eraser Treatment - A-F-33.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, pretty effective on mouth lines if used consistently - affordable. Another Avon product i don&#x27;t like to run out of. I use it at night as a treatment cream and Genics in the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks. I have seen a subtle wrinkle reduction. I am 46, and I am a smoker, so my face situation is probably worse than most. I have experienced a dramatic positive change in the elasticity of my skin. I have a couple deep vertical wrinkles around my mouth, and they are less visible. I recommend this product. I am a face lotion fanatic, and nothing I have used thus far delivers results like this product. It works!</li>
    <li> Agree with England review at about day 7-8 pretty good stinging with redness and discomfort, much due to the chemical components of the product, with reactionary peeling of the skin. If its too good to be true? Yeah- they have great marketing though. I guess you have to try it yourself as everyones skin is original.</li>
    <li> I was told this product \\&quot;really works\\&quot; by an Avon sales rep. Well, it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m 29 with minimal deep wrinkles but several around my eyes from sun/tanning bed damage. I&#x27;ve used this product for the past month and it has not made one bit of difference. It did not make me break out though like some skin care products do. But it simply did not help to minimize wrinkles or make my skin feel tighter/softer/smoother. The $10 DMAE cream I got at Walgreens works better. The product&#x27;s claim is that it is supposed to make your skin produce more collagen on it&#x27;s own so you have to quit using anything else you use with collagen in it, which I did and I think my skin actually looks worst. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I got a deal on this product on an auction site, so the only good thing about my experience was that I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.  I followed the directions and it did nothing for my fine lines.  I have very sensitive skin and was worried this would irritate me.  I only used it on my forehead where I have the lines.  I may as well have not put anything on.  The only way I knew I had applied it was because of the smell.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  The first time I applied it, I got a very slight tingle.  That was all that ever happened.  It&#x27;s a cool bottle so I haven&#x27;t thrown it out.  Maybe I can figure out a way to refill it with something that will work.  Skip this product.</li>
    <li> I tried this for three weeks, at first avoiding the eye area as it suggested.  Then when I did use it around my eyes it left the skin, dry, scaly, sore and red, everything I applied to sooth this area stung. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin either. The eye area is where I need a little help with lines so it completely defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> After using this item for awhile it has proved to be somewhat helpful&lt;br /&gt;nice feel, line diminishing so-so.  Need to use it longer. I would&lt;br /&gt;order from amazon again, got it in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to think. I am DONE trying lotions and creams etc.. to help with my wrinkles on my forehead.  At first, I thought this product was great.  It felt pleasant on my skin and it is not greasy.  After only a few nights of using the product, my forehead got really red and started to peel.  Okay, I guess this is to be expected, but it hurts and burns.  I had such high hopes that I already purchased a second bottle.  (MISTAKE!).  I do admit, I have sensitive skin but did not think my skin would peel and crack and be red.  I have not used the product for 3 nights now and my forehead is still irritated..  Not happy with the product and at the moment, my skin looks worse then it did.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice any results from this. I used it faithfully under my moisturizer and could have gone without it. I wont buy it again</li>
    <li> I thought it would be fantastic because of all the reviews I&#x27;ve read but I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and nothing. What a waste of money even if it was cheaper than buying from a Avon rep.</li>
    <li> I was excited by the advertising claims of this product (and the eye cream with the same formula) but more than disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;It cost £30 and all it has done is give me sore, red, scaly/flaky patches that sting like mad. Not a good look :-(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay about sums it up...I really can&#x27;t say that I have fewer fine lines but i have tried a lot and I mean a lot of products and this one is so reasonably priced and does about the same thing they all do...very little..</li>
    <li> For the first 4-6 weeks my skin appeared to be glowing and the firmness did seem to improve but now, almost overnight my skin is just as the other poor reviews have commented;  Extremely dry, flaky and very sore.  I&#x27;ve already bought my second bottle of the AF33 face cream because up until a week ago I was that happy with the first bottle that I also splashed out on the eye cream.  I&#x27;ve always had either combination skin so it&#x27;s quite distressing to go from T-Zone to a no go zone.  When I pick at the flaking around my eyes it bleeds!! That&#x27;s how dry it is.  Very disappointed as I have been buying Avon products for many years.  It&#x27;s back to Decleor for me (feed my skin not dehydrate it)</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I noticed great results in only 1 week.  I would highly recommend this purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, softening the lines so far, havent used for very long so heres hoping it will do the trick :)</li>
    <li> Been using for 1 month absolutely no change. The price was better than buying from Avon, guess I had my hopes to high</li>
    <li> I really like this one.  It has a slight tightening effect does a good job.  It was a great buy for the money.  I will definitely re-order this one.</li>
    <li> It may not be a &#x27;miracle&#x27; but I do feel that my skin looks much less weathered than it did. I will continue to use and will buy again.</li>
    <li> My title pretty much says it all. Maybe I&#x27;m just dazzled by the futuristic swirls surrounding the picture of the item and its sleek silver-bullet packaging, but I really think that this stuff does indeed infuse a bit of freshness/plumpness to my skin. I&#x27;m on my third bottle now. Can&#x27;t argue with success...</li>
    <li> I am using this product as a line filler, particularly on my forehead where the lines are deeper and between the brows. I am quite satisfied with the results. I use this product in addition to a serum. I have noticed the lines on my forehead are lighter and plan on continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> I´ve noticed that the scars on my face have diminished. Anyone that has old acne/accident scars should definately try it. It must actually penetrate the skin for this to happen. [[ASIN:B008QFRPFY AVON Anew Clinical PRO Line Eraser Treatment - A-F-33]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the press release and a glowing beauty blog review. I&#x27;ve used topical Vitamin C and retinol for years with great results, but always in search of a product to firm and lesson the look of lines. I am on day three of using the AVON Anew Clinical Pro Line Eraser A-F33. After using it the first night, I woke up with 4 pimples. Not great. But I applied it again that morning and again that night, as directed. Woke up this morning with 5 NEW pimples! I have spots here and there all over my face. It is not a rash because they are filled and needed to be drained (eeww). I&#x27;m willing to keep at it for a few more days, in case the product is \\&quot;purging\\&quot; my skin and bringing underlying pimples to the surface (though nothing I&#x27;ve read suggested that would happen). Another reviewer stated it did not make her oily skin break out. So we&#x27;ll see. I gave it 2 stars right now, but I&#x27;m not giving up yet...in tests 100% of women saw improvement in wrinkles, I&#x27;m hoping I will, too!</li>
    <li> Totally a breakthrough in skin care. I love the way that it smooths my lines without downtime .i already ordered my next one. Worth it!</li>
    <li> After a few evenings of use, my skin couldn&#x27;t handle the power of the formula. My skin was burning.  I backed off and remain unsure how well it will actually work and exactly how I will tell if it is a great product or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickly shipped and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products with retinol including sensitive skin formulas (neutrogena, ROC) and this was the best, didn&#x27;t break out too bad the first 2 wks compared to similar products and have noticed a huge change in my skin, forehead much smoother and acne scars faded some after 3-4 wks or so of daily use (use sparingly).  I have also combined this with olay regenerist serum and makeup with retinol including Too faced beauty balm and peter thomas roth unwrinkle foundation so it may be just the perfect combo of low retinol...</li>
    <li> cream is ok......no marked results as of yet, but I am reluctant to use it as it really smells bad.........similar to self tanning cream? curry?</li>
    <li> I knew i had to get this product after seeing my mum recently who is 60 something and i commented how great her skin looked and thought she looked younger.She told me about how her and her friends were using this - so i placed an order quick smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using this now for around 5 weeks and the results are impressive, i had a small indent scar on my face which has now almost disappeared, the fine lines i started to get around my mouth are loads better, and my skin looks more youthful, smooth and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some professional photos taken just before i started to use this, and really did feel my face was starting to show the signs of looking in my mid 40&#x27;s, now my skin looks really different and definatley more youthful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems from other reviews some people experience sensitivity but my skin has been fine with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well done avon! a brilliant product and one i wont be without now</li>
    <li> I had great expectations about this product, having read other reviews. Not me. I saw no difference, after 2 bottles. The magic elixir it is not, oh well.</li>
    <li> This product started to burn after a few uses &amp; a few days later, my skin broke out and was red &amp; blochy. When I asked for a refund, I was denied. Not a good transaction. Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I would first like to say that my rating is only for the product.  A five star would go to the seller.  I received fast and courteous shipping and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the product was poo-poo.  Once again I am glad that I did not pay full retail.&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 and I used small amounts as directed on the box.  After 1 month I used twice as much with no results.&lt;br /&gt;I still have a little left after gobs of it went on my face with no results.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommended.</li>
    <li> Love the product and I have told all my friends  it is great to be able to order on line</li>
    <li> NEEDED MORE PRICE IS RIGHT LOVE IT PACKED WELL IN ORIGINAL BOX AND SEALED , VERY HAPPY</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted as a facial cream...Highly rated by Avon so hope it works!!  Much cheaper than Avon brochure price...</li>
    <li> I tried out this product and I saw no change at all besides less money in bank account buying this product.</li>
    <li> After so many good reviews I am personally very disappointed in this product. It has done nothing for my skin except make it sting and I have persisted for over a month. I actually have good skin anyway and from now on am not going to worry about  the few wrinkles I was targeting with this so called miracle product. I&#x27;d rather spend my money on something else! A dermatologist gave us nurses a lecture several years ago and he said good skin is all down to genes, keeping your hands off your face and using a simple moisturiser. Maybe he has a point?</li>
    <li> This product was not for me.  It burnt my skin, so I had to give it away to a friend, who used it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I use it every day and I notice a BIG difference if I don&#x27;t. Goodbye wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that actually makes my 61-year-old skin look so much better.  Not greasy, easily absorbed, gentle, fabulous.</li>
    <li> I have read good reviews about this product and found it here on Amazon for about half the price so have given it a test for the past couple of weeks and the lines around my mouth are not as prounounced as they were before, that is a plus! I am in my 60&#x27;s so anything that will work at this age is a blessing! I will continue to use and am thankful I have found a product that works on us older gals. Give it a try, it is not a miricle cream but it helps a lot, I can now stand to wear my glasses and look into the mirror and not ask myself, \\&quot;who is that old lady?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a few weeks now. Doesn&#x27;t work and clogs my pores leaving acne bumps on my skin.</li>
    <li> At first this was promising but after 6 days I have come out in pink rash under my eyes. Also I have a burning stinging feeling and it is bit swollen too. Be careful! Didn&#x27;t think it would burn my wrinkles off.</li>
    <li> I loved the price! I loved the promtness of the order! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a difference, but think it will be great!</li>
    <li> It is a light cream. Good for oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin. I use it in the morning and at night before bed. It does say not to use it around your eyes. I do and don&#x27;t have any problems. I have adult acne due to oily skin. I usually break out with certain products. This ones doesn&#x27;t effect my skin like most. Has a nice scent, works pretty good  making your skin glow. Like most products this is a quick fix but not permanent like most. As soon as you stop using it your skin goes back to the way it was before you started using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about two weeks now, and I am already seeing great results. The lines around my eyes are starting to diminish. I am forty and am in the sun a lot. To get rid of wrinkles I have been getting botox injections for about a year now but am starting to see there is hope beside botox. I will definitely keep using it and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get rid of those deep lines and look younger again.</li>
    <li> MY wife has found the product not only has reduced the wrinkles but it has greatly increased the moisture content of her facial skin. She would definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> I have just completed a 28 day free trial for Avon using the A-F33.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 years old and lucky enough not to have many wrinkles at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have sensitive skin until I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week of using the cream, I had no problems with it but on day 8 I began having problems:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied the cream on the evening I had a burning/stinging sensation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got up the next morning and noticed a rash/blotches on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped in the shower but as soon as water touched my face the burning/stinging sensation returned - this continued until the end of the trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I persevered and continued using the cream on my neck for three weeks but had to stop as the rash/blotches just got worse. As soon as I stopped the rash cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued using the cream as instructed on my face until the end of the trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever to the wrinkles I have - I was really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avons claim is misleading as they state 100% of people agree it works but the small print states 100% of 69 people agree it works.</li>
    <li> I like the way it glides in my skin.  But I think it&#x27;s too early to tell if impact is significant.  Will use again.</li>
    <li> Is this product SAFE? These Company&#x27;s aren&#x27;t in business to keep you healthy. Just take a close look at the ingredients! It is my opinion Avon (and others) are talking out of both sides of their mouths...&#x27;Avon walk for breast cancer\\&quot;, \\&quot;Avon foundation &amp; breast cancer crusade\\&quot;  what are they thinking when they use potential cancer causing agents in their products?! Leave questionable ingredients OUT of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone ~ Is a form of silica. Very common and is also in some &#x27;mineral&#x27; foundations. It&#x27;s been linked to tumors in the lungs and endocrine system. Full toxicology is still not known but it&#x27;s a substance that \\&quot;accumulates\\&quot; in the organs.&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol ~ It&#x27;s created from Bezene, a known carcinogen and has been listed as being toxic to the bladder &amp; kidneys. Phenoxyethanol has been linked to reproductive disorders, brain degeneration and nervous system depression.&lt;br /&gt;Methylparaben ~ They&#x27;re often listed as &#x27;safe&#x27; preservatives in small quantities. However, these parabens mimic the sex hormone oestrogen, known to play a role in BREAST CANCER - and parabens have repeatedly been found in breast cancer tumors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t blindly think all products are safe...make informed decisions when deciding to use this or any product.</li>
    <li> The product has been great have seen a difference within a week. Feels light on the skin highly recommend the product</li>
    <li> I THINK I NEED TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT MORE TIME BEFORE I CAN DECIDE IF IT REALLY WORKS BECAUSE I HAVE DEEP LINES ABOVE MY LIPS.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice a day for 2 weeks now and I keep looking to see if I can see any noticeable imrpovements but to be honest I can&#x27;t see any difference at all, maybe I need to reserve judgement a bit longer.</li>
    <li> still waiting for my results on this knew beaut wrinkle cream ???? been using this cream day and night with no or very little results</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I am usually sceptical about anti aging products, and it takes a lot to make me write a review. After four days of using this product, two different people commented on how good I look. I hadn&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, but others did. Now I have been using it a month, and I definitely see a difference. My crows feet and the forehead lines and even my neck (was starting to get saggy) looks much better. I will not ever stop using this product. I am 45 and had been a smoker and sun worshipper most of my life. I don&#x27;t need to look 25, but this has really shaved off the years and damage I had done.</li>
    <li> About 1/3 into the bottle has evened out my skin tone a bit have not noticed much of a difference in the fine lines though.</li>
    <li> love this stuff...use it every day under my eyes</li>
    <li> Common sense says if a product claims to be as good as injectable treatments at less than half the cost then research the ingredients and learn the affects.&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is used in anew af33. Research this before you try. The % or concentrate used can affect your judgement of using this product if you don&#x27;t understand the ingredient. Lots of reviews claim a continued use caused a burning sensation. This is because they did not gradually build up the use of this product allowing the skin to get used to the product.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product followed by a soothing moisturiser also washed with a gentle facial scrub to remove dead skin and promote renewal.&lt;br /&gt;Every third day I used soothing moisturiser only to give my skin a break.&lt;br /&gt;I continue with this use and have noticed an improvement in skin tone, elasticity and yes wrinkles are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I am a sun worshipper and my skin was needing this miracle cream.&lt;br /&gt;Use right and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Educate yourself on the ingredients. You will shop with more confidence and wont waste money.&lt;br /&gt;People have stated how expensive it is for a small bottle....what do you expect if expensive injectable grades are used in the product and remember at less than half the cost of injectable treatments.&lt;br /&gt;The internet is a big place. Google your product and find a cheaper source to buy from. I have purchased 3 anew af33 from ebay and amazon for less than £10 each.</li>
    <li> Broke out my face really bad..had to stop using after a few days.  Will see about another product that may work better</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It smooths out my wrinkles on my forehead and face.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 weeks not much of a change on the fine wrinkles around my eyes, in fact, I do not notice a change.  5 Stars to the company that sent the product, perfect timing on the delivery and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Although this product &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; like it was doing something, the smell gave me massive headaches.  I continued to use it for several weeks and noticed that my crow&#x27;s feet were actually GETTING WORSE!  I stopped using it and the headaches went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t send it back so I just tossed it.  Total waste.</li>
    <li> This stuff is vicious! It burns and reddens instantly, and my skin looks like it has been burned with acid, it is so tight and painful, this is after 5 days of lightish usage.  My skin is peeling off and I have a mass of wrinkles where my skin was fine before.&lt;br /&gt;I had dryish skin and some crows feet (I am 54), so I thought I&#x27;d try this, but I am worse off!  No thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, but haven&#x27;t tried all that many anti-wrinkle products as I decided very quickly that they simply dont work. With this product I was pretty certain I could instantly see a difference. I&#x27;ve now been using clinical anew for about 3 weeks (and usually only apply it in the mornings) and there have been definite changes in my skin&#x27;s appearance. It seems to be mostly due to the increased elasticity, as the larger laughter lines below my cheekbones have also diminished. I haven&#x27;t asked for anyone elses opinion, but I&#x27;m certain my face is looking younger!</li>
    <li> Well, let me rephrase : I don&#x27;t really hate this product, I just don&#x27;t care about this product anymore, at all.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:nice package, good texture, smells ok,applies and absorbs easily,one bottle lasts 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NO RESULTS!!!!!!!!!! Zero, nole, none, etc....I&#x27;ve used it for 5 weeks every morning/evening and no improvement (not a bit).Thanks God, I&#x27;m done with it.&lt;br /&gt;And, I don&#x27;t like when companies lie to their customers. Right on the package of this treatment Avon claims : 100% of women saw the results  just in 2 weeks. And, it is a huge lie.Sorry, Avon, but I am M.D.and I like facts, and the fact is:According to double blind clinical trails of this product only 50% improvement in fine lines and wrinkles in 11 weeks! (almost 3 months), not 2 weeks. Common, people. To really see that improvement you need to have a microscope instead of an eye :). So, those people who see results on next day or after just one week, they really flatter themselves and see what they want to see, or just in love with Avon products (good for them).&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice will be: buy this one if you will find it for $8 or less;or save your time, nerves, and money, go to eBay and find a serum for $5-7 that will give you the same results (pleasant smell, texture, moisture, etc).</li>
    <li> I am not sure what is contributing to a feeling good about looking in the mirror but I started using this product a few months ago.  I don&#x27;t keep track of specifics, but I like the look.</li>
    <li> I am 42 and while I don&#x27;t have a lot of fine lines, probably due to having oily skin since age 13, but do have the &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines and vertical lines between my eyebrows and wanted to try.  I originally bought from a friend who sells Avon.  I didn&#x27;t see drastic changes, but I did see and overall smoothing of my face.  Above one of my eye brows, I have a deeper line, like a crease, and that has smoothed out some.  The skin on my neck is thinner these days and I have noticed that using this on my neck helps, making the skin feel a bit plumper.  When I read reviews, mostly fine lines were effected, but I was hoping it would help my deeper ones more.  Since sellers on Amazon have it for a much more reasonable price, I will buy again, mostly for my neck and to help &amp;#34;keep things in check&amp;#34;.  The biggest problem I have is it makes little zits appear around my mouth, usually the corners.  I have just been avoiding using it there.</li>
    <li> CAUTION, this product will burn the skin if used twice a day. I used it for lines between the eye and cheek and developed second degree BURNS (red blisters).</li>
    <li> this product did not work for me; possibly if i used it longer but i just was not&lt;br /&gt;interested in it</li>
    <li> Used everyday have more expensive cream I use at night but it is a good cream and affordable.  Good deal</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
    <li> I used this every night for months, concentrating on wrinkle areas. I really saw no noticeable change.  Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve noticed my sun spots are fading and my wrinkles appear less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My dermatologist recommended Aveeno Positively Rradiant daily moisturizer and Aveeno Smart Essentials for nighttime use and this trio has made a world of difference in my aging skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results from using this product.  I think the Anew night time moisturizer works better than this product.</li>
    <li> Avon Anew is my best beauty regimen. I no longer have a problem with dry spots.</li>
    <li> just many other women i have tried many different anti wrinkle creams and did not see much result. I saw an ad in a magazine re Anew clinical A F33 and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results, I&#x27;m an older woman who really takes care f her skin and the few deep wrinkles that i had have almost disappear using this product, i love it  and i&#x27;m ordering more now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skin care junkie. I read blogs, magazine articles, physician articles (I have med degree), and talk in earnest w my aesthetician, dermatologist and plastic surgeon (I admit,  I get Tox twice a year for a forehead furrow). At 36, I look a decade or more younger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I read about this on a British News site an started googling. After reading an article from a plastic surgery journal, I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using two weeks or so, and I see where some acne scarring is smoother. Also, the tone of my skin has improved (my husband says my skin looks \\&quot;clearer\\&quot;). The elasticity of my skin seems improved, also. An adult acne sufferer, I&#x27;ve had no problems w breakouts or skin sensitivity. I&#x27;ll definately reorder!</li>
    <li> Maybe you would think I am exaggerating, but only a few hours after applying the line eraser, I already noticed the magic it did to my skin - smoother skin that glows! Not to mention the next morning I found myself with skin that looked much finer, fewer lines, fully pumped with moist!</li>
    <li> I use this on the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; above my nose/between eye brows.  It works very well.  I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd bottle. I first saw it in a news article at The Daily Mail, UK. Ordered, came right away and absolutely love it. My skin texture is amazing, lines around my eyes have diminished, dark spots that i have tried other expensive products on with no difference have all but disappeared. am sending my mum and sister for Christmas. I have since ordered other Avon Anew skincare items and love them. Just orded 2 more. The products are 100 times better than the $$$$ ones from the department stores and at great prices from Amazon... and free shipping!</li>
    <li> Avon can say anything they want but I did not find this product to be effective! I used it for two months and saw no difference in my lines. Maybe at my age nothing will help! I am 67!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, price and service. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The price was right to try this item out.  I think it makes a difference on this old face.  My sister, who is older, likes it also.  It seems to brighten the face and reduce some wrinkles.  I would probably buy it again, on sale.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. My skin has not improved one bit. It has only dried me out and sometimes burns.</li>
    <li> I have bought this, but was lucky enough to receive a free sample from my local Avon lady before the product actually arrived.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had any reaction to anything.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream on at night and went to bed, only to wake up the next morning with red (feels like severe sunburnt) skin.  It was horrible.  It was stinging and sensitive.  It has been 3 days now and my skin is still red, blotchy and sore.  I have had an outbreak too.  When my product finally arrives, I will be throwing it in the bin.&lt;br /&gt;This product should be banned.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It is non gready and has no odor. Lightweight and easy to apply. I use it morning and evening.</li>
</ol>
