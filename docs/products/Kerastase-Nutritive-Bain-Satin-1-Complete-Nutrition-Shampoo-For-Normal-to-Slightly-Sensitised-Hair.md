      <li>Leaves your hair soft and VERY  healthy!!!!</li>
      <li>My hair feels very clean and the smell is nice.</li>
      <li>I have highlighted, shorter hair, and use a lot of styling product; most shampoos will strip the product out, but the color will end up getting stripped out too.  </li>
      <li>i just love this product.</li>
      <li>how do I get some more...  </li>
      <li>and it just responds better to this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>i want som more.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I wish I would have gone with the more nourishing line....</li>
      <li>Kerestase products were introduced to me by my daughter who worked for a top hairdresser on Newberry St in Boston.</li>
      <li>I am somewhere in between and am pleased with that.  </li>
      <li>I read many reviews for this shampoo and thought people were exaggerating.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like many shampoos.</li>
      <li>Not with Kerastase - this shampoo makes my hair feel squeaky clean, but also hydrated - an amazing combination.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair very clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Best shampoo on the market,ml eaves your hair revitalized and moisturized all day long..</li>
      <li>I loved how much it lathered</li>
      <li>Shampoo came with original seal removed and plastic wrap around the top.  </li>
      <li>The Internet has the best price as it can be extremely pricey over the counter.</li>
      <li>The shampoo I received smelled strongly of undiluted lemon floor cleaner....</li>
      <li>for people with fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo - I&#x27;ve been using this along with the Kerastase Nutritive Lait Vital Nourishing Care for years, and my hair never looked or felt better!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use more than about a quarter-sized amount to get a really good lather; sometimes I&#x27;ll leave it on for half a minute to really get my hair in great</li>
      <li>My first time experiencing this was purchased thru a fine salon and it seemed to work better than the bottle I rec&#x27;d online.</li>
      <li>The scent is very clean and fresh and not over-done.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for years and can say that it was not the original product.</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
      <li>so shiney and clean</li>
      <li>Great shampoo if your hair is dry!</li>
      <li>My hair stylist had initially recommended it and so do I. Amazon has a good price too.</li>
      <li>After the first time even using it I noticed that my hair felt amazing; smooth, soft, light, etc.</li>
      <li>If you can stomach spending over $20 on a bottle of shampoo, and you want to take really good care of your hair, I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.</li>
      <li>Have used for the last year and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It appears to be more watery then normal.</li>
      <li>The smell is absolutely lovely, and it makes my hair soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>The amazing thing was the next morning the softness was still there, and my hair retained the style.  </li>
      <li>You can really tell the difference between this product and the cheap ones.</li>
      <li>it is pricey,  but worth every penny for it.it</li>
      <li>Leaves a nice low gloss on some hair shades.</li>
      <li>You pay for this quality but it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It still works, but I&#x27;d rather have fresh stuff.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
      <li>The shampoo had a lovely smell and really cleansed my hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is an Exelent  product I am 47 years old and my hair is still healthy , because of this Product&lt;br /&gt;Y recomend it for price and quality</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Kerastase Bain Satin 1 for at least five years, so I was excited when I saw the great price here.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for 10+ years and could tell right away</li>
      <li>Soft, shiny, easy to style hair.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>and I keep coming back to it, because I just haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price. :-)</li>
      <li>Kerastase is quite possibly one of my favorite products in the world.</li>
      <li>This shampoo never weighs my hair down and leaves it very healthy and wavy.  </li>
      <li>and I just can&#x27;t afford to spend that much on shampoo and conditioner right now.</li>
      <li>I have never been able to use conditioner even with the change to dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily, but with fine hair</li>
      <li>I have used Kerastase products for over 5 years but this is the first time for this particular product.  </li>
      <li>It is cheaper to get the huge bottle and refill the smaller ones.</li>
      <li>although very pricey.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this shampoo from my salon before and it was much thicker when I bought it at the salon.</li>
      <li>Never again, this is the real deal.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see that much of a difference</li>
      <li>Does not take much of the product to shampoo your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> must use with kerastase nutritive protein conditioner and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused as I searched for Bain Satin 1 and when I pressed the link it took me to this page where the photo has a bottle of Bain Satin 2.    I bought Bain Satin 2 and it was a bit heavy for my hair, could someone help me out and let me know if this is 1 or 2?  cheers</li>
    <li> In the past I always had oily hair.  One day I woke up, and my hair was dry.  I was in a new world.  I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily, but with fine hair I felt I needed to do it to keep a style.  I read many reviews for this shampoo and thought people were exaggerating.  I used the shampoo and was happy with the return of the softness to my hair.  The amazing thing was the next morning the softness was still there, and my hair retained the style.  Now I do not feel the need for the daily wash.  I am not back to the oil in my hair that I was used to all my life, but my hair does not feel dry any more.  I am somewhere in between and am pleased with that.  I have never been able to use conditioner even with the change to dry hair.  I am going to try the conditioner next.  Many times you try a new shampoo, and it works for a few days.  This has been weeks and I still like it... a milestone to me.  Put this on your must try list.</li>
    <li> Kerestase products were introduced to me by my daughter who worked for a top hairdresser on Newberry St in Boston. They are the best I&#x27;ve ever used-although very pricey. I consider them a luxury and do not purchase often-they lather and perform beautifully-hair is healthy and great. To be honest I get equally good results with slightly less expensive professional products. If they were on sale for example I would choose Kerastase over any other product, otherwise I try to save $$.</li>
    <li> I adore this shampoo! I use it without conditioner even, and it turns out great. However, please be careful when ordering it. The bottle I bought for what I thought would be a great price ended up expiring that month. It still works, but I&#x27;d rather have fresh stuff. Next time I&#x27;ll probably buy from a salon.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo - I&#x27;ve been using this along with the Kerastase Nutritive Lait Vital Nourishing Care for years, and my hair never looked or felt better!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that is highlighted.  I purchased the Keratase Nutritive Bain Satin 1 and the Lait Conditioner.  For the money, I am not wowed.  I think Pantene Smooth Vitality does about the same job of keeping my hair soft and silky.  Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!!! A Really Great product!!!! I have used for years. Leaves your hair soft and VERY  healthy!!!!</li>
    <li> I switched shampoo for years, always chasing the latest and greatest.  Never again, this is the real deal.  The scent is very clean and fresh and not over-done. This product cleans well but is not harsh.  You pay for this quality but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I hate, hate, hate that I have to spend over $20 on a bottle of shampoo.  However - this is absolutely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have highlighted, shorter hair, and use a lot of styling product; most shampoos will strip the product out, but the color will end up getting stripped out too.  Not with Kerastase - this shampoo makes my hair feel squeaky clean, but also hydrated - an amazing combination.  I don&#x27;t need to use more than about a quarter-sized amount to get a really good lather; sometimes I&#x27;ll leave it on for half a minute to really get my hair in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swore that I&#x27;d only ever get one bottle (because my hairstylist kept telling me I needed to).  Well, I bought it here because it was considerably cheaper than at that salon...and I keep coming back to it, because I just haven&#x27;t found anything better.  If you can stomach spending over $20 on a bottle of shampoo, and you want to take really good care of your hair, I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.</li>
    <li> It smells good, it feels good, and it is great for the hair. Totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I think this is probably a good product.  I compared ingredients with other shampoos purchased at my health food store - a little less expensive but with similar ingredients.  My sister tells me that this product is used by movie stars and the like and is supposed to be the best.  I don&#x27;t see that much of a difference but of course, I will use it until finished.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo and conditioner. I loved how much it lathered and my hair felt great after every use. After a month of using this product my hair was noticeably smoother and stronger. Each strand of my hair seemed stronger! I got my mom and sister hooked on this as well. The only reason I don&#x27;t use it now is because I used up the last of my bottles and I just can&#x27;t afford to spend that much on shampoo and conditioner right now. But if you can afford it and are looking to greatly improve the texture of your hair, don&#x27;t hesitate! buy it!</li>
    <li> for people with fine hair.  This product is worth every penny - my hair looks shiny, thick and lustrous, instead of its fine, flyaway usual self.</li>
    <li> Shampoo came with original seal removed and plastic wrap around the top.  It appears to be more watery then normal. I have purchased this shampoo from my salon before and it was much thicker when I bought it at the salon. Perhaps it was watered down?</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BIZSYY Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 1 Complete Nutrition Shampoo for Normal to Sensitised Hair, 8.5-Ounce Bottle]]    This is one of the best shampoos, which I have used. It makes my hair very clean and shiny. And it&#x27;s got a great scent. The bottle is big, so it will last for a long time. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Kerastase is a great shampoo -- a very little goes a long way.  The Internet has the best price as it can be extremely pricey over the counter.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favortie shampoos. It keeps highlighted hair shiney and glossy. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the price. :-)</li>
    <li> I was expecting Bain Satin 1 but instead rec&#x27;d Bain Satin 2 from beautyonus. My first time experiencing this was purchased thru a fine salon and it seemed to work better than the bottle I rec&#x27;d online. Not really sure why but I will keep it. My hair feels very clean and the smell is nice. But my hair health didn&#x27;t seem to change. I will probably go back to purchasing thru the salon next time to be sure I get the right product.</li>
    <li> Just bought this as a recomendation. After the first time even using it I noticed that my hair felt amazing; smooth, soft, light, etc. Hope it continues to treat my hair well.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo on the market,ml eaves your hair revitalized and moisturized all day long..</li>
    <li> This is wonderful shampoo and I can not find it in any store, so came to amazon.  Does not take much of the product to shampoo your hair.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have gone with the more nourishing line....I think it is in the green bottle.  This is a good shampoo but can be a bit drying for hair that&#x27;s been colored.</li>
    <li> My hair is in much better shape when I use this shampoo!! I missed it!! I would suggest to anyone~</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s the perfect shampoo for my hear type!</li>
    <li> great product...using it for years</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo ever. It is cheaper to get the huge bottle and refill the smaller ones. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I&#x27;m very picky with my hair products and have used this for years.  My hair is super thick and heavy, but can easily be weighed down by shampoos &amp; conditioners....  This shampoo never weighs my hair down and leaves it very healthy and wavy.  It also cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> Kerastase is quite possibly one of my favorite products in the world. The smell is absolutely lovely, and it makes my hair soft and shiny! I have been losing a lot of hair lately and there is a noticeable decline in the amount of strands falling out since I started using these products. Pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> The best there is!&lt;br /&gt;A shampoo with wonderful fragrance and gives your hair incredible body and fullness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on Vitamin Kerastase for the hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have keratin relaxed/straightened and this shampoo helps maintain it. My hair stylist had initially recommended it and so do I. Amazon has a good price too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is now impossible to find in salons, so happy that Amazon has it!  I&#x27;ve tried other high-end shampoos on occasion when I can&#x27;t find Keratase and always regret it.  My hair gets weighed down easily and this seems to be the only one that doesn&#x27;t build up a residue.  Also, my hair is healthier.  The woman who cuts my hair can always tell when I&#x27;m not using it.  Now I just stock up on it here and never have to stray in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works well and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, and smells nice. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kerastase Bain Satin 1 for at least five years, so I was excited when I saw the great price here. But when the shampoo arrived, it was clear instead of the usual milky white consistency. I&#x27;ll definitely pay extra and buy from a salon from now on.</li>
    <li> i have been using this shampoo for awhile it is pricey,  but worth every penny for it.it makes you hair so shiney and clean and it smell so good. i just love this product.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Have used for the last year and have been very pleased with the results. Would highly recommend this - despite the high cost.</li>
    <li> It is an Exelent  product I am 47 years old and my hair is still healthy , because of this Product&lt;br /&gt;Y recomend it for price and quality</li>
    <li> Not the best and not the worst shampoo we have used.  Country of origin may be of concern to some as U.S. made review/content protections?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work OK on fine, thin hair.  Not a dandruff preventative shampoo.  Leaves a nice low gloss on some hair shades.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like kerastase for your hair. It&#x27;s very expensive, but miraculous. Soft, shiny, easy to style hair. Yeah.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive but lasts a long time. You can really tell the difference between this product and the cheap ones.</li>
    <li> Only issue with this product is that it is pricey for such a small bottle of shampoo.  Am considering ordering the larger bottle, but since I can only get this size through Amazon Prime with minimal shipping fees, I may likely stay with this size.</li>
    <li> The vendor this was purchased from sent a fake product.  I have been using this shampoo for 10+ years and could tell right away it was not the legitimate product.  It was not the correct milky white color, and it smelled different.  I suppose that is what you get when you buy a &amp;#34;salon only&amp;#34; product online, but I was disappointed nonetheless.  PerfumebyDominique was the vendor.  Other vendors through amazon have sent the correct product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and can say that it was not the original product. I&#x27;m really disappointed that I spent my money on something that I can&#x27;t use!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of hair products and Kerastase is the best. It is expensive but it works. Several times I have stopped using it because I get tired of spending $35 on shampoo, but every time I notice a decline in my hair after a few weeks using something else. There&#x27;s a reason it costs $35, it&#x27;s because it works! Now I just stick with Kerastase.</li>
    <li> i want som more.  it is wonderful.  I like it.  thank you.  how do I get some more...  blessings always.</li>
    <li> I like it!! Though it hasn&#x27;t been too long since I bought it, I have noticed my hair does not shed as much and it just responds better to this shampoo. I don&#x27;t like many shampoos.</li>
    <li> I remember buying this product from a salon a few years ago. The shampoo had a lovely smell and really cleansed my hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy the product on here because it was tad cheaper. Needless to say, I am very disappointed. The shampoo I received smelled strongly of undiluted lemon floor cleaner.... you know, the stuff that public bathrooms usually reek of? Not pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that I received a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad I can&#x27;t return it :/</li>
    <li> Great shampoo if your hair is dry!</li>
    <li> I have used Kerastase products for over 5 years but this is the first time for this particular product.  It is a good alternative for all hair types, even my curly hair.  I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair beautiful and shine, I recommend it and I will order it again soon.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller...thanks!</li>
