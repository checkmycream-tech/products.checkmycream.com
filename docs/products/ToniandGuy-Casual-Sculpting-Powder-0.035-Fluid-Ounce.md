### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>product in concept is awesome!</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
      <li>It made my roots incredibly greasy, and it took two shampooings before I got all of the residue out.  </li>
      <li>Also great for days</li>
      <li>I was definitely happy about this and plan to purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Keep this in mind and you&#x27;ll have a good experience.  </li>
      <li>not something I was super impressed with.</li>
      <li>Product is like talc - very light and flaky!</li>
      <li>Product is like talc - very light and flaky!</li>
      <li>Amazing</li>
      <li>One still needs a good hairspray on top of the powder to maintain a hold, so I don&#x27;t under stand the purpose of this.  </li>
      <li>As I stated, I have not been using the product on its own.</li>
      <li>I am the first to admit that I&#x27;m not an ideal candidate for this sculpting powder.  </li>
      <li>I love their brand and will be buying more!</li>
      <li>It shakes out of the container like it was a very fine powdery dust.  </li>
      <li>Shake some fine, lightweight, talc-like product onto your hair, run your fingers through your hair and you have a lived-in look in seconds!</li>
      <li>This fine powder does provide for a nice hold, but it also leaves a sticky residue on the hair and hands.  </li>
      <li>For the most part it seems like a good and useful product.  </li>
      <li>This might be better for someone with thinner hair.</li>
      <li>Probably not but I&#x27;m enjoying the styling results</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an interesting product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
      <li>I was moderately pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>and, well, although it may not have turned into a paste it sure felt like</li>
      <li>This is some magic powder.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a non-liquid product to be able to use in carryons for airplane travel.</li>
      <li>On the top it has a pepper shaker like grill that allowed the powder to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is an interesting product.  </li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>It was OK, but</li>
      <li>This has an interesting texture to it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>] and was able to \\&quot;lubricate\\&quot; my hair so that I could use a brush through it.</li>
      <li>The one good thing is that the container is small and best for travelers.</li>
      <li>If you are just using this on clean hair as a styling product on its own with no additional product, you might not get your desired results.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to get better results styling my fine hair like some of my favorite singers and movie stars are wearing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a combination of fine powder and chunky clumps that made my hair feel sticky.</li>
      <li>I picked up this product because I really liked the Big Sexy Hair version of it, and thought this might be just as good.  </li>
      <li>- just go easy on it.</li>
      <li>but this was almost TOO easy</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
      <li>The powder is so fine that it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is anything in the jar, but once I start shaking it I could see it coming out.</li>
      <li>Dow Corning® VM 2270 Aerogel Fine Particles Aerogel silica silylate is a thickener, sebum absorber and impacts the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Corning</li>
      <li>There is no way of opening the container and viewing the available contents and since the powder is so fine and lightweight</li>
      <li>others have pointed out, the bottle is deceptively light, making you think there must not be anything inside.</li>
      <li>My second day hair looks just as great as day one.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair very &#x27;sculptable&#x27;, but it is kind of a pain to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Micro-fine powder creates volume and shape great for achieving a laid back \\&quot;lived in\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;Around that time, you&#x27;ll realize that it feels bizarre and if it gets on your hands (which it will when you try to maneuver it)</li>
      <li>the product is so light and flaky that it floats in the air.</li>
      <li>When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a styling product that adds volume and control with a clean matte finish.  </li>
      <li>After sprinkling it on, I backcombed with a special brush and guess what?</li>
      <li>I have not found that to be true.</li>
      <li>It does create a bit of sticky feel, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say my roots are smooth and that you can run your fingers through them easily, but what do you expect?</li>
      <li>you must get your hair in a certain way this will work great, just at a cost of getting it out later.</li>
      <li>Luckily, my sculpting foam got my hair manageable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(P.S - I love this line, just not this one particular product.)</li>
      <li>While the hands can be quickly washed off, the powder in the hair can not.  </li>
      <li>It achieves similar results to this product, is easier to work with, washes out easily, and is more economical.</li>
      <li>I mean, if you want light hold that washes out easily then maybe this isn&#x27;t good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product claims a lived-in look and the product persisting in the hair might fit in very well for someone&#x27;s lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is all this worth the hassle?  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want to go directly in your hair and then try to avoid touching it.  </li>
      <li>This has now become a new favorite, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>The powder is an ultra fine silica silylate, nearly invisible when shaking it onto my hands.  </li>
      <li>* Need minimal product for an effective hold&lt;br</li>
      <li>For use prior to styling, in order to add volume, my wife has not found anything better.</li>
      <li>: Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing Powder, 0.53 Ounce</li>
      <li>It immediately does exactly what I want it to do.</li>
      <li>: it works exactly as described, it adds volume without crunch</li>
      <li>It offers a really light hold.</li>
      <li>This product is very fine, almost like dry snow flakes.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, the bottle is about the size of a large chap stick.</li>
      <li>This one is pretty much what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>I do believe that this product &#x27;might&#x27; deliver if one has short, smooth, fine, low volume, silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suspect that these reviewers are usng too much.</li>
      <li>So you need to watch how much you tap out of the bottle</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway it seems to work very well</li>
      <li>It does leave your hands feeling really sticky after using it.</li>
      <li>When you shake out some of the powder, it&#x27;s very lightweight -</li>
      <li>Sculpting his hair to the style he wants is what it is all about (and going to college in September).</li>
      <li>Notice how much is included here, .035 ounces, so</li>
      <li>For sculpting my hair, I much prefer Paul Mitchell Mitch Construction Paste.  </li>
      <li>Immediately after applying it my hair felt kind of tacky in the application area, but that went away within a few minutes.</li>
      <li>I was hopeful this would add some volume, because my hair tends to get kind of limp.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the Toni &amp; Guy voluming plumping whip, so I might be getting some better results than other people reviewing the product.</li>
      <li>I put some of this in my hair and it did do a decent job</li>
      <li>I tried using it on my wavy/curly hair and didn&#x27;t see a particular result one way or another.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first Toni and Guy product I have ever used and it seems that, in general, people really like these products.</li>
      <li>This micro-fine powder that you sprinkle on your roots and is absorbed in seconds gives you instant volume and allows you to gently shape and tease your hair for just rolled out of bed beachy waves and height.</li>
      <li>If you are getting a the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; problem then you are using far too much.</li>
      <li>so the complaints about the size should let you know that those people are using far too much.</li>
      <li>Toni&amp;Guy Casual Sculpting Powder seems like a great idea</li>
      <li>I have very long hair and the product is intended more for men and women with short hair.  </li>
      <li>Dust directly at the roots of dry hair and scrunch together with fingers or work through the lengths and ends of an up-do for texture and light hold.</li>
      <li>If I had left the hair in the un-managed state right after application I would have a lived-in look (as the product claims).</li>
      <li>and I put the TINIEST amount possible right at the roots.</li>
      <li>The only way to apply to roots would be if my roots were easily exposed - such as in low body, short, smooth, silky</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it on day two hair and I put the TINIEST amount possible right at the roots. I really do mean a tiny amount. I grab a section of hair and flip it over and barely sprinkle it on the underside of my hair. It immediately does exactly what I want it to do. I have very dark hair and you can&#x27;t see any powder at all. My second day hair looks just as great as day one. Yes, your hand feel a little weird afterward but you&#x27;re hand will feel weird after putting anything in your hair. Wash your hands and move on and there&#x27;s no problem. If you are getting a the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; problem then you are using far too much. This tiny little tube should last quite a while so the complaints about the size should let you know that those people are using far too much.</li>
    <li> This micro-fine powder that you sprinkle on your roots and is absorbed in seconds gives you instant volume and allows you to gently shape and tease your hair for just rolled out of bed beachy waves and height. I am not a pro at styling my hair but this was almost TOO easy and I highly recommend it to those who are short on time and skills or if you aren&#x27;t a morning person. I love their brand and will be buying more!</li>
    <li> And that is the name I would give this product. The 18 year old in the family is into grooming. Sculpting his hair to the style he wants is what it is all about (and going to college in September). His feedback: it works exactly as described, it adds volume without crunch you get when using styling mouse (although it felt like cotton candy), his hands were tacky after using them to style his hair, washing it out can&#x27;t be done with a 2 in 1 product so he shampooed his hair once - rinsed -- shampoo again, rinsed and then used conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the Tony&amp;Guy website: Dust directly at the roots of dry hair and scrunch together with fingers or work through the lengths and ends of an up-do for texture and light hold. Or for extra lift, sprinkle on the crown before backcombing. Micro-fine powder creates volume and shape great for achieving a laid back \\&quot;lived in\\&quot; look. With a weightless texture, it absorbs instantly into the hair giving bounce and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the scoop on the one ingredient Silica Silylate from a web page for Dow Corning:  Dow Corning® VM 2270 Aerogel Fine Particles Aerogel silica silylate is a thickener, sebum absorber and impacts the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Corning Products&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Soft Solid Antiperspirant&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Pressed Powder&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Foundation&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Oil-in-Water Facial Cream&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Face &amp; Body and Sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Color Cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Arctic Defense Body Cream&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Sun Protective Serum&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Marzipan Souffl&amp;eacute;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Silky Feel Hydrogel</li>
    <li> This is some magic powder.  Notice how much is included here, .035 ounces, so this is a very small bottle.  When you start using it, if you get any on your hands at all, you&#x27;ll probably regret it.  You&#x27;ll want to go directly in your hair and then try to avoid touching it.  It makes your hair very &#x27;sculptable&#x27;, but it is kind of a pain to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must get your hair in a certain way this will work great, just at a cost of getting it out later.</li>
    <li> The 2-Star rating is because this product does not work for \\&quot;me\\&quot;! I do believe that this product &#x27;might&#x27; deliver if one has short, smooth, fine, low volume, silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product in concept is awesome! Shake some fine, lightweight, talc-like product onto your hair, run your fingers through your hair and you have a lived-in look in seconds! In reality (for my thick stranded, good body, dense, wavy hair) it did not work as expected. I applied (~5 shakes) to moist hair and it instantly ceased up - think of your hair turning into a friction pad - I could not get my fingers through my hair. It had become unmanageable and had clumped (AMAZING that such little product could do that!). I used my [[ASIN:B002Z0QLG0 Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam Mousse 16.9 oz.]] and was able to \\&quot;lubricate\\&quot; my hair so that I could use a brush through it. If I had left the hair in the un-managed state right after application I would have a lived-in look (as the product claims). However, since I attempted to run my fingers through it, it got an uneven volume and looked horrible. I did have a firmer-than-normal hold all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my product experience and seeing what it can do, I feel that this product would work for low volume, short, smooth, silky hair. This product instructions direct us to apply to hair roots - the product is so light and flaky that it floats in the air. The only way to apply to roots would be if my roots were easily exposed - such as in low body, short, smooth, silky hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing this product out is difficult. Even after shampooing twice there was a little product left in. Luckily, my sculpting foam got my hair manageable. It took another 2 shampoos to get the product out completely. The product claims a lived-in look and the product persisting in the hair might fit in very well for someone&#x27;s lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Need minimal product for an effective hold&lt;br /&gt;* Amazing volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Seems to work for specific hair types - since they do not specify, one has to figure out via trial &amp; error&lt;br /&gt;* Product is like talc - very light and flaky! Difficult to apply to roots&lt;br /&gt;* Difficult to wash out of hair&lt;br /&gt;* Lightweight product gets on to other items in the bath and is difficult to get offc hair types - since they do not specify, one has to figure out via trial &amp; error&lt;br /&gt;* Product is like talc - very light and flaky! Difficult to apply to roots&lt;br /&gt;* Difficult to wash out of hair&lt;br /&gt;* Lightweight product gets on to other items in the bath and is difficult to get off</li>
    <li> This is an interesting product.  It shakes out of the container like it was a very fine powdery dust.  It doesn&#x27;t look like much of anything is coming out, but when we touch our hair, we can definitely feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found it a bit difficult to use because it was hard to see how much was coming out of the bottle, but it does lift the hair where we sprinkle it, and adds volume and gives us the ability to shape and lightly hold the hair without hair spray.</li>
    <li> I like this sculpting powder! I can do quite  a bit with my hair just by using this. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it kind of leaves my hair looking a little dull.</li>
    <li> I picked up this product because I really liked the Big Sexy Hair version of it, and thought this might be just as good.  It isn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t work. At all.  I might was well pour talcum powder on my head, it&#x27;d be just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this awfulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this instead: Big Sexy Hair Powder Play Volumizing and Texturizing Powder, 0.53 Ounce</li>
    <li> I am the first to admit that I&#x27;m not an ideal candidate for this sculpting powder.  I have very long hair and the product is intended more for men and women with short hair.  I had hoped that the sculpting powder could still be used to bring a little extra volume and lift to my roots and bangs, but the problems I ran into would have been issues no matter the hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem was that it was really difficult to determine how much product I was using.  The bottle isn&#x27;t transparent, so it&#x27;s impossible to gauge how much powder is inside.  (Heck, it&#x27;s so lightweight that I initially thought there had been an accident at the plant and I&#x27;d received an empty bottle!)  When you shake out some of the powder, it&#x27;s very lightweight - it reminds me somewhat of the fake &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; you see on windows at Christmastime.  Against my dark hair, I&#x27;d see the white powder for a moment or two, but it seemed to disappear into the roots quickly.  If I shook it into my hands, I couldn&#x27;t see the powder at all, only feel a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, I tried to bring lift to the roots, with minimal success.  But I had known that this would be a long shot, so I wasn&#x27;t too disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the powder out was a miserable experience, though.  It made my roots incredibly greasy, and it took two shampooings before I got all of the residue out.  So for that reason alone, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it - but combined with the difficult application it was clear that Tony&amp;Guy&#x27;s Sculpting Powder DEFINITELY wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I was suspicious when I ordered this product. I was afraid of it turning into a gross paste in my hair and, well, although it may not have turned into a paste it sure felt like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty gross and took a few days to wash out of my hair. Won&#x27;t go down that road again. *trash*</li>
    <li> I was moderately pleased with this product.  I applied it directly to the roots, where I wanted to add volume.  After a bit of back combing, I achieved the desired results, and the hold lasted.  (I also used my regular hair spray, as I normally would.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I used very little, I found it hard to wash out.  For sculpting my hair, I much prefer Paul Mitchell Mitch Construction Paste.  Even though it&#x27;s marketed toward men, it works just as well for women.  It achieves similar results to this product, is easier to work with, washes out easily, and is more economical.</li>
    <li> Toni&amp;Guy Casual Sculpting Powder is just the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for. It makes styling my hair so much easier than using messy goops and sticky pomades. This stuff reacts with the natural oils of the hair, it seems, to create a soft hold that remains flexible, doesn&#x27;t create helmet head, and helps keep the hair from looking as oily as the day goes on. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way for short hair, and it is really easy to use. 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Note: I have short to medium, layered, men&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  It&#x27;s a styling product that adds volume and control with a clean matte finish.  If you don&#x27;t want your hair looking fussed over and prefer a natural, effortless look then you&#x27;ll appreciate the results as opposed to something wet, greased or gel stiffened.  Reactivation also gets a thumbs up and is accomlished by running wet hands through your hair or a few swipes of the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side there are some frustrations with this product.  The powder is an ultra fine silica silylate, nearly invisible when shaking it onto my hands.  However, I do know that the powder is there because my bathroom in the morning gets plenty of natural sunshine through the window and I see a dust storm of sorts, floating all around me when the powder is shook out and applied to my hair.  Also, it&#x27;s really, really difficult to gauge how long the .035 ounces of product will last.  There is no way of opening the container and viewing the available contents and since the powder is so fine and lightweight you can&#x27;t discern any movement or noise when shaking it.  One trick I&#x27;ve come across is to shake the container over a piece of dark paper to visibly gauge the amount of powder being emitted.  Is all this worth the hassle?  Probably not but I&#x27;m enjoying the styling results so I&#x27;ll continue to stick it out until this tube runs dry.</li>
    <li> This definitely weighs my hair down and feels greasy to the touch around roots, and no matter how much I avoid my roots when applying it always seems to work its way back up to them within hours.  Extremely hard to wash out afterwards, just not worth it for me personally.  I have naturally curly/wavy shoulder length hair, very thick.  This might be better for someone with thinner hair.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re still testing out this sculpting powder.  For the most part it seems like a good and useful product.  I would say that it has more hold than most products... which can be bad.  I mean, if you want light hold that washes out easily then maybe this isn&#x27;t good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it seems to work very well and we&#x27;ve had no real issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very easy for &amp;#34;cool messy&amp;#34; to become dirty.  I&#x27;ve used various sculpting powders, and if you can get to the point of using just a little, it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used sculpting powder before, you may be surprised at how tiny this bottle is.  It&#x27;s small because it&#x27;s effective at very low quantities.  Keep this in mind and you&#x27;ll have a good experience.  Overall, I can use this product to get a bit of lift and texture in my otherwise straight/fine layered hair.  It definitely works well - just go easy on it.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it. I was hopeful this would add some volume, because my hair tends to get kind of limp. The powder is so fine that it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is anything in the jar, but once I start shaking it I could see it coming out. Immediately after applying it my hair felt kind of tacky in the application area, but that went away within a few minutes. I did not notice any improvement in volume. I tried multiple times on hair that was both clean and 2nd day and no difference. It did, however, make my hair look and feel dirty, which was not something I wanted. Maybe it would work for someone with a different hair texture, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have the straightest hair in the world so I&#x27;m always looking for something to help shape my hair. I put some of this in my hair and it did do a decent job but I didn’t care for the feeling of having it in my hair and getting it out the next morning was not fun.</li>
    <li> Toni&amp;Guy Casual Sculpting Powder seems like a great idea but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. It&#x27;s hard to get out of the tiny tube and when it does come out it&#x27;s more of a combination of fine powder and chunky clumps that made my hair feel sticky. It was also difficult to wash out too. I was hoping to get better results styling my fine hair like some of my favorite singers and movie stars are wearing. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my arsenal of gels, spritzes, and mousse.</li>
    <li> This is the first Toni and Guy product I have ever used and it seems that, in general, people really like these products. I ordered this because I saw a friend using a similar product that cost $50 and I really liked the way it worked and wanted to have something similar at a slightly less expensive price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, the bottle is deceptively light, making you think there must not be anything inside. Then when you open it and attempt to shake some out onto your finger tips, it&#x27;s as if dandruff is floating out of the bottle. Time and time again I tried to actually get some product on my hands but to no avail. Heaven help you if someone walks by you, or creates even a slight breeze -- the product is gone like dust. I have taken to just putting it directly on my scalp. When the product actually gets to my hair, it does exactly what it claims to do. It adds texture and lift to my roots. It does create a bit of sticky feel, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say my roots are smooth and that you can run your fingers through them easily, but what do you expect? The product doesn&#x27;t claim to give you touchably soft roots, it claims to give you body and texture and it does just that. If your hair is dirty, this product is not going to make it look like you have freshly washed hair -- it&#x27;s not dry shampoo, it&#x27;s not meant to be absorbing oil, it&#x27;s adding body. I think some people have been confused about the intent and purpose of the product. A lot of reviewers have commented on the stickiness of the product on their hands when using it, to which I say, when you use gel or mousse or pomade doesn&#x27;t that make your fingers sticky? I just wash my hands after apply. I know others have commented that the same stickiness is in their hair and that it is difficult to wash out. I haven&#x27;t had this same issue, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if I would buy this product again or not. In general, I apply my products to my hair when it is still wet and if I am styling it and blow-drying it I typically don&#x27;t need a product to give me additional lift. I do use the product on day #2 when I am not going to wash my hair and want to add a little volume. Thankfully I don&#x27;t have oily hair so it works out ok and I don&#x27;t feel like I have icky sticky messy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...in the end, the pros: does what it says -- adds volume and texture; cons: difficult to get in the places you want it because it is powdery,  flies away and seems almost impossible to apply unless you dump it directly on your scalp about 1 inch away from your head -- which again is what the directions on the product instruct you to do.ll wet and if I am styling it and blow-drying it I typically don&#x27;t need a product to give me additional lift.

    <li> This fine powder does provide for a nice hold, but it also leaves a sticky residue on the hair and hands.  While the hands can be quickly washed off, the powder in the hair can not.  One still needs a good hairspray on top of the powder to maintain a hold, so I don&#x27;t under stand the purpose of this.  The one good thing is that the container is small and best for travelers.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work. I have the softest hair ever (as my stylist likes to remind me) because I don&#x27;t color it yet. As a result, ponytails (and every other hairstyle) fall flat unless I put product in it. When I received this, I lifted the back of my hair and sprinkled it on at the roots. It is a translucent color, so if you have brown hair, you don&#x27;t need to worry about it showing. After sprinkling it on, I backcombed with a special brush and guess what? My hair kept its shape! I was definitely happy about this and plan to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This was a mess. First and foremost, the bottle is about the size of a large chap stick. Secondly, it feels empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use it, its impossible to see so you could dump half the bottle and have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around that time, you&#x27;ll realize that it feels bizarre and if it gets on your hands (which it will when you try to maneuver it) you&#x27;ll have a weird sticky/tacky/dirty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck getting it out of your hair.  Seriously, you&#x27;ll need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I openly admit my experience may be user error, but then that is an issue in itself since I should have to go to cosmetology school to use a product from a commercial line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S - I love this line, just not this one particular product.)</li>
    <li> From my wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the Toni &amp; Guy voluming plumping whip, so I might be getting some better results than other people reviewing the product. I should specify; I use the plumping whip after I shower on my damp hair. I use the sculpting powder the next day to extend my shampoo. The sculpting powder says it creates a matte finish. I use it as a dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, thin, flat, and professionally colored. This product is very fine, almost like dry snow flakes. They dissolve on contact with my scalp. So you need to watch how much you tap out of the bottle or you might get sections where you have placed no product, but think you did. Parting my hair at different sections, I tap the product directly from the bottle onto my scalp. Once I&#x27;ve applied it on all desired parts I massage it in with my fingers. I have noticed some extra volume that wouldn&#x27;t be there on day old hair. As I stated, I have not been using the product on its own. Some reviews stated they had a hard time shampooing out this product. I have not found that to be true. But depending on how many/much hair product a person uses, they might need to add in a weekly wash with a clarifying shampoo to their hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are already using a mousse or voluming cream, I think this sculpting powder can help extend the length of time you get volume. As I stated, I use it as a dry shampoo. If you are just using this on clean hair as a styling product on its own with no additional product, you might not get your desired results.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that when I opened the package, some of the sculpting powder was loose in the packaging. This has an interesting texture to it. It looks almost like a fake snow, but it dissolves and adds a bit of texture to the hair. It does leave your hands feeling really sticky after using it. It offers a really light hold. It was OK, but not something I was super impressed with.</li>
    <li> For use prior to styling, in order to add volume, my wife has not found anything better. This has now become a new favorite, but it doesn&#x27;t take much. Her hair can lay pretty flat without use of rollers (lots of work) or hairspray (hates the crunchy feel). She had never used sculpting powder before and is now hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are quite a few reviews complaining of it being difficult to wash out. I suspect that these reviewers are usng too much. There are four small holes on the top; we use only two to help have only minimal amount come out. Using it about 3 times a week, we suspect that this will last 6-12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is dry sculpting powder. I tried using it on my wavy/curly hair and didn&#x27;t see a particular result one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see a lot of sticky white powder on my hands and clothes. Warning: Do not wear black when applying this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the reason for all the powder is because of the design of the container itself or the fact that its hard to tell how much powder to use. The powder comes in a tiny can-like bottle that is about two inches in height. On the top it has a pepper shaker like grill that allowed the powder to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of attempting to use the powder, but I think I&#x27;ll stick to pomades and gels that yield results and that are less messy from now on.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non-liquid product to be able to use in carryons for airplane travel. This is a powdery talc type of consistency that does tend to clump a bit and be hard to get out of the container.  It&#x27;s meant for lighter styles (hence, called &#x27;casual&#x27;) and works well for light usage.  Trying to make it do a firm hairstyle, however, will be problematic since it will weigh down hair and also be surprisingly hard to wash out as well.</li>
    <li> I have used several brands of sculpting powder. This one is pretty much what you&#x27;d expect. The powder feels oddly damp when you sprinkle it on but acts completely dry. You want to shake this into the roots of your hair. It gives texture and fluffs it up. It works as well as I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t invisible. You can see the powder in your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I only wash my hair every couple of days, and this really helps to give some lift to the second day of wear. Also great for days I&#x27;m styling it to go out and need some extra oomph!</li>
