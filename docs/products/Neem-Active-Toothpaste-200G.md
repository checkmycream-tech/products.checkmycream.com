<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellente! The flavor is great, my theet are clear and clean!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste.  I have had gum problems for a long time, and since using Neem my gums are pink and healthy.  I recommend this toothpaste to anyone who has gum problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for two years great stuff.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, tastes fine, cleans effectively</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste my husband will use. says it keeps him away from the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
    <li> NO OTHER PASTE CAN BEAT THIS TOOTH PASTE! THE TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;AND WHITENING AND REMOVING ADOR AND STRENGTHENING THE GUMS&lt;br /&gt;UNBELIEVABLE</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I also watched a TV special on it. I’ve enjoyed it ever since I first purchased it.</li>
    <li> I got the product on time. I&#x27;m pleased to say that it is the same as the product I was introduced to thru the VA. Can&#x27;t say what the outcome of my dental check up will be however the first time I used it I got improved marks on my dental appointment with the hygienist.</li>
    <li> I love to have many aspects of my life as natural as possible.  The taste as well as what it is doing for me is great.  My dentist said that my gums look the best he has seen in years!!</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job of keeping my teeth white. Heard of it through a friend and am happy I did.</li>
    <li> I chose &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t really know if it is doing what it says it will -- like reduce bacteria in your mouth.  It also says it has calcium in it that makes your teeth stronger.  I&#x27;m not sure if calcium can be absorbed that way.  It does have a good taste, and I thought I was getting one tube, but got two.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and matches description.</li>
    <li> Works very well, Doc Oz says its the shizneezy, mom swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;Foaming action seems to get in the cracks</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product because I use Neem on a daily basis in capsule form for alleviating my allergies and infections whenever I happen to get one. I have some issues with using regular toothpaste and with my teeth. I already know Neem helps fight off infections and I have taken the capsules for tooth related infections and it cured the infection for me personally. I want to try the toothpaste to have cleaner gums and teeth and using a healthy natural alternative instead of chemical artificial toothpastes. This product arrived by mail fast and I am pleased to have it.</li>
    <li> The product is OK but for the cost of purchase and shipping, it&#x27;s just too much for my budget. I&#x27;ll stick with Crest or some other easily accessible brand. It&#x27;s done me now since I was a kid and I&#x27;ve probably only got 20 more years to go. If you can afford it and you think it makes your teeth and gums healthy then \\&quot;go for it.\\&quot; As for me, as I said, it&#x27;s not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel and look better. I am no longer self-conscious nor shy about showing my teeth through big large smiles. That&#x27;s really organic, natural, great stuff!</li>
    <li> Its ok not sure if  will order again.</li>
    <li> I saw Neem oil products promoted on Dr. Oz and started using this toothpaste about 3 or 4 years ago. I use this at night and a whiting toothpaste in the mornings. Leaves a feeling of deep clean in my mouth unlike any other commercial toothpaste.</li>
    <li> fresh and clean. feels like it kills unwanted germs and not too strong of a mint taste. I&#x27;d recommend it but it is a little pricy.</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste. my whole mouth feels great, teeth are whiter. and i will keep buying this toothpaste. love love it.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, the flavor and the way it makes my mouth feels, even the Grandkids use and like it. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> And I haven&#x27;t looked back since.  Seriously, this stuff cleans your damn teeth real well.  My wife has been using it for months and hasn&#x27;t even noticed it&#x27;s neem and not standard toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, it does what it says and nice to use natural toothpaste.I sooo enjoying this product</li>
    <li> A friend heard an MD on a chat show mention that she used Neem toothpaste and never had a plaque problem.  We&#x27;ll see.  So far, after several months, it&#x27;s a great toothpaste but I&#x27;ll have to report the results after my next cleaning in 6 months.</li>
    <li> Wonderful taste, minty fresh feeling after brushing. I will definitely order again if it helps improve my oral hygiene. Hope it works!</li>
    <li> Tastes great and is good for your teeth.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a non fluoride toothpaste and saw this product. I ordered it and am so happy with it. Strong Mint flavor and best of all, no poisonous FLUORIDE!!!!</li>
    <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that it contains a foaming agent that I don&#x27;t need in my toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve found a brand that doesn&#x27;t us it and I&#x27;ll be buying that next.  Otherewise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and consistency of this toothpaste.  This is a repeat order.  I have been using this toothpaste for the last 5 months.  My next cleaning will be next month.  The proof will be in what the hygienist says.</li>
    <li> Having previously heard about the awesome benefits of (Neem) on the Dr.oz show .I was excited to try this new founded (to me) beneficial health product . I came across this toothpaste , I purchased it and I love it . I will never buy regular brand toothpaste ever again . And neither should anyone else . Neem Active toothpaste is my new favorite! !</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from a &amp;#34;guest &amp;#34;  Dr. on  THE DOCTORS show this summer.  I tried it &amp; have been very pleased with the results.  I have very high expectations for good results on my next dental check-up.  Most refreshing toothpaste I have ever used.  Makes my mouth feel professionally cleaned clean... every day!  Would recommend everyone try it.  Much better than ANYTHING in the stores today!!</li>
    <li> Leaves a refreshing aftertaste.  Seems better than the regular toothpaste that I&#x27;ve used forever.  Would recommend to friends.  Will repurchase as needed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this, but absolutely love this product. It has a fresh minty taste. My teeth are so clean and getting whiter each day which is a bonus for me. I wish I could find it locally, but I will continue to buy on line because it&#x27;s worth it. It looks like products that include Neem are the new and upcoming and most healthy ingredient.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has a good flavor and my gums seem to be healthier.</li>
    <li> Afeter years of deep and painful cleaning every 3 months for paradontial disease I watched a program on TV for Neem.&lt;br /&gt;Neem is is a natural ayurvedic healing tree leaf that is used widly in other countries.  This wasn&#x27;t an infomercial that I watched, it was a Dr. on national TV.  I listened to all the healing benefits of what seemed amazingly impossible.  One recommended item was tooth paste for gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;I went on the Internet and found this tooth paste hoping for some releif for the disease and a break from the cost of specialized expensive cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a couple of tubes in different flavors and found i preferred the taste of pomegranate over the mint.  The texture is different than regular tooth paste.  Neem tooth paste is more like the old fashioned Pearl Drops of long ago.&lt;br /&gt;I used this tooth paste for 3 months and went in for my scheduled dental appointment.&lt;br /&gt;I was told that I no longer required the deep cleaning every 3 months.  In fact I didn&#x27;t need that specialized cleaning at all.  I continue to have receded gums from age and crowns but the disease it&#x27;s self was gone.  I beleive it is helping me grow new healthy tissue.&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to use this tooth paste but not a fan of the mint flavor.  The price is right when ordered in bulk.  Much more affordable than from health food stores if you can find it.  Out west we don&#x27;t have a lot of alternative choice shopping.&lt;br /&gt;I remain disease free to this day as long as I use this tooth paste in combination with a water flossing machine.  I use a sonic tooth brush and brush twice a day,  water floss in the morning and the evening.&lt;br /&gt;I have had astonishing results with Neem tooth paste.  I can&#x27;t list all the extra ingredients that are in this tooth paste, there are to many.  I will say it is all natural, organic, sugar and sugar substitute free.  It has a pleasant taste and it isn&#x27;t your grandmas tooth paste or a baking soda concoction that is gritty and doesn&#x27;t work on paradontial disease.&lt;br /&gt;Check out Ayurvedic healing alternatives.  I have been very please with the results.  But remember i only get results as long as I stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;What do you have to loose trying it besides your teeth?</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste and my gums feel the difference. I use it three times a day and it has helped with keeping my gums and teeth heathier. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Your teeth will feel liked they&#x27;ve been cleaned at the dentist.  Also has helped any sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste and brand</li>
    <li> Ive used it close to a year and I absolutely love it. It has gotten rid of my tooth sensitivity and taste y great. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Thus product has carrageenan and sorbital.  Carrageenan has been studied extensively and has been shown to be detrimental to humansi. See DrWeil.com for an eye opening review. I prefer not putting sorbital on my teeth. Makes no sense to me when xylitol is sweet and has been shown to be good for your teeth.</li>
    <li> This seems to help, I&#x27;ve been using the Neem mouthwash and taking neem pills and CoenzymeQ10 as well, some teeth that where loose are no longer loose. Only 4 stars because the neem works but I don&#x27;t like the other ingredients. I&#x27;m still going to continue to use this product, but I could do without sweetener and fluoride.</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this toothpaste and was told by a friend that it was healing for your gums. I am hoping that this works. I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I do like it.</li>
    <li> Have only been using it for a couple of days, but so far, I like it.  Have heard so much about it from Dr. OZ.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS. I DIDNT LIKE ALL THE INGREDIENTS THAT WHERE IN IT COMPARED TO OTHER NEEM TOOTHPASTE I HAVE PURCHASED.</li>
    <li> Too pricy for the internet. Acquired a better quality product at Whole Foods for same price.</li>
    <li> WARNING CONTAINS FLUORIDE *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;did not know this until i read the information this info says it contains 1000ppm max of fluoride. disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!  Tastes good and leaves my teeth feeling really clean.  I have tossed the old tubes of the more popular brands and plan to stick to this one.  My dental check-up was already slightly improved after only a couple months use.  Maybe with more time my teeth and gums will be much improved.  I hesitated to buy this because i was afraid the taste would be a turnoff, but it is just fine.</li>
    <li> After using this product I did try a few other similar flavors. I came back to this one. Mouth feels cleaner even in the morning after sleeping. I won&#x27;t switch again.</li>
    <li> Recommended by an ayurvedic doctor years ago, I have used it ever  since,with no dental problems It&#x27;s well worth a good try.</li>
    <li> I got advice on tv to buy  this product, and I love the taste, and it seems my mouth is cleaner!</li>
    <li> we love it and recommend it! better than any other toothpaste in the market!</li>
    <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t say I like it better than any other toothpaste.  It tasted fine though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of months and my teeth are much whiter. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> It has a different taste but not bad.  I don&#x27;t know if it works well or not but I&#x27;m using it to see if it is.  I try to take care of my teeth because I don&#x27;t want dentures.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t taste like Aqua Fresh which I normally use.</li>
    <li> I really like this and I enjoy using it especially because it has NO floride in it I do not like floride and I do not think people should be forced to take it.</li>
    <li> As expected.  I have ordered it before.</li>
    <li> I have receding gums on my lower jaw due to pressure from overcrowding.  They have been slowly receding my entire life and I had thought there was no solution short of braces and a gum graft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I got a tip from a friend to try Neem toothpaste.  Since then (about halfway through my first tube), my gums seem healthier and even seem to have grown back a little.  I also love the extra clean feeling after brushing from the foaming action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO REGRETS!  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Cleans your teeth great and helps with plaque and sensitive gums too. Saw on Dr. Oz and it&#x27;s on the up and up</li>
    <li> I was having difficulty with my teeth feeling clean.  I use the Neem toothpaste after eating, in the morning and before bed.  I have tried all the major brands of toothpaste and find that Neem meets my needs.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever. Good taste and good foaming action. On last visit dentist told me to keep doing what I am doing...</li>
    <li> We have had to use tooth paste designed for sensitive teeth. Read about Neem Toothpaste. Decided to try it. We really like it. It seems to keep the tartar down. My teeth feel cleaner. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> taste is unusual but I feel it is what I wanted! I have crowns and wanted something that would help protect them!</li>
    <li> Product took a while to get here ,but you have to take into consideration the fact that it is getting here from India that not so unusual .  Great taste and most importantly it does not make me gag as most toothpaste do so like it so far .</li>
    <li> Best best best ever! Teeth doesn&#x27;t feel clean using any other product.</li>
    <li> This is a refreshing and good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product cleans beautifully makes my pearly whites WHITE!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste.  I like the taste and the clean feeling in my mouth.  I will diffinitly continue useing it.</li>
    <li> I like it being all natural and it only takes just a wee amount on your brush.And it taste good also...&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it took WAY to Long to get it.</li>
    <li> Neem toothpaster:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a while and don&#x27;t really see any cnahge in the cleanliness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use many toothpastes but have incorporated this in my daily routine of brushing.  Really like this and will not run out of it, will reorder.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND MY DENTAL APPOINTMENTS HAVE IMPROVED SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING NEEM.  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> I love the way this tootpaste tastes. It foams a little, and makes brushing feel very CLEAN. I do believe my teeth are also whiter sice I&#x27;ve started using.</li>
    <li> Really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it  a five yet. I&#x27;ll let you know after I use it a while longer. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Available in local stores, neem (Azadirachta indica) is one of the Ayurvedic preventive medicines. Both the bark and leaves are used in different medicinal preparations and in cuisine. The tree is planted in India in temple premises and homes because it is believed that it sends out a calming chemical/energy and will keep the atmosphere and the humans and animals calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste is made with leaves/juice of leaves and other ingredients that help keep gum and teeth strong. Neem possesses an astringent quality that helps healing.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is very good.  I packed away all my colgate and crest products and even gave away unopened tubes I had in my closet away.  I will never go back to the other brands after experiencing Neem.  My breath stays fresh and is under control.  Everyone should have this in thier closet.</li>
