<li> , I&#x27;m not sure it takes any shorter of a time to curl hair then a regular curling iron.</li>
<li> So I was pretty skeptical aboutthis RC curling machine</li>
<li> Only negative aspect is the one I received it</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not sure the curls come out as well as it would if I had shorter hair.</li>
<li> bought the wrong color, my baby easily left her little dirty print on it.well, my mistake.</li>
<li> But difficult for me to use it.</li>
<li> Wrap the hair from the base of the curling iron to the tip in a downward direction.</li>
