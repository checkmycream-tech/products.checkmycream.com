<li> Wow fast delivery&lt;br /</li>
<li> so I threw them in the trash and bought a new razor.  </li>
<li> the only problem is the price but other than that i love it</li>
<li> First of all, how can they be dull and yet cut while shaving?  </li>
<li> Also, the first shave is always the best--but I wonder how these blades dull after one shave.  </li>
<li> My husband has had the single injector razor for around 35 years now, He bought a couple dozen of these blades from CVS when they had them on sale to discontinue them, about the only place to get these now is online.  </li>
<li> The razor blades wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my beard.  </li>
<li> I love the injector razor, and it&#x27;s getting a little difficult to get quality razors.  </li>
<li> These replacment razors are hard to find where I live so getting them here saved me time and travel.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the part that pushes the steel blade into the injector razor is made of aluminium, which means the steel blade bends it, and after five or six times, I have to use an external apparatus to move the blade into the injector blade holder.  </li>
<li> Consider this product family for the entery tool into wet shaving, by allowing your child to  experiment  with lathering  (soap/cream &amp; brush) and and the injector blade razor.</li>
<li> They work just like the other brands</li>
<li> /&gt;Sussie Due</li>
<li> not worth anything.</li>
<li> barber injector blades not worth the money.  </li>
<li> do recommend them to other users!</li>
<li> could have a little longer shave life--seems to dull up in 7 days usage-----a</li>
<li> TOO DULL AFTER ONE USE.</li>
<li> blades dull and cuts skin while shaving.  </li>
<li> not a good product.</li>
<li> They were dull and useless</li>
<li> I decided to give Barber a try based on other five-star reviews and wanted to see for myself why some people were giving these a bad review.  </li>
<li> Sorry</li>

    <li> Great for old way to shave</li>
    <li> The product(which there is a dwindling supply of and therefore hard to find) was of good quality and delivered from the vendor within the stated time frame. I will continue to use Amazon as a resource in the future.</li>
    <li> No bad for price, made in USA.</li>
    <li> not a good product. company need to discontinue product. blades dull and cuts skin while shaving.  need refund for product. not worth anything.</li>
    <li> These razor blades are the best because you can wash out the hair that gets in the razor those new type with all the blades you can not get in between the blades.</li>
    <li> I AM HAPPY TO FIND THIS KIND OF RAZOR BLADES FOR MY OLD RAZOR I HAVE. THEY WERE SHIPPED FAST I WILL BUY FROM THEM AGAIN. THANKS  &lt;&gt;(*!*)&lt;&gt;(^!^)&lt;&gt;(~!~)&lt;&gt;AOK&lt;&gt;AOK</li>
    <li> Husband loves them - so glad to be able to get them - he still has and uses his OLD injector razor.</li>
    <li> These replacment razors are hard to find where I live so getting them here saved me time and travel. They work just like the other brands so if your thinking about getting them I say go for it!</li>
    <li> These are really good and my husband relaxes now that he can order the blades for a razor he has used for years.</li>
    <li> very strong and durabule this is my first time using this blade for my Mr. C straight razor the only problem is the price but other than that i love it</li>

    <li> While it looks like a great deal on injector blades, the $9.95 postage is a flat-out ripoff.  It actually makes them more expensive than buying the Schick brand-name blades.  Do not buy from vendors that pull this type of stuff.</li>
    <li> Good blade sharp.The injector case works well will order again.</li>
    <li> Very smooth for a single blade</li>
    <li> Persona blades are a good substitute for Schick blades</li>
    <li> best price and what a steal on the internet.  Will be buying some more of these.</li>
    <li> barber injector blades not worth the money.  TOO DULL AFTER ONE USE. SHICK BLADES WERE GOOD FOR SEVERAL  SHAVES.</li>
    <li> I am using these injector blades for the first time, and they appear to last much longer than the original Shick blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend them to other users!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND SAID &amp;#34;IT WORKS PERFECTLY, THANK YOU&amp;#34;. WE WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN! SO GLAD WE FOUND YOU TO BUY THIS CAUSE THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE THEM HERE IN WY.</li>
    <li> Blades are as good as any I ever used. They give a very close shave and no burning sensation.</li>
    <li> Pefect, can&#x27;t find &#x27;em in the store any more</li>
    <li> This type of razor blade is all that I have ever usedfor many years, and they have done a  great job for me all this time, thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> i like the ease of getting this product and the use of it will tell friends about these razor blades</li>
    <li> The razor blades wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to cut my beard.  They were dull and useless so I threw them in the trash and bought a new razor.  Sorry but I will never buy anything else from you as both of my experiences with you were bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Randy Oplinger</li>
    <li> Good shave, as expected.</li>
    <li> But my husband says they are not bad for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sussie Due</li>
    <li> Great price, great service.</li>
    <li> These were perfect and just as the seller listed. I received my Shick injector shaver during Vietnam.  With all of the plastic, throw away, disposable razors with two to five additional blades, I prefer this razor.  Until I located these blades on Amazon, I had to rely on an independent pharmacy located in Canada to obtain replacement blades.  This dealer is a godsend.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Wow fast delivery&lt;br /&gt; Blades work just fine , easy to load , very close shave !</li>
    <li> Been looking allover finally I found them well done thanks</li>
    <li> The product was as good as or better than simular products. The product produced a smooth shave and I did not have any adverse reactions to the product.</li>
    <li> product should work fine.  I was happy to be able to find these blades since I was not able to find them in any local stores</li>
    <li> I love the injector razor, and it&#x27;s getting a little difficult to get quality razors.  Barber does quality and does it right.  My only complaint is that the part that pushes the steel blade into the injector razor is made of aluminium, which means the steel blade bends it, and after five or six times, I have to use an external apparatus to move the blade into the injector blade holder.  Not easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the blade is quality.</li>
    <li> These are good blades.  I was using Schick blades-the platinum plus and super chromium.  I decided to give Barber a try based on other five-star reviews and wanted to see for myself why some people were giving these a bad review.  First of all, how can they be dull and yet cut while shaving?  Also, the first shave is always the best--but I wonder how these blades dull after one shave.  Anyway, I am very satisfied with Barber blades and they out-perform the Schick blades I have been using.  I am able to shave every other day and still look good.  I am getting about 8 shaves before I feel the need to change.  I also am happy with MayaBeauty that fill my orders. They are fast and with 20 blades/dispenser economical too.  I recommend these blades to anyone looking for quality at a low price.</li>
    <li> Good blades, sharp, nice price</li>
    <li> The razor this blade goes in is good for your child&#x27;s first &#x27;&#x27;real&#x27;&#x27; razor.  This razor family and its blades can not stand up to a beard that  can shred a cotton ball 24hrs after a close shave.  Consider this product family for the entery tool into wet shaving, by allowing your child to  experiment  with lathering  (soap/cream &amp; brush) and and the injector blade razor.</li>
