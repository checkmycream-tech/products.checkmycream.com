<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product works on toe nail fungus</li>
    <li> I hand an allergic reaction on belly and this cream helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Very healthy for the skin. I noticed the smoothness and radiance in days.</li>
    <li> Clearing up my Perioral Dermatitis.  I&#x27;ve been detoxing and changing how I live and treat my body, I broke out with this junk, third time in my life.  It IS caused by an acidic, toxic body that has candida (yeast overgrowth).  I will triumph though.  Using sulphur face soap and this and its clearing it up now.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Coach Carla&lt;br /&gt;www.feelingrevived.com</li>
    <li> Great for athletes foot. Cleared in about 2 days</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get by the smell, so I&#x27;m sending it back</li>
    <li> works really well, takes the redness out</li>
    <li> I use it for the cracked corners of my mouth nothing else I tried worked.  Also using it on brown spots on the face to lighten them.</li>
    <li> Its too early for me to give an honest review right NOW. I&#x27;d love to continue use before doing a genuine review!!!!</li>
    <li> I HAD BARROWED SOME CREAM FROM A FRIEND; LIKED IT SO  MUCH, I BOUGHT SOME.  I USED IT ON SOME PLACES ON MY DOG THAT DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANY HAIR.  IT HAS HEALED IT ENOUGH AND THE HAIR IS COMING BACK.  INSTEAD OF BEING ROUGH AND PRONE TO BLEEDING; IT HAS HEALED AND VERY SOFT.  IT IS THE ONLY THING I HAVE USED IT ON SO FAR.  I LIKE IT THAT THE HAIR IS GROWING BACK.  I KNOW I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.  I AM A HAPPY CAMPER WITH MY CREAM.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  SANDRA OWSLEY</li>
    <li> I like it and use it daily.  Looks like it is working!</li>
    <li> Doctor said it was good for toe nail fungus.  All I experienced was oily [probably ruined] socks and bed sheets. Would not waste my money on it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Healed my athlete&#x27;s foot when nothing else seemed to work. Also great for my dry elbows.</li>
    <li> The product is not effective as it is being advertised. Haven&#x27;t done any good so far. Instead of the procedure to apply the product the package was full of Merchandises.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over a month with no improvement.  I had high hopes, since a friend recommended it.  Sad to say, I am disappointed.  I was using it for widespread eczema which had progressed far beyond an itchy rash.  I kept the jar in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for oral care, but note it will make your teeth highly sensitive so only use it every three or four days. Ozone is well known for it&#x27;s astonishing power to heal any skin problems. Clears everything right up be it bacterial, fungal or viral. This has no additional perfume so smells STRONGLY of ozone, even a day later. If you are going to use this product on your face, I suggest you get one of the scented versions. This company makes a whole line of ozone imbued oils. I chose unscented olive oil because I wanted to use it orally. I was astonished and delighted when I noticed not only were my gums healthier but the deep stains on my teeth that not even my periodontist could remove are slowly but steadily coming off my teeth with no damage to them. I found it easiest to apply the oil on clean teeth with a dry manual toothbrush. You use less but get more even coverage than simply rubbing it into your gums with a finger. As an aside many years ago I saw medically processed ozone gas used on the gangrene infected amputation site of a diabetic&#x27;s big toe. I think this ozone imbued oil will probably work well for diabetes caused sores on the feet and legs. I have not had a chance to test that idea out yet but will be encouraging a diabetic in the family to try it. At the very least it will cause no harm. I will post more once I have tried this stuff on stubborn diabetic sores.</li>
    <li> I have used this on a itchy detox rash and it works! After 2 days no more itching and the bumps and redness are almost totally gone! Nothing else has worked this well. I am amazed at how fast I have had results.  Also a scar that has been on my neck for over a year has softened considerably. It has also lightened some spider veins on my leg!</li>
    <li> Works great to remove blemishes!</li>
    <li> I purchased some of this Ozonated Olive Oil, and applied it to the inside of my nose where I had been having persistent irritations for many months. I was afraid it might be pre-cancerous. However, after applying the oil at bed time, I woke the next day with the irritation gone. And after a day or two, if it did come back I simply applied a tad more of the oil and it went away. I did this routine for about a month and eventually whatever it was cleared up. Now I only use it maybe once or twice a month.  Side Note. I also had some other company&#x27;s oil delivered at the same time, but it did not have the solidity that thisPur03 has so I don&#x27;t use the other brand.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you couldn&#x27;t eat this. I thought it was something you could eat. :( Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the page clearly enough. But anyway, I&#x27;ll try it on rashes and stuff, but I really wanted this for internal use. If anyone knows of a seller that makes ozonated oil you can eat, please let me know! It arrived with its ice pack melted. I&#x27;m not sure if that matters. The oil was still solid. And I&#x27;m keeping it in the fridge anyway. It smells really bad, but who cares -- you have to put up with such things for health sometimes.</li>
    <li> I love Pur03 Ozonated Olive Oil and will use it forever!  I have tried many kinds of skin care products and this one works the best by far.  I have uneven skin tone, and old acne scaring.  I noticed a slight change using this once and the quality of my skin just improves as I use it daily. I leave a light layer on my face overnight and the smell does go away.  Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I give it a thumbs up! It is fast acting on clearing up bug bites &amp;moisturizing skin, just as it claims.</li>
    <li> This can be used on skin, teeth, inflammations, bug bites, etc. It is a great moisturizer for skin, and helps keeps my gums healthy. It also seems to whiten teeth. Another great surprise is how good it&#x27;s been for my pets. I use it on hot spots on my dog, and massage it into gums and teeth of both my cats and dogs to keep their breath beautiful and their teeth healthy. Excellent product. I will never be without Ozonated Olive Oil again. I will make sure to have it when I travel as well. Can be used for any moisturizing, analgesic, microbe-fighting, etc., needs that come up. Kind of an all-in-one product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this on my skin and it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with ozonated (olive) oil and so it is difficult to say if this one is the best. There is no standard for ozonation (in grams and such) but this ozoil knocked off my athlete&#x27;s foot in three days after once-daily evening applications. I use it once every three days now, but only as a maintenance and never really seeing signs of it coming back. I also love ozoil because I discontinued a preparation that I considered too chemical (prescription stuff) and with a shrug watched the skin between toes peeling, even with daily fresh socks. My toes now look like they were some 20 years ago, a truly nice feeling.</li>
    <li> nice product - smells strongly of ozone and is easy to apply at room temp..</li>
    <li> Was not the miracle cream I&#x27;d expected.</li>
    <li> Stubborn nail infection [3+ years], bought this stuff and nail started to pink up after 2 weeks of twice-daily use.  If I slack off for 2 days it starts to regress so I&#x27;m going to keep it up for a full 6 months after it&#x27;s totally healed.  These people posting the smell is bad are just plain ignorant and have done NO research whatever.  IT SMELLS LIKE OZONE WHICH IT IS SUPPOSED TO SMELL LIKE!!!!</li>
    <li> The cream is  good but the smell is not good, so when I try to put in my face or my kids faces is very difficult to keep it</li>
    <li> I tried this to compare to another Ozone creme I was impressed with. Thought that the glass jar was a good idea. Unfortunately, shipping method is so slow that ice pack can&#x27;t keep it cold for the trip esp in summer. Perhaps that affected the product. I  believe I am getting better results with Ozene and will return to that product on next purchase</li>
    <li> I LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell *funny*.  I wrote and asked them about the smell to make sure mine was not rancid. They very kindly responded that since it *is* oxygenated, it is rancid (oxygen + oil-yep ---&amp;#62; *duh* self.....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it now for about two weeks and my skin has never felt better.  I add a bit of orange essential oil in the morning and some Lavender eo in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me... it is worth it!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just received the Ozonated Olive Oil, and applied it to my infected gum, and it has relieved the pain. It was recommended to me by my Holistic Dentist, until I could get in to see him. This is beyond my expectations. The Best, Truthful</li>
    <li> Great product... my girlfriend had a bad chemical burn on her face and this product cleared it up quick with no scarring. I also use it on my 5 year old&#x27;s bug bites and she loves it... great product from a great company. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This has cured my athletes foot even from the nail! I have had several times where it tried to come back but one or two applications knocks it out! It also works well as an anti-fungal for babies creases. The redness and smell is gone from the baby creases the next day! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Speeds up healing of cuts not nothing I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and the price is affordable compared to some other brands I will order again in the future</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been absolutely fantastic!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I first used it when my brother had an ekzema on his foot because of diabetes and his skin was healed.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on cuts, on my nails, pimples, insect bites  and whenever I have a gynaecological infection.&lt;br /&gt;I love it !</li>
    <li> I did not see any results with this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.  It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is actually my secret natural skin care product for smoothing out fine lines, especially around the eyes. I recommend keeping it in the fridge and then take it out to set at room temperature for about 10 minutes before using. I use just a couple dabs on my face at night before bed, as well as on any minor scrapes or abrasions I may get on my body for fast scar free healing. This is also great for grooming my Pug&#x27;s wrinkles. Great product, good packaging in actually glass - not BPA plastic, and a very reputable company. Gina &#x27;The Veggie Goddess\\&quot; Matthews...vegetarian/vegan blogger and author.</li>
    <li> My eyes got redness from sun exposure. I usually use Alo Vera gel but gave a chance to Ozone, hoping for even fast\better recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually burn for 20 minutes (Aloe Vera gel usually itch for 5 minutes top), I couldn&#x27;t bare it anymore so I had to wash. The skin seemed even redish than prior applying, and the burn feeling was painful.. Don&#x27;t use in on the eye area.</li>
    <li> I had been trying to get rid of toe nail fungus which I acquired at a Martial Arts place for YEARS and NOTHING worked. I read that this product works as an antibacterial and anti fungal agent and tried it. I put it on the affected nails twice a day and the toe nail fungus was GONE WITHIN 2 WEEKS. I recommend this product to everyone now and have heard people using it as a preventative, such as after going to a public pool or -shower or even after getting a pedicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also told my pedicurist to recommend it to her clients.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Did not perform as I expected based on other reviews. Find it interesting how this product performs well with some and poorly( as in my case) with others. Bought it in hopes of alleviating a rash I was experiencing. It did not work for me.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Received in great condition!</li>
    <li> The only thing that I&#x27;ve found that works on stubborn blemishes.  Takes a while...but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* have since found that a colloidal silver gel is more effective...though I will still use this.  Forget the triple-antibiotic topicals as found in drug stores.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed. Used it in my mouth on A tooth infection daily for a few weeks without much of any results. The flavor wasn&#x27;t good at all. Had much more success with ozone oil provided by my dentist. Personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand at least.</li>
    <li> Very effective on healing. Definitely can smell the ozone in the oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I began experiencing itchy feet and was concerned I had contracted athletes foot from trying on a pair of shoes at a thrift store. My itching has ceased upon using the oil for a week and I&#x27;m very happy with this ozonated oil. It&#x27;s rich, opaque and feels really nice as if you know it&#x27;s going to work. It does possess a slight odor from the ozone however this doesn&#x27;t bother me because I know how wonderful the product is now. I have read about all the different types of ozonated oils they create on their website. I found the sunflower ozonated oil seems to be best for use as a facial night cream so I&#x27;m going to use it as such after I finish my olive oil jar. Certain humans on this earth are bright, creative, conscious, intelligent beings. They are the ones creating products which truly help us unlike Western medicine and the general populace all whom are largely ignorant. Thank you PurO3! Oh and they even offer a frequent buyer plan which I hope to sign up for soon on their website! :o)</li>
    <li> \\&quot;My favorite tool might be the Butler soft picks... It&#x27;s just a little tool that I can dip in the ozonated oil and put in between my teeth. You can put it anywhere there&#x27;s a plaque. It pretty much melts the plaque off.\\&quot;  Carol Vander Stoep, author of [[ASIN:B009WZEDEI Mouth Matters; Healthy Mouth, Healthy Body: How Your Mouth Ages Your Body and What YOU Can do About It]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some few years I have been researching ozone dentistry and trying to locate a dentist who actually incorporates that in her/ his practice. After seeing \\&quot;Dr. Mercola Interviews Carol Vander Stoep about Dental Hygiene\\&quot; on youtube and learning about Ms Vander Stoep&#x27;s book, her website, and her incorporation of Ozonated Olive Oil in her patients&#x27; dental care, I became hopeful once again that Ozonated Olive Oil would be offered on amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, here Ozonated Olive Oil is offered, and it is what I had hoped it would be. It is as the amazon.com descriptive states. It is fully ozonated and is a semisolid substance, a salve. I have seen what others would pretend to be ozonated olive oil but nothing more than a liquid, smelly ooze of dubious content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PurO3 is professionally packaged in cobalt-blue glass jar and not in a plastic container where petrochemicals and other unwanted ingredients will leach into the product. (I understand a producer looking out for the bottom line, but I wish MORE manufacturers would be conscious of the consumer&#x27;s health and go back to using glass containers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to incorporate this ozonated olive oil into my home teeth care. Also, I appreciate Ms. Vander Stoep&#x27;s website - mouthmattersbook com - and her listing of dentists who practice ozone dentistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The only way dentistry will change is by patients asking for better alternatives.\\&quot; Dr Joseph Mercola&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    <li> no change in my new scars on my face. Chizuko de Queiroz(Richard&#x27;s spouse)</li>
    <li> Great for my dogs skin. Great for my skin.</li>
    <li> very good, as advertised</li>
    <li> Good product! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Arrived well packaged with small ice pack to keep it cold. However, did not help my eczema or my aunt&#x27;s anal fissure. The strong odor is also really unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This stuff smelled so bad it literally made me gag.  I also could not see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I started to use with my gum too. The flavour it&#x27;s ok for me, but I suggest to get the peppermint flavour if you need strictly for your gum.  [[ASIN:B00E3FBWVO PurO3 Tooth and Gum Support with Ozonated Olive Oil (With Peppermint)]]</li>
    <li> Again- another outstanding product- I use the olive oil on my hands, for marks- and for my face. Pro company all the way. Just saw another \\&quot;wanna be\\&quot; on another site using \\&quot;ozone\\&quot; into a base of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil with Orange essential oil! Not these guys! I also use it as a hair treatment twice a week really makes my hair thicker feeling and looking and stopped the scalp itch, was awesome for my Dad&#x27;s dandruff- and for his roseaca. He has VERY sensitive skin- and this is another winner</li>
    <li> still in process ofseeing if it makes a difference. i use it on my teeth and gums for general maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;it is convenient and non-messy.</li>
    <li> Love most products I get through amazon, but must say this is not among them.  Ordered this product to rid myself of moles on the strength of recommendation from Dr. Bob Marshall on his nutrition radio show.  Applied this to one at bedtime and taped over, as recommended.  Couldn&#x27;t tolerate the odor, which actually seemed to beleaguer my lungs.  Kept at it anyway for several nights hoping the mole would dry up and fall off as mentioned.  No luck.  Anyone interested in a gently used product?</li>
    <li> i had bought to see if it would help my acne, but tried it for several weeks with no improvements.</li>
    <li> This is one of, if not the best purchase I have ever made.  It cleared up my acne, erased acne scars, completely cleared my daughters dermatitis, works great for diaper rash.  Im sure its great for other things but I highly suggest this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother who has undergone several fillings, extractions and gum surgeries.  It has helped her manage her recovery.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for small cuts or dry spots. If you use too much too often it can have the reverse affect and make the area dry. It has that &amp;#34;ozonated&amp;#34; smell that isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Sped up healing on a severe turf injury. 2 oz goes a long way. Value is good considering it helps heal your skin.</li>
    <li> This  PurO3 Fully Ozonated Olive Oil - 2 oz products made my skin  feel soft  and fresh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  PurO3 Fully Ozonated Olive Oil - 2 oz  is just a little to expensive but it does works good on your skin</li>
    <li> Feb 2015: I was a little skeptical to be honest, but have been using ozonated olive oil on my athletes foot for the last 2-3 weeks and it has cleared up. Over the last 4-6 months I had used  a couple of different creams from the podiatrist, but they both irritated my skin and made it worse. Also tried Gentian Violet (messy) and Povidone Iodine sticks to no avail. I used a different product (O2-Zap), but basically the same ingredient. Amazing that this stuff actually works... :-)  This seems to be a little cheaper than the product I bought  Update June 2015 - So far so good Amazing - The Athletes foot infection has not returned. Still clear after ~ 4 months. I haven&#x27;t had to use my Ozonated Olive oil since the initial treatment. Funny thing is my wife works at a Podiatrists Office as an MA, but most of the Doctors scoff at this treatment and are not interested in it&#x27;s benefit.</li>
    <li> This is very high quality skin salve. The ozone smell is prevalent, and smelling it on my skin elevates my MOOD and sense of calm! There are lots of claims of skin improvement; I have only used one jar, and have not noticed any yet.</li>
    <li> I went right through it- it helped with healing and scars.</li>
    <li> I thought this was just what I needed, but after a short time, where I would put it made me break out worse and I was raw and sore.</li>
    <li> Helps clear toenail fungus.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Easy delivery.</li>
    <li> works well for many skin irritations.</li>
    <li> Good for all dry skin and lips.</li>
    <li> The smell is all ozone and smells clean to me.  If this stuff is full of ozone/oxygen should be good, too soon to tell.  Its all the oxygen in this oil that does the magic, and its not an oil any more its like a paste, same consistancy as vasoline maybe even thicker.  I&#x27;m a believer in oxygen products.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, and believe it is a healing oil (salve.)</li>
    <li> Used it on my shingles area, applying each day. So easy to apply and felt good to use as it is so natural. Am sure it has helped with the healing.&lt;br /&gt;Am also using it on a couple of dry patches on face (sun exposure) and it has helped. Have started to use some on my little toe nails which have had a tendency towards showing some fungus signs.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> it softens skin and is effective against toenail fungus</li>
    <li> This product is wounderful. I had a ganglion cyst on my wrist and I used the PurO3 for approx 4 evenings. I massaged i my wrist and wrapped it with a plastic wrap for the 4 nights. The cyst was gone be the 5th day. I recommend this oint very much.</li>
