      <li>MAYBE  GETTING MORE</li>
      <li>All the screws cone with it and easy to replace.</li>
      <li>easy to install.</li>
      <li>Great price, quick delivery, included new screws and washers.</li>
      <li>But again, the blades work just as good as when the clippers were brand new.</li>
      <li>After I changed the blade the clippers worked as good as new.  </li>
      <li>None the less, once I got them replaced on my clippers, they were great!</li>
      <li>Most definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>The blades themselves are great, though not an exact replica of the blades on my old Designer.</li>
      <li>These are carbon steel blades, and will eventually oxidize no matter how you clean and oil them, FYI.</li>
      <li>We use the clippers for home use ,it is an old pair of clippers that still works great with a new set blades.</li>
      <li>Very smooth action and close, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to select the proper fitting blades for your model.</li>
      <li>Make sure to pay attention when removing your old blades as the install instructions are lacking.  </li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable, even with shipping.  </li>
      <li>Shipped fast too!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>If this is your first time, you might want to get out the manual for your clipper before you remove anything.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you tighten down all screws first!</li>
      <li>My husbands clipper blades were so old that I could barely find a model number on the clippers, they were the original blades.  </li>
      <li>Could maybe be a little sharper, but a huge improvement over the 15 year old original blade.</li>
      <li>These blades extend the life of my classic Wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>And I was finally able to cut hair without having to repeatedly going over the same spot several times.</li>
      <li>They perform like new after 15 years.</li>
      <li>Now I remember what my trimmer was like when it was new.</li>
      <li>Breathed new life into my Wahl clippers.</li>
      <li>cause my clippers are old!  </li>
      <li>not the same quality as the original parts, replacements should be the same quality as the original but its not so its a waste of money, just buy a new clipper all together</li>
      <li>They are super sharp, and cut fantastically.</li>
      <li>I bought these clippers because my old clippers had rusted over and were no longer usable.</li>
      <li>Used professionally.  </li>
      <li>fixed my old clippers</li>
      <li>My old bottom blades do not have holes in them, however this doesn&#x27;t affect anything while in use.</li>
      <li>Overall, solid OEM blades that saved me from buying new clippers.</li>
      <li>The new bushings are much taller, and therefore, the screws that hold them in a bit longer--again, not a huge deal.</li>
      <li>The clippers were sharp and not only came with the screws but came with the washers that go on the left and right holes.  </li>
      <li>Also, if your clippers are buzzing too much, adjust the larger black philips shaped screw on the side of the clippers.</li>

    <li> Works great. Make sure to pay attention when removing your old blades as the install instructions are lacking.  This is the replacement for several models. If this is your first time, you might want to get out the manual for your clipper before you remove anything.  But again, the blades work just as good as when the clippers were brand new.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed my last ones lasted 4 years if you keep them cleaned with the solution that goes in the charger stand your blades last longer!!!</li>
    <li> I should have changed the trimmer blades sooner.  Now I remember what my trimmer was like when it was new.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly, very satisfied.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> fixed my old clippers</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used my designer clippers in years so I decided to change the blades.  After I changed the blade the clippers worked as good as new.  Make sure you oil the blades after you install them.</li>
    <li> We use the clippers for home use ,it is an old pair of clippers that still works great with a new set blades. The new blades fit perfect and the suplier is good to deal with.</li>
    <li> The blades themselves are great, though not an exact replica of the blades on my old Designer. My old bottom blades do not have holes in them, however this doesn&#x27;t affect anything while in use. They are super sharp, and cut fantastically. It appears the bushings and outer screws are a bit different than the originals. The new bushings are much taller, and therefore, the screws that hold them in a bit longer--again, not a huge deal. These are carbon steel blades, and will eventually oxidize no matter how you clean and oil them, FYI. Overall, solid OEM blades that saved me from buying new clippers. Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> great price.  top quality</li>
    <li> Good price  Good quality</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Could maybe be a little sharper, but a huge improvement over the 15 year old original blade. Most definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I  MAYBE  GETTING MORE</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery, included new screws and washers. Saved me a trip to the over priced beauty supply, so it gets a thumbs up from this hermit.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. All the screws cone with it and easy to replace.</li>
    <li> i order it like 2 weeks a go and it say it was coming in 2 days but never got it i don&#x27;t like it and i want it or i want my money back.</li>
    <li> they fit my wahl perfect!  I was afraid, cause my clippers are old!  I am very happy, I would order them again.</li>
    <li> very good blade.  easy to install.</li>
    <li> Just as seller described. Excellent experience.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought that my Wahl Designer clipper came with blades there weren&#x27;t as tapered to a point as these.  However, when I got them and looked at them side-by-side, they were identical.  I installed these anyways and they do cut better--I guess these blades do get dull after a while, even when meticulously oiled after every use.  The price was very reasonable, even with shipping.  I love my clipper!!!</li>
