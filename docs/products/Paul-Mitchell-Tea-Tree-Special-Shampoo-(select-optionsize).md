      <li>I have been using this for many years.</li>
      <li>Noone makes a better tea tree shampoo</li>

      <li>and I fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>and I love the minty tea-tree smell of it.</li>

      <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo is a refreshing burst on the scalp.  </li>
      <li>And if you order it via Amazon, you will be very pleased with how fast it arrives.       </li>
      <li>I have fine, non-oily hair and</li>
      <li>: The salon shampoo was FAR superior</li>
      <li>I originally purchase it since my daughter had lice and used a safer way to get rid of them.</li>
      <li>/lather up like the original.</li>
      <li>This shampoo can also be used as a body wash if you want a tingly clean feeling all over.</li>
      <li>Makes the scalp tingle and, of course, gets my hair squeeky clean.</li>
      <li>The salon stuff had a better tingle, it created a much thicker lather, rinsed cleaner, and left my hair with more body.</li>
      <li>this shampoo makes my hair feels smooth and soft without using a conditioner.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell brand remains consistent over the years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree Special Shampoo for many years alternating with other shampoos.</li>
      <li>and I am certain I have been had.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a large pump size and have refilled it with this 16.9 ounce bottle.</li>
      <li>It was pretty decent shampoo</li>
      <li>This size container is a good size for a connected single, or couple because it lasts long enough to ensure you fell like you got a good value, but not so long that the ingredients begin to separate.  </li>
      <li>The primary scent of the stuff from the salon is peppermint with a background tea tree oil scent (a much nicer smell overall).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The primary scent of the shampoo from Amazon is tea tree oil (sort of similar to Pine-Sol).  </li>
      <li>I have very oily hair</li>
      <li>After a couple weeks using this shampoo, the condition was much improved.  </li>
      <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t work well at all, the real stuff which I had bought from a salon years ago, works very well.</li>
      <li>It makes your scalp tingle a bit, and can be a little drying so make sure to use a conditioner with it</li>
      <li>I thought it was normal</li>
      <li>(I have to wash my hair everyday if I live in a place with 60F or higher) and I use this shampoo as a deep clean once a week.     </li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist after I complained about dry itchy scalp that I had experienced for several years.  </li>
      <li>Wow, what a difference.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is mild enough for daily use yet strong enough to be used in small quantities.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has any kind of sensitivity to other shampoos, or has dry scalp, or anything at all going on with other brands.  </li>
      <li>It slightly helped a little bit, but we mostly used this on my hair (Male)</li>
      <li>Since I had seen my dermatologist several times about dry itchy scalp and had tried several prescription remedies that did not help, I was pleasantly surprised that this &amp;#34;off the shelf&amp;#34; product worked so well.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and other shampoos make me break out.  </li>
      <li>I give the counterfeit shampoo two stars because it wasn&#x27;t bad, but the real Paul Mitchell shampoo is so much better</li>

<li> Only gripe is its expensive, but what isn&#x27;t from Paul Mitchell?</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product, I guess to tell the difference between the fake and real bottle is by the color of the bottle, matte green is the real stuff, and the glossy bottle is the Amazon/knockoff.</li>

<li> I had tried all kinds from expensive to non-expensive.  </li>
<li> So sad.</li>
<li> disappointed</li>

    <li> This shampoo smells neat and is very good for my scalp, which flakes and peels - since I have been using this shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with flaking or peeling at all. It makes your scalp tingle a bit, and can be a little drying so make sure to use a conditioner with it - don&#x27;t worry if your hair is damaged though, it isn&#x27;t TOO drying - my hair is bleached within an inch of its life, and I can still use this without damaging it further. I just make sure to use a rich conditioner afterward. This shampoo can also be used as a body wash if you want a tingly clean feeling all over. Peppermint oil has cleared up my complexion as well as my scalp. And you get a nice sized bottle for the price. You only need to use about a quarter sized dollop so this bottle will last you a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years. I have very oily hair (I have to wash my hair everyday if I live in a place with 60F or higher) and I use this shampoo as a deep clean once a week.     it have a mint smell (to my hubby it smells like medicine &#x3D;p) but for me it&#x27;s refreshing in the morning and it leaves a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; feeling in the scalp. very nice.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s shampoo for years. I was introduced to it by my hair dresser and I fell in love with it.  Makes the scalp tingle and, of course, gets my hair squeeky clean. I am happy to recommend it to anyone.And if you order it via Amazon, you will be very pleased with how fast it arrives.       http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R&#x3D;2SN4SR6BKYFHF&amp;C&#x3D;17ZSPKFDHLVQV&amp;H&#x3D;V7IH8QAF3DSWISA5NX1SZ7ZIPVGA&amp;T&#x3D;C&amp;U&#x3D;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2Fcreate-review%2Fref%3Dpe_6680_20553630_cm_cr_ec_add_1_h_c20553630%3Fie%3DUTF8%26nodeID%3D%26asin%3DB0006ZEVU4%26customerID%3DAEYPGOSWXRH49</li>

This stuff doesn&#x27;t work well at all, the real stuff which I had bought from a salon years ago, works very well. It is pricy, and does work when you buy the real one, but this fake stuff was awful and I feel ripped off since I could have easily gotten another shampoo (with conditioner) for much less money than this stuff. Everyone do yourself the favor, buy it from a salon.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shampoo.  Great feeling the tingle from the mint and tea tree in this shampoo.  Excellent for the hair and the scalp.  Although it does have a medicinal smell from the tea tree oil, it does not linger around after you rinse it out.  I would recommend this to anyone that has any kind of sensitivity to other shampoos, or has dry scalp, or anything at all going on with other brands.  I have very sensitive skin, and other shampoos make me break out.  If you think a zit on your nose hurts, try one on your scalp.  This solves the problem and ends those breakouts with ease.</li>
    <li> This is not the same bottle that came to my house. The picture is false advertising. I received the glossy one that is a knock-off version that doesn&#x27;t tingle/lather up like the original. So sad. I love the original.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my grandson. He loves it. It works great.</li>
    <li> This Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo works great. It is kind of pricey but it works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best...best...best.  I was having problems finding a shampoo that didn&#x27;t make my scalp itch and breakout in red splotches.  I had tried all kinds from expensive to non-expensive.  Some seemed to work for a few shampoos, and then not.  I started researching, and found lots of reviews about Tea Tree essential oil and mint helping scalp issues.  This product has both of these.  So I gave it a try, and I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months.  I love it!!!  It&#x27;s a prayer answered for something that would ease my scalp itching...other products that I&#x27;d tried left my scalp burning and itching so badly, I would literally scratch sores on my scalp.  I find this shampoo to be soothing and cooling to my skin.  I lather the shampoo and let it stay on my scalp for a few minutes before rinsing, and repeat if needed.  The cool tingle is amazing, so much better than burning &amp; itching.  Also, when acne spots pop out on my forehead, I let the shampoo cover it for a few minutes; it soothes and cools the skin, and helps my skin heal faster. A wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I like the tingly scalp sensation. I don&#x27;t know if this stuff actually possesses any medicinal quality to control scalp itch. I&#x27;m hoping that, with regular use, it does.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry scalp and this shampoo has let me move from using medicated shampoo every day to only needing the medicated shampoo 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree Special Shampoo for many years alternating with other shampoos. I tend to have a dry, itchy scalp but using this tea tree shampoo a couple of times per week takes care of it. The scent is pleasant rather than medicinal as with some tea tree or therapeutic shampoos.  I&#x27;ve gotten my elderly father to using it now, too, for all the same reasons. I ordered a large pump size and have refilled it with this 16.9 ounce bottle.</li>
    <li> satisfactory and enjoyable use</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo is a refreshing burst on the scalp.  The shampoo is mild enough for daily use yet strong enough to be used in small quantities. This size container is a good size for a connected single, or couple because it lasts long enough to ensure you fell like you got a good value, but not so long that the ingredients begin to separate.  Paul Mitchell brand remains consistent over the years.</li>
    <li> oooo that tingling sensation... I like the way it smells and feel and you only need a little to do the job!</li>
    <li> I personally like this shampoo a lot. I originally purchase it since my daughter had lice and used a safer way to get rid of them. It slightly helped a little bit, but we mostly used this on my hair (Male) Makes you feel refresh and helps me with razor burns from showing up on the next day. Smells great as well. Only gripe is its expensive, but what isn&#x27;t from Paul Mitchell?</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t help at all! My scalp is getting dry , it&#x27;s horrible , at the first I thought it was normal And I continued till 15 days and it was worse so I stopped :( disappointed</li>
    <li> Noone makes a better tea tree shampoo then Paul Mitchell....</li>
    <li> Based on the Amazon reviews, I decided to try this Paul Mitchell shampoo.  It was pretty decent shampoo and I liked the tingle.  I had used about 1/3 of the bottle when I saw the same shampoo on sale at a salon.  It was a good price so I got another bottle.  It looked like the same stuff (same bottle, same shampoo color &amp; consistency) but what made me suspicious was the difference in smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary scent of the shampoo from Amazon is tea tree oil (sort of similar to Pine-Sol).  The primary scent of the stuff from the salon is peppermint with a background tea tree oil scent (a much nicer smell overall).  Then I used the salon stuff to wash my hair.  Wow, what a difference.  The salon stuff had a better tingle, it created a much thicker lather, rinsed cleaner, and left my hair with more body. Over the next four days, I tested my theory by washing my hair with the Amazon-bought shampoo one day and the salon-bought shampoo the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULT: The salon shampoo was FAR superior and I am certain I have been had.  I give the counterfeit shampoo two stars because it wasn&#x27;t bad, but the real Paul Mitchell shampoo is so much better and I paid for the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon, but they need to get to the bottom of this.  I am willing to donate some of my fake Paul Mitchell shampoo for testing.  Just send me an email.</li>
    <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist after I complained about dry itchy scalp that I had experienced for several years.

I have fine, non-oily hair and this shampoo makes my hair feels smooth and soft without using a conditioner. To avoid counterfeits, make sure it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot;, if they still sell the product. The bottle currently pictured is not what was sent, but rather the newer, updated bottle was sent.</li>
