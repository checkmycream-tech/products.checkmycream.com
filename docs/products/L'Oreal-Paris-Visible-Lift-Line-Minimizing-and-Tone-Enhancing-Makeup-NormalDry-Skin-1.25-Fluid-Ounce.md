<li> , it is totally unusable to me now, I turned 2 bottles upside down and put them into a small cream jar but after all day nothing drained and bottles were still almost full.</li>
<li> BUT IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
<li> then I couldn&#x27;t get the make out of the bottle as it is much too thick and should have been packed in a jar and not a bottle with the narrow neck</li>
<li> OLD-makeup was separated and thick</li>
<li> When I opened the package felt disappointed to see the product without any seal on it.</li>
<li> Wrong thing to do!!!  </li>

    <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS. I LIKE IT.. KEEP BUYING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.. GOOD PRODUCT. WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> OLD-makeup was separated and thick</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and you can&#x27;t buy it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> got my item on time and item is great</li>
    <li> This product covers well, does not aggravate skin allergies and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  This works really well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 bottles in different colors and while they were full I used it couple of times, what was in the neck of the bottle... then I couldn&#x27;t get the make out of the bottle as it is much too thick and should have been packed in a jar and not a bottle with the narrow neck, it is totally unusable to me now, I turned 2 bottles upside down and put them into a small cream jar but after all day nothing drained and bottles were still almost full.</li>
    <li> Product did not come with a seal on the cap. When I opened the package felt disappointed to see the product without any seal on it. First thoughts: does it really is a L&#x27;Oreal product or it was tampered...opened it up and it looked fine.</li>
    <li> Have used this before and was satisfied. The name of color  was changed but it seemed about the same hue.</li>
    <li> Helps to cover my darker spots and blemishes for a smoother look, yet not a heavy makeup feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and sometimes cannot find it in CVS or Walgreens.</li>
    <li> WASN&#x27;T THE BEST TEXTURE, AND SEEMED REALLY OILY. NOT FOR YOUNG SKIN. THOUGHT I COULD GET A LIFT ON MY YOUNG SKIN BUT IT WASNT WHAT I EXPECTED. MAY WORK FOR DRIER MATURE SKIN. AND IT WAS DARKER THAN I THOUGHT, ON A PINKER TINT.</li>
    <li> Still using this and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> This face makeup I have used for many years and have always been pleased with the color and the staying effect of the makeup over a long day.  I used a face powder to set my makeup and the face powder is also L&#x27;Oreal.  In this price range this is a good makeup.</li>
    <li> I typically use Lancome; however, find this a great daily alternative that is far less pricey.  It is a great for a &amp;#34;woman of a particular age&amp;#34; that wants a medium coverage.</li>
    <li> I have been using this makeup for years.  Now L&#x27;Oreal has a smaller bottle with a spray dispenser.  I like this better and is is less costly than the new style.</li>
    <li> Great price for an item I would have paid too much for at the store.</li>
    <li> This item has been replaced with an &amp;#34;update&amp;#34;.  Wrong thing to do!!!  Why replace something when it is great already.  Amazon is the only place I can still find it and know eventually they will run out of stock.  Best makeup I have ever used!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this, its the perfect color i always wear it i would definitely buy again.</li>
