      <li>Great - Myrrh is more woodsy for men, but may appeal to women remind me of log cabin outdoor person would love  .  </li>
      <li>but still nice to use with a after shower lotion</li>

      <li>Cedar is nice, too.  </li>
      <li>Good strong scent.  </li>

      <li>This soap leaves your body and face beautifully clean!  </li>
      <li>Very nice natural scent, but</li>
      <li>it is strong.</li>
      <li>This soap smells pretty good, but does not have a true frankincense and myrrh smell like castlebaths soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really sexy, sweet, woodsy scent that will work well on either a man or a woman.</li>
      <li>nice aroma.not  too much lather.</li>
      <li>I thoroughly enjoy the fragrance of this soap.</li>
      <li>The scent on this soap is fabulous and permeates througout the house.</li>
      <li>I bought a lot of these bars of soap after trying a free sample.  </li>
      <li>even though I enjoy Zums Frank and</li>
      <li>Smells great (in my opinion), feels good, lathers good (so at least 3 stars), but in the shower lasts about as long as it took you to read this review.</li>
      <li>It smells so clean.  </li>
      <li>I love the pure ingredients in ZUM frankincense and myrhh.</li>
      <li>i always keep a travel bar in my suitcase and large bar in my linen closet. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super emollient and the unique scent lingers for a while.</li>
      <li>Even if it didn&#x27;t leave my skin really nice and soft, (which it does,) I would buy it to put in my sock drawr as a sachet.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t make you feel as clean and fresh as a Zum Bar</li>
      <li>Whenever I &#x27;surprise&#x27; him with a new bar, his face lights up. :)</li>
      <li>I heard it is good for dry skin (a friend told me this).  </li>
      <li>- Thanks for free sample.    </li>
      <li>I have to start by saying that I love natural soaps and this is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>The bar is soft and needs to be replaced more frequently than most bars in the shower.  </li>
      <li>Nubian Heritage(no ,I don&#x27;t work for, am not related to, own no stock in)</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>But for the scent alone it is worth it.</li>
      <li>It has a powerful scent, so be prepared.  </li>
      <li>If you can afford it ... treat yourself to Zum&#x27;s sophisticated mysterious aroma and rich lather</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered my second bar of this fantastic soap!</li>
      <li>I bought it first on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I like this fragrance above all others and receive many complements on the smell from friends when I am hugged by them.</li>
      <li>And, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (a promise made by many commercial soap manufacturers, but fulfilled by few).</li>
      <li>BEST SOAP- (I have sensitive skin) only use clearsil soap or black soap.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin unbelievably soft and clean.</li>
      <li>This is a good quality product with the scent last through the entire bar of soap.</li>
      <li>I have used many of their fragrances, and I have been curious about Frankincense &amp; Myrrh ever since I first heard it was a gift for our baby Jesus.  </li>
      <li>It lathers really well</li>
      <li>Takes all the make up off and leaves you with fresh, soft, touchable skin.  </li>
      <li>Very concentrated, intense perfume.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend the room/body spray and oil as well!</li>
      <li>it was appreciated.</li>
      <li>Nice smell..lots of lather but didn&#x27;t last too long for the cost</li>
      <li>FOR THE FIRST TIME, HAD NO SUDSING ACTION, &amp;  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this soap and hate when I run out.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the liquid hand soap, too.</li>
      <li>Hello,  Received 1st order included two free sample slices of soap 1 - frankincense other (2) myrrh.  </li>
      <li>I AM going back to My one true Frankincense and Myrrh, at least you should give it a try if you love the smell/fragrance of Frankincense and Myrrh as I do.</li>
      <li>You can also find better pricing online if you are planning to purchase a few bars as the shipping remains the same for certain quantities.</li>
      <li>Face felt refreshing cleaner than ever hard to explain.   </li>
      <li>My husband on the other hand is not a fan of essential oils and he thinks their smell is too strong for him.</li>
      <li>The only negative is the frankincense top (dark portion) falls off easily.</li>
      <li>I was shocked to hear that he loved the smell of this soap and this is when we started fighting over it!</li>
      <li>The only drawback is the price, the bars are too small and sell for almost $5 and at the rate we go through them it is becoming a luxury...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive though.  </li>
      <li>I saw the same soap in a natural foods store for the same price</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nice aroma.not  too much lather.</li>
    <li> The scent on this soap is fabulous and permeates througout the house. It lathers up well. However, although still expensive, you can certainly find this for less money elsewhere; sorry Amazon. I just purchased a bar at my local health food store for $5.99. You can also find better pricing online if you are planning to purchase a few bars as the shipping remains the same for certain quantities.</li>
    <li> This soap is made from goat&#x27;s milk and it is so creamy and leaves my skin moisturized. The fragrance is heavenly. I saw the same soap in a natural foods store for the same price but it wasn&#x27;t in any kind of wrapper just sitting out on the shelf where anyone could pick it up and handle it. This soap from Amazon is wrapped and sealed in plastic making it much more sanitary in my opinion. I like this fragrance above all others and receive many complements on the smell from friends when I am hugged by them. You should see their startled look when they ask what I&#x27;m wearing and I tell them it is my bath soap.</li>
    <li> Smells great (in my opinion), feels good, lathers good (so at least 3 stars), but in the shower lasts about as long as it took you to read this review. At almost $5 a pop thinking I will go back to the $3 olive oil soap that lasts me a month.</li>
    <li> The Frankincense &amp; Myrrh scent is wonderful--rich, spicy, clean--and the soap lathers up very nicely. And, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (a promise made by many commercial soap manufacturers, but fulfilled by few). I&#x27;ve just ordered my second bar of this fantastic soap!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality product with the scent last through the entire bar of soap.</li>
    <li> I bought a lot of these bars of soap after trying a free sample.  I use it everyday and put the extras in my truck and around my house to act as air fresheners.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have to start by saying that I love natural soaps and this is one of my favorites. My husband on the other hand is not a fan of essential oils and he thinks their smell is too strong for him. I was shocked to hear that he loved the smell of this soap and this is when we started fighting over it! It is not drying on the skin and leaves a wonderful smell that we both love (we use Ylang Ylang and Frankinsence and Myrrh)! I have also tried other scents by this soap, but these seem to be our favorites. The only drawback is the price, the bars are too small and sell for almost $5 and at the rate we go through them it is becoming a luxury...</li>
    <li> I love the pure ingredients in ZUM frankincense and myrhh. It&#x27;s super emollient and the unique scent lingers for a while. The only negative is the frankincense top (dark portion) falls off easily. Unfortunately it&#x27;s too expensive so I switched to Nubian Heritage Coconut-Papaya and Mountain Ocean soaps. If you can afford it ... treat yourself to Zum&#x27;s sophisticated mysterious aroma and rich lather</li>
    <li> LOVE Zum soap! It leaves your skin unbelievably soft and clean. I love the Frakincense and &amp; mythe scent as well! HIGHLY recommend the room/body spray and oil as well!</li>
    <li> This soap smells pretty good, but does not have a true frankincense and myrrh smell like castlebaths soap. It does not last as long as other hand made soaps. When I would wash my face on this soap, it would leave a unpleasant after taste on my lips that you would eventually taste. Even a couple of hours after use. If you don&#x27;t plan on washing your face with this soap, then it would be good for you.</li>
    <li> I have had skin issues for my whole life, and I used to use Shea Butter whenever my skin dried out, but since I switched to Zum Bar, I have had no issues and no dryness!  The soap makes a rich lather, and the goat&#x27;s milk makes your skin soft and happy!  I have used many of their fragrances, and I have been curious about Frankincense &amp; Myrrh ever since I first heard it was a gift for our baby Jesus.  Now I know why!!!!  This is a wonderful fragrance, appropriate for either men or women.  This soap is one of life&#x27;s few truly affordable luxuries!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice natural scent, but it is strong. Soap is also a bit drying for winter. but still nice to use with a after shower lotion</li>
    <li> Used for enema. Works well, smells good.</li>
    <li> This stuff will have you, your bathroom and any place you put this stuff smelling wonderful.  I love, love, love this soap and hate when I run out.  The smell is awesome and very full.  You will not be disappointed.  The only thing is that the soap disappears quite swiftly.  Shame.  But for the scent alone it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My skin feels softer and itches less. The bar is soft and needs to be replaced more frequently than most bars in the shower.  I have found the zum bars in a local store for less.  Amazon will be my source for the other Zum Frankincense &amp; Myrrh products.</li>
    <li> This soap has become part of my Christmas celebration - I buy a bar or two around December every year.  It has a powerful scent, so be prepared.  It lathers really well (something I love) and is kind of tingly.</li>
    <li> It might just be actually? I have no idea how they create this scent, but its brilliant. Warm-spicy-comforting-fresh..all that and more. Perfect for the winters and year around and the soap is not of drying. You owe yourself to try this :)</li>
    <li> To all those ladies out there that have a hard time deciding what to get that certain man... look no further. My husband is border line in love with this soap. Whenever I &#x27;surprise&#x27; him with a new bar, his face lights up. :)</li>
    <li> I HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, FROM ANOTHER SELLER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A 2017 DATE, ON WRAPPER,&lt;br /&gt;WHICH APPEARS TO BE AN EXPIRATION DATE,&lt;br /&gt;THIS BAR OF SOAP,  USED FOR THE FIRST TIME, HAD NO SUDSING ACTION, &amp;  MINIMAL FRAGRANCE,&lt;br /&gt;UNLIKE PAST PRODUCT USAGE.</li>
    <li> Best soap in the world!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about a week now and will just say it smells fantastic! It&#x27;s a really sexy, sweet, woodsy scent that will work well on either a man or a woman. Even if it didn&#x27;t leave my skin really nice and soft, (which it does,) I would buy it to put in my sock drawr as a sachet.</li>
    <li> Zum Bar Frankincense &amp; Myrrh-3 oz.  It smells so clean.  i really love it.  It&#x27;s kind of expensive though.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Hello,  Received 1st order included two free sample slices of soap 1 - frankincense other (2) myrrh.  1st impression (did not like odor).  Opened - ??? Maybe two scents together clashed.  SMELLS Great - Myrrh is more woodsy for men, but may appeal to women remind me of log cabin outdoor person would love  .  Curious - samples instructions to use as potpourri, used frankincense to wash face.  BEST SOAP- (I have sensitive skin) only use clearsil soap or black soap.  BENEFITS - (I thought the reviews were overrated, but they are not).... Face felt refreshing cleaner than ever hard to explain.   Skin was smooth, face felt great kind of like after a mask treatment (if you have used before).   SKIN TYPE:  African American/Sensitive  SUMMARY - Thanks for free sample.    you must try this soap - Will order few bars different scents in goat milk.</li>
    <li> Good strong scent.  I heard it is good for dry skin (a friend told me this).  Great for aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> my favorite smell from zum. i always keep a travel bar in my suitcase and large bar in my linen closet. :)</li>
    <li> Use this heavenly-smelling bar in the shower and luxuriate in the wonderful scent, then apply the body lotion so you can walk around in a cloud of nirvana. Seriously, they did not pay me to write this. I highly recommend the liquid hand soap, too. Very concentrated, intense perfume. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I Like Zum&#x27;s Frankincense and Myrrh(just bought the hand and body liquid ).It does cleanse well,fresh smelling too.I bought mine from Quality Goods ect, they packaged my item extremely well,I also received two small samples of zum soap(I&#x27;m not sure which 2-they weren&#x27;t labled)however it was appreciated.I must be frank here(no pun intended) even though I enjoy Zums Frank and Myrrh&#x27;s fragrance- I feel Nubian Heritage has them beat.Nubian Heritage(no ,I don&#x27;t work for, am not related to, own no stock in) this company just a customer on amazon like you. I think it&#x27;s more of an opulent fragrance,(their blend,) TRULY CELESTIAL!! I AM going back to My one true Frankincense and Myrrh, at least you should give it a try if you love the smell/fragrance of Frankincense and Myrrh as I do.</li>
    <li> I LOVE  the scent of this bar soap!  I bought it first on Amazon.  Now I buy it in California at Raley&#x27;s/Bel Aire Supermarkets for $5.49 a bar.  I like that price better.  This soap leaves your body and face beautifully clean!  Takes all the make up off and leaves you with fresh, soft, touchable skin.  I have every scent they make.  I go through a bar or two a month--that&#x27;s why the price at Raley&#x27;s is preferable.  However, I am grateful to Amazon for introducing me to this wonderful product!  The regular bar soap or even that liquid  stuff in a bottle (DOVE, etc.) doesn&#x27;t make you feel as clean and fresh as a Zum Bar does.  I still use Dove at times because I occasionally like the deep, penetrating lotion of that product on my legs.  But I would not want to do without my Zum Bar.  I buy 20 at a time and keep them in my dresser drawers.  They serve to make my clothes smell wonderfully. Frankincense and Myrrh has always been my favorite fragranced Zum Bar--but they are all lovely. Patchouli is another favorite.  I love the freshness of the Sea Salt scent.  Cedar is nice, too.  Oh, goodness, they are  all wonderful!</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy the fragrance of this soap. Wish it lasted longer. We need a larger size.</li>
    <li> Nice smell..lots of lather but didn&#x27;t last too long for the cost</li>
