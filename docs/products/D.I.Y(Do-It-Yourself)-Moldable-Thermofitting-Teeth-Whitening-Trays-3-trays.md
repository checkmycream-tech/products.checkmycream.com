<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great tooth whitening trays... 3 in a set and I only needed 1 it molded very easily to my upper teeth and stays in so comfortably I have slept with it in my mouth (to prevent teeth grinding) and have never spit it out halfway through the night like every other mouthpiece I have tried.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t mold to your teeth very well and they shrink a lot if you leave them in the hot water too long. I ended up going to the dentist and getting proper trays made.</li>
    <li> Ok, you get what you paid for</li>
    <li> It is not even thermofitting either. It is a piece of plactice and tough.&lt;br /&gt;You probably better off to buy something that is really moldable and thermofitting. The advertise is false.</li>
    <li> If you have ever wanted to whiten your teeth and have bought a super-strong solution, then these Moldable Thermofitting Teeth trays are what is needed to aide you in receiving your beautiful smile!</li>
    <li> I bought the plus white 5 minute whitening gel without the tray so I bought this instead. I tried molding it to my teeth but when I stuck it in water one of them bent over so I couldn&#x27;t mold the shape. The other one I put in my teeth to mold the shape, but it only made a small dent. But the plus white whitening gel doesn&#x27;t require teeth molded tray so I recommend to people that use it just as a tray not for actually molding.</li>
    <li> Very cheap trays that you can use for probably a few weeks. Didn&#x27;t have high expectations so it&#x27;s all right.</li>
    <li> After being formed it has to much material in the back to properly fit and make a good fit for the mouth.</li>
    <li> The product was very, very thin and poor quality.  When biting into the plastic after it was boiled it left the worst taste in my mouth and was not long enough to go all the way to the molars.  Unable to use any of this product.  I have only received two of my requested moldable thermofitting teeth trays.  I would like a full refund from this manufacturer.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> They work for DIY teeth whitening pretty well. They seem like they are a little big. But worth the $$</li>
    <li> instructions are easy yet hard to get your form. i stop using this instead use a cotton swab. Not good.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to mold,  but they did what I needed so it was worth $1 a tray</li>
    <li> I have not used the product yet and the reason why ? This may have taken a couple of weeks to cross from China but I was amazed to find there are no instructions with the product. In fact no paperwork at all,  just the address label. Amazon this is unacceptable</li>
    <li> could not mold it well !! it is really hard!! i struggle to mold it a little! will not buy again! sorry</li>
    <li> One of these at Cvs costs $30, so it was definitely worth it.  Helps keep gel in for whitening teeth!  Not that moldable but at this price, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many reviews with no instructions how to do the trays, I did go back and read the product description and it was described.  This is how you mold trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions-PREFITTING PROCEDURE: Place one tray in your mouth placing on your upper teeth. Practice sucking the air from the tray. This is the procedure you will use when you retrieve the trays from the boiling water to contour the tray to the inside surface of your teeth. Do the same procedure with the other tray with your lower teeth.BOILING WATER: Boil a pan of water. Remove the water from the heat. Place the tray in the hot water by the tab. Leave in water for 3-4 seconds. FITTING THE TRAY:Lift the tray from the water using the tab. Quickly place the tray around the teeth and perform the same sucking procedure as practiced with the prefitting procedure. To avoid gel contact with the sensitive tissues of your mouth, take small scissorsand/or nail clippers and trim your trays on the gingival line (teeth/gum line). NOTE: This product does NOT include gel. To purchase gel please see our SmileMedic storefront.</li>
    <li> read the instructions,serve and they serve their purpose, simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only way I can use that whitening gel that is probably in the &amp;#34;people often buy this with&amp;#34; section. Without these, the gel runs into my gums and it HURTS!</li>
    <li> I bough these on one review.&lt;br /&gt;They far exceeded my expectations,&lt;br /&gt;They are thin ( I forget I have them in my teeth) easy to mold, can talk with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t get over only a buck a piece.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased 3 packs x 3 per pack&#x3D;9 pieces.</li>
    <li> I got one of the three to work properly, they are a little tricky to get perfect.  Still worth what I paid for them.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Intended to use for D.I.Y teeth whitening trays but was hesitant when I opened to package to find the product not in proper packaging. Instead, each mouth guard (3 total) came in small plastic bags, much like that of a ziploc bag. I knew I would be sanitizing them before use anyway but their lack of packaging creeped me out. Who had handled this product before I bought it and did they wear gloves? Thoughts that don&#x27;t exactly make me want to put this product in my mouth. Pressing on, I tried to mold the guards by submerging in hot water for a few seconds like you would with any mouth guard but the plastic started melting away and dissolving before I could even take it out of the water (we&#x27;re talking a mug of mildly hot water from the microwave here, not even boiling water.) With that one being unusable, I tried again, with cooler water. I got it to be pliable without really melting but it still didn&#x27;t work. I didn&#x27;t use any water on my third attempt but the plastic wasn&#x27;t soft enough to mold. Overall, I wound up throwing them away and paying a little more money for a different brand. Will be more discerning and careful when reading item descriptions next time.</li>
    <li> Not worth it, even at the low price. I wasted my money</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with my plus white teeth whitener. They worked great. I put them in boiling water since it didn&#x27;t work if it wasn&#x27;t and they fit great. They are a little thick but still for the price they are great. Oh but be carful not to put them on too fast in your mouth to mold them since I did the first time and cut my gums, my own fault. Live and learn. :)</li>
    <li> only got 2 and no instructions: (update) found instruction online seems to work ok (update) december 27th no response from company why i only got 2   instead of 3</li>
    <li> I tried the instruction, it worked but not that great.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth this much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;ll probably take a little bit to get used to working with heating these things but they work pretty well overall and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Thought trays would have been a little more retentive....but, may not have gotten the water hot enough making them easier to mold</li>
    <li> After dipping these into hot water and fitting them, they only covered just my front teeth (about from the canines forward if you&#x27;re curious). I was really looking for something that was like a whole fitting mouth tray without having to pay a dentist $250.00 or whatever they charge to mold one.    If you just want something cheap to whiten your front teeth, then this product should do the job just fine. If you are looking for something to fit over all your teeth (molars included), then you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It works well and with minimal expense and inconvenience.</li>
    <li> The easiest and the most efficient (cheapest and no timer) way to mold your own whitening trays. Included instruction says it all, warm it up and mold it to perfection as many time as you wish unless they really fit. I even did some readjustment after couple days of using them. You don&#x27;t have to cut these front tiny pieces-tags - it works more comfortable while putting trays in and out of your mouth.   Along with 5min whitening solution they work just perfectly.    :D big smile so you can see all my white teeth</li>
    <li> These items did not work for us.  They are not made of a high quality and are extremely difficult to mold even though the instructions were followed precisely.  I do not recommend these teeth trays.</li>
    <li> works as it should for whitening trays. just be careful when you are molding them. it shrinks as soon as you take it out of the water - it freaked me out a little and i made my first tray sort of crooked. but as long as you are calm and are careful. these are easy to mold. and if they are not absolutely perfect... you can put it in the hot water again and remold. it&#x27;s cheap and works fine.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. You just have to remember to take it out of the hot water almost immediatly because if you dont it turns to mush. It forms well on your teeth. I recommend</li>
    <li> The thermofitting teeth whitening trays work great.  I have whitener from my dentist but didn&#x27;t want to spend the $300 for the trays, so I decided to try these.  Had never heard of them before ordering either.. Never knew that by putting the unmolded trays in boiling water that they could then inturn be fit to your teeth.     I had to dip them in the boiling water about 4 times, to get the best fit.   And I didn&#x27;t let my water cool down for a few minutes either, just after the water breaks boil, i removed from heat, and put the trays in until I saw they became very bendable!      I recommend these very much.  The plastic material is a little bulky, but still great and fit well once you have them mastered!</li>
    <li> These trays are a total waste of your money! By buying these I was hoping to avoid a near $200 charge by my dentist for custom teeth whitening trays. These trays do not form close enough to your mouth that they would hold the whitening gel firmly against the targeted teeth. The trays fit loosely and you can&#x27;t talk while they&#x27;re in your mouth. They are cumbersome and thick and feel like what I would imagine a sports mouth guard would feel like. If you have the overnight gel these trays would be nearly impossible to keep in your mouth. They come in a pack of three and I used all three trying to get a proper fit, to no avail. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
    <li> These items just come LOOSE, stuffed into a Mailer-bubble envelope.  There was absolutely \\&quot;NO\\&quot; packaging around the mouth pieces, not even a simple ziplock baggie - nada, nothing.  That is not sterile at all.  In addition, \\&quot;NO\\&quot; instructions were enclosed to tell me how to do it!  I&#x27;m really disgusted.  I&#x27;m going to have to look on the internet to find out how to make them.  The point is \\&quot;Who does something like that??\\&quot;...Somebody very inconsiderate!!</li>
    <li> Did not include instructions as indicated they would.  Did not mold to teeth well and were not as pliable and soft as others I have tried.</li>
    <li> your going to need the 3rd tray,  Water was too hot shrunk the tray, lucky i had the other 2</li>
    <li> Let me start by writing what I did. I boiled water. As I waited, I took out a tray and tried it on. I practiced sucking the air out of it as mentioned in the instructions here in the product page. After the water started to boil, I turned off the stove and transferred the water to a pan. I immediately dipped the tray, waited for about 3-4 seconds and then placed it around my teeth. I tried to mold it as much as I could but it wasn&#x27;t enough. I repeated dipping into hot water and molding for about 5 times but I could never get a good impression. I stopped because I didn&#x27;t think it could get any better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This DIY tray is quite cheap so I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations. Nevertheless, I expected it to at least somehow follow the contours of my teeth. One of the reviewers mentioned that you should cut it around the gum-tooth border. How can I when I can&#x27;t even see where it is? The impression on the tray wasn&#x27;t enough even though I tried to reheat and remold it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to mold it, I thought that maybe it will be enough to keep the whitening gel in contact with my teeth. It looked like it did when I examined it in front of a mirror. Unfortunately, the trays were really uncomfortable. The gel I have requires 8-9 hours of use so I use them overnight. When I tried to sleep, I couldn&#x27;t close my mouth because the trays were too thick. However, if budget is a concern, this is tolerable enough. If you&#x27;re using it for a much shorter time, I think it will work too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it just depends on whether you want to shell out the extra money to get something that fits your teeth better. This does the job of keeping the gel in place but there&#x27;s no comfort whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good for the money, also if the first time molding does not come out right you can redo it again. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Instead of wasting money on these, go to Walmart and buy the football player mouth guards instead.</li>
    <li> It was my first experience with these type of trays and at first it was kind of cool to be able to &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; fit the trays. However that excitement quickly faded. I was lucky to have 3 trays because one of them became too hot and the silicon fused to itself making the piece not usable. I was able to somehow boil the other two just good enough to use. They say the piece isn&#x27;t hot but it is because there&#x27;s near boiling hot water still on the device. So I got them to fit and was excited to use the whitening gel. I did 22% Carbamide Peroxide for 30 minutes and noticed a big difference in shades. But those 30 minutes were filled with uncomfortableness! Despite the trays&#x27; slimness, they are still just too thick and clunky. It is hard to wear these for any amount of time. I had a large amount of saliva generated during that time and was worried about swallowing it due to the possible leak of the peroxide. So what does one do with all that? You can either swallow it with the peroxide, try to spit it out without losing the peroxide, or you can wad a bunch of tissue into your mouth. That is what I did and it was OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I was able to whiten my teeth(one time) but the process made me want to go to the dentist to get an actual custom tray. I will not be using these cheap-o trays again. For the money, I guess you could say its worth it. But I just don&#x27;t think its a good idea to use these because they don&#x27;t actually fit perfectly to your teeth. I did get a burnt gum from the peroxide and I wondered if it had to do with the trays being deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again and in fact am going to the dentist tomorrow to get custom trays. There are some things that it is worth it to get the real thing. For me, my teeth are precious and I want to be able to have a professionally done cleaning and whitening. I thought the cheap route would be good enough and would save the hassle but now I think it would have been better to just take the hit and goto the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me. I followed the directions, but no matter how hot the matter was, the mold did&#x27;t not even break it&#x27;s form.</li>
    <li> They worked fine after you cut them.</li>
    <li> totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> it came w/ very easy to read directions but they didn&#x27;t say anything for molding the bottom half. trust me you want to know what u r doing 1st.</li>
    <li> This item was more like a football mouthpiece than the trays I have used in the past for whitening.  They are heavy and triming is required.  They were low cost but not a great product for whitening.</li>
    <li> Unlike other buyers, the directions were wrote in just one paragraph. Boil water, put tray in for 3 seconds, put in mouth, suck out air, rinse with water and dry, Now I have 3 pieces of useless plastic and tubes of whitener I can&#x27;t use,</li>
    <li> These do not work properly, they do not conform to your mouth. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying these were the least expensive tray I could find so the fact that they came in a fold top sandwich bag that was inside a mailing envelope and dirty, I guess I can&#x27;t complain. When I took them out ( and washed them) I was surprised at the size of them. Are these for a 3 year old? They actually did fit over most of my teeth but not the last couple of back teeth. I used these for a gel for my gums, not for whitening so it did matter to me that they cover all my teeth and gums. What can I say,  you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These trays are difficult to mold into anything useful. They dissolve quickly in hot water so you have to be very fast.  I salvaged one of the three but still find it uncomfortable. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Teeth whitening trays were sent in an envelope with a piece of paper. There wasn&#x27;t any type of plastic around the trays to prevent contamination. Disgusting!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t as easy to do as I thought.  I had to put them in water 3-4 times before I got a decent fit.  After the fourth time, they stopped molding as well.  I haven&#x27;t used them with a whitening product yet, so we will see how they do with that.  They don&#x27;t get as snug of a fit as I was hoping, but we will see if they work.</li>
    <li> These molding trays aren&#x27;t the greatest but for the low price I can&#x27;t complain too much. They did their job and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product. I followed the directions and they still did not conform to my teeth. The plastic tastes really bad too... such an awful after taste. Sorry, but I do not recommend these.</li>
    <li> After using hot water to mold them to fit my teeth they worked well.  Very very odd number of trays would have liked to have a fourth but 2 were all I used.  Great item for the price!</li>
    <li> Not at all what they are supposed to be.  The directions it comes with says you begin to form them before heating them, trim, and then boil.  These are the typical ones you have to boil before you even begin to mold and are very noticable.  Jaws is a liar.</li>
    <li> Make excellent grind guards for a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> Did not know the product came from China, would not have purchased it and didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Runs a little large, but a good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I hate giving bad reviews but I have to be honest. These are flimsy and melt out of shape if you try to use hot water to conform them to your teeth. They are just badly made.</li>
    <li> I havent used them yet but they seem reasonable and they seem to be what i was looking for... i plan on using them for teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> These teeth trays work great. I just use them to brighten my smile every now and again when I feel like my theeth are looking dull because of all the coffee I drink at the office. I tried to do the heat molding (when you dip them in hot water and shape them to your teeth by biting down in them). It doesn&#x27;t really work, but for what I&#x27;m using them for they fine either way. They were so cheap too! I totally recommend this product if your looking for a simple whitening tray.</li>
    <li> Fast and reliable! I suggest everyone!</li>
    <li> they work, but they;re cheap. i use them for a gel whitening, so it works great for that</li>
    <li> Shrunk up a lot didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> First off, you should note that these do not come with instructions. So make sure you read the instructions from the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a small pan of boiling water, and holding the tab, held the tray in the water for about 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sucking air from the tray&amp;#34; worked fairly well for doing the top tray, but not as much for the bottom. I found that sucking the tray and then pressing it into my teeth with my fingers worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are re-moldable, and I actually re-dipped my top tray about three times before I felt like the fit was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The trays do run a little small, and if you have wisdom teeth that are actually visible, these won&#x27;t cover your very back teeth. I have a fairly small mouth, so these fit perfect for me, but someone with more mouth might not get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great deal for three trays.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, and not exactly professional quality, but perfect for on the budget teeth whitening. Works perfect with my whitening gel.</li>
    <li> These are just generic sport teeth guards, had I realized that to begin with I might have purchased them at a local store. They work okay.... I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth have the right contact with the trays that they need to get the full effect of the bleech.  You dip them in hot water then put them in your mouth and they shrink a little to fit your mouth, but not realy your teeth, just your mouth.  If your going to spend the $$$ on bleech, its probably a good idea to spend the $$$ on better trays than these ones.  (I ruined the first one, by putting it in boiling water for 6 seconds instead of 2-3 seconds like the directions said.  So if you do get these take the directions seriousley.  :)</li>
    <li> Moldable THERMOFITTING Teeth Whitening Trays were easy to mold. The directions are pretty easy to understand. Personal use it took a few times dipping it in very hot water, biting down hard and pressing the front against my teeth to get a nice snug fit. I also thought that the whiting system I used spread easily on the tray. Three trays came in the kit and are reusable. I rate this Moldable THERMOFITTING Teeth Whitening Trays very easy to use and rate it a 5 star item. I would recomend the trays. Shipping was fairly quick and arrived in a bubble wrap envolope with the sealed clear bag to keep the trays free of damage.</li>
    <li> i like this product very much it came earlier than i expected which i liked very much. This is a great product you guys should buy</li>
    <li> It is ok. But kind of too big for any regular set if teeth. But it does its job some how</li>
    <li> I ordered the Opalescence 35% and 3 D.I.Y trays in a package all together and while the whitening gel was as described, the trays were a great disappointment. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and from the other reviews I had read I figured that perhaps I should try it out on my own and not go by others opinion. The trays are very thick acrylic that doesn&#x27;t mold to your teeth as you would think they do, even by following step by step instructions. Very poor quality trays and not good for using with whitening gel. Playing football, perhaps. Ive decided to invest money in a professional dental trays instead.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t kknow exacactlly what to say about dental whitinging trays other than they work and provide a usuable serface for the whitinging solution.</li>
    <li> No instructions included on how to mold to your teeth. Arrived in a package with nothing except the product. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Bad, bulky, mold only temporarily, then revert back to original and fall off, that is if they hold in the first place. Not worth even the 5$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from California Dental.</li>
    <li> I received them pretty quickly. Molded just very easily, just followed the directions. Worked out great! Would defiantly order from them again.</li>
    <li> While my product arrived without directions, I am very thankful to other reviewers who posted how they did it.  I recommend reading the review where the buyer discussed boiling water, cooling water, refitting, etc.  I&#x27;ve since realized that my top tray is not the best fitting- but it was also the first tray I molded (and the good thing is that I have a 3rd to get it right).  And be sure to cut away extra plastic that will lay over your gums.  This does take some finesse and time, but definitely worth it.  These trays are somewhat bulky, but tolerable.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this- as teeth whitening has now cost me around $20 (trays and whitening stuff) as opposed to several hundred at the dentist.  Color me happy!</li>
    <li> Have used moldable trays before and loved them. These were great for the price and I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really understand how so many people where having problems with these. The only thing I can figure out is they&#x27;re doing it wrong. I personally had no trouble with these, they come with instructions but all I did was heat some water in the microwave in a cup and used that to mold them. The only suggestion I would make is that they make them a little longer because when you put them in the water they do shrink and its hard to get them perfect so they fit all of the length of your teeth and still be molded perfectly. So as far as suggesting these goes, I would get them, but be careful when you&#x27;re molding them because if the water is too hot it will shrink them.</li>
    <li> Awesome! They do the same job as a $300 dentist tray for a $3 price!</li>
    <li> I bought three due to the very reasonable price.  I wanted to cut one to fit just the area I needed and it worked great.  I&#x27;m saving the other two for later usages because I thought they&#x27;d be cheaper &amp; thinner but they turned out to be very nice quality.  I am using the five minute tube of whitener gel and don&#x27;t mind the entire procedure at all.  This made it all very simple for me.</li>
    <li> I used then to mold them into my teeth so I could use it for teeth whitening and they did the job.</li>
    <li> I guess they are ok... but they came with no instructions. Just a little package from China with three soft plastic molds, but do you place it in boiling water, warm water??? for 10 seconds, 10 min. Glad there are three so I can try to figure it out.</li>
    <li> The gaurds were really thick, which I thought was going to be a good thing.  I followed instructions but before I could put them in my mouth to mold, they folded over on themselves.  I got three in a package and don&#x27;t you know, all three got ruined when I tried to mold them.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use (to mold). I did not have to throw away any as it is easy enough to follow the instructions. After 3 seconds, it does shrink, so be sure to work fast. They are a bit clunky when you have to wear them for hours, but they are totally tolerable. Overall, I would repurchase these because they do the job and are affordable. Plus they came very fast.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend them, I&#x27;m not sure why someone would pay big money to have ones made at a dentist. They mold perfect, for a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Price was great but these things don&#x27;t mold well even if carefully following the instructions.  In this case I got what I paid for - low price, low quality.</li>
    <li> not very good to use in mouth it was just way too big and says easy to mold when warmed up...not true...wouldn&#x27;t recommend use to anyone</li>
    <li> These tooth molds never fully mold to your teeth, tried multiple times to no avail.  But all things considered the price is very low.</li>
    <li> Worked just as well as the other popular brands.</li>
    <li> he seller sent the product at the right time.  Even if the picture shows 3 trays, in the package there are only 2, so be aware of that first to make your purchase.</li>
    <li> THIS IS BAD ONE CAN NOT USE AT AL. I AM STILL THROW IT AROUND IN MY PLACE HERE NEVER TOUCH BECAUSE UNFIT INSIDE MY MOUTH OR CAN NOT USE WITH MY TEETH. THIS IS STUPID MISTAKE BUY IT WASTE MY MONEY.</li>
    <li> These trays are horrible and useless they dont conform to the teeth and melt quickly. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> These fit my mouth perfectly, and help with great teeth whitening.  I don&#x27;t use a bleach product.  I a peroxide/baking soda mixture that I make myself for much cheaper.  The peroxide/baking soda mixture doesn&#x27;t have a minty taste, but the taste is very mild.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this, especially at the price!</li>
    <li> Tried to get them to form but they&#x27;re so poorly made that dropped into hot water, they shrink like a cheap cotton tee shirt in a hot dryer.  I had to go find mouth guards at a local store.  They shrunk so much I could not get them to stretch out big enough to cover the front teeth.  There were no instructions with them, but we had something similar when I played football and followed that procedure of sinking them into boiling water for 20 to 30 seconds.  But almost immediately on hitting the water, they shrunk &amp; curled up so small, I couldn&#x27;t work with them. If you got these and haven&#x27;t fitted them yet, don&#x27;t use boiling water and don&#x27;t drop them in for more than a second or two.  Maybe that will work for you but I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> it gets the job done. I ruined the first one in the boiling water. just make sure its not in the water for too long and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
    <li> These are great teeth whitening trays for the money. Worked as described and easy to form. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for trays to hold whitening paste.</li>
    <li> I never received the product, and after letting the seller know that was told it was between me and the Post Office. Never again!!</li>
    <li> For the price, you get what you paid for..but it does the job. It was weird that it didn&#x27;t come in a sealed pack with instructions though. When I received the package it was just in the package envelope no package for the item itself. Shipping was quick.Don&#x27;t leave it in the hot water for more than a couple seconds</li>
    <li> Good price, but from China direct.  More info should be provided on the materials and polymers in these.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for 3 boil n&#x27; bite mouthpieces. Considering we have an upper set of teeth and a lower set of teeth, I wish it came in multiples of 2 (a two-pack, or four-pack maybe), but a three-pack is alright. For this price, get 6 in case you mess them up. I use these for whitening with a 20% peroxide gel, and they work well. They won&#x27;t be as good as custom, vacuum-fitted trays, but they are adequate. I wish they were more transparent. I&#x27;ve purchased from other brands before, and those ones were completely clear. These trays are slightly opaque, like frosted glass. Aside from these small nitpicks, these trays are as good as you&#x27;ll get outside of custom-trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;Boil some water in a pot or in the microwave. Remove from heat and wait until the bubbling subsides. Then, using the attached tab, dip the tray into the water, being careful not to burn yourself. Make sure the entirety of the tray is submerged. Hold for 30 seconds. Remove, shake it to cool and remove excess water. Place it in your mouth, making sure to center it with the tab. Bite down on the mouthpiece, close your lips, and suck all the air out of your mouth. Hold this for 10 seconds or so. Now open your mouth, leaving the tray in place, and use your fingers and your thumb to apply pressure to the tray in areas you feel could use a snugger fit (focus mostly around the gaps between teeth). You&#x27;ll have about 10 seconds to do this. Then carefully remove the mouthpiece and run it under cold water for 5 seconds. Put it back in and check for the fit. It it needs adjustment, place it back in the hot water and repeat the process. Once you are happy with the fit, cut off the tab. With a non-toxic pen, trace the outline of your gums. Using a pair of small, sharp scissors (or a pair of clean cuticle clippers), trim the mouthpiece along the gum-line. You will also want to make sure to cut it so that there are not sharp edges or abrupt corners. This will improve the comfort of the trays. Once you&#x27;ve finished trimming, clean the mouthpiece with soap and water to remove any leftover ink. You tray is ready for use.s. Once you&#x27;ve finished trimming, clean the mouthpiece with soap and water to remove any leftover ink. You tray is ready for use.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if they work or not , because there were no instruction on how to boil them.  I put them in boiling water too long and they melted into a ball before I even knew what happened.</li>
    <li> They took 3 weeks to arrive, so that didn&#x27;t help.  But while the description states the order contains 3 trays and directions, all I received was a small brown envelope stating it contained craft beads, and the 3 loose molds.  I tried using directions listed in other reviews, and the results were very &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; at best. The fit my teeth, mostly.  But I can&#x27;t get both trays in at once as the area near the back molars is too thick.  Spend the extra dollar or two and get some that have a reasonable ship time, directions, and better molds.</li>
    <li> These are not quality at all! I put them in hot water to help form to my teeth and they literally just fell apart! They also took almost three weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> Cheapest Mouth guards I&#x27;ve ever had. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This did not work-- first one I put in not water shrunk to nothing the other two would not conform to my teeth no matter what i did.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my daughter. They melt very quickly. We tried to get molds for her three times and never got one to work.</li>
    <li> Great item. It was easy to use with the instruction included. Will be buying more soon. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this guard for about 3 months now. I&#x27;m replacing this with another mouth guard. I find this one to be thick even after trimming.  Mine did not come with instructions. I also didn&#x27;t like that this was imported from China. I suppose for short term use it might be ok such as 15-30 minute teeth bleaching but for sleeping 8-10 hours no.</li>
    <li> This product is by its own description is D.I.Y. &amp;#34;Do it yourself&amp;#34; yet the 3 moulds were packaged in a plain clear plastic envelope, nothing more, and no instructions on how to use.&lt;br /&gt;Further, the supplier is maishikai(come2 buy) c/o harper logistics ltd Unit14,1/F Kowloon Bay Ind.Centre 15 Wang Hoi, Kowloon Bay Hong Kong. So, it seemed to me it would be a waste of time and money to try and get directions on how to use this product  by sending a letter by mail to the only known contact which seems to be a distributor.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a source for the how to use instructions I can email ?</li>
    <li> Nice product and really glad it came in a 3 pack! I got it for my sister who wanted to whiten her teeth. Really easy to do, but she dropped one in the pot and it got deformed, so good thing we had an extra!</li>
    <li> Cheap, good and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had an expensive, dentist-made set of whitening trays.  My husband bought this item and made his own.  His seem to work just as well as my more expensive set and he says they are just as comfortable.  Pretty good deal when compared to what a dentist charges.</li>
    <li> Unable to form these molds.  They are so stiff and unflexable.  Also,  they are produced in China.  i would not have bought them if I had seen them before hand.</li>
    <li> Great person to work with, quick svs.  The product is OK.  Fit isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d like it to be but they serve the purpose OK.</li>
    <li> All three melted so quickly in the hot water that they left plastic residue stuck to the bottom of the pot. What a waste of a couple dollars.</li>
    <li> These are easy to mold trays for teeth whitening products (which are often sold in drug stores without the mouth trays!) and easy to slip into your mouth with whitening solution.</li>
    <li> These are not worth buying. I put them in hot water for less than 3 min and they melted. I mean if you sanitize them without boiling water then they might work for you. They fit, but would not reach my molars. They are not very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Even though I did as the instructions stated, these are way too uncomfortable. Glad i didn&#x27;t spend too much on them.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and perfect for people who grind at night or a whitening kit</li>
    <li> Not bad at all.  Bought 2 sets, ruined 2 cause I left in the water more than 4 sec.  They&#x27;re manageable and cheap so I&amp;#34;ll just get more.</li>
    <li> They work fine.  Why there are 3, I don&#x27;t know.  It met my needs for tooth whitening trays, though.</li>
    <li> Eh they work okay. Molding the bottom row is pretty difficult to accomplish, plastic is very cheap. Good for casual use to protect teeth as a temporary night guard and custom whitening trays for whitening gel but I wouldn&#x27;t count on them for much more.</li>
    <li> Using these as my teeth whitening trays. They work great!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with the tooth bleaching kit I wasn&#x27;t extremely happy with them when you put them in the hot water they shrunk up way too much I bought them because they were inexpensive next time I think I would splurge on a little better pair</li>
    <li> These work amazing,get some! so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Eh...my whole mouth started bleeding.</li>
    <li> Easy to mode. Quick and easy</li>
    <li> These do it yourself teeth whitening mouth regular mouth trays work just fine.  Make sure you suck the air out during the molding process.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intent of using them as teeth whitening trays. They were melted and ill formed once they were received and thus rendered useless. The product came from a foreign vender so I&#x27;m not surprised with the quality since the package was probably subject to harsh temperatures along the way. I suggest just going into a store and buying your own mouth guards, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Less expensive then those sold at the pharmacies and just as good. I  Highly recommend this product, it works for grinding teeth or teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> If you need to whiten your grade school childs teeth this might be just the item, but for an adult mouth it is way to small and distorts to an unusable blob of plastic when trying to form it.  I can&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Easy to mold when following provided directions. Be careful bc they get very hot.  I use with teeth whitening.  Good price</li>
    <li> Trays are a bit thicker than I expected, but they work well. A bit tricky to mold them at first, but you get 3 so you can screw up once and still come out right.</li>
    <li> the trays do not fit at all in your mouth. there&#x27;s no instructions, came from China took a month to receive it.&lt;br /&gt;yes, they were cheap. now I know why. they are not moldable trays, that you would heat up and then press in your mouth to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never recommend this product. not worth the expense to return them either.</li>
    <li> I did not like these teeth whitening trays. I bought these because i forgot what brand that i bought last time i got whitening trays. They do not mold well and are very thick. I had to put the tray in the boiling water for longer than the instructions said because it took a long time to get them to actually mold. In addition, when they finally did mold, they were not clear, and the molding BARELY got the shape of my teeth even when i sucked the air out while i was pushing on it to mold it. I definitely will not buy these again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I found the brand that worked very well the last time i used them --&gt;  [[ASIN:B001J8PTD0 Tooth Teeth Whitening Whitener Bleaching D.I.Y. 3 Trays&amp; free tray case]]</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;form&amp;#34; even after repeatedly trying.  It would melt and sag in the hot water and it would put it into my mouth SUPERFAST (ouch) and suck, push, etc. and it wouldn&#x27;t form to my teeth.  Seemed to lose even more form after I took it out.  The end result was about what I started with (like the pic).  Also tastes toxic.  Since I am using it for remineralizing gel and not for bleach, it will be fine.</li>
    <li> Took forever and a day to receive and then did not work!!</li>
    <li> Came in a small package from Hong Kong with no instructions or even a product label. It seems a little sketchy. With plastic you can never be too careful so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be putting these in my mouth considering I don&#x27;t even know what kind of plastic it is. Scary</li>
    <li> I have a tray of my own from the dentist and have used / molded several mouth pieces in my life.  Despite following the instructions directly, the mouth pieces do not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> The cost for this product was great but you get what you pay for. Molding is not that great in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried for a little bit more money.</li>
    <li> Impossible to mold, but what do you expect for it being so cheap. First and last time. I will spend a little more and try another method.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints, molding them was easy enough, you have to put them in the boiling water then in your mouth and suck the air out, I did this twice for each one and didn&#x27;t have to use the third one provided. They aren&#x27;t as tight fitting as the ones you would get from a dentist but they work just fine for whitening.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price and so far so good using them with bleach. They were a lil difficult to mold, if the water is too hot they will shrink, but that is what is good about having 3 of them to work with !</li>
    <li> The teeth whitening trays were great. They worked perfectly as expected. They were easy to mold and use. I would recommend them to anyone.d</li>
    <li> I thought the plastic would be less bulky but it is pretty heavy in your mouth and doesn&#x27;t mold easily... Want a replacement or refund.</li>
    <li> It takes some getting used to, but it works.  Why get expensive custom trays when you can get these for much less?  They may not fit as comfortably as the custom trays, but the end result is the same from what I noticed.</li>
    <li> These are as bottom of the barrel garbage you can get, and you better hope that the first time you boil them you get the fit right. Correction, do not boil them since they&#x27;ll just melt, but don&#x27;t heat them excessively so you can get a better fit.  You can fix a bad mold, maybe twice, but not after.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, but there is no instructions how to use it</li>
    <li> For the price, theses will do just fine. I don&#x27;t need a perfect fit...if I did, I would spend more.</li>
    <li> These trays are great for whitening your teeth -- and cheap too! They are a bit awkward in the melted stage, but you can conform them well enough to fit your mouth.</li>
    <li> These were great! I left the first one in too long and melted it so it&#x27;s a good thing you get 3. The last 2 weren&#x27;t perfect shaped when I was done but in my mouth it was fine.</li>
    <li> instructions for these are not accurate should not be heated long at all or melts down to nothing so first time users she be aware the boiling time is not that long</li>
    <li> Trays are OK, better than big bulky trays you buy in drug store.  They Don&#x27;t mold to your teeth as much as expected.  But they are more streamline so you don&#x27;t waste bleach</li>
    <li> I had to order these twice. One time they melted. The second time they didn&#x27;t mold to my teeth when I bit down. They also shrink in the hot water.</li>
    <li> does the job and all it needs is very hot water and everything should be okay. overall good purchase :P</li>
    <li> I did not melted or molded the trays I used them as they are to put fluoride, toothpaste in them and sit on my teeth for a good 5-10 min. then rinse and till next week. perfect for the use I give them.</li>
    <li> The trays themselves are amazing. I needed some not so expensive trays to use with my teeth whitener and these are great. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because I was not provided instructions for use. Thankfully another reviewer had posted instructions so big thanks to that person! Hopefully others who order these will get instructions.</li>
    <li> These are great - super easy to mold.  I just microwaved a bowl of water for 3 minutes then dipped it in the water for about 15 seconds.  Make sure to suck all the air and water out.  After letting it cool off in my mouth I repeated the process twice more then dipped it in a bowl of ice water after the third time.  The material is thick and not easy to cut with scissors so I used a razor blade to trim the excess material off.  Easy cheap alternative to getting custom molded trays at the dentist.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and as advertised. Great vendor to work with. Thanks !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products like these, so I have past experience on how these are suppose to mold to your teeth.  This product doesn&#x27;t do as it claims.  the plastic doesn&#x27;t even change after you dip it in the boiling water.  I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and purchase a better product next time.</li>
    <li> These came with a horrific smell and fingerprints all over them then I placed them in hot water and the melted . Do not waste your time</li>
    <li> When i ordered these, I thought it would come with 3 pieces in case you mess one up. Well It showed up (really fast shipping, it was here in 1/5 the time it was meant to take) with only two trays. I also ordered the 44% gel at the same time and it came too. So what i did was put a coffee mug full of distilled water in the microwave and boiled it. When it boils, turn the microwave off and leave it for a few seconds and dip your tray in. Start off with one second and slowly increase the amount of time you leave it in. You can always put it in again, but once you leave it in too long its pretty much over. I would suggest putting the tray in your mouth prior to forming it and trimming off the excess material to create a better seal. And you have to be tough because as soon as you pull it out of the water its best to bite and suck the air out right away and it hurts for a second.&lt;br /&gt;Once you do everything though they work great! very satisfied with the product, not pleased with the false information on the product page.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in plastic bags without instructions or paperwork of any kind.</li>
    <li> This product came from Hong Kong in a bubble pack mailer.  Unfortunately, there&#x27;s nothing to tell me how to use it.  Reviewers have said something about heating it to soften and then mold to teeth.  Does anyone have a link to the instructions or advice (serious only) you may have?  2 stars only because no instructions.  It could go up or down from the point that I have instructions and can actually try it.</li>
    <li> It was a great deal at under $5 delivered one can not expect the world but the first of 3 wilted away in just 10 seconds in boiling water. But good to have 3 :-). One for top, bottom and one to mess up!</li>
    <li> Molds were easy to make as long as the instructions are followed.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price but it takes some effort to get them form properly</li>
    <li> It was difficult to form.  I have had better luck with other brands.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for a friend so they could use with the Day Whitening Kit and they&#x27;re pretty naff, would advise that you pay the extra and get a dentist to make a proper fitting set.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the T but they would NOT melt! (it says to \\&quot;use hot water about the same as hot coffee\\&quot;. Nothing!)&lt;br /&gt;So after 3 tries of increasing the hot water I finally BOILED water and dipped it in the hot water using a pair of pliers as not to burn myself.&lt;br /&gt;Then quickly tried to fit it to my teeth following the directions. A minute later. Not impressed. The plastic is just too thick.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily yesterday I found my PROFESSIONAL trays my dentist made that I had thought I&#x27;d lost which are so thin and fit perfectly you barely know you are wearing them.  Nope.  I would NOT recommend the DIY trays. Sorry.</li>
    <li> It does not fit into my mouth very well.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as expected. Bought these for kids to use with whitening product. They were able to mold them to teeth and they have used them several times with no problems. These are not by no means your high end molds you get at the dentist, which I have. These do work great if you mold them properly, which was very easy to do. My son had to remind his bottom mold to fit better, we reminded it about a week after the first attempt, no problems.</li>
    <li> These did not shrink to my teeth in any way after several tries.  I bought extras in case I had a problem.  Do not bother with these.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my order.  The product is a good quality and it works great for whitening.  I would recommend this.  It was shipped to me fast.</li>
    <li> Prefec sizes,  good materials, easy to mold and cut, and can be reused.  Whit no change in consistent. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for the purpose intended or even a night guard.&lt;br /&gt;A dentist version is $500, if your careful on making a tight fit it can serve an alternate purpose.</li>
    <li> works good just make sure you dont keep them in the water too long or they will melt together (obviously) but just warning you</li>
    <li> Ok this is a DIY so not perfect, but my goodness the tray is EXTREMELY bulky, makes your mouth look like a monkey mouth.  It&#x27;s like wearing a football mouth guard!  So not cute, and not very functional either</li>
    <li> I used the trays with a bleaching product I bought and it worked well. I&#x27;d reccomend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> You can use these with whitening gel also.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, just dip them in the hot water for 5 seconds and mold to your teeth. You athletes out there will remember how to do this.</li>
    <li> It took a while to receive this and when it came, I found out why!!!! It came from China. How do I know there is not harmful chemicals in there!!</li>
    <li> Works well, but melts extremely fast.</li>
    <li> I have used several of these before.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this set as a replacement for another pair of trays that I had.&lt;br /&gt;These were very hard, did NOT mold to my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;The kit included three trays, and attempts to mold all three did not work.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber is very firm, and even gritty.&lt;br /&gt;Again, having used several of these before, I was not at all impressed with these, and I will now be ordering a different brand to try to find something that is usable.</li>
    <li> These trays worked well with whitening gel, however, they were rather large and allowed some of the gel to get onto my gums - WOW! did that burn! be sure and spread a &#x27;thin&#x27; layer of gel.</li>
    <li> didnt work for my bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were too big and sat far from my actual teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wouldnt get these again</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat these for the price!  After boiling the water, I formed the first and third pair without any difficulty.  However, I left the second pair in the boiling water for probably a second too long and they shrank and shriveled up before I took them out.  Very small room for error with these, which is why I rated them a 4 star.  I made top and bottom molds of my teeth, so at least there was an extra available.  Otherwise, they seem to be working just fine as I have seen a lot of progress in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to anyone wanting to whiten their teeth as an alternative to professionally made trays.  Can&#x27;t beat the cost!</li>
    <li> If you can find them at walmart then get thm there. Im glad it came with an extra one because it&#x27;s super hard trying to mold them to your teeth. You will need to use the extra one.. Might want to buy another set... Or dont waste your money and just find better ones elsewhere. I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Bought these and they did the job.  Obviously not as good as getting proper moulding trays from dentist.  Have ordered more already.</li>
    <li> I like the clear color can see teeth through it while they are being whitened and they fit comfortably whether they are molded or not</li>
    <li> they didn&#x27;t mold to my mouth, but the did do their job in holding the whitening gel, so can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> Not bad for teeth whitening trays.  Not one of the quicker ones to melt and shape into a form-fitting tray - probably because it is thicker and hopefully more durable than some other brands.</li>
    <li> I followed the direction to a T with these but they still didn&#x27;t seem to mold all the way to my teeth. The outside is still very rigid against the inside of my mouth. For the amount of time I use them, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to order after reading some of the reviews. After reading the directions and reading what others had done wrong, I had a pretty good understanding of how to properly mold my teeth. I didn&#x27;t have to use the third one either. Not only should you suck on it, but should use your fingers to press against the gum line. I only trimmed the back molars. No problems with burns or leaks when using the 35% whitener.9*2</li>
    <li> The delivery process was faster than I expected. I am very pleased with my purchase. The trays cover a good are of the teeth and that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> i bought a whitening cream and these are perfect to use with it as well. IF i need more ill for sure buy more  :)</li>
    <li> In the picture it looks like the mouth pieces that can be molded in hot water but they do not mold at all, I let them sit in hot water for 15 minutes and they did not soften.</li>
    <li> I purchased these not for a professional fit, not for a product that is going to last 20 years. It was cheap, and it worked exactly as stated. They fit great, and they were amazingly easy to mold. If you can&#x27;t figure it out from the instructions, there are videos online. If you need whitening trays, save yourself some money and buy these!</li>
    <li> I received two, not three trays. I ordered these to use with teeth whitening gel I just got and after I placed the order, the estimated delivery time was about a month from the date I ordered them. I soon realized that it was because they were coming from China. These are trays that you are supposed to boil, put in your mouth and suck on to make them fit. China is famous for making cheap knock-offs and have far less stringent safety regulations. I do not want to put these in my mouth. If I knew they were coming from China I would have never ordered them. I didn&#x27;t expect this from an Amazon seller.</li>
    <li> Where to begin?  I gave them two stars for being cheap, but they don&#x27;t mold properly and the instructions are wrong,if you boil for as long as stated they don&#x27;t mold, if too long they turn to gel, and collapse on themselves as a sticky mess.</li>
    <li> good product, no direction to use it</li>
    <li> To stiff to mold to teeth.  You would be better off with packaged whitners</li>
    <li> 5 star is&amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t say I love moldable trays but I do like them. :)</li>
    <li> Nice to have more than I tray. I messed up on the first one, so it was nice to have extras</li>
    <li> received the trays, but no instructions.</li>
    <li> These are a little harder (stiff may be a better word) than the ones I got previously.  They must be used quickly, and I recommend a lower temperature for a longer time, rather than boiling water.  With the boiling water the thinner parts melt quick and the thicker parts stay stiff.  It made it very difficult to get a good fit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, thank you.</li>
    <li> THE WAY THIS PRODUCT IS MARKETED, IT MAKES YOU THINK THAT THE TRAYS MOLD TO YOUR TEATH ALMOST LIKE A GEL OR CLAY MOLDING. IT IS NOT THAT WAY. IT IS LOOSE AND ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT IS SOFT AS APPOSED TO THE HARD TRAYS. THEY REALLY SHOULD NOT SAY THAT IT ID MOLDABLE. THEY REALLY SHOULD JUST SAY SOFT GEL TRAYS AS OPPOSED TO THE HARD TRAYS.</li>
    <li> I am glad I got to find these.  My teeth are very important to me and I love that I don&#x27;t need to order a custom made piece to protect them when I sleep or to treat them.</li>
    <li> Unlike most of the reviews, mine is VERY positive. These do the job. Be sure to follow the directions and trim away excess pieces witha a sharp pair of scissors and you should have no problems.  Of course, at that price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything extra special, but I did well with this product. Just be sure to read the directions..(which happen to be in about 8 different languages)   :]</li>
    <li> they werent very good trays..they didn&#x27;t mold well to my teeth. i wouldnt get them again thats for sure. but then again they were very cheap</li>
    <li> You really do have to boil water for this to work. I thought steaming hot water would would, but it needs to be a literal boil. They are nice though, once you get it fit.</li>
    <li> These DIY moldable whitening trays are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Boil some water in a cup&lt;br /&gt;2. Hold the mouth guard by the top piece&lt;br /&gt;3. Submerge in hot water for 15-30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;4. Take it out and wait for it to cool for a second and put it in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;5. Create suction in order for the mold to form around your teeth&lt;br /&gt;6. Cut off the extra piece and use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deduct 1 star because it took over a month to receive the mouth trays. I use them to keep the whitening gel away from the rest of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and what you see is what you get!</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t mold very easily, or at least didn&#x27;t mold as completely as I was hoping. But for the job, they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant because of the rating, but the ratings that WERE good convinced me to try them out. They are cheap so even if it didnt work out I wouldnt be upset. Today I finally got around to using them. Boiled water and used tongs to dip them in, pulled it out and blew on it for 2 secs, touched it to make sure it was okay, and then put on my teeth. Bit down a little, but also sucked the air out. (make sure you dont bite too hard, you could definitely bite through them while they&#x27;re pliable.) They molded really well! I was pleasantly surprised. You can keep dipping them in and remolding until you&#x27;re happy. Great product.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality.... far from it.&lt;br /&gt;But check out that price tag!&lt;br /&gt;They work well enough for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for more (while keeping my bank account).</li>
    <li> Considering I paid 65 dollars last time to have 2 molds made with the gel included, this was a nice savings.  Make sure you order at least 35% teeth whitening strength.</li>
    <li> This is nothing fancy, but they serve their purpose! For the price, I definitely can&#x27;t complain. The dentist told me that I \\&quot;need a night guard, like, yesterday\\&quot; due to my teeth grinding/clenching. I couldn&#x27;t afford the huge price tag, but these are helping in the meantime!</li>
    <li> No instructions unless you can read Chinese.</li>
    <li> Pass this up and get the real deal from your dentist. The gel trays do not form tight enough to your teeth, and the gel leaks before it has a chance to truly whiten teeth.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding? For the price these are great! Just because some people are inept with the use of their hands doesn&#x27;t mean that the trays don&#x27;t work. Read the title \\&quot;D.I.Y.\\&quot; That means that you are responsible for the fit of the trays - No, a dentist won&#x27;t show up at your house, they won&#x27;t fit right out of the package. You have to make them fit. What ever it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fitted mine several times before they were what I wanted. The instructions don&#x27;t explicitly say that you can re-heat them and re-fit them but you can. I compared them to trays that my wife paid for from her dentist ~ $150 a piece! That&#x27;s $300 for both. These are far better than the whitening strips - They do what they say; they hold the gel on your teeth. Stop whining. If you want \\&quot;better\\&quot; trays be prepared to pay.</li>
    <li> These trays work very well with the Opalescence whitening gel.  They are very easy to form as long as you do not leave them in the hot water to long - 15 seconds is all you need.</li>
    <li> when it arrived, it arrived in a shipping bubbled bag and thats it, nothing else.. wasn&#x27;t too happy about that but whatever. They are very big so what I recommend doing is boiling some water and dipping them in, For two reasons , one to sanitize them and two, to mold your teeth. I dipped them in the boiling water , waited a few seconds and stuck them in my mouth to start molding,(you can redip till you have your desired mold).Once I had my desired mold, (wasnt perfect but it was the closest I could get them), I ran them under cold water to lock in the mold. when I used them it was okay, nothing really major, thy&#x27;re still alittle big so its alittle hard keeping them stuck on your teeth. They are okay for beginners and for someone just looking for some cheap molds but if you whiten your teeth alot, I suggest getting some better ones, not these.</li>
    <li> I tried the products that are sold to prevent nightly teeth grinding.  They were WAY too thick &amp; cumbersome!!!!  This product may not last as long, but it is comfortable at night &amp; inexpensive.</li>
    <li> if I had known I was ordering directly from China I would have splurged for a more expensive item. a warning that it would take 2 months to arrive would be helpful.</li>
    <li> I used hot water to mold these trays.  The trays shrunk after a few seconds on the hot water, after making sure that it&#x27;s not too hot for molding  - I proceeded and got my trays properly indented with my teeth.  The trays also cools very fast, so you got to work fast with molding too. I trimmed the excess by using a regular scissor.  It did not change shape after cooling off.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Result was a twisted, warped, unmolded, unusable product. Tried to contact seller for a refund but never heard back.</li>
    <li> These are just about long enough to cover the teeth that are visible when I smile very widely (which I do a lot, especially when I&#x27;m excited).&lt;br /&gt;I had to cut them at the front on both top and bottom, but that is as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I found it hard to mold the first tray for top and the first tray for the bottom teeth, the soft material was hard to manipulate on the back of the tray, they sort of flipped the edges inwards so they did not fit snugly to the teeth in the sides.&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t bought 2 sets of these, I would have had only one useful tray to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> I use these molds for my teeth whitening serum and these trays work perfectly and gets the job done. Now for the whitening serum I use, I find it to be junk lol.</li>
    <li> I bought these Thermoplastic whitening trays after getting a mouth guard with a whitening product that was just so uncomfortable for me! I figured, for the price I really couldn&#x27;t go wrong! Now I should mention that not everyone will like these, and given the price nobody should be expecting dentist-quality trays. That said, for the few dollars I spent, I&#x27;m rather pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;- No plastic taste&lt;br /&gt;- Moldable to your mouth&lt;br /&gt;- Only need hot water to mold&lt;br /&gt;- Three trays in case you mess one up&lt;br /&gt;- Great for teeth whitening gels&lt;br /&gt;- Allow you to talk (with difficult), drink water and spit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Tricky to get just right&lt;br /&gt;- Even after trimming, amount of plastic between molars is uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m not displeased. After having left one tray in the boiling water for too long (shrank to an unusable size) I managed to get the other two pretty much to a usable mold for my teeth. Since I am using these for whitening, they are only in about 20 minutes every day or two, so I don&#x27;t mind that they are a little uncomfortable! For the price I paid (compared to the $125 I was quoted by a dentist) I would definitely buy these again. Due to the lack of viable alternatives on the market, I would recommend them with some reservation - keep your expectations low and I think you might be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> i mean for the price  you really cant beat it. its pretty good, does the job. i would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> These things are actually very good.  Custom fitting them to your mouth can be a challenge at first (which I think is why they come in  a 3 pack). As others have stated, you are best to only dip these for about 2-3 seconds and then fit them.  Do this multiple times until you get the fit you want.  I got mine to the point where I think they are perfect, but I did ruin one in the process. These are so inexpensive that it would be wise to order extra.  The product itself is very good, the challenge is getting them molded without making a mistake.  It seems that if this product folds over on itself and cools, you will not get it apart.  If you soak these things in boiling water for 5-10 seconds like the directions say, they will be too difficult to handle without folding.  I would (and probably will) buy these again.</li>
    <li> Not that bad, they work well enough. People seem to trash talk theses saying they are horrible. They are not, just not great. Work perfectly fine hold whiting gel.  Do not the expect a tray that will come as close as a whiting strip. Theses are cheap, not professional grade. You get what you pay for if you want it nice and perfect go to a dentist and pay him $300-$400. If you want good brought at a good price tag you live found them.</li>
    <li> sent in a timely manner. No issues with product</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed at a great price!</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Very poor fit.  Barely molded at all.</li>
    <li> So, these are for those who are crafty and can improvise.  If that&#x27;s not you, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for Good Fit&lt;br /&gt;1) There are 3 trays for a reason.  Use the first one to test out your methods so your last 2 can be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;2) Err on the short side for dipping duration.  If it&#x27;s wilting, probably already too late.  I used a larger set of water so I dipped for about 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3) Be sure to suck air out so it presses against your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;4) I repeated this process 3-4 times per tray.</li>
    <li> they were a gift but I do not know if they have been used</li>
    <li> I thought these would be a little more pliable.  They were hard and big and made me gag.  I don&#x27;t think I would recommend them because I don&#x27;t like gagging.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to have found the whitening trays.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could have been better is that there were no instructions included&lt;br /&gt;telling the purchaser how to mold the trays.  They are moldable, but I don&#x27;t know how&lt;br /&gt;to mold them and there were no instructions included.</li>
    <li> Works but very uncomfortable. Didn&#x27;t come with any instructions. Make sure u don&#x27;t leave in the boiling water to long.</li>
    <li> Not worth a dollar!  Horrible product!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what dentists use.</li>
    <li> you might have to boil more than once but they work and are great with 5 minute whitening gel. also comes with an extra just incase</li>
    <li> Shipped from China - didn&#x27;t mention that in the \\&quot;detailed seller info\\&quot;.  No instructions or any other material in the package.  Thank you to you who have bought these as I will use your instructions.  I will post with an update once they&#x27;ve been through the molding process. So far the only possitive is the packaging was the most adequate size I&#x27;ve ever seen...abut 5 x 5 inches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Why is it I&#x27;ve lived for almost 50 years and still have to be reminded that \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;*  (rhetorical question)</li>
    <li> wouldnot order these again not impressed with the product at all. i will spend the money to get the ones from my detist so they actually fit with no fussing around</li>
    <li> Very Quick Delivery. Easy to use and very flexible to mold a very close form of your teeth to apply whiteners or even to wear and a night guard for teeth grinding.</li>
    <li> Be careful with the heating process. They will shrink into unusable pieces if in the heat too long. Luckily they send 3 for that reason I think</li>
    <li> I have gotten whitening trays from the dentist, but ended up ruining one of them so I wanted to try this.  They worked alright.  They are too thick to get a good form to your mouth.  Overall I think they worked.</li>
    <li> they are ok if you want to use them as a bite guard. I would not recommend for teeth whitening, since it is almost impossible to make them fit super well. this can lead to having whitener on your gums, which can lead to a chemical burn.</li>
    <li> good price, and functional product, does what it says and the value is good for the price. would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Ordered and paid for three but only received two and did not receive an invoice or instructions. I want to know what type of material these trays are made.  I had no idea this product was from China.</li>
    <li> Have tried several times to get these to form around my teeth and nothing has worked! Ended up throwing them out. Luckily I didn&#x27;t spend too much on them.</li>
    <li> These are junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I threw them in the trash. They are definitely NOT moldable.</li>
    <li> Real small and srinks smaller. They only sent me 1/2 of my order but that&#x27;s OK because I tossed them in the garbage anyway. Only buy if your under 5 ft tall or less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I went through with this purchase! I read all of the reviews and people saying how they didn&#x27;t fit and we&#x27;re having difficulty molding them and not to buy, but since they were so cheap I decided to purchase them and I&#x27;m so happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not going to fit perfect in your mouth as they are not dentist made, but they work and get the job done and you&#x27;re not having to spend hundreds of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the instructions and boil them for about 8 seconds and then put in your mouth and suck the air out and press on them to mold to your teeth for about 10-15 seconds. Then remove from your mouth and repeat.  I did this about 3-4 times before getting mine to mold the way that I wanted them too. Then with a pair of scissors cut a little of the top unnecessary part off, that is on your gums, as you don&#x27;t want the whitening product to go on your gums.</li>
    <li> Worked great and didn&#x27;t need the third!  I love they send an extra just in case you mess up though!</li>
    <li> They work as described. How can you go wrong with simple mouth pieces.</li>
    <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get used to at first but eventually grasped the moldable pieces easily. Instructions could have been better.</li>
    <li> I tried again and again to get any kind of mold out of these trays. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I am use to using strips so it takes a little time to get use to the trays.  But you cant beat the price and I am going to order trays for the whole family.</li>
    <li> These DIY moldable trays are of terrible quality. They did not come with instructions on how to mold them and once submerged in boiling water they melted and became a blob of rubbery goo. Will never purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> had a little problem but finally got the right fit. It worked well and very happy when combined with the teeth whitening syringes.</li>
    <li> I put the in hot water and they totally shriveled up.  Couldn&#x27;t use them!</li>
    <li> Got these today after almost 2 weeks so they are not helping me in doing my whitening when I needed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made of soft rubber and you can kinda mold them by dipping in hot water and couting upto 5 and putting them on your teeth and sucking on them.....an repeat till a good fit. Careful to not overdo it :) They do mold to your teeth. The only drawback is they are thicker than desirable. I got some from the mall whitening guys and they were made of thin rubber that was so much easier to keep in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price they are good buy !</li>
    <li> It claims to be moldable, however, I melted the first tray attempting to heat it to suitable temperature.  I did not heat the next for quite as long and so it did not form to my teeth at all.  I attempted to warm it again found there was not good temperature that allowed it to become pliable without melting completely.  However, despite this it still functioned well enough to for my uses.  Odd that the package comes with 3 trays, almost like buying 3 socks.</li>
    <li> I received the trays today, and they didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.  Also, the three trays were together in a little plastic bag, don&#x27;t know if they are kept sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays themselves are the thicker than I thought they would be. I read some reviews where people said the trays melted into mush when they boiled them, but I had the opposite result. I boiled the water and dipped the tray in, then followed the forming instructions but the tray didn&#x27;t really change shape. I dipped and re-dipped about 7 times and they still aren&#x27;t really any different, so they aren&#x27;t really \\&quot;custom\\&quot;. They are good enough for now I guess, but I have a feeling I will have to re-whiten do to the fact that the tray isn&#x27;t formed enough to my teeth.</li>
    <li> thought i was getting a STEAL! turns out these things will not get hot enough to become moldable OR they will become hot enough and melt into itself. these could definitely not be used for whitening and they leave a huge gap between your teeth and the guard. i think these are possibly fighting mouth guards but nonetheless they are not worth the 3 dollars and your time.</li>
    <li> I tried softening two at once, and they totally melted into each other, useless. The directions should warn you about that!</li>
    <li> I needed additional trays for a tooh whitening system my wife and I bought,  Just what i needed at a decent price.</li>
    <li> There were no instructions on how to use this product. I will try to find this somewhere else. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The manual was very precise, but I found it a little hard to get the perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - it&#x27;s doing the job. I just put a film of &amp;#34;5 plus&amp;#34; on my teeth with a cotton swab and then attach the trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to cut of a lot because they were too large for my mouth.</li>
    <li> Instructions are very good and must be followed exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Great tray!  They worked great on the first try.  I ordered two sets for my Husband and I and didn&#x27;t have to use them all because they worked so good on the first try.</li>
    <li> Decent quality given the price. If you are looking to whiten your teeth, as I was, then this product will get the job done.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t mold as they should, all of mine were defective and none hold whitening gel well. :/</li>
    <li> If you are willing to wait for this product to come in the mail, it is worth it.  Dip the plastic guards in boiling water for a few seconds and place it on your teeth and close your mouth and suck it in.  Bravo and so cheap!</li>
    <li> I wanted to these to work as well as you&#x27;re probably hoping they will. However, they&#x27;re awful. I was glad it was a three pack after I messed up the first one, but even after I did the last two right (held them in boiling water for 4 seconds and bit down, etc) they were still extremely uncomfortable and left me drooling while they were in. YUCK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on them ;)</li>
    <li> I read the instructions and warnings carefully, and followed them to the letter.  I got a warped try that shrunk before I could try to mold it, and a couple that molded...but not really.  The material sucks.  Go to walmart and get one of their night guards that you can form by the same process...those things actually work and are a thicker plastic.  These ones absolutely suck no matter how many times you try to do it exactly right.  And they are too small.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were cheap. Well i got what i paid for in my opinion. First they shrunk up like crazy on me only after maybe 4-5 seconds in the water. So flimsy and thin i would never try these again. I suggest not wasting your money and buying a higher quality product.</li>
    <li> Product is fine, but no instructions were included. Beats spending $400 or more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these are supposed to work, but they don&#x27;t. Played with them for awhile but tossed them. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> If your looking to whiten with gel, no need to mold the trays to your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I tried, ended up melting one of the three, but after using the remaining to (unmolded) for several weeks, I&#x27;ve realized you really don&#x27;t need to mold them! They work just fine as generic trays!</li>
    <li> Comfortable trays at a great price, fast service.</li>
    <li> Took a VERY long time to ship and just was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I recommend if you want a quality product then go to the dentist.</li>
    <li> Works great, molded to my teeth very well, has been used quite a few times and is still in great condition. A must have for a teeth whitening fanatic.</li>
    <li> Came missing one of the trays.</li>
    <li> It seems to do its job.</li>
