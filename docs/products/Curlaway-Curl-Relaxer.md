      <li>The product being great was the icing on the cake!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>mo2XPXMKL4FINVI]]I thought a video would be best to show how pleased I was with this product.</li>
      <li>I would have given this product 5 stars if it had had a pleasant odor;</li>
      <li>But doesn&#x27;t kill the smell as good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used relaxers for years and none of them smelled good.</li>
      <li>and I  was very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing as a relaxer and does not damage your hair.  </li>
      <li>The roller brush is the kind that retains heat.</li>
      <li>it honestly made me want to gag!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>no longer have any breakage, my hair is bouncy, looks great, full of body and has grown faster than ever before.</li>
      <li>the smell is quite strong but was easy to get rid of i just put a good smelling conditioner on hair after product.</li>
      <li>Like most of you I was looking for an alternative to chemical relaxers but because of the smell and hazzard(chemical can get on your pillow case and in your eyes).</li>
      <li>I will continue using it mostly as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>i see so many comments about the smell but to me it reminds me of salt and vinegar potato chips, with an added apple scent.</li>
      <li>If used properly, this product is great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I wanted to straighten it</li>
      <li>and I love the results I&#x27;m seeing.   </li>
      <li>Just make sure you comb it through evenly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I know the directions say that you may need to use the product many times to get the desired outcome but that&#x27;s asking alot to me.  </li>
      <li>But better than sulfur smell.</li>
      <li>Okay thats the background</li>
      <li>I was more than pleased by this product.</li>
      <li>To keep parting my hair and applying that more than 2 times is just not happening.</li>
      <li>I love my curls</li>
      <li>you use twice a week and was out I wouldn&#x27;t do more than that because your hair will break off.</li>
      <li>I want t first start off by saying EXCELLENT Customer Service and FAST delivery.</li>
      <li>other than having to pay twice for shipping its ok quality if you want to use this relaxer for managebility then its perfect for you</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the results so far.  </li>
      <li>The product is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;2) use STRONG smelling shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Now i noticed my curls are slightly looser,but the best part is</li>
      <li>i have smooth curls not frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I kind of like the product because it does its job by loosening some of my kinks and turning them into waves but it is a very gradual process.</li>
      <li>I use a dab of the product as a part of my nighttime hair regimen (using it with a dab of light hair lotion to cut balance out the smell) and this works wonders.  </li>
      <li>You cannot go anywhere with this product in your hair unless you enjoy people moving away from you to avoid the odor.</li>
      <li>I have used Curlaway for about a year now and my hair is absolutely fabulous.</li>
      <li>I must say the smell is like apples and vinegar, but honestly the smell is no worse than a hair salon or a relaxer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very humid today and my hair hasn&#x27;t frizzed!!!</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t quite achieved the straight look, but I have noticed my hair is smoother and more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Be sure not to use too much...</li>
      <li>I have been using Curlaway (formerly Curlex) for about 18 months with good results.  </li>
      <li>I didnt give it five stars because i will have to see the full results after a couple of months.</li>
      <li>It is super curly --nothing can get the curl out--not even a relaxer.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect drastic changes quickly</li>
      <li>But, the smell doesn&#x27;t last on your hair for more than a couple of hours at most.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong but I really didnt mind it</li>
      <li>more like fish and salt&amp; vinegar chips (and maybe a little more, but i refused to use it again once i closed the bottle lol)</li>
      <li>i will probably buy it again if i don&#x27;t find a way to perfect another natural stretching option through using coconut milk and lime or bentonite clay i hear there are quite a few ways out there</li>
      <li>I Undertand that it takes several applications to eventually \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; out your hair, but honestly,I don&#x27;t think I have that kind of patience</li>
      <li>I thought It was more like a natural product</li>
      <li>After the success I have had with this product, I may never use a chemical relaxer on my hair again.  </li>
      <li>and honestly they work the same.</li>
      <li>and it grows pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item because I was looking for something to use to extend the time between relaxers and the price seem right.  </li>
      <li>I like how it&#x27;s non-alkaline because my hair is a bit too porous right now</li>
      <li>I thought what did I have to lose, right?  </li>
      <li>, I am a person who takes impeccable care of my hair after co-washing I DC, detangle in the shower, follow up with a leave in and seal with my own mix of shea butter and olive oil , I follow this with a rollerset and hood dryer dry to half and air</li>
      <li>My goal is to get my hair back healthy.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t be sure if it actually straightened, so wont&#x27; be trying it again.</li>
      <li>FIrst off i had to repay shipping when the package arrived at my house.</li>
      <li>It DOES smell funny, sort of like vinegar</li>
      <li>i dont care how much you decide to put as a shipping price, but when i want an unsavory product sent back, i should be able to right ?</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a waste of my money and more important my time.  </li>
      <li>I bought this first from walgreens, and when I used it it seem to very gradually loosen my hair.</li>
      <li>good buy if you can get past  the vinegar smell.</li>
      <li>definetly slicked them down nicely, the grapeseed oil does help to soften the hair.</li>
      <li>I was immediately able to see a major difference in my hair, my hair looked professionally done after blow drying alone.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I sometimes just leave it as a leave-in, even though that&#x27;s probably less effective.</li>
      <li>This stuff made my hair sooooo dry and brittle that I have lost more than 2 inches of hair(bra</li>
      <li>I let my hair air dry, I just love it.  </li>
      <li>spoon of pure vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>I used the ponytail technique to pull my hair straight</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You dont have to wear your hair straight with this</li>
      <li>It also may make your hair seem greasy if you use too much.</li>
      <li>and my hair was very unmanageable.      </li>
      <li>Again I did not follow the directions to get my hair straight because that&#x27;s not what I wanted to do.  </li>
      <li>and I wanted to buy a product that would give me the option to use my hair straight sometimes.</li>
      <li>I have really kinky curls</li>
      <li>The smell was absolutely terrible(like amonia and vinegar)it smelled toxic.</li>
      <li>Hair must be pulled straight during both the application and the drying process or it just flops.  </li>
      <li>I really want this to work.</li>
      <li>I knew it was real.</li>
      <li>straight.</li>
      <li>I wore it overnight with a scarf on and the smell really kept me up.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only purchased the product once. i see so many comments about the smell but to me it reminds me of salt and vinegar potato chips, with an added apple scent. the jar seemed to last me forever. i think i did about 8 overnight treatments, and i would add it to my roots and brush back definetly slicked them down nicely, the grapeseed oil does help to soften the hair. i&#x27;ve gone to their website and notice they said to use velcro rollers to help with the stretching overnight, and that it should also be pulled while drying. i think it works at least you could use it like a detangler definetly helped me while i was transitioning. i will probably buy it again if i don&#x27;t find a way to perfect another natural stretching option through using coconut milk and lime or bentonite clay i hear there are quite a few ways out there so i&#x27;m just exploring other options rather than giving up and buying the $20 jar again. $20 can buy a heck of alot of coconut and limes</li>
    <li> I must say before ordering this product I read both negative and positive review on this Amazon board. Because the reviews were mostly positive, I convinced myself I could deal with the unpleasant smell of this product, afterall I&#x27;ve used relaxers for years and none of them smelled good. but regular relaxers don&#x27;t need to stay on for 8 hours or overnight as recommended on the jar. The smell was absolutely terrible(like amonia and vinegar)it smelled toxic. I persited and applied it to my hair  and even kept it in overnight. I found it impossible to fall asleep the fumes gave me the worst headache.     I followed the directions and it did work, it loosened the curls and  there was little to no hair loss after washing the product out. I Undertand that it takes several applications to eventually \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; out your hair, but honestly,I don&#x27;t think I have that kind of patience and I can&#x27;t deal with the smell(Seriously it&#x27;s that bad). It says This product can be used on children, I do not recommend that. Like most of you I was looking for an alternative to chemical relaxers but because of the smell and hazzard(chemical can get on your pillow case and in your eyes). I think you are better off using a chemical relaxer until something better comes along, unfortunately this is not it.</li>
    <li> This product contains a known eye irritant which might be forgivable if the product did not have to remain in the hair a minimum of 3 hrs. This would also be forgivable if it had a tolerable scent. The stench is so bad that my husband actually gets angry with me for wearing it around him. My daughter does not want to be around me for the same reason. You cannot go anywhere with this product in your hair unless you enjoy people moving away from you to avoid the odor. Essentially this is only a usable product if you are a skunk or do not live among the human population. Questionably in the ingredient list all the ingredients are not listed. If this company could make the smell of this product tolerable it seems to produce results even if at a snails pace. I would have given this product 5 stars if it had had a pleasant odor; as it is I WARN EVERYONE TO STEER CLEAR and search for an alternative product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DOESN´T WORK AT ALL.  IF YOU BUY THIS IS THE SAME YOU TROW YOUR MONEY TO THE WASTE BASKET.</li>
    <li> I want t first start off by saying EXCELLENT Customer Service and FAST delivery. The product being great was the icing on the cake!&lt;br /&gt;Although the smell is horrendous, the product is actually great!!!  My hair is hard to perm. I have a mixture of American Indian and African American hair texture. Its thick, curly, wavy and straight. It&#x27;s an old combination when I chose to keep it short. When wet, it curls  and without the right product my curls can become a little dry. In order to get my straight to my expectations, I have to go through extreme measures of using wrapping papers and a light moose that doesn&#x27;t put flakes in my hair either over night or sit under the dryer. It&#x27;s hard to keep a perm in my hair since I wash my hair once or twice a week  and it grows pretty quickly. After using this product the first day, I noticed a major change! I use a dab of the product as a part of my nighttime hair regimen (using it with a dab of light hair lotion to cut balance out the smell) and this works wonders.  I can now wear my hair either curly or straight without it looking terribly dry or frizzy. I love it!!! There has to be a way to mellow out the smell...</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I was looking for something to use to extend the time between relaxers and the price seem right.  I was more than pleased by this product. The product is easy to apply.  I used the ponytail technique to pull my hair straight and I wore a plastic bag on my head while the product was on.  I only left the product on for three hours before I washed and blow dried my hair.  Once I began drying my hair I was immediately able to see a major difference in my hair, my hair looked professionally done after blow drying alone.  Once I flat ironed my hair, I showed my husband and he was surprised by the results as well.  I must say the smell is like apples and vinegar, but honestly the smell is no worse than a hair salon or a relaxer. Also using a plastic bag will lessen the smell and prevent the product from getting in your face or eyes.  I also should mention there is some minor irritation, but is minor and it may have just been my experience. The time factor is a hindrance, but it isn&#x27;t enough for me to stop, honestly I have spent longer in a salon with half the results. After the success I have had with this product, I may never use a chemical relaxer on my hair again.  Mothers before relaxing your daughter&#x27;s hair try this product.</li>
    <li> Ok I was so skeptical when i purchased this because of the bad reviews, but i have to say this has been wonderful. Im biracial and have 3c hair. I have only used this about 4 times but i noticed less frizz after the first 2 applications. Now i noticed my curls are slightly looser,but the best part is i have smooth curls not frizzy.  I use it about twice aweek which seems to work for me. You dont have to wear your hair straight with this you can wear it natural.  This smell is not as bad as people say and it gets less strong as time goes on. I didnt give it five stars because i will have to see the full results after a couple of months. If u have ringlets to wavy hair this would be best for you.</li>
    <li> I use this as a leave-in conditioner. I dab it around my hairline and on the new growth. I then proceed to either rolll my hair on hotrollers or use a flat iron to bump it. My hair feels dry afterwards. I&#x27;m concerned that I might expereince breakage. I don&#x27;t think this is the problem buyt my hair feels and sounds dry. I put some on my sons hair. Same technique as a rub in conditioner. He said that his hair felt dry. That made me realize that I was experiencing the same thing. I really want this to work. I am going to a hairstylist on Thursday. I&#x27;ll see what she thinks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Curlaway (formerly Curlex) for about 18 months with good results.  I only tried the heavy application once, left it on for hours, but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  Then I read the suggesion to use it as a leave-in conditioner, and it worked great!  My hair responds quickly to a ceramic straightening iron - only 5-10 minutes to soft straight hair.  Also, using it as a leave-in product really extends the time between purchases - I get at least six months from a jar.  Be patient, it might take a couple of weeks to notice results.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, I wasn&#x27;t actually looking for my hair to be straight.  I stopped perming my hair 3 months ago. It&#x27;s damaged, dry and brittle.  My goal is to get my hair back healthy.  I work from home so I was justing putting my hair in a pony tail.  I wish I had before and after pics.  My pony was a hot mess, it was dry and frizzy.  I have now used the product twice as an overnight leave in conditioner every other day.  Today is day four.  My hair is still in a pony and has done a 360 turn around since using this product.  It&#x27;s not dry looking nor is it frizzy.  I let my hair air dry, I just love it.  It&#x27;s curly.  Again I did not follow the directions to get my hair straight because that&#x27;s not what I wanted to do.  It&#x27;s actually changing my dry hair.  I&#x27;m sure if I wanted to straighten it, I could however that&#x27;s not my goal.  I will continue to use this product I&#x27;m so happy with the results so far.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair looks like in the next 6 months.  FYI I&#x27;m african american, I have black kinky hair.  Not many were saying their ethnicity which I think is important with reading a review on hair, not a racial thing just a need to know thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this first from walgreens, and when I used it it seem to very gradually loosen my hair. Since it was natural , I kept using it but my hair seem to be getting shorter. I thought it was my imagination, however when  my Mother told me I lost two inches. I knew it was real. It ONLY straighten my hair about 5 percent and it took out my hair. I could have got a relaxer at that rate which only takes about an hour.</li>
    <li> I have used Curlaway for about a year now and my hair is absolutely fabulous. It took some time to understand how to apply the product for the best results, but once I did....great. Hair must be pulled straight during both the application and the drying process or it just flops.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I no longer have any breakage, my hair is bouncy, looks great, full of body and has grown faster than ever before. I would never consider using a chemical relaxer on my hair again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month now and I love the results I&#x27;m seeing.   I know that in the next few months I will have my full desired results.  Don&#x27;t expect over night miracles, this product is all about patience.</li>
    <li> This product does just what it says it will.  I use it as a leave in conditioner so I haven&#x27;t quite achieved the straight look, but I have noticed my hair is smoother and more manageable.  It also doesn&#x27;t frizz up in damp weather anymore.  If used properly, this product is great!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine blonde (going gray ) hair that frizzes in heat &amp; humidity.  I just tried this product by using it as a styling gel on my towel dried hair. It&#x27;s very humid today and my hair hasn&#x27;t frizzed!!! I can&#x27;t count the   number of products I&#x27;ve tried that haven&#x27;t worked.  My hair has only a little   wave but so far it&#x27;s staying straight with no frizz. And the appley smell goes away once your hair is dry.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I am a west indian of mixed heritage--I have the hair of my african ancestors. It is super curly --nothing can get the curl out--not even a relaxer. If the relaxer gets the curl out it also eats up the hair. I did locs for 4 years--it takes a lot of time for your true hair texture to come back after you stop using relaxers. The hair I had when I started going nature is no the hair I ended up with. I love my curls but I had a problem with the shrinkage!! My hair is shoulder length but it shrinks up close to my head when dry--no matter what products I use. Okay thats the background--This product did relax the curl a bit but it made it dry, dry, dry, and frizzy. The part that scares me is that I could hear my hair breaking when I combed through my hair. I curled my hair w/ the product and left it on overnite. I am hoping my hair will revert back..but probably not.</li>
    <li> I have used this product. It stinks like vinegar. But better than sulfur smell. I does straighten the hair. I was without a perm so long when I began to use this product. My hair was virgin. This straighten it out.  I am happy with this product. I have returned to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am a mixed chick...used relaxers and dye for years and my hair would grow to a certain point, then break off.  So, about 3 years ago, I started growing all of the relaxer out of my hair...I also stopped dyeing my hair and now only use body art quality pure Egyptian henna to color my straggling grays.  Problem is, while I may not actually \\&quot;need\\&quot; a relaxer, it was the only thing that kept the wild tame of tight curls in a more manageable state.  I have tried  other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; relaxers such as African Wonders and Fresh Look Hair..neither of them really worked, and Fresh Look Hair left my hair feeling stiff, gummy and looking frizzy (which prompted me to think it wasn&#x27;t really all natural).  I tried the spray in keratin treatments, too.  Those were a joke.  Then last week, I tried another search and came across this stuff.  I thought what did I have to lose, right?  $20?  Not this time--this stuff is a miracle, and I am jumping for joy!  After washing and conditioning, I put in a dime-sized dollop and blew it dry.  It was straight and heavy after just blow drying it, which NEVER is the case (usually I have a giant puff ball to contend with).  I applied a small amount of coconut oil (out of habit), that made it a bit flat, but flat ironing my hair in 20 minutes  is yet another first!  I will tell the world about this product so the company does well and I never have to be without it, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As the other reviews advised, I didn&#x27;t opt for the overnight treatment.  Using it as a leave-in product seems to work best.  Just make sure you comb it through evenly.&lt;br /&gt;2. Be sure not to use too much...I used another small smear of it that I didn&#x27;t need to...it burned away after flat ironing my hair, but next time, I bet it will have more body without the extra amount.&lt;br /&gt;3. It DOES smell funny, sort of like vinegar (that&#x27;s actually what it&#x27;s made from).  To counteract the smell, I used a bit of extra virgin coconut oil (which might have also contributed to weighing my hair down a bit where I needed to burn it off from flatironing it) and that masked it well.  If you don&#x27;t like coconut, you could probably use a mango or some other light oil.&lt;br /&gt;4.  One jar will last a long time, so don&#x27;t be tempted to buy two as I&#x27;m not sure what the shelf life is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY I HAVE FOUND A PRODUCT THAT GIVES MY HAIR WEIGHT, BODY, SHINE AND BOUNCE AND STRAIGHTENS IT WITH NO CHEMICALS!!!ghing my hair down a bit where I needed to burn it off from flatironing it) and that masked it well.

    <li> I wasnt using this to straighten my hair just to help me stretch between relaxers. The smell is strong but I really didnt mind it but then again I did not leave this on my hair for hours at a time. I used this as a leave in and used a blow dryer and flat iron and I  was very pleased with the results. I like that it is reversible and compatible with relaxers.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2XPXMKL4FINVI]]I thought a video would be best to show how pleased I was with this product. I am Italian and Puertorican who always had thick wavy hair. This product was able to tame my hair but still keep its beauty.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for the curlaway relaxer, but I was very disappointed.  I have been using it almost everyday for two weeks, I followed the directions on the box.  But no results AT ALL!  I tried leaving it in my hair overnight, and also as a leave in Conditioner, and it did not work at all.  It is a waste of time and money.  Plus, you have to deal with that aweful smell of \\&quot;sour apple\\&quot;.  I am hoping to return it, and to get my money back.  Exremely Unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> if you can&#x27;t control your hair and don&#x27;t know what to do, use this product! But:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) 1/4-1/2 tea. spoon of pure vanilla extract. stir it into the product well. this reduces the spoiled rotten smell into just a regular bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) use STRONG smelling shampoos and conditioners. Black soap hair products are a life saver. I used SheaMoisture African Black Soap Purification Masque as a co-wash and conditioner. the SheaMoisture African Black Soap shampoo. SheaMoisture is at walgreens, target, drugstore.com. However only some Walgreens carry the black soap products, so check the walgreens website to make sure the store you&#x27;re going too have these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Use shea moisture african black soap dandruff &amp; dry scalp elixir in the days between washes. it helps improve scalp health (stop dandruff) and is the last step for Killing that SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) aussie 3 minute miracle deep conditioner is also a good conditioner for covering the smell if you don&#x27;t like black soap. But doesn&#x27;t kill the smell as good. it only last 2 days, then that Smell comes back.</li>
    <li> It worked for my naturaly curly hair, without damaging it. I recommend this product to anyone. A little pricey for me because you do a treatment every 3 wks and the bottle only last for 3 treatment because my hair is long. Also it smells bad!</li>
    <li> the product is a good one it does not completely break down your hair but your pattern does get looser the smell is quite strong but was easy to get rid of i just put a good smelling conditioner on hair after product. good buy if you can get past  the vinegar smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product recently as I&#x27;m in a \\&quot;consideration phase.\\&quot;  Considering growing out my relaxer to either natural or texlaxing.  So I purchased Curlaway while I&#x27;m researching as I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in almost 20 weeks and my hair was very unmanageable.      So I looked for it in Walgreens and none had it in stock and finally ordered from Amazon.  Got the product and followed the overnight directions twice with a day in between as the directions said.  I followed the directions to the penny.      My review is lukewarm.  Yes it loosened the curl so I could comb thru it but the new growth still looked the same.  There was no wave- just a softer looser frizziness.  I ran 3 miles this morning and its about 1pm and my roots still feel pretty soft.  Now I know the directions say that you may need to use the product many times to get the desired outcome but that&#x27;s asking alot to me.  And although the directions say wear it overnight..I highly advise against that.  I wore it overnight with a scarf on and the smell really kept me up.  I tried to sleep on my back and it was hard as I&#x27;m a side sleeper.  Anytime I would change positions the smell was alot to take but I finally drifted off.  I recommend you try it when your going to be in the house all day...cleaning, teleworking etc.       The jar costs $20 and I got 2 applications out of it just applying it to my roots.  I can&#x27;t see myself purchasing another jar and applying again and again.  That&#x27;s a waste of my money and more important my time.  No thanks.  To keep parting my hair and applying that more than 2 times is just not happening.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says. Don&#x27;t expect drastic changes quickly but it loosened your hair right after a few applications and with no hair loss.  It is great as a leave-in conditioner.  The smell is not pleasant but a few drops of vanilla extract makes it bearable. Overnight application is a bit messy and the smell....  I will continue using it mostly as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> im not sure if it works-i only used one jar and did three treatments.  If there were any change in my hair it was very minimal but again its a slow process.  the smell isnt all that bad-i thought it smelled like vinager but my kids said it smell like mustard i have 4a hair type</li>
    <li> This product definitly does soften your hair and relax the curl some what. They say it&#x27;s a gradual process.  i am not interested in getting totally straight hair I just want perfect curls and waves so i will continue using Curlaway until i get these desired results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product.  I saw no change in my hair and I thought it was very messy and sticky</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m not sure this product actually worked. Tried it for a few months to stretch a perm but decided to stop because you could smell my head. Not a good thing when people comment on a bad vinegary smell. Can&#x27;t be sure if it actually straightened, so wont&#x27; be trying it again.</li>
    <li> I waited a little before i did this review, but that&#x27;s only because i wanted to be nice and give them back their product. but i won&#x27;t hold my tongue now so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;1. this product smells HORRID ! green apple ? not even close. more like fish and salt&amp; vinegar chips (and maybe a little more, but i refused to use it again once i closed the bottle lol) it honestly made me want to gag!&lt;br /&gt;2. it doesnt do anything a good leave in conditioner would do! so why bother having my hair smelling like fish and chips if i can use a conditioner ?&lt;br /&gt;3.i barely used any and it stil flaked into booger-like crumbles, which looked sooo nasty in my hair &gt;_&lt;&lt;br /&gt;4. i paid for the product + shipping and handling. i dont care how much you decide to put as a shipping price, but when i want an unsavory product sent back, i should be able to right ? NOPE. they sent me a bogus shipping label that i could have printed myself. so basically they want me to have to pay all charges to send it back to them. apparently they dont want their product either. but I DONT WANT TO SPEND ANY MORE MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT, WTF!!!! so they&#x27;re gonna have to fix that ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISSATISFIED.&lt;br /&gt;DONT EVEN LOOK TWICE AT THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;until i get my money back ;)</li>
    <li> The product  does work I you use twice a week and was out I wouldn&#x27;t do more than that because your hair will break off. Deep condition when using it. It WILL strip your hair if its color treated. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to price. I found another product for a lot less an will last months.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even went out of my way to go to a store \\&quot;in da hood\\&quot; that carried it.  There are 8 yes 8 Walgreen&#x27;s between my home and my work and NONE of them carry this product.  The ghetto Walgreens did. SO I drove 5 miles in the direction opposite my work to home route to pick it up .  I was so committed to the idea of a \\&quot;chemical free\\&quot; relaxer that I bought 2 jars at once @ 20 dollars a jar.  This stuff made my hair sooooo dry and brittle that I have lost more than 2 inches of hair(bra strap,AA relaxed)  Mind you, I am a person who takes impeccable care of my hair after co-washing I DC, detangle in the shower, follow up with a leave in and seal with my own mix of shea butter and olive oil , I follow this with a rollerset and hood dryer dry to half and air dry the rest of the way.&lt;br /&gt;  This stuff is not for everyone.  It made my hair like black straw in spite of moisturizing conditioners and such.  I have stopped using it and with henna treatments and DC my hair is filling back in.  While I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t use it I would say use with caution.  I have a complete un opened jar I would give away but can&#x27;t find anybody that I(hate enough and) could give it to and not have a case of conscience&lt;br /&gt;My next foray into unknown straighteners will be phtyo but i need to save my pennies after spending my product junkie money on this. LOL</li>
    <li> This product is amazing as a relaxer and does not damage your hair.  The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.  I would love to use it daily to help with the relaxing, but the smell is too bad to wear anywhere but at home.  The product is amazing though!!</li>
    <li> The product does work but I can&#x27;t take the smell. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to use it daily.</li>
    <li> FIrst off i had to repay shipping when the package arrived at my house. I ended up paying about 25$ in total and paid shipping twice. I would recommend to just buy some in Walmart they have it there other relaxers for 5$ and honestly they work the same. i have been using this product for a while just about everyday and yes it smells really bad but it does leave my hair shiny and silky. But the chemical smell is not very healthy. other than having to pay twice for shipping its ok quality if you want to use this relaxer for managebility then its perfect for you but if you are using it to get your hair less curly i can tell you that it is going to take to long so just look for a different product.</li>
    <li> I kind of like the product because it does its job by loosening some of my kinks and turning them into waves but it is a very gradual process. So far, since I only concentrated on the front of my hair, that&#x27;s the only part loosened into waves and I&#x27;m hoping that the rest of my hair follows suit with the product.That&#x27;s the only annoying part about it to me. I simply don&#x27;t like the idea of having to wait 4 to 9 hours with my hair stretched enough so that the product loosens the curl pattern of my hair. I&#x27;m kind of impatient, especially with haircare so I like to just wash and go without encountering problems such as tangling and SSK&#x27;s later. That&#x27;s why I sometimes just leave it as a leave-in, even though that&#x27;s probably less effective. I will continue using this anyway to see if it could get all my kinks to lay down. Unlike some of the other reviews, I&#x27;m actually not that bothered by the smell. I think it&#x27;s alright, it&#x27;s not exactly desirable but maybe those people are scent-sensitive, I know I&#x27;m not. I like how it&#x27;s non-alkaline because my hair is a bit too porous right now so I can&#x27;t use any other loosening things that are alkaline. I plan to use this in conjunction with henna treatments to see if I can gradually get the long, shiny, strong, loose, auburn-colored waves that responds well to flat-ironing that I want.</li>
    <li> I have really kinky curls and I wanted to buy a product that would give me the option to use my hair straight sometimes. So I decided to buy this Gradual curl relaxer, but unfortunately I did not get the results that I wanted cos my hair remained curly.</li>
    <li> I have thin, very curly caucasion hair. I washed, conditioned and towel dried my hair, then applied about a tablespoon to my hair and combed through to make sure it applied evenly. Then I blew my hair out with a high quality roller brush and blow dryer. The roller brush is the kind that retains heat. My blow out came out smoother and shiner and less frizzy than when I used John Frieda 3 -day straight. The only bad things: it smells pretty strong, like vinegar, and may make your eyes water. But, the smell doesn&#x27;t last on your hair for more than a couple of hours at most. It also may make your hair seem greasy if you use too much. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this product but it \\&quot;seems\\&quot; more natural than a lot of other things. It&#x27;s also cheaper than Phyto Relaxing Balm. I&#x27;m waiting to see if it has a \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; relaxing effect if I use it regularly. If it does, I would probably give this product five stars.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said it would a waste of money.I want buy it again. the produce is no good for straightener out your hair. My hair isn&#x27;t straight at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Walgreen for roughly 10 dollars. I never finished it. I did multiple applications and noticed no difference in texture which is what I was looking for. I have 4c hair and was looking for something that would make my hair easier to detangle. This did nothing.</li>
    <li> This product smelled really strong and it made my daughters hair itch like crazy. My daughter has not had a perm in 4 months do i wanted to try something a little less harsh on her scalp. When I tried washing it out, it left it tangled. I thought It was more like a natural product but it wasn&#x27;t. Not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Not worth it, it smells so bad and the smell will stay in your hair for a few days. Waste if money</li>
</ol>
