<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lip treatment is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!  It hydrates, and lightly exfoliates with continued use.  My lips look like I&#x27;ve had them plumped.</li>
    <li> I bought this and used it a few times, it was like blistex. The worse part was the pump quit pumping out the stuff, I tried to take it apart so I could access the product a different way. (very frustrating) considering what I paid for it, I ended up throwing it away, its such a hassel returning once your thrown out the packaging. I would not recommnend it, save your money and buy blistex medicated lip balm</li>
    <li> This lip cream is amazing. Gives your lips a youthful plumped up appearance. Really good for maintaining appearance after a juvederm injection.</li>
    <li> No more chapped lips... Soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and you only need a tiny amount. Hold the container in a way that will allow you to press the pump only a little... You probably won&#x27;t need a full pump to cover your lips. I do also use Burt&#x27;s Bees after the lip treatment has soaked in a bit.</li>
    <li> I have using Skin Ceuticals products for years. I started using the Antioxidant Lip Restorative Repair Treatment several months and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Softened lines around my mouth as promised, however I think I&#x27;ll need to continue to use to maintain results.</li>
    <li> not seeing any improvement or changes</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. My lips are greatful that I treat them with this delicate product.</li>
    <li> My lips are still dry. I am going to order this products one more time. Will let you know if continual use helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I have tried many lip products and absolutely none of them kept my lips from becoming chapped and cracked. This product works 100% of the time.? I apply it to my lips every night before I go to sleep as well as any day that I am not wearing lipstick. My lips never get chapped, cracked or rough! My constant problem disappeared with this product!</li>
    <li> I like that this is not greasy like chapstick.  My lips do feel much smoother.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get a small amount out with the pump, so push lightly or you&#x27;ll have too much to distribute.</li>
    <li> Not good at all. Too expensive and it is not any different than those over counter lip treatment.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lip repair it made my lips soft and smooth. Absorbs instantly and is not greasy. I would have given it 5 stars but my pump dispenser stopped working and I had to break it open to use the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lip moisturizers and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.  I put a small amount on my lips after my shower and my lips do not get dry and chap all day.  I follow up with the lip gloss, shine or moisturizers that I usually use on a daily basis, only these other products do not work alone.  This is a great product that really works</li>
    <li> Love SkinCeuticals! Love saving $$ on it, too! Even with the savings, this seemed pricey for a lip treatment... SO worth it! Living in Colorado and in my mid 40s, my lips were always peeling and chapped. Tried everything out there it seems! Even department store counter brands. Loving the whole SkinCeuticals line, I decided to bite the bullet and try this one. This is the only treatment that has worked! Right away, no more peeling, no more crusties and no more ugly picking at my lips. Now instead of layers of Chapstick, I can wear pretty lipstick on smoooooooth lips! Victory! And bonus... My lips are fuller and plumper.  I use a tiny bit of it morning and night. At night, I also add a dab of the Hydrating B5 Gel. Product arrived on time, in good condition, unopened and authentic. Recommend seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and truly like it.</li>
    <li> Not a great improvement over regular lip products. For me, once in the morning and once at night is not enough.</li>
    <li> Skinceauticals are the best products.  My skin has never looked better...and this site has great prices, easy transaction.  Have been using all skinceautical products forever!</li>
    <li> This lip repair cream goes on so smooth and keeps my lips feeling moist for a very long time. Helps with dry lips and cracking.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem quite up to par with skin ceuticals product line.</li>
    <li> leaves my lips moisturized without the negative feedback loop (leaving the lips more dry after)</li>
    <li> was disappointed being an avid skinceuticals lover for ever.  Just did not do much 4 me</li>
    <li> I love this article. It&#x27;s amazing and my lips are very happy. I shall buy now. Thank you for all</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this product at a local salon and loved it.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  However, the product has changed and is nothing like it used to be.  I checked with the salon, and they also have this (new improved?) version.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love everything in this line.  I may be expensive, but I have used so may way more expensive skincare over the years and this is not expensive if you look at the ingredients you are receiving.  Why pay $300-400 for a jar of Perricone, not worth it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product and have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> I started using Skinceuticals about a year ago, just one product at that time, now I use them exclusive.  The Lip Restorative Repair Treatment is great.  I notices a big improvement in one week,  the dermatologist I go to recommended these products to moi, I love my skin and always have taken good care of my face and neck area, and now at 61 years young , I get compliments on my skin, so adding these products , now at this stage of my life, I know I will always look good as I age, hopefully , gracefully!</li>
