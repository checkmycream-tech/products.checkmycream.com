### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Happy to find on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Beautiful tint and flavor with no waxy residue!</li>
      <li>This has perfect color for me and I can apply without a mirror.</li>
      <li>Great Balm!</li>
      <li>Perfect amount of color.</li>
      <li>Awesome product.  </li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>feels great on my lips</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good in the purse when you want to tint though.</li>
      <li>Is cheaper and just as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees and I prefer the color.</li>
      <li>Good ingredients.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, makes my skin feel moist, and the color is just perfect.</li>
      <li>The Soft Plum was the perfect color for me, and goes on very nicely.</li>
      <li>Love the hint of color!</li>
      <li>This lip balm feels amazing on my lips</li>
      <li>Kind of like 80s lipstick.</li>
      <li>A nice alternative to lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Soft plum was the perfect color for me.</li>
      <li>Out of all my color lip balms, this one is not my favorite, but it&#x27;s still nice.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this lip balm!</li>
      <li>Perfect light plum color, can make it deeper with more coats or very natural looking.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite chapstick for months.</li>
      <li>but I do love how my lips feel all the time.  </li>
      <li>And it has a nice, smooth feel.</li>
      <li>so I am going to end up using my Palladio Rosy stick much more than this one - this will probably be saved for the healing properties of vitamin E in the privacy of my home but not when I want to be out in the world feeling sexy.</li>
      <li>Its easy to use with lip liner and its a plus</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday.</li>
      <li>Wears comfortably.</li>
      <li>Just enough color and great feel.</li>
      <li>Can put lip liner lightly over all of lips then add this.</li>
      <li>I am a very fair skinned redhead so if you are someone with medium to dark skin tones, I doubt this will show on you at all</li>
      <li>Most natural tinted lip balms have shimmer and cover more like a lipstick.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>Wait a bit and reapply for more intense color.</li>
      <li>This product acts a little more like a lipstick because of its consistency and its superior tube, but it feels like lip balm when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned, I can only wear the soft plum when i combine it with rosy bloom.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes and isn&#x27;t super shiny, which I consider unattractive/sticky looking.</li>
      <li>It looks better than lipstick and feels better than regular lip balm!</li>
      <li>I carry this in my pocket all the time for a quick hint of color.  </li>
      <li>The color is comparable (maybe slightly more red) and it feels more velvety.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love natural lip products.</li>
      <li>Yes to Carrots is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>A nice alternative to traditional lipstick.</li>
      <li>This was a bit darker than expected, but generally a good product.</li>
      <li>Yes to Carrots Soft Plum is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The color is just right.</li>
      <li>I like the natural ingredients and the fact that it does leave a light color tint on the lips, but I wish this was more of a rosy red tint instead of a plum.  </li>
      <li>One, it smells sort of funny.</li>
      <li>, my new go to!!</li>
      <li>Keeps lips very moist.  </li>
      <li>Very silky feel on lips.</li>
      <li>Does not give as much color as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I likely won&#x27;t buy it again as plum doesn&#x27;t compliment my natural yellow tan fair skin tone as a woman of color.  </li>
      <li>Most other color lip balms I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Like many other tinted flavored lip glosses it does what it says it will.</li>
      <li>Sheer, moisturizing, tastes slightly sweet.</li>
      <li>I love Black Honey almost lipstick but was looking for a cheaper alternative.</li>
      <li>it looks much darker in the stick but goes on sheer with just the right amount of color.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I wish they offered more colors and that the colors could be a little darker.  </li>
      <li>Nice, subtle color you can build to a deeper tint.  </li>
      <li>my lips are full and get very dry in TX.</li>
      <li>Pretty sheer plum color, and my lips respond well to it.  </li>
      <li>This balm is a pretty plum color without shimmer and is just tinted enough.</li>
      <li>and it will just look like a clear gloss.</li>
      <li>clearly doesn&#x27;t have the cache of pulling out a the silver Clinique stick if that sort of thing matters to you.</li>
      <li>As far as i can tell there is no fragrance which is a plus.</li>
      <li>My 16 year old daughter taught me that.</li>
      <li>that is got natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Probably not a big deal to most people, but the reason I like tinted chapstick is because you can pretend like you&#x27;re just putting on regular chapstick and not have to hassle with rolling the product up and down every time you want to put it on.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind kissing me right after I put this on like he does with other lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>have been very shiny and soft, and they come in traditional lip balm tubes that tend to get gummed up and won&#x27;t twist properly after a while.</li>
      <li>If you have really dry lips and want a real moisturizer for them this is not the choice.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just doesn&#x27;t favor to me like my other lip balms that have a rosy red or rosy pink color tint.</li>
      <li>I was looking for an alternative to Clinique&#x27;s black honey and this is very similar in color and texture, it just doesn&#x27;t last as long, but for the price difference I&#x27;d say it is worth it</li>

<li> Not sticky or greasy, but color doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
<li> But it doesn&#x27;t last long once applied.  </li>
<li> As of this writing Black Honey is $15 and this Soft Plum balm is $6.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not too heavy like a lipstick, but has a tinted natural look.  </li>
<li> It makes me think it could be old or rancid but not sure.  </li>
<li> Its not like lipstick pigment, but its enough pigment to be too dark.</li>
<li> you screw it back down.</li>
<li> And secondly, the container isn&#x27;t like your typical chapstick&#x27;s.</li>
<li> It is browner and paler than what I had expected when I ordered it and from what I&#x27;d seen on some photos online.</li>
<li> Not a very dark color, hardly a tint</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a fan of the brand for other things, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees for lip balm.</li>
<li> Not too dark or lipsticky.</li>
<li> I was hoping for a little darker hue.</li>
<li> but I use it when I want a little color.</li>
<li> The white part that looks like a lid is actually the base, and the red part slides off.</li>
<li> She loves this brand, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find the tinted lip balm in stores near me.</li>
<li> but I am disappointed in the color of the Soft Plum.</li>
<li> Reminds me of Black Honey but tons cheaper!!!</li>
<li> color is subtle and the the product leaves my lips supple.</li>
<li> I am addicted to lip balms...</li>
<li> but this smells bad.  </li>

    <li> Like many other tinted flavored lip glosses it does what it says it will. If you have really dry lips and want a real moisturizer for them this is not the choice.  It&#x27;s good in the purse when you want to tint though.</li>
    <li> Sheer, moisturizing, tastes slightly sweet. The color is just right. Not too dark or lipsticky. This is a product I order again and again. I am addicted to lip balms... my lips are full and get very dry in TX. This protects them. Good ingredients.This is all I use now.</li>
    <li> This lip balm feels amazing on my lips but I am disappointed in the color of the Soft Plum. It is browner and paler than what I had expected when I ordered it and from what I&#x27;d seen on some photos online. I wanted a redder color so I am going to end up using my Palladio Rosy stick much more than this one - this will probably be saved for the healing properties of vitamin E in the privacy of my home but not when I want to be out in the world feeling sexy.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before in the store and didn&#x27;t mind the smell of it but this smells bad.  It makes me think it could be old or rancid but not sure.  I definitely won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite. Perfect for everyday. Just enough color and great feel. Wait a bit and reapply for more intense color. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great. It could last longer but it&#x27;s still great and I haven&#x27;t had problems with it being drying. It isn&#x27;t my go-to (I like yes to grapefruit lip balm) but I use it when I want a little color.</li>
    <li> Yes to Carrots Soft Plum is my favorite. It looks better than lipstick and feels better than regular lip balm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for a tinted lip balm that isn&#x27;t too glossy. Yes to Carrots is my favorite so far. Most other color lip balms I&#x27;ve tried have been very shiny and soft, and they come in traditional lip balm tubes that tend to get gummed up and won&#x27;t twist properly after a while. This product acts a little more like a lipstick because of its consistency and its superior tube, but it feels like lip balm when I&#x27;m wearing it. Soft plum was the perfect color for me. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this lip balm! Goes on smooth, makes my skin feel moist, and the color is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Perfect light plum color, can make it deeper with more coats or very natural looking. feels great on my lips, my new go to!!</li>
    <li> This has perfect color for me and I can apply without a mirror. I add lip liner and it looks like lipstick. Can put lip liner lightly over all of lips then add this. My 16 year old daughter taught me that. Is cheaper and just as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees and I prefer the color. I use it daily. Moisturizes and isn&#x27;t super shiny, which I consider unattractive/sticky looking. I bought 3 at once!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite chapstick for months. Perfect amount of color. Not sticky or greasy, but color doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find this in stores! Beautiful tint and flavor with no waxy residue!</li>
    <li> Out of all my color lip balms, this one is not my favorite, but it&#x27;s still nice.  I likely won&#x27;t buy it again as plum doesn&#x27;t compliment my natural yellow tan fair skin tone as a woman of color.  I like the natural ingredients and the fact that it does leave a light color tint on the lips, but I wish this was more of a rosy red tint instead of a plum.  So it&#x27;s not a bad product, it just doesn&#x27;t favor to me like my other lip balms that have a rosy red or rosy pink color tint.</li>
    <li> Nice, subtle color you can build to a deeper tint.  Keeps lips very moist.  A nice alternative to traditional lipstick.</li>
    <li> I carry this in my pocket all the time for a quick hint of color.  It&#x27;s not too heavy like a lipstick, but has a tinted natural look.  I can&#x27;t find them in the store so I subscribed to receive these every 3 months.</li>
    <li> Very silky feel on lips. Does not give as much color as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and it covers well and she likes the consistency. Its easy to use with lip liner and its a plus that is got natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> It leaves just a hint of color. I was hoping for a little darker hue. Wears comfortably. WIsh I knew if it had any spf protection.</li>
    <li> Not a very dark color, hardly a tint but I do love how my lips feel all the time.  My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind kissing me right after I put this on like he does with other lipsticks.  I wish they offered more colors and that the colors could be a little darker.

    <li> The Soft Plum was the perfect color for me, and goes on very nicely. I have two complaints about the product, however. One, it smells sort of funny. Kind of like 80s lipstick. And secondly, the container isn&#x27;t like your typical chapstick&#x27;s. The white part that looks like a lid is actually the base, and the red part slides off. Probably not a big deal to most people, but the reason I like tinted chapstick is because you can pretend like you&#x27;re just putting on regular chapstick and not have to hassle with rolling the product up and down every time you want to put it on. I&#x27;m a fan of the brand for other things, but I&#x27;ll probably stick with Burt&#x27;s Bees for lip balm.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order again.  It has a just a hint of color.  But it doesn&#x27;t last long once applied.  And I didn&#x27;t like taste.</li>
    <li> She loves this brand, and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find the tinted lip balm in stores near me. This was a bit darker than expected, but generally a good product.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned, I can only wear the soft plum when i combine it with rosy bloom.  I like that combo.  Its not like lipstick pigment, but its enough pigment to be too dark.</li>
    <li> Great Balm! Love the hint of color! Reminds me of Black Honey but tons cheaper!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty sheer plum color, and my lips respond well to it.  A nice alternative to lipstick.  With our desert air, I am using it often!</li>
    <li> color is subtle and the the product leaves my lips supple. I bought several because I want one in work bag, one in handbag, one in bathroom makeup kit. Happy to find on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love natural lip products. Most natural tinted lip balms have shimmer and cover more like a lipstick. This balm is a pretty plum color without shimmer and is just tinted enough. And it has a nice, smooth feel.</li>
    <li> I love Black Honey almost lipstick but was looking for a cheaper alternative. As of this writing Black Honey is $15 and this Soft Plum balm is $6. The color is comparable (maybe slightly more red) and it feels more velvety. it looks much darker in the stick but goes on sheer with just the right amount of color. I think it&#x27;s just a bit darker than Bonnie Bell&#x27;s Dr. Pepper if that helps. As far as i can tell there is no fragrance which is a plus. The only things i can even think of as cons is that 1) it doesn&#x27;t seem to retract.when you screw it back down. You actually have to push it back in manually.2) clearly doesn&#x27;t have the cache of pulling out a the silver Clinique stick if that sort of thing matters to you.</li>
