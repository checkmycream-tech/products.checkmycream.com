      <li>Great Shampoo!  </li>
      <li>It is the best product on the market</li>
      <li>Before it was AWESOME!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with it!</li>
      <li>It smells delicious and the smell lasts.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d see if their shampoo was equally wonderful</li>
      <li>Not to mention it smells great.  </li>
      <li>This is probably great shampoo for people with curly hair.</li>
      <li>It was a great deal.</li>
      <li>It leaves a great body of cleansing on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>great product</li>
      <li>and this shampoo is great.</li>
      <li>great shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with the results!</li>
      <li>The shampoo also smells good.</li>
      <li>My wife and I were looking for an organic product for our hair and this fit the bill perfectly!!</li>
      <li>I loved it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it still didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as good as Wen, nor was it an all-in-one product, so I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
      <li>It sounded good, so I bought a bottle for me and my boyfriend to try.</li>
      <li>Great product,very pleased.</li>
      <li>Like most people, I&#x27;d find a great shampoo, but after six months or so, have to change to another brand.  </li>
      <li>Love the conditioner however!</li>
      <li>I had better expectation!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s My favorite product!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;I Love My Hair!</li>
      <li>The lather is nice... cost good - love the scent.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is so nice, leaving you hair so clean and feels great, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shampoo came after a 90 degree day, so maybe that was part of the problem (softer plastic maybe?), but the top had popped off the top of the bottle and the bag that the shampoo was placed in had probably a good 1/4 cup of shampoo in it.  </li>
      <li>The Renpure Organics I Love My Hair Body &amp; Shine shampoo was aptly named.  </li>
      <li>I love the Renpure Conditioners like My Foxy Hair Needs Fixing and Amazing Miracle</li>
      <li>Smells good and gets hair clean.</li>
      <li>matching conditioner is adequate, but not the best, which doesnt matter really, its the shampoo that fades the color.</li>
      <li>smell great, leaves hair beautiful, natural ingredients and of course priced right.  </li>
      <li>I love how my hair color lightened and started to shine over 2 month use.</li>

      <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>but I found it to be just okay.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many shampoos claiming to be color safe.</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about when to order more.  </li>
      <li>Love product line, would buy up loads if I can find in the stores like years ago.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo, and when I realized that I could get it for quite a bit cheaper here than at CVS, I ordered it and signed up for subscribe and save</li>
      <li>This is a good product and I am not necessarily unhappy with it.  </li>
      <li>I really love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I see no difference between this product&#x27;s performance and the top of the line $75 shampoo.&lt;br</li>

      <li>My hair is easier to comb with Renpure rather than just wetting my hair with water and trying to comb through it, but I know there are better products out there.    </li>

      <li>I love how light and clean my hair feels after shampooing with Renpure.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have been using this shampoo for a month now, and it is hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>I have one of the shampoo to my husbands daughter who has fine hair as he does.</li>
      <li>I think it lathers just fine.</li>
      <li>I have fine straight/wavy hair and the shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and tends to be on the drier side.  </li>
      <li>Aside from the smell which is fine after rinsed out and smells lightly of grapefruit, I will probably purchase this shampoo again.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2 shampoo, 2 conditioner and one of the miracle reconstructors online and they shipped for free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While browsing at the grocery store, I saw a mail-in rebate for a free bottle of shampoo hanging on the Renpure bottle.</li>

      <li>to use and gives a squeaky clean effect.</li>
      <li>clean</li>
      <li>The bottle inself is really cool, I dig the shape.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t get a lot of lather, and you must be sure to rinse it out really well.  </li>
      <li>and right now there is a manufacturer&#x27;s mail-in-rebate where your get the product for free.</li>
      <li>other than that its great</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve never seen so much gray!!</li>
      <li>This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
      <li>I had first purchased the shampoo at my local drug store and then they stopped carrying it, so knowing how much I already loved the product, when I ran out</li>
      <li>Recently, I read about how sulfate-based detergents are used in most shampoos, and wondered if getting a more natural product would in turn make my hair feel more natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only downside I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as your everyday SLS filled shampoos, but it still cleans wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>My hair is dry now, and as I run my fingers through it there is an incredibly lightweight feeling, unlike yesterday, when I had to load it up with conditioner to achieve a similar feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it works just fine, but sometimes my hair gets to a point where after using this, it just doesnt feel clean enough.</li>
      <li>Add a little conditioner and im all good to go.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding great shampoo</li>
      <li>It did the same thing to my boyfriend&#x27;s hair too, and his was healthy virgin hair.  </li>
      <li>But if you have brunet hair and do not want to light it up, then stay clear.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t even get through the first bottle.  </li>
      <li>well, we&#x27;ve been married 13 years</li>
      <li>pretty scent and lathers up a lot if you like that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have tried many organic shampoos and many of them have left my hair feeling heavy, dirty and lifeless.  Not this shampoo!  Everyday after using Renpure my hair is left feeling clean and healthy.  I absolutely love the way my hair looks using this product....AND it&#x27;s organic!!  Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, and when I realized that I could get it for quite a bit cheaper here than at CVS, I ordered it and signed up for subscribe and save so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about when to order more.  The shampoo came after a 90 degree day, so maybe that was part of the problem (softer plastic maybe?), but the top had popped off the top of the bottle and the bag that the shampoo was placed in had probably a good 1/4 cup of shampoo in it.  It is still usable and I will use it out of the bag, but it is a mess that I shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with!  I&#x27;m going to see how my next delivery goes, and if I have the problem again, I will take my business elsewhere.  I also attached a picture.</li>
    <li> This is a changed recipe, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it did! Before it was AWESOME! I had to order this on line because the stores stopped carrying it.  I bought several bottles and I didn&#x27;t even get through the first bottle.  I stopped using it, it made my hair greasy by mid day.  I gave the other bottles away. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for most. I have a hard time finding great shampoo and I was so disappointed to see that it was a different product sold in the same bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my thick, wavy hair feeling soft, clean and lightweight. I have noticed that my hair stays cleaner longer and my scalp isn&#x27;t as oily or flaky (a surpise that this has almost all but got rid of my dandruff which Head &amp; Shoulders never could do). I am pleased with everything except for the weird, strong citrusy smell.      By the way, it is not 100% organic (because it is not all from vegetable source) but has no chemicals, parabens or sulfates. I think it lathers just fine. It&#x27;s not going to lather like a typical drugstore shampoo (which make my scalp itch and dry my hair) because Renpure is all natural. I have used organic products before and am used to this. Lather isn&#x27;t necessary for cleaning and many times products that produce heavy leather are very drying.     Aside from the smell which is fine after rinsed out and smells lightly of grapefruit, I will probably purchase this shampoo again. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it from this vendor however because even thought the price is low, the shipping is high. You would have to purchase several bottles in order to benefit from the low price. Check your other beauty stores such as ulta where it is 6.99 and right now there is a manufacturer&#x27;s mail-in-rebate where your get the product for free.</li>
    <li> The bottle clearly states in Big Bold letters: \\&quot;All Renpure Formulas Are Color Safe.\\&quot; Gail just came out from the shower after have just used this shampoo and guess what? The bottle lies!!! She went in to the shower a brunette and came out....... well, we&#x27;ve been married 13 years and I&#x27;ve never seen so much gray!!</li>
    <li> It has chamomile as one of the ingredients. And chamomile is a natural highlighter. I was looking at all chamomile shampoos on the market and decided to give it a try. I love how my hair color lightened and started to shine over 2 month use. But if you have brunet hair and do not want to light it up, then stay clear.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I am not necessarily unhappy with it.  However, I am still looking for a sulfate-free shampoo that is also a conditioner to replace the Wen I no longer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this primarily because it had fewer ingredients that the other items I looked at and seems to be relatively natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it still didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as good as Wen, nor was it an all-in-one product, so I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
    <li> I saw this conditioner in the grocery store and picked it up because it had a \\&quot;try me free\\&quot; mail in rebate form and I had just ran out of another organic brand that was discontinued, so I could no longer get it. Compared with the results I got from the discontinued brand, Renpure just doesn&#x27;t cut it.     I have very dry, thick and kinky hair. When I apply this product it barely softens my hair and it is still very dry. The other brand would literally \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the kinks out of my hair and it eliminated much of the dryness which lasted all day. As far as tangles, I agree to some extent, with the other reviewer. My hair is easier to comb with Renpure rather than just wetting my hair with water and trying to comb through it, but I know there are better products out there.    Disappointing results, but at least I was reimbursed.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this because it&#x27;s sulfate free, but ended up hating it.  Weighed my hair down, made it greasy, and made me feel like i was rubbing dirty oil on my scalp every night.  Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to gluten, this is a great shampoo. Free of many harsh chemicals so it is safe for your color, but at the same time out performs all the natural hair care products I&#x27;ve found. This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
    <li> I loved it.  I like the way it makes my hair feel after I use it.  It&#x27;s My favorite product!</li>
    <li> This cleans without stripping and helped retain my color but my hair was flat and greasy looking within hours. This is probably great shampoo for people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have pretty normal, thick hair, but lately all of the shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve been using have been bogging it down and making it difficult to style properly. And it gets dirty so quickly, which means that sometimes it&#x27;s dirty by the end of the day! So I started trying new shampoos and conditioners, with little luck, . Recently, I read about how sulfate-based detergents are used in most shampoos, and wondered if getting a more natural product would in turn make my hair feel more natural as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While browsing at the grocery store, I saw a mail-in rebate for a free bottle of shampoo hanging on the Renpure bottle. I thought that it couldn&#x27;t hurt to buy this brand because if it didn&#x27;t work the way I wanted it to I wouldn&#x27;t be out any money. I brought it home and tried it today in the shower. And the experience was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I used on my hair today was the Renpure shampoo - no conditioner, no straightener, nada. Since I have thick hair I washed my hair twice with it, and then combed it out and let it air dry. I am thrilled with the results! Typically, if I use shampoo by itself, my hair tangles horribly. Today, my first shock came when I combed it out, because there were absolutely NO TANGLES. That&#x27;s never happened to me before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use conditioners, my hair becomes silky but very heavy, and then, with all that conditioner in it, it got greasy and dirty extremely quickly. Ugh. My hair is dry now, and as I run my fingers through it there is an incredibly lightweight feeling, unlike yesterday, when I had to load it up with conditioner to achieve a similar feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually if I let my hair air dry, it crimps and ripples and simply looks \\&quot;wonky\\&quot; for lack of a better word. But I just went and looked in the mirror and my jaw dropped! My hair is following the curve of the haircut I got a few weeks ago, and it looks like it&#x27;s been styled! It&#x27;s not perfect,of course, but there were no bumps or wrinkled bits or odd ripples like my hair normally has. I am, in a word, blown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing was learning about the product and family that makes it. I read the ingredients in the shower today, and then laughed out loud when I got to \\&quot;Not Tested on Animals\\&quot; part, because underneath that line it said, \\&quot;Tested on the Redmonds.\\&quot; Ha! That&#x27;s fabulous!am, in a word, blown away.    My favorite thing was learning about the product and family that makes it. I read the ingredients in the shower today, and then laughed out loud when I got to \\&quot;Not Tested on Animals\\&quot; part, because underneath that line it said, \\&quot;Tested on the Redmonds.\\&quot; Ha! That&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! The product is not organic and certainly gave me a strong itch and dried up my hair like crazy even with using a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine had the same reaction from this product.  We were so itchy and starting complaining about our shampoo and how its ruining our scalp and found out its this brand that is causing this!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. couldn&#x27;t buy is locally anymore adn once again I turned to Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;A great product</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos claiming to be color safe. I have found through research and trial and error that the shampoos that contain no sulfates are really the only ones that protect color. My hair is 75% gray and I color it a dark red shade, which is the worst combination as far as retaining color goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RenPur retains the color so well I do not notice any color change until about week 4. I have no idea what that one reviewer was talking about when he said his wife came out of the shower with gray hair. Hard to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this formula because it cleans my oily scalp/dry ends evenly and does not leave it dry or greasy, which others have done. I see no difference between this product&#x27;s performance and the top of the line $75 shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matching conditioner is adequate, but not the best, which doesnt matter really, its the shampoo that fades the color.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo.  My hair is fine and tends to be on the drier side.  This shampoo is moisturizing without be heavy.  Not to mention it smells great.  I really have no idea if it boosts the volume if my hair because I also use volumizing conditioner.  I do think it adds shine to my hair though.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo.  I wish I could still find it in stores.</li>
    <li> I have medium hair both in thickness and in dryness. I don&#x27;t color or otherwise treat my hair but I bought this because I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of chemicals. This is a safe product. Unfortunately it kind of weighed down my hair. My hair felt weird after washing. It was clean but hard to style. My hair just wanted to lay flat. Tried it for a couple of weeks but then gave up on it.</li>
    <li> Love this product line and I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and hair, yes, hair.  But this purchase seems like older, discontinued stock because the scent is not its usual scent, a little less scenty and smells more kindergarten paste or modeling clay. Love product line, would buy up loads if I can find in the stores like years ago. Would not buy from here again though. Moving to Gud by Burt&#x27;s Bees or Hair One at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have thick bleached hair and my husband has thin, fine hair and we both love this conditioner. I think it is because of the protein in it. It keeps my hair from breaking and ads body and thickness to my husbands hair. I also use the conditioner. I put it on my dry ends before I get in the shower and then shampoo my hair and lightly rinse it.  This brand can be hard to find in stores. I first tried it from my local Wal-mart and when I went back to buy it again they had stopped carrying it! I ordered 2 shampoo, 2 conditioner and one of the miracle reconstructors online and they shipped for free. It was a great deal. I have one of the shampoo to my husbands daughter who has fine hair as he does. I am waiting to hear back but, I think she likes it!</li>
    <li> Very misleading name. Although this product contains some organic ingredients it is definitely not organic nor is it all natural.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a sulfate-free shampoo and haven&#x27;t found one that has captured my loyalty. Its a nice size although kind of a weird shape. The smell is a little weird, but I&#x27;m used to mroe flwoery soapy scents so I think its the chamomile throwing me off. I haven&#x27;t had ANY of the bad side effects mentioned here with scalp issues or stripping my hair color. I&#x27;m a redhead so I&#x27;d notice fast if there was an issue and I&#x27;ve seen none. My hair feels clean but also feels a little less silky and soft than it has been with other shampoos. Not a deal breaker, but I don&#x27;t think this will be my go-to shampoo once this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo... the fragrance is so nice, leaving you hair so clean and feels great, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mature man, I often have to put on hair gel just to keep the hair down : D  but not with this shampoo.  I use it every other day and don&#x27;t need any hair gel at all.  And it looks great ; full and fresh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be a day soon, wherein a prospective buyer can sample a fragrance by way of the internet... something to ponder.&lt;br /&gt;But in the meantime, get a bottle, you&#x27;ll love how your hair will look; shiny, healthy, clean and full of life....</li>
    <li> It smells delicious and the smell lasts. Also, it actually gives me some volume unlike most natural shampoos. Only complaint is the bottle shape. I would prefer a shape that I could stand upside down.</li>
    <li> The Renpure Organics I Love My Hair Body &amp; Shine shampoo was aptly named.  Natural ingredients, great smell, thick creamy shampoo rich, foamy lather that delivered exactly what the title promised--great body.  I had first purchased the shampoo at my local drug store and then they stopped carrying it, so knowing how much I already loved the product, when I ran out I got online and bought 3 bottles.  Oops, there was a problem!  Sometime within the last year they changed the product (but not the name or bottle design).  It&#x27;s not even close to the same shampoo.  Different smell, thin, runny consistency, weak lather and the body?  No - no volume, the shampoo is over-conditioning and leaves hair flat.  Too bad I&#x27;m stuck with 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> I love the brand, but this specific type made my hair feel too dry and very hard to manage when it was wet..&lt;br /&gt;I will switch back to the type that I used prior to this.</li>
    <li> the only organic shampoo i use. smell great, leaves hair beautiful, natural ingredients and of course priced right.  ( comes in other colors but i like green the best) yes conditioner too !!</li>
    <li> Great product,very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a non-sulphate shampoo for a while now, and happened upon Renpure. It sounded good, so I bought a bottle for me and my boyfriend to try. The bottle inself is really cool, I dig the shape. The shampoo also smells good. But I ran out of my regular, truly non-sulphate shampoo, so I started using the Renpure. It left my healthy (henna colored) hair dry like straw, and sucked out some of my color. It stripped all the moisture out of it like it was a cheap store brand shampoo. It did the same thing to my boyfriend&#x27;s hair too, and his was healthy virgin hair.  Maybe this would work for some people, but I would not recommend. I&#x27;m going to be using Wen for now, and trying some other brands too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a shampoo that gives consistent results.  Like most people, I&#x27;d find a great shampoo, but after six months or so, have to change to another brand.  I&#x27;ve used this Renpure Organics shampoo for over two years now without having to find another product.  I love how light and clean my hair feels after shampooing with Renpure.  I have thin hair and this product does give it both body and shine.  Plus, it stays clean and has body longer than other products I&#x27;ve used.  I think this is mostly due to what this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have in it.  There are no sulfates, parabens, colors or dyes.  You won&#x27;t get a lot of lather, and you must be sure to rinse it out really well.  The end results are far superior to any other brand of shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve also not had to use any conditioners since beginning with this shampoo.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores around my area, so thank heavens for Amazon!  I plan to stock up so I don&#x27;t have to worry about not having it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me note here, I do not know if you will get the same results with color treated or chemically treated hair!!  My hair is in a natural state now, and I didn&#x27;t try this product when I was still coloring it.</li>
    <li> I love the Renpure Conditioners like My Foxy Hair Needs Fixing and Amazing Miracle so I thought I&#x27;d see if their shampoo was equally wonderful but I found it to be just okay.  I have fine straight/wavy hair and the shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel *clean*. When I ran my fingers through it after rinsing, it still felt like there was oily residue on my hair and I ended up using a different shampoo to wash this one off.  On the other hand, my boyfriend has been slowly using up the abandoned bottle for the last month or so and I&#x27;ve heard no complaints from him so your experience may be different.</li>
    <li> actually adds volume to my limp hair!! pretty scent and lathers up a lot if you like that. i really like the deep conditioning treatment same line</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this shampoo for a month now, and it is hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Seriously.  I&#x27;ve tried shampoos that seem to leave my hair very moisturized at first, but then my hair looks greasy the next day.  With this shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t leave that squeaky feeling after washing, it leaves my hair feeling SOFT even while it&#x27;s still wet!  The only downside I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as your everyday SLS filled shampoos, but it still cleans wonderfully.  It&#x27;s true, after using this product I Love My Hair!  This will be a permanent item on my subscribe and save list.</li>
    <li> It does NOT add body or shine, it&#x27;s just a regular shampoo  and seems to  makes my hair frizzy.I had better expectation!</li>
    <li> Without the toxins! All natural! Better than most I&#x27;ve tried on store shelves too. I have naturally dry hair and this shampoo is great.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing and has great ingredients, you cant beat the price especially delieved right to the house! I have ordered 2 already and plan on a third.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo!  I have a sulfate allergy and this is the only Shampoo I will use. Smells good and gets hair clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with using various hair products, even inexpensive ones.  What&#x27;s the worst thing that can happen when trying something new?  The conditioner won&#x27;t really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my experience with Renpure Organics \\&quot;I Love My Hair! Body and Shine Shampoo\\&quot; was horrible.  My family purchased it during a sale and this summer while we were visiting, I used it for four weeks because that was what was in the guest bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks my scalp actually started to bleed and scab.  After forgetting to pick up a new shampoo and conditioner in town I used it again (thinking, could the shampoo really be doing this?!?!?!) while being careful just to use it on the bottom of my hair and not my scalp.  Things still got worse (although that was reason enough to make the long drive into town, since we live in a rural area, to buy a new product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what is in this that was so damaging (I definitely didn&#x27;t expect that in an organic product) but whatever it was did horrible, horrible things to my head.  I haven&#x27;t used it in days and my scalp still seriously hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is my hair shiny?  It&#x27;s about average right now.  But I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.  Ever.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. My hair feels cleaner and stays cleaner longer. I don;t get the itchy skin when the shampoo washed over me and I don&#x27;t get dandruff as often anymore. This is a really great natural product.</li>
    <li> My letter to Renpure -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi, I used to buy Renpure I Love My Hair shampoo all the time over the past many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula went from Organics -&amp;#62; Originals -&amp;#62; the new 2015 formula, each with cheaper ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You used to have certified organic extracts, those were removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &amp;#34;Renpure Originals&amp;#34; the 6th and 7th ingredients used to be Chamomile Flower Extract and Green tea extract, now...&lt;br /&gt;Acrylates Crosspolymer, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Fragrance, Triethanolamine - all come before the natural extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is disappointing. Most of the time, business decisions come down to economics and bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for a family run business that you promote as such, it&#x27;s simply sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the majority of the public won&#x27;t even notice, but I did - and won&#x27;t be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originals:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside (Coconut Oil [Derived Source]), Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate (Vegetable Oil [Derived Source]), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Oil [Derived Source]), Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate (Palm Oil [Derived Source]), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Certified Organic), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (Certified Organic), Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (Certified Organic), Panthenol, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Distearate, Glycol Stearate (Palm Oil [Derived Source]), Polyquaternium-47, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside (Coconut Oil [Derived Source]), Glyceryl Oleate, Amodimethicone, Glycerin (Vegetable Oil [Derived Source]), C11-15 Pareth-7, Laureth-9, Trideceth-12, Benzophenone-4, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Citric Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015 formula:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Acrylates Crosspolymer, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract (Matricaria), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (Green Tea), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Glycerin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil (Sunflower), Panthenol, Cetyl Betaine, Coco Glucoside, PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Oleate, Amodimethicone, PEG 150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PEG 6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Polyquaternium 47, C11 15 Pareth 7, Laureth 9, Trideceth 12, Benzophenone 4, Trisodium Ethylenediamine, Disuccinate, Citric Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate</li>
    <li> Shampoo does not lather like normal shampoo. Does leave hair shinny so seems like a trade off. Love the conditioner however!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. It is the best product on the market and I love it. I have tried as many shampoos as there are out there (I am exaggerating a little bit). I have a few hair problems and when I started losing my hair at one point - most probably due to lupus - this is the shampoo that helped me the most. Please, do not misunderstand my claim; I am not saying that it stopped my lupus-hair-loss. But this shampoo does feel better than anything else out there. I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I try to use natural or organic products as much as I can. I have used several natural shampoos, and I like this one alot. 9/10 times I use it it works just fine, but sometimes my hair gets to a point where after using this, it just doesnt feel clean enough. Then i gotta pull out the old bottle of whatever stuff I used to use, and my hair gets all frizzy, but feels clean. Add a little conditioner and im all good to go. So for the fact that maybe once every week and a half I switch to a non natural shampoo just to get that extra clean, i give it a 4 star. other than that its great i will continue to try other renpure products.</li>
    <li> will def. be buying it again. great shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> OK...this may be a weird complaint! But the conditioner made my hair way to soft? I couldn&#x27;t do a darn thing with it, it has natural curl &amp; finger waves and I had to use extra styling products. The lather is nice... cost good - love the scent. I would have loved the softeness when I was younger and had VERY long parted in the middle hair I just washed, dried and was on the go. But now have to tame it with styling products &amp; flat iron. Wish I could go back to those care free days of the 70&#x27;s...LOL</li>
    <li> I like the organic - ness of this knowing that only purity is being used to&lt;br /&gt;wash my hair.  It leaves a great body of cleansing on my scalp.  Very&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and gives a squeaky clean effect.</li>
    <li> My wife and I were looking for an organic product for our hair and this fit the bill perfectly!! Thanks</li>
