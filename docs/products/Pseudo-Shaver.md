### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The pseudo  shavers is perfectly designed with its rounded edges so it doesn&#x27;t dig into my skin.</li>
      <li>And the tip works almost perfectly every time for removing hair after using a depilatory cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is a very good alternative to using that &amp;#34;dangerous&amp;#34; metal razor blade.  </li>
      <li>This shaver is the ideal tool for removing your depalatory cream.</li>
      <li>Its also great for travelers like myself.</li>
      <li>This product works great.</li>
      <li>Works great for me.  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect shaver for men who use Magic Shave to shave.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>Its amazing .</li>
      <li>This is a nicely designed razor with a nice balance to it and easy to handle .  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy using this product!</li>
      <li>and I look forward to many more years to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found using magic shave</li>
      <li>Nice and smooth shave result</li>
      <li>quicker then magic shave...</li>
      <li>Most of the time I couldn&#x27;t get all of the hair off.  </li>
      <li>It works ok, but I like</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m still glad I have it</li>
      <li>A damp washcloth works better than this shaver.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to get this before I tried using magic</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, the product is ergonomically designed to provide a very clean shave.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product to anyone who uses a depilatory cream.</li>
      <li>3 times already still nice and crisp.</li>
      <li>I know, most people don&#x27;t believe in love at first site but after watching YouTube videos of multiple satisfied customers and the extremely great results</li>
      <li>solid design and great idea.</li>
      <li>I have used everything from a butter knife to the Ti razor and found the pseudo shaver to be far superior.</li>
      <li>Very useful product.</li>
      <li>I searched for alternatives and discovered love at first site, the Pseudo Shaver.</li>
      <li>the old plastic magic shave razor better.</li>
      <li>It shaves cleanly and closely and gets all the hair.</li>
      <li>, I have tried several non razor shavers and have yet to find a product as good as this shaver.</li>
      <li>The balance is good and the weight is such that it does not slip out of my hand when I use it.  </li>
      <li>It completely removes the magic shave cream which I use to shave with and give me a clean,  close and smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>As a long time Magic Shave user, I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that can remove Magic Shave from my face.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I would NOT recommend this for effective removal of shaving powder.  </li>
      <li>shave again because most guys I know use a old butter knife</li>
      <li>When shaving with it for the first time it feels like shaving with a credit card with just the right amount of sharpness.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!</li>
      <li>When I first thought , &amp;#34;magic shave needs to market this with their product&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>would definitely recommend you try this one if you are a Magic Shave user</li>
      <li>But that doesn&#x27;t do anything for the less than effective manner in which it removes shaving powder from your face.</li>
      <li>It has a tendency not to remove as much hair as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>This shaver has really helped with the process.</li>
      <li>This device works very well.  </li>
      <li>Performed better than any other product in its category.</li>
      <li>I use Magic power every other day.</li>
      <li>Other than that, its much better than using a credit card or butter knife.</li>
      <li>I had three problems: applying and removing the cream quick, clean, and with less irritation.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for purchase.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended  that you try it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend  the pseudo  shaver to all  women for shaving their bikini area without worry of razor bumps.</li>
      <li>Very similar to a razor except it&#x27;s longer, the blade (sort of blade) is just the right thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like many African American men I suffered with razor bumps for a long time.  </li>
      <li>One particular product, which is no longer available in the U.S., provided small plastic razorless shavers, however, the one that I have left is ready to be retired.  </li>
      <li>Removes the cream cleanly and my skin is waaaay less irritated.  </li>
      <li>As far as scraping as some reviewers said, it just depends on your pressure and angle.</li>
      <li>I wish someone would market the straight edge barber type blade that I bought some years ago (the handle&#x27;s broken, but the blade STILL is going strong).</li>
      <li>Before trying the Pseudo shaver, I tried to use depilatory creams with little success.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t need this because it comes off in the shower or with a wet rag</li>

    <li> Very useful product. Due to its simular shape and size of a regular razor this product makes shaving painless. Its also great for travelers like myself.</li>
    <li> As a long time Magic Shave user, I&#x27;m always on the look out for something that can remove Magic Shave from my face.  This device works very well.

    <li> This product works great. For a guy who was military and forced to shave I wish I had this product prior to the bumps . Its amazing .</li>
    <li> solid design and great idea. However, for me while it does remove a lot of hair, sometimes it will leave some that I have to manually remove. Other than that, its much better than using a credit card or butter knife.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical but was tired of the nicks and razor bumps; which most of you should be as well! I searched for alternatives and discovered love at first site, the Pseudo Shaver. I know, most people don&#x27;t believe in love at first site but after watching YouTube videos of multiple satisfied customers and the extremely great results, it was a must buy! I have been using my Pseudo Shaver since January 2014 and I look forward to many more years to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello Pseudo Shaver...Goodbye razor bumps!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product! It is a very good alternative to using that &amp;#34;dangerous&amp;#34; metal razor blade.  I highly recommend this for purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shaver for men who use Magic Shave to shave.</li>
    <li> I have used everything from a butter knife to the Ti razor and found the pseudo shaver to be far superior. It shaves cleanly and closely and gets all the hair. I strongly recommend this product to anyone who uses a depilatory cream.</li>
    <li> Just got this a little while ago and I wanted to get this before I tried using magic shave again because most guys I know use a old butter knife and I tried it years ago and didn&#x27;t like how it felt or worked. This is a nicely designed razor with a nice balance to it and easy to handle .  When shaving with it for the first time it feels like shaving with a credit card with just the right amount of sharpness. I also like the fact that it stands up for storing in the cabinet.  I found using magic shave I really didn&#x27;t need this because it comes off in the shower or with a wet rag but I&#x27;m still glad I have it and it should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Like many African American men I suffered with razor bumps for a long time.  Before trying the Pseudo shaver, I tried to use depilatory creams with little success.

    <li> Amazing product. The bulb helps it not fall out your hand. The 2 idiots that wrote bad reviews didn&#x27;t give this perfect razor less blade shaver</li>
    <li> This is not for me. The big bulb at the end  makes it hard to handle the &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;.  I should cut it off. But that doesn&#x27;t do anything for the less than effective manner in which it removes shaving powder from your face. Once it comes to a somewhat thick part of powder, it tends to glide over it, rather than through it.  It&#x27;s rather heavy, and unwieldy, too.&lt;br /&gt;  I wish someone would market the straight edge barber type blade that I bought some years ago (the handle&#x27;s broken, but the blade STILL is going strong). I&#x27;m not referring to the 3 piece crap straight edge they have out now (been there, done that).&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I would NOT recommend this for effective removal of shaving powder.  The search continues.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  I had three problems: applying and removing the cream quick, clean, and with less irritation.  I solved all problems using a spoon (back) to apply cream and the Pseudo Shaver to remove.  This little guy was just what I needed.  Removes the cream cleanly and my skin is waaaay less irritated.  I recommend.  Now if I can find a cream that works better/quicker then magic shave...</li>
    <li> I bought  the pseudo shaver to shave my bikini area because I always get razor bumps when using a razor blade.  The pseudo  shavers is perfectly designed with its rounded edges so it doesn&#x27;t dig into my skin. It completely removes the magic shave cream which I use to shave with and give me a clean,  close and smooth shave.  I highly recommend  the pseudo  shaver to all  women for shaving their bikini area without worry of razor bumps.</li>
    <li> I use Magic power every other day. This shaver has really helped with the process. There are some metal blade ones on the market but one drop in the shower and the blade breaks. This has stood up to almost daily use well.</li>
    <li> Performed better than any other product in its category. I got a closer shave than my plastic butter knife...Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> i like it, no issues, works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;used 3 times already still nice and crisp. will recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> It works ok, but I like the old plastic magic shave razor better.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth shave result, I have tried several non razor shavers and have yet to find a product as good as this shaver.</li>
    <li> A damp washcloth works better than this shaver. It has a tendency not to remove as much hair as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I use cream depilatories because of facial hair that crops up. One particular product, which is no longer available in the U.S., provided small plastic razorless shavers, however, the one that I have left is ready to be retired.  This pseudo shaver fits the bill.</li>
    <li> When I first thought , &amp;#34;magic shave needs to market this with their product&amp;#34;. This shaver is the ideal tool for removing your depalatory cream. As far as scraping as some reviewers said, it just depends on your pressure and angle. I have coarse beard hair and have been shaving for over 10 years since the Marines so my face has taken towards a bit rougher treatment. Nevertheless, the product is ergonomically designed to provide a very clean shave. Highly recommended  that you try it</li>
