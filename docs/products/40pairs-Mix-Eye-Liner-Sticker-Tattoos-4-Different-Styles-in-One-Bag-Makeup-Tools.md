<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried some on but couldn&#x27;t get them on right? Didn&#x27;t really like but maybe if I tried a little more I could have liked it.</li>
    <li> I received a great variety of liners and they are great quality. Great value for your money!!&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder!</li>
    <li> How come they do not give you pretty ones mostly black &amp; they deceive you because they do not give you the color on the box.</li>
    <li> I love them...they make me feel like a model😉</li>
    <li> Mine came in today!!! So I immediately had to try them out!  Application is easy and it&#x27;s such a fun concept.  Now aligning them isn&#x27;t easy!  It&#x27;s too bad they couldn&#x27;t have a cut/paste chart on backside. I got my right eyeliner perfect but apparently cut left eye wrong leaving a tiny gap between lash line and tattoo... I just filled it in with liner. Since this is just for fun for me anyways... Could never wear for professional work. But at 3.50 it was a fun purchase!  I&#x27;m including a pic of the good eye on first application!  I cut the shape out so I could rest the tattoo against my lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT*  I&#x27;ve had these for awhile and have learned some tricks along the way.  TAKE YOUR TIME APPLYING!!&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure your eyelid is clean and DRY before application.&lt;br /&gt;2) I personally cut the the tattoos from the inner eye, lashline to the wing so that it fits more comfortable on my lid for application.&lt;br /&gt;3) Once cut I put them on my eye reversed (sticky/tattooed side facing out) and see how the look/align.&lt;br /&gt;4) When ready to apply I place against my eye and as close to lashline and corner of eye.  I use a damp cottonball and I don&#x27;t rub the backing, I let the cotton ball sit and soak through than move it to soak through and till backing is completely moistened (The paper should stick to your eye on its own when fully wet and ready to be removed - you can gently lift part of paper if you are cautious and want to make sure tattoo is in place.)&lt;br /&gt;5) Once its set and backing is off, keep your eyes closed!! **THIS IS IMPORTANT!!** Let the tattoo fully dry so as to avoid cracking and flaking.  Dependent on your genetics and eye composition, this may happen anyways.  (oily skin, puffy eyes, etc).&lt;br /&gt;6) Add final touches, more eyeliner to define or fill in gaps, mascara, colored liner on water liner.  HAVE FUN!</li>
    <li> They dont work on the eye lids.</li>
    <li> Came in early which was an unexpected surprise. Used as they arrived. Cut close to the designs. Pat dry. Use some liquid liner if you have some gaps.</li>
    <li> very easy to use just have to get use to lining it right, other than that they look good on models, will buy again</li>
    <li> This are so good I order them again and last for days</li>
    <li> What cheap crap...&lt;br /&gt;I can not believe I brought these...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so difficult to apply and once you do...it looks like you have nasty crackle mess in your crease and top line...!! I will NOT BUY Again...!!!</li>
    <li> Fun for going out or just fun everyday makeup look</li>
    <li> They are AWESOME looking, but they are not for occasional &#x27;put on the face-rs&#x27; like myself.  You have to cut out the liner, and get it all right up next to your lashed, and then HOLD THAT, do NOT BLINK, or TWITCH!!!  Luckily for me, I have a couple of girly friends who don&#x27;t mind plasterting my eyelid to my face to keep it still, but _I_ couldn&#x27;t get them on correctly to save my life. Product is as described, with one small exception. I was thinking for the price that I would be getting a lower quality &#x27;tattoo-sticker&#x27;, but it happened the other way around.  These are SO MUCH nicer than what was available around here, even during the Halloween holiday.  I am going to have awesome eyes at parties for years! I am ordering more, because, honestly, it gives me a reason to invite some friends over and play &#x27;dress-up&#x27;!  Worth five or more times what I paid, easily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got 40 but I wish I got different designs like the red and pink Bundle. They are really awesome</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use any of these as yet, so can&#x27;t really comment.  It looks cool just not sure yet if there&#x27;s two of each design for my eyes, will see how it goes.</li>
    <li> These are fun, but don&#x27;t make a mistake because it&#x27;s not easy to take them off!</li>
    <li> All 40 pairs were the same wich was n9t advertised wont be rebuying this crap. Dont waste ur money please</li>
    <li> So many different styles! They are all fun and interesting, and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> These looked great on but were difficult to remove.  I used them at a teenage birthday party.</li>
    <li> I thought it was coming with all different sorts of eyeliner just came with the same one on all of them.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this product it doesnt look anything like the picture.When I tried putting it on it wasnt as pretty as the picture.I dont recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> A+, well worth waiting for thanks finally received the item today after waiting more than a month for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;thank you and best regards.</li>
    <li> Look cool at first. Fun idea. Tattoo peals off or cracks as you move eyelids</li>
    <li> None of the designs pictured arrived.  I have a pack of butterfly eye tattoos.... the entire package is the same ugly fesin.  Very misleading.</li>
    <li> Love them they go on so nice . Easy to take off . Everyone loves them when I wear them</li>
    <li> These are nice but will take a few times of trying to get them on just right.  You also need to cut them down A LOT to put them on.</li>
    <li> Fun little tattoos, a little hard to apply but fun none the less. They are just like the tattoos that I played with as a child. You take the clear top off and place it on the skin. Then you take a wet sponge and place it on the paper, the tattoo removes from the paper and adheres to your skin. It comes off with baby oil. Stays on for days even after taking a shower if you do not use any oil based make up removers. Just be cautious they are hard to get on even. Takes time and practice.</li>
    <li> These are super easy to use</li>
    <li> I must not know what I am doing, I couldn&#x27;t get these to work if my life depended on it, I can&#x27;t even say how many I distoryed trying to get them to work... I am sorry about this review but I really worked hard to try and get them to work on me.</li>
    <li> these are so awesome! After one practice test i had no problem applying them at all! They go on easily, look great, &amp; come off with eye makeup remover!</li>
    <li> The only good thing about this product is that I received it before time. Bad thing is its not what I ordered . I was supposed to get different designs and I didn&#x27;t and they look cheap. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a one because  when will I ever get to wear these designs.  Halloween&lt;br /&gt; is only once a year.  Did not transfer well.</li>
    <li> After receiving the product and opened it there was only four ..... The ad says 40 pairs.... Now four is not 40!!!!!!! I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> you get a lot for your money and the styles are all diffrent. It took a few trys to get them lined up just right but it was fun. I wish they were pre cut though.</li>
    <li> First off to get them delivered to my front...awesome!  I simply adore these ...if your not good with following the instruction that&#x27;s clearly printed on the back...go to youtube.  They have a couple of girls who take you through the process step by step.</li>
    <li> I love this my kids love this. We use these all the time. I will order some more in the future</li>
    <li> I really like this priduct. I would recommend it. Many colors and choices to choose from. Good for any occasion.</li>
    <li> they were really really hard to put on correctly, and they do not come off once you get them on. i scrubbed and scrubbed till my skin hurt to get it off. tried to master it but they just wearnt meant for the normal type of eye shape! they were too straight. normal eyes are far more curved than that! wish there were different sizes!</li>
    <li> These were fantastic. I found them very easy to put on but I did watch a few YouTube tutorials (HIGHLY recommended). Make sure you also purchase a remover for these. Without some oil, these will NEVER come off. I rubbed my eye raw before finally purchasing some baby oil on our trip to remove them. So fun, really gave my Mardi Gras attire an extra kick!</li>
    <li> For the cost, I figured I&#x27;d give these a try. I had a lot of doubles. I also had a reaction to the glue that is used with these, and my eyes are still sore a week later.</li>
    <li> they arrived wayyyy earlier than I expected but when I received them, they were just beautiful.  if not used as intended you can use them as a stencil to use your own eyeliner or pigments to enhance, there are spaces to add gemstones. and the designed are very creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be referring and ordering more of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very important note, they are true to size and the area in which they are to be placed</li>
    <li> I was soo glad with this purchase !! The subtle touch of Extra POP was a No Brainer !&lt;br /&gt;The price was great. I am going to use these of a new concept and I will RE Oder again from this fine retailer!!</li>
    <li> Not worth buying. Hoping they come up with. Stincil that. You can trace yourself</li>
    <li> This product is cool! I have to figure out somethings but, it works.</li>
    <li> These are stupid.  I thought I&#x27;d get them for some parties for Halloween. Of course I tried them out prior to the party night and it was a disaster.  Putting a temporary tattoo on your eye?  What?  First, how do you even see to do it?  Then you have to hold your eye still while you put water on there and hope it&#x27;s in the right place (which it won&#x27;t be), and then once you pull the paper off, the tattoo will try to come off also messing up the entire thing.  So then what do you do?  You have to remove what&#x27;s left.  Oh but wait!  It&#x27;s a tattoo.  Those things don&#x27;t just come off easily.  Nope.  You have to rub and rub until you leave your poor little eye red and looking puffy.  Don&#x27;t buy these.  Really don&#x27;t.  They irritate your eye all for nothing.</li>
    <li> last for a very long time! this came in the mail fast too! It is not for all skin type!</li>
    <li> this look great ones you figure out how to correctly cut and stick them on.  some dont stay on as well as others this is a major reason it lost a star. But other then that are a must have for those who dont have a lot of time to put on there makeup..</li>
    <li> The product itself i like, very easy perfect for work... HOWEVER it says bundle so you think variety. NO it the same sheet that has 4 styles on it 10 times! And you don&#x27;t get to pick which ones. mine were super simple black eyeliner no color and heart and the end. I cute of the heart and just use them as smudge prof eye liner</li>
    <li> I love how many you get, but I was upset to see I had received one design set twice. Otherwise, they were easy to apply and stayed on very very long - longer than I anticipated, as I spent 20 minutes trying to rub them off! Cool for those of us not gifted in the makeup abilities department.</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T  GIVE IT AN HONEST REVIEW SINCE I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT.  I JUST CHANGED MY MIND AT THE LAST SECOND,</li>
    <li> Still waiting for them.</li>
    <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t used these, but I have read enough bad reviews to steer clear of them. And, as a make up artist I am quite leery. Come on ladies, just practice with your eyeliner. It is ultimately easier to put on eyeliner than cut something to match the exact shape of your eye. Invite a friend over to just do your liner? My friends are too busy for such nonsense. Additionally, and this is important, not every eye pattern is right for everyone. These would look silly on a person with wide set eyes. Pick up a book or google eye shadow patterns, and learn what pattern is best for you. That will ultimately, with a little practice, serve you better.</li>
    <li> These really do look good.I have been using the plain black ones as eyebrows because I had accident leaving me browless on one eye permanently so I shave other side to make things more symmetrical so these were a great find for me. Both for my eyes and eyebrows lol</li>
    <li> This was a great idea waiting to happen. Im glad it did. Came with plenty to share. Will be ordering more when I run out. Thank you...</li>
    <li> Product came before expected which I liked but upon ordering it and then receiving it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. The advertising for this product to me is miss leading. I received 10 packages of the same tattoos. I was looking for a variety like it said 40 PAIRS MIX EYE LINER TATTOOS. If you would like 10 packs of the same thing then order this product.</li>
    <li> horrible - horrible -  impossible to use!!</li>
    <li> These are not stickers. They are those weird temporary tattoos that you have to get wet and hold on your skin for a while. Just try to imagine doing that on your eyelid accurately. Cool idea if they WERE stickers, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this if you can.  They are extremely hard to get soaked and do not stick to your face in the way that it is shown.  I ended up giving this to a friend&#x27;s daughter who plays with it on her arm because that&#x27;s literally how long it takes for it to detach from the paper and then adhesively attach to the skin.</li>
    <li> really hard for me to apply</li>
    <li> Very difficult to put on but beautiful colors!! What a waste!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to work at all.  Really had a hard time with it and would never again order it.</li>
    <li> im not happy at all!!!  i got 40 pairs of the same liner... they work well and are very pritty, but all the same style</li>
    <li> Product is cool, but when you say a mix of the 40 pairs it shouldn&#x27;t be 40 pairs of only 4 styles. I was expecting more than just 4 styles of the same thing.</li>
    <li> I really do like the designs included in this package, but the problem is two-fold. First, the only way to make these look &amp;#34;model worthy&amp;#34; is to cut them as close to the edges of the designs as possible. These aren&#x27;t like temp. tattoos where you just put them on and wet them - you actually need to cut them in order for them to sit on your lid well. The other problem is that even if you cut them perfectly, it&#x27;s hard to see exactly where you are placing them on your lid. I feel that these are better suited to be used by a makeup guru or to be applied by someone else who can see exactly where the shape is sitting on your lid. Again, the designs are awesome, this is just a little too complicated for someone who barely even wears eye shadow more than once a week...</li>
    <li> took 6 weeks to get it. it was going to be part of a gift, but her birthday was over. now what do i do with them? they were too cheap to pay for return shipping... oh well.</li>
    <li> ummm no! very hard to apply, a bit corney when you do apply it. i was just not happy with this product</li>
    <li> These are THE BEST. I thought they would look tacky because3 of the price, but these are perfect!!! Stayed on for 2 days.</li>
    <li> hard to get on and get a clean cover :(</li>
    <li> Bought for my niece. She says they are cute and work well but you need a lot of water to get them on.</li>
    <li> Looks cute....order two from different seller recieve one, will not be ordering but hey its cheap so Im not mad</li>
    <li> These suck. You have to get these right on the eyelid for them to be straight and even then it&#x27;s hard and they hurt. But once you get them on, they look all wrinkly.</li>
    <li> A little trickier to apply than i thought. Be SURE you apply BEFORE other makeup or they wont stay on!! Excellent array of choices. I even wore 2 sets at once and they were very cool, even for everyday wear..</li>
    <li> is exactly what i ordered. worked perfectly as i hoped and was cheaper that chain or department stores here in town. thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these once so far, but they&#x27;re fun &amp; super easy to apply.  Just like a stick on tattoo when you were young.</li>
    <li> Thought I was recieving a mixture . They were all the same</li>
    <li> Fun tattoos and easy to put on.</li>
    <li> These work very well. they only take a minute to apply if you soak them after putting them on. It is the application that is difficult, trim the bottoms as close as you can.</li>
    <li> Update: So I finally got to trying out a pair and I&#x27;m in love!! Definitely worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the first time with just a black pair with flowery designs at the outer corners b/c I could touch it up with black liquid eyeliner if it didn&#x27;t work. I cut as much excess white as I could. Cutting as close to the black as possible. The first eye I started placing at the inner corners and for whatever reason that inner corner didn&#x27;t get any black color on it. For the second eye I started placement at the outer corner with the flowers then wetted the tattoo down to the inner corner. Worked ALOT better. All together it took me maybe 10 mins to do both eyes. Took about 1-2 mins of wetting for each eye. Once on, they do not feel weird or uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with them! They look gorgeous on. I would definitely recommend for girls that are into makeup and have a bit more experience with them. Especially if you&#x27;re using them on yourself. The average girl might not have the patience or practice with eye make up and want to bother with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original: I haven&#x27;t tried them yet... but speaking to the variety I did not get any regular black ones. The all black ones I did get had the flowery designs at the end. I got three all black, the rest have some sort of color. I got 40 pairs... 3 were duplicates. So excited that I got the rainbow pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do take a while to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using! Even if they don&#x27;t work out it&#x27;s a fun experiment imo.. I seriously do hope I can muster my make up talent to make these work though...</li>
    <li> These are so fun to have for a fun night out on the town. I do suggest using a cream based shadow if you are going to use these because a powder shadow will wipe off when you apply the tattoo. they last for days too. I just like using the tattoo itself. Its usually all you need to get a pop and have people asking questions about your eye shadow. I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> hard to put on. I would have to halve huge eyes</li>
    <li> Theses r very awesome haven&#x27;t used yet but I&#x27;ll let u know but I know it will be awesome wearing these at my daughters art shows best time to show off ur stuff</li>
    <li> If its not lined just right it looks odd, takes some practice</li>
    <li> I give it 1 star just because of the designs.  However,  the design that they advertise does not even come in the package and that was the one that I like the most. To put on the tattoos didn&#x27;t take but a minute but you could not see the entire design which was a waste for me. It really does stay on,  but you have to make sure that you cut the tattoo very close and then paste it on your eyelid. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> poor quality fake tattoo&#x3D;hard to apply correctly, and impossible to remove all at once! It was awful to say the least. Interesting concept, but incredibly poor application</li>
    <li> The tattoos arrived quickly (a full week before the expected delivery date) and look exactly as pictured (you get one of each of the sets shown). Some are pretty and some aren&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s how it goes w/ sets like these.&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent it in such a way that my postal carrier needed a signature from me before they would deliver it.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping these work well. If they don&#x27;t, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them as yet, review based solely on delivery time, which took longer than I anticipated being that it came from China, and the contents.  The mix contained two each of 3 particular designs and one each of the other four.  Would have preferred no duplicates to get more of a mix.</li>
    <li> I love these but they can be tricky to put on. Cut them out close to the tattoo on the bottom and match it up to your eye then place a really wet cloth on them and they transfer nicely and stay on. They need to be removed with baby oil.</li>
    <li> I think the designs are great and they last so long as matter of fact it is hard to remove them. The reasons why I don&#x27;t use them even tough I ordered many that they only stick to clean skin surface and once I put eyeshadow on it does not stick but if I put the shadow on after I put this on then the shadow&#x27;s powder falls over it. Also when you cut it out there is a few mm thick edge on them in order to be able to remove the covering paper but  this way no way knowing where are the ends as the paper is not see through so one can never know where the pattern will fall once you won&#x27;t see the tattoo side up. So in order to lay it the best one can I tried to cut it as close to the patterns edge as I could but then I was unable to remove the paper. So basically put it is not the most practical item though it would look amazing. If it come off without water would be much better also with a clear backing in order to see where one lays it.Plus the first things I have written re. the powder from the eyeshadow and etc.</li>
    <li> I love this little investment bundle. I struggle with my cat liner and not to lie you may ruin a few getting used to them but you get 40. I have ordered several stacks of these but I love the choice this company sends is sooo cute. I have perfected this art and get tons of compliments by the way I use them daily will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is more for like lil girls. They don&#x27;t stay on long at all. With make up and sweat prepare for a &#x27;tattoo&#x27; malfunction to happen. This would be fun to play with for the little ones to play around with.</li>
    <li> I could see where these could be cool but the just did not fit my eye (way to small).  They also take a lot of practice to get on and if they move unexpectedly can glue your eye closed (it was not fun).  That being said they were fun colors and I could see where they could be nice.  But they clearly can only be use by people with a certain kind of eye.  What kind of eye that is I am not sure.  Not larger almond shaped eyes and nothing with a deeper crease (even when you get it on most of the tattoo will disappear when your eyes are open).</li>
    <li> I really like the number of designs offer and it was easy to put on...however I do not really get the instructions. I tried several times yet could not get it to look right on my eyelids...or maybe it was just a problem with my own eyes... ._.</li>
    <li> Nothing against the stickers they just weren&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Eazy,super cool, fun to work with, I would certainly recommend this to all my mua friends...fun.com, try them, u will love em</li>
    <li> A little bit of a challenge to apply and remove but the look is worth it all! I wanted to surprise the SO when I met him for drinks and he really loved the way they highlighted my eyes.</li>
    <li> Would have given more stars, but when I ordered this it says 40 PAIRS MIXED EYE LINER .... and what I got was 40 pairs of the exact same thing! In other words 10 identical packages .. no variety. Not happy.</li>
    <li> 20 pairs of cheetah print eyeliner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least they got here pretty fast! That&#x27;s always cool. And the other 20 are black and not so tacky. There really isn&#x27;t much to say about &#x27;em. Would I buy again? Nah I don&#x27;t think so. Should you buy? If you can&#x27;t find a better use for five bucks and you actually don&#x27;t mind the chance you could get all cheetah print, then yeah go for it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you that finish look. It is really hard to put on. And because it is hard cardboard it will irritate your eyes</li>
    <li> I love love love these!!! They are easy to apply and will stay on for a few days!!! Pretty cheap too</li>
    <li> I have eye liner stickers, like these from a local store. These one are like water tattoos. Its hard to get the placement right and even harder to get them off. They slide down really easily as well. I would not buy these again.</li>
    <li> Not easy to apply.  Finally got it on and it peels off in 1/2 hour.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, great product. Lasts and looks good even after a day or so.</li>
    <li> This was a great price and I did get a tremendous selection of both solid black and colorful tattoos.  They are so much fun!  Mine arrived in only a couple of weeks, way ahead of schedule, and they are in 10 packages of 4, so if you want to share them with friends, or give a few as little gifts or stocking stuffers, you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put mine on and they went on fine.  They ARE easy to take off, just use a bit of oil and they come right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it best to cut mine ALL the way to the black or colored liner itself, then BEND it before sticking it to my eye lid.  I used a wet paper towel to apply and for me, application was very easy. I sacrificed my least favorite pack of 4 to getting good at putting them on.  Because there are so many in this set, I do think it is a very good starter set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall that I had is that these are NOT quite long enough for my eyes.  I always had been told I had big eyes, so I guess it is official.  They just don&#x27;t go from end to end of my lash line.  Liquid eyeliner comes to the rescue and extends the look to my inner eye, but I really would like these better if there was an extra 3-4mm at least on them.  They are probably fine for most people.  I&#x27;ll definitely try other brands because I do like the way these look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take them off, just use a q-tip or cotton ball with a bit of oil on it.  Any kind of oil works, and cold cream works too. Be aware though, if you use an oil based make up directly on these, they can come off.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it they work great, just don&#x27;t rub your eyes. I will never review a product again since I&#x27;m required to write so many words, this is my review</li>
    <li> thanks! just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I love every design. It&#x27;s great for my Halloween costume. There are so many in this set to choose from.</li>
    <li> The packet I received only had black liner designs, no colors so that is my main reason for not liking them. I should have gotten at least one colored one by the selection shown in their pictures. In it&#x27;s defense, they apply very nicely, like it says you can wear it more than one day but if it&#x27;s not a colorful unique design why bother, I have liquid eyeliner that I can do more detailed designs, my skin won&#x27;t feel tight and I don&#x27;t wear it overnight so I know it doesn&#x27;t mess with my skin. I did receive 4 different design packets so that was true to their description. I would not recommend these to any of my friends, however if you have trouble applying eyeliner in general then go for it. That&#x27;s really the only reason I can see to buy these.</li>
    <li> The only issue I have is there are no clear instructions so they are a but difficult to figure out how to stick on, but when you catch on they stay really well and will only come off with baby oil.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t  used them yet, but you get a lot of them in your package. I thought it would have been maybe 3 sheets, but you get about 7 of them.</li>
    <li> Super cool and easy to use!</li>
    <li> These are fun as all h*** but super uncomfortable. If you don&#x27;t get them perfectly aligned with your eye, you have to fill in the gaps with eyeliner, which isn&#x27;t much of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;All these are are temporary tattoos, like the ones you&#x27;d get as a kid.</li>
    <li> The product is as described in it&#x27;s header. I don&#x27;t know why the person reviewed there are not any clear directions. They are clear as day on the back of the package.</li>
