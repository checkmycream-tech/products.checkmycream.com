      <li>B0071F6C1S Nioxin DIAMAX INNOVATIVE TREATMENT for THINNING HAIR</li>
      <li>but I love the way it makes my thinning hair feel and look thicker.</li>
      <li>for nothing more than alcohol.</li>
      <li>we both have noticed a thicker texture and greater styling options.</li>
      <li>PRODUCT WAS OK BUT</li>
      <li>I also actually really love the scent of it as well.</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>Combs smoothly and leaves no stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s yet available in salons in Canada, so I ordered it online.</li>
      <li>This product has been good so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>This product is superior to others that I&#x27;ve used because it not only makes my hair look thicker, it FEELS thicker.</li>
      <li>I have used many volumizing and thickening hair products over the years since my hair is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;Diamax</li>
      <li>I  actually won my 1st bottle of Diamax online and just fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>As soon as I used this product, I could smell alcohol (the first ingredient!).</li>
      <li>It is expensive but well worth it, easy to use, with great results.</li>
      <li>I first purchased it from my hairdresser at a higher price.</li>
      <li>I have used many products and they seem to add volume and body to my hair for only an hour, then</li>
      <li>No messing with it at all, except a pretty casual blowdry, and my part looks AWESOME.  </li>
      <li>Diamax is a new product and I am glad it was developed for those thinning spots.  </li>
      <li>It has changed my baby fine thinnish looking hair to a Volume looking head of hair that I can actually work with and style.</li>
      <li>It only took a day or two for me to notice the difference this made in my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This product is a little pricey, but let me tell you, it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
      <li>Pricy amd didn&#x27;t help me much</li>
      <li>I had heard about it and wanted to try it because I have fine/ limp/ straight hair.</li>
      <li>When I found it at a reasonable price, I jumped at the chance to buy another one, even before I ran out.</li>
      <li>I got this product from a local beauty store as a free reward.</li>
      <li>My hair was flyaway; it felt like I put too much conditioner in my hair.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight product, and hair does appear to be thicker after you put it on.</li>
      <li>It is very noticeable to the eyes and feel also.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the last few weeks and it is very effective.  </li>
      <li>is the only product that has made a significant difference.</li>
      <li>OTHER PRODUCTS PRODUCED BETTER RESULTS.</li>
      <li>Fuller appearance, use as directed to get the true benefits - hair didnt grow back but looked fuller.</li>
      <li>I still have almost a full bottle left</li>
      <li>As you get older your hair gets thinner.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I use lots of products to get volume but this one I now can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this for my sister with thinning hair to the top of head - pretty much a thin to a bald spot.  </li>
      <li>I like big hair, so I am always on the prowl for volumizing products, and products that claim to make hair look/feel thicker, bigger, full of body.</li>
      <li>I was surprised.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not a product for ethnic hair in the natural style of Sisterlocks.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at the price.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product thinking my hair would look fuller, instead, it made my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>I would hands down try a new product that promises to do the same thing, only smells better.</li>
      <li>I put on with towel dry wet hair, and it works fine.</li>
      <li>but I am not sure it is helping to thicken my hair, I think volumphosize from Kerastase is much better for that or Viviscal which makes hair actually notice growth.  </li>
      <li>If I miss a day I&#x27;m back to my normal lank locks no matter how much I blow dry.  </li>
      <li>IT IS AN INNOVATIVE TREATMENT FOR THIN HAIR.  </li>
      <li>This particular product is a bit expensive in comparison to the rest, however it&#x27;s guaranteed by most stores, so you can get your money back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
      <li>Also, this product not only thickens the hair, but it makes my hair feel soft at the same time, plus adds shine to my hair.</li>
      <li>I use about 5 squirts on my hair daily after I put anything else as far as staying stuff on my hair, then I pray it on last.</li>
      <li>I use a center part that has steadily been growing wider with enough scalp showing that I try to hide it by messing with it.  </li>
      <li>My 1st bottle lasted about 4 months or so, but now I don&#x27;t have not very long hair.</li>

<li> It works well with blow drying or the flat</li>
<li> Gave it to someone who dont mind since he has short hair, I wanted my hair grow and long without damage</li>
<li> It would not keep a style and was flat as could be.</li>
<li> I only tried it on wet hair before drying, but apparently you can use it on dry hair as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not sure how, but it works!  Results are NOT overnight - at least not for me - I used System 5 in addition to Nioxin Diamax....Within 2 weeks, my hair LOOKED and FELT fuller and thicker! I love it!! [[ASIN:B0071F6C1S Nioxin DIAMAX INNOVATIVE TREATMENT for THINNING HAIR 3.38 oz / 100 ml Niacinamid]]</li>
    <li> This product has been good so far. I have been using this for about 20 days now and it seems to improve the condition or texture of my hair. I am expecting more from a brand like NIOXIN. I was expecting thickening of the hair in future but not sure of number of days of application to see the actual results.</li>
    <li> I got this product from a local beauty store as a free reward. I had heard about it and wanted to try it because I have fine/ limp/ straight hair. I have used many products and they seem to add volume and body to my hair for only an hour, then after awhile my hair would go back to its usual self. I have used Diamax for a few days now and I love the results. My hair seems thicker and has more volume that lasts. Even though this product is expensive, I think it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought the package with shampoo and conditioner real nice product but I am not sure it is helping to thicken my hair, I think volumphosize from Kerastase is much better for that or Viviscal which makes hair actually notice growth.  But don&#x27;t dismiss the great shampoo and conditioner. I even take their \\&quot;vitamins\\&quot; that is not resulting in any difference at least not yet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I first purchased it from my hairdresser at a higher price.As you get older your hair gets thinner. This gives your hair great volume and thickness. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone .</li>
    <li> Diamax does what it claims to in that it does thicken limp and balding spots and even the temple areas.  I use Diamax in conjunction with the follicle booster.  They both work great together.  Diamax is a new product and I am glad it was developed for those thinning spots.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight product, and hair does appear to be thicker after you put it on. I put on with towel dry wet hair, and it works fine. The price on amazon is just a little over 1/2 of what you will pay in a walk in store, so you can actually afford the stuff!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR THINNING HAIR - KEEPS VOLUME ALL DAY LONG  PRODUCT IS EASY TO APPLY AND USE.  IT IS AN INNOVATIVE TREATMENT FOR THIN HAIR.  MY HAIR IS THIN, SPARSE AND MEEK.  WHEN I USE THIS, I GET GREAT VOLUME ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> As soon as I used this product, I could smell alcohol (the first ingredient!). Its drying to the hair and it made my scalp itchy. I can&#x27;t imagine the hype on this product - being so expensive ($50.00 retail a bottle!!) for nothing more than alcohol. Any volumizing spray can do the same thing. I had to return mine. Very disappointing. I don&#x27;t like giving 1 star reviews (karma), so I generously gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> It does make your hair grow a bit.  But you have to keep putting this on a daily basis.  Good product</li>
    <li> I ordered this in hope that it would help with my thinning hair.  Have been using this daily now for several weeks and have seen NO difference in my hair.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product if you have thinning hair due to changing hormones....DID NOTHING FOR ME at all.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and apply this product after each shampoo.  The hair shafts look larger and feels thicker the next shampoo.</li>
    <li> A great product if used as directed  to smooth the hair shaft. It works well with blow drying or the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I find that when applied to slighty damp hair I get the best results.  My hair is very fine.</li>
    <li> I could not tell this product help at all!  The discretion sounded so good, I was very disappointed that it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> It only took a day or two for me to notice the difference this made in my fine hair.  I use lots of products to get volume but this one I now can&#x27;t live without.  It&#x27;s easy to use but you need to part your hair all over and spray into the roots to get it evenly distributed.  I don&#x27;t think the plumping is permanent.  If I miss a day I&#x27;m back to my normal lank locks no matter how much I blow dry.  I was hoping it was a long lasting treatment because it is so expensive but I don&#x27;t think so.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 5 months now and will continue to do so.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last few weeks and it is very effective.  I would recommend it to anyone whose hair is starting to thin.</li>
    <li> It actually ruined my hair. Gave it to someone who dont mind since he has short hair, I wanted my hair grow and long without damage</li>
    <li> Great Product and customer service!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It smells great, too!  My hairdresser says she can see the difference!  So I tried it and I am happy!</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Diamax today.  I immediately washed my hair, and used Diamax as directed-which is to rub it on the scalp.  My hair is a chin length bob. I blew my hair dry and I cannot believe my eyes.  I use a center part that has steadily been growing wider with enough scalp showing that I try to hide it by messing with it.  No messing with it at all, except a pretty casual blowdry, and my part looks AWESOME.  I have some friends with the same problem.  I kind of want to try it on them but I kind of want to hoard it, too. OMG.  I am so happy.  I hope the bottle lasts a long time.  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have used many volumizing and thickening hair products over the years since my hair is very fine.&lt;br /&gt;Diamax is the only product that has made a significant difference. It is expensive but well worth it, easy to use, with great results.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product.  It did nothing to make my hair feel or look thicker.  I am very disappointed. I will stick with what I was using prior to this.</li>
    <li> Not kidding...this is a great product! Since undergoing chemo almost 12 years ago, my hair has been thin and hard to deal with. In the month that I have been using this product...and not telling my hair dresser... we both have noticed a thicker texture and greater styling options. I&#x27;m a believer...this will not be the last bottle that I purchase! Does not weigh my hair down...nice fragrance!</li>
    <li> I finally ordered this after hearing all the raves about it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s yet available in salons in Canada, so I ordered it online. Let me tell you, this product is phenomenal. I like big hair, so I am always on the prowl for volumizing products, and products that claim to make hair look/feel thicker, bigger, full of body. This product is superior to others that I&#x27;ve used because it not only makes my hair look thicker, it FEELS thicker. I wash my hair about every 3 days, and my hair still feels the same on the third day. Also, this product not only thickens the hair, but it makes my hair feel soft at the same time, plus adds shine to my hair. This does not make your hair look or feel crunchy at all. I also actually really love the scent of it as well. This product is a little pricey, but let me tell you, it&#x27;s more than worth it. You&#x27;ll feel like a fox when you use this in your hair. I still have almost a full bottle left and I&#x27;m already ordering my 2nd bottle. Can&#x27;t praise this product enough.</li>
    <li> Pricy amd didn&#x27;t help me much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nioxin Diamax at my hair salon and fell in love! My hair is very fine and Diamax adds a lot of volume and the best part is that you cannot feel or see that you have a product in your hair. I only tried it on wet hair before drying, but apparently you can use it on dry hair as well. I will have to try and see if the effect is the same. I love this product! I&#x27;d definitively recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I probably haven&#x27;t gotton used to it yet but I am using it most every time I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> I WAS SHOCKED AT THE VOLUME AND MOVEMENT I GOT FROM THIS PRODUCT!  I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET AS I HAVE THE DOUBLE CURSE... FINE AND THIN HAIR!  THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I was still skeptical but I figured I would try it anyway. I saw no difference in the before and after, I would not repeat the purchase. It was way to expensive for the lack of results.</li>
    <li> Thrilled to see this offered! Works well on my baby-fine hair!  Was having trouble securing from a local source.  Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I have bought this for my sister with thinning hair to the top of head - pretty much a thin to a bald spot.  Within weeks the hair was growing back and the entire hair on center of the head has become really thick and full.  It is very noticeable to the eyes and feel also.  It does works.  And I encourage her to keep using it.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS OK BUT NOTHING GREAT. PROBABLY WOULD NOT BUY IT AGAIN. OTHER PRODUCTS PRODUCED BETTER RESULTS. IT WAS EXPENSIVE FOR THE RESULTS</li>
    <li> I finished by bottle of this, and I did not see an improvement. I was really disappointed because I watched an interview with Vanessa Lachey saying that it \\&quot;saved her hair.\\&quot; This stuff smells horrible, and I see no difference in the thickness or volume or breakage of my hair. I would hands down try a new product that promises to do the same thing, only smells better. The smell of this stuff almost makes me sick! I just am not impressed with it at all...</li>
    <li> I  actually won my 1st bottle of Diamax online and just fell in love with it! It has changed my baby fine thinnish looking hair to a Volume looking head of hair that I can actually work with and style. I was so thrilled that I bought a bottle here online at Amazon of it. I was surprised at the price. I use about 5 squirts on my hair daily after I put anything else as far as staying stuff on my hair, then I pray it on last. I go a had and blow-dry my hair and style as usual. It drys without being sticky or greasy. It lasts a long time. My 1st bottle lasted about 4 months or so, but now I don&#x27;t have not very long hair. When I found it at a reasonable price, I jumped at the chance to buy another one, even before I ran out.</li>
    <li> Thickens my very fine hair!  Combs smoothly and leaves no stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  I will buy it again.  Also no fragrance!</li>
    <li> Have used it for six months..no real change. May have increased hair growth but hard to just massage into scalp...mostly gets into hair.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair in the crown area of my scalp. Afer reading all the glowing reviews, I purchased this product. I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t plump up the strans of hair in the crown area. The product also made my hair stiff. Maybe it&#x27;s not a product for ethnic hair in the natural style of Sisterlocks.</li>
    <li> Definitely woke up my hair, I would recommend! Fuller appearance, use as directed to get the true benefits - hair didnt grow back but looked fuller.</li>
    <li> Not sure I will order again because it is too expensive but I love the way it makes my thinning hair feel and look thicker. I was surprised. Also I like the fragrance and for someone sensitive to strong perfumes that is a very good thing.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY GOOD AND MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THICKNESS WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE USING IT FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.</li>
    <li> This product works great and even serves as a gel-styling product, however in order to maximize its use, you must be using Nioxin shampoo and conditioner.  I also using a scalp treatment as well; all their # 2 brand which is for thinning hair.  This particular product is a bit expensive in comparison to the rest, however it&#x27;s guaranteed by most stores, so you can get your money back if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking my hair would look fuller, instead, it made my hair so soft. I didn&#x27;t like it at all. My hair was flyaway; it felt like I put too much conditioner in my hair. It would not keep a style and was flat as could be. Oh, and try readying the instructions. The lettering on the bottle is so small, I needed my glasses plus a magnifying glass. Personally, it was another waste of money paid to the manufacturers of Nioxin. Instead of spending money on this produc take yourself out to a nice dinner with a friend.</li>
