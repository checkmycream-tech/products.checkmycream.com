      <li>The coverage is great and my hair feels terrific!</li>
      <li>These products are excellent because they dont include chemicals, the problem is that my hair grows too fast and need to use the every ten days!!!</li>

      <li>Same review as for 7G, my hairdresser mixes these two colors, to give me a beautiful hazelnut colored finish, with all the highlights of natural haircoloring.</li>
      <li>and I feel good knowing it is free of harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>I need to color more frequently.  </li>
      <li>I changed from color 5g to 6g and found the 6g to be a more natural color, a bit darker, without the brassy tones.</li>
      <li>So far so good, I have been using this hair color for several years</li>
      <li>Overall I love Naturtint hair color products</li>
      <li>This is the first time I ever bought 6 boxes of haircolor at one time.</li>
      <li>They also used to include more conditioner, enough for 2 treatments.  </li>
      <li>is a very natural hair color manufactured in Spain where the EU has special restrictions  on the chemicals used in hair coloring products.</li>
      <li>Making sure you use a gentle shampoo will make the color last longer without fading.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle, looks like a real hair color, DOES NOT SMELL.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very gentle on hair and makes your hair very silky.</li>
      <li>But on a positive note, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that Naturtint products do not contain as many potentially harmful ingredients as other brands of hair color do.  </li>
      <li>Right now my hair is super short, so I can get by with using 1/2 a box per coloring session.  </li>
      <li>very intelligent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I felt very compelled to buy a six pack of this dye because I use it alot on my hair and was amazed at how fast it arrived.  </li>
      <li>Really like it.</li>
      <li>Thanks for selling it at a reasonable price</li>
      <li>whenever I notice my gray roots getting really noticeable, which is about every 3-4 weeks.</li>
      <li>I always do tell them and very often anywhere it is sold, it runs out of supply.</li>
      <li>(I usually need to apply it sooner than other hair colors), however, it still is a winner for me because of it goes on safely, easily and leaves my hair in good condition.</li>
      <li>This fit well with my hair as I have grey brown hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing (besides mixing your own henna powder, which is messy) that doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or make it fall out.  </li>
      <li>Mainly, it a rich, natural color and it wears longer than the other brands.</li>
      <li>I intuitively happened to put the small box tab in my wallet, and was able to give it to a woman I met at a natural health lecture.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive scalp and Naturtint does not irritate my scalp.</li>
      <li>This hair coloring completely covers my gray.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>And my hair feels soft, no split ends.  </li>
      <li>This hair color leaves your hair feeling natural, silky and does not get brassy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>Used to use traditional drugstore brands, but developed a sensitivity to them.</li>
      <li>I tried several different shades but finally settled on 6G because it is the closest to what my natural color was before I went gray.  </li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend it for someone who seeks a hair color product without harsh chemicals.</li>

<li> They must have changed the formula at Naturtint a few years ago.  </li>
<li> Now there is a small packet.  </li>
<li> but When i recieved this package 2 out of 6 color box were damaged and useless.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this dye. Doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell of so many others on the market and really seems to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; well in my hair. Way cheaper to buy this way than at the store where it runs $15-18 per box.</li>
    <li> Works very well and the seller was excellent to communicate with when I had an issue.</li>
    <li> A natural hair dye, and it works great! I have terrible allergies. but I do not react to this. And I love the color!</li>
    <li> The coverage is great and my hair feels terrific! This is the first time I ever bought 6 boxes of haircolor at one time.</li>
    <li> This fit well with my hair as I have grey brown hair. Covers the white and does not give any discomfort to my hair sculp.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that Naturtint products do not contain as many potentially harmful ingredients as other brands of hair color do.  I tried several different shades but finally settled on 6G because it is the closest to what my natural color was before I went gray.  This hair coloring completely covers my gray.  In fact, when I tell people that I am 100% gray without it, they don&#x27;t believe me!  Right now my hair is super short, so I can get by with using 1/2 a box per coloring session.  I re-color my hair whenever I notice my gray roots getting really noticeable, which is about every 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> These products are excellent because they dont include chemicals, the problem is that my hair grows too fast and need to use the every ten days!!!</li>
    <li> So far so good, I have been using this hair color for several years and I feel good knowing it is free of harsh chemicals. Will keep ordering from Amazon, they have the best price that I have found.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of hair dye since 2006. It is very gentle, looks like a real hair color, DOES NOT SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to many chemicals - this one has been great. No breakouts, hives, and I used it through three pregnancies (and nursing). None of my children have any health issues (no asthma, allergies, and all three are very intelligent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have white towels. This hair dye washes out of my laundry and wipes off from my granite. The only thing - I recommend using vaseline on your forehead because it will dye your head if you drip!!</li>
    <li> Same review as for 7G, my hairdresser mixes these two colors, to give me a beautiful hazelnut colored finish, with all the highlights of natural haircoloring.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom...she was very happy! The price was great compared to buying at the store. From now on this is the way she will buy hair color.</li>
    <li> This product works so well for me - whether I&#x27;m touching up the gray or going for an all-over boost of color and shine.</li>
    <li> Even though I had three defective boxes in my six pack order. I was able to receive three replacement boxes by Naturtint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years. The in-store price is approx. $15.00, so I jumped at the opportunity to buy it through Amazon (I bought 6 boxes so that I don&#x27;t have to rely on store availability).&lt;br /&gt;This is a very natural hair color manufactured in Spain where the EU has special restrictions  on the chemicals used in hair coloring products. I have sensitive scalp and Naturtint does not irritate my scalp. I&#x27;ve tried other local products that do not contain ammonia, but they are still harsher on the scalp. The color in Naturtint does lack a bit of the lasting power than other products (I usually need to apply it sooner than other hair colors), however, it still is a winner for me because of it goes on safely, easily and leaves my hair in good condition. I would certainly recommend it for someone who seeks a hair color product without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several years.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> Received this item very quickly and was exactly as described from seller. I love this hair color because it natural and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> A great product!After 3 month use I can see a big difference in my hair!And 6 boxes for $40.00,it&#x27;s a huge deal!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now since it does not contain ammonia. Ladies I met in the malls, the streets often ask me what color and the brand name. I always do tell them and very often anywhere it is sold, it runs out of supply. Thus, I resorted to buying by bulk and thus I found Amazon.</li>
    <li> Buy this color and brand exclusively. Used to use traditional drugstore brands, but developed a sensitivity to them. This brand works great AND is a great price on AMAZON. In stores, can run $15 each!! Colors run dark, though. I would normally use a medium brown, but found this color perfect.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. Thanks for selling it at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Great color and easy to apply.  One exception, must apply almost every four weeks to make sure that color stays.</li>
    <li> ESTE PRODUCTO ARREVASA CUALQUIER ESPECTATIVA, LOGRE OBTENER EL COLOR PERFECTO SIN TENER QUE APLICAR DESCOLORANTE,CHICAS SI QUIEREN UN COLOR CLARO SIN TENER QUE APLICAR BLEACH ASU CABELLO ESTE PRODUCTO ES PERFECTO!!! AMI ME FUNCIONO Y NO PIENSO CAMBIARLO.</li>
    <li> This hair color leaves your hair feeling natural, silky and does not get brassy.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for six weeks.  It lightens slightly, but only the new growth gives the clue that it is time to color again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years.  It&#x27;s the only thing (besides mixing your own henna powder, which is messy) that doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or make it fall out.  I think the quality isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be.  They must have changed the formula at Naturtint a few years ago.  The color fades quicker than it used to.  I need to color more frequently.  They also used to include more conditioner, enough for 2 treatments.  Now there is a small packet.  But on a positive note, you can&#x27;t beat the price.  And my hair feels soft, no split ends.  I could give this 4 stars, and if I hadn&#x27;t used the product before, it could get 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Best price for Naturtint, and nice to have a supply on hand.  I have received compliments and inquiries on my hair color.  I intuitively happened to put the small box tab in my wallet, and was able to give it to a woman I met at a natural health lecture.</li>
    <li> I love the beautiful and vibrant color that Naturtint gives my hair. Best hair color I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I felt very compelled to buy a six pack of this dye because I use it alot on my hair and was amazed at how fast it arrived.  It came from the manufacturer and was just what I wanted.  The dye does not contain ammonia so it is alot gentler on your hair! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on hair and makes your hair very silky. All natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I changed from color 5g to 6g and found the 6g to be a more natural color, a bit darker, without the brassy tones. Making sure you use a gentle shampoo will make the color last longer without fading. I&#x27;ve used Naturtint for years and have never been unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> I recently bought 8 boxes after putting my hair through the traditional supermarket brands. This product is made from plants or henna, so it has no ammonia in the ingredients. Mainly, it a rich, natural color and it wears longer than the other brands. Its reassuring when you find something you love and can find it on Amazon...in bulk prices...now thats a winnner!</li>
    <li> Overall I love Naturtint hair color products and i rated 5 star the 4G shade already, but When i recieved this package 2 out of 6 color box were damaged and useless. Also the shade is mostly orangish</li>
    <li> Great product and greater price.</li>
