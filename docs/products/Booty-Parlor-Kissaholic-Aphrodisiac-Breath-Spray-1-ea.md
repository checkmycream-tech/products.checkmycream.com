      <li>This has a very pleasant taste, minty but not too over powering.</li>

      <li>enjoy the flavor, it&#x27;s not too strong and tastes great!</li>
      <li>This stuff if very strong, it bites your tongue and leaves a lingering syrupy aftertaste.  </li>
      <li>Very strong aftertaste ....  </li>
      <li>Kiss tested and approved :)</li>
      <li>Love it and will order more</li>
      <li>Its okay</li>
      <li>I like this better than chewing gum or using mints to freshen my breath.</li>
      <li>...love love love the booty parlor products...</li>
      <li>but this I will not buy again..because it lasts 2 minutes at most.</li>
      <li>My husband took a wiff of the spray and it wasn&#x27;t his favorite considering how strong of mint smell</li>
      <li>Get it if u dont mind a strong minty taste</li>
      <li>Strong to the point where I make the just had a strong shot face &amp; do the strong shot squirm every squirt..</li>
      <li>Tastes REALLY minty but refreshing !</li>
      <li>but hey..it wakes me up LOL not unhappy with it completely?</li>
      <li>This stuff is super strong cinnamon flavor</li>
      <li>The first spray is so strong of cinnamon...</li>
      <li>It is a very hot cinnamon flavor.</li>
      <li>I think I got about a hours worth of breath freshening.  </li>
      <li>cause it tastes like intense mint !</li>
      <li>- very cinnamon you.</li>
      <li>and I live it!</li>
      <li>But, after you recover from the initial zing, you realize how wonderfully fresh your breath is.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong at first and then makes your mouth feel so cool that it almost feels numb.  </li>
      <li>but WOW!  </li>
      <li>The first time you use it, your eyes will open BIG!!  </li>
      <li>but little hot effect.</li>

    <li> The container leaked all over my purse. It is a very hot cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong product...</li>
    <li> Must be the ginger but WOW!  The first time you use it, your eyes will open BIG!!  But, after you recover from the initial zing, you realize how wonderfully fresh your breath is.  Kiss tested and approved :)</li>
    <li> This stuff if very strong, it bites your tongue and leaves a lingering syrupy aftertaste.  I don&#x27;t believe that the breath freshening lasts long.  I think I got about a hours worth of breath freshening.  I will stick with simple Trident gum.</li>
    <li> yummy cimammon. but little hot effect. watch out while spraying.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations</li>
    <li> Tastes like cinnamon yuck</li>
    <li> Shocking breath spray...it definitely wakes you up! Does it have some kind of quality that makes you kissable, I don&#x27;t know, maybe for some, but it&#x27;s an awesome breath spray!</li>
    <li> Tastes REALLY minty but refreshing ! Get it if u dont mind a strong minty taste cause it tastes like intense mint !5 stars!</li>
    <li> Its okay...love love love the booty parlor products...but this I will not buy again..because it lasts 2 minutes at most. The first spray is so strong of cinnamon...you would swear you took a shot of cinnamon everclear (dont know if thats a thing, but imagine the two together &amp; bam its this product). Strong to the point where I make the just had a strong shot face &amp; do the strong shot squirm every squirt..but hey..it wakes me up LOL not unhappy with it completely? But 3 stars because it has zero lasting power!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very strong at first and then makes your mouth feel so cool that it almost feels numb.  My husband took a wiff of the spray and it wasn&#x27;t his favorite considering how strong of mint smell it was.</li>
    <li> Love it and will order more</li>
    <li> This stuff is super strong cinnamon flavor and I live it!</li>
    <li> This has a very pleasant taste, minty but not too over powering. I like this better than chewing gum or using mints to freshen my breath.</li>
    <li> I liked but expensive for small amount gone in 1 week</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes and smells like the fireball candy from the 60s - very cinnamon you. Not at all what expected. Blah...</li>
    <li> Very strong aftertaste ....  Very heavy cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> enjoy the flavor, it&#x27;s not too strong and tastes great! the only thing is that it leaks a little, other than that .... it&#x27;s great!</li>
