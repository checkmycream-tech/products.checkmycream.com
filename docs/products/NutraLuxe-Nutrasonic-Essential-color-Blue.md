      <li>This face brush does a great job, and the price is very competitive.</li>
      <li>it going off on me, and the price is so much better on my wallet..</li>
      <li>I love the way my skin feels.  </li>
      <li>But now I have been able to stop using the prescriptions</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I would recommend to this to anyone with any skin type and you can use it with your favorite face wash.</li>
      <li>Sincerely  Patricia Liedel</li>
      <li>Was very excited to receive the nutrasonic in the mail today...</li>
      <li>I loved this at first.  </li>
      <li>My husband bought my Nutra Sonic for me and at first I was very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>After charging properly, the unit works great, my complexion is better than ever - love it.</li>
      <li>Just grateful that I didn&#x27;t buy replacement heads that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use (the original ones are still fine)&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not pressing or anything, but it definitely is strong-</li>
      <li>After the third day, my skin looks beautiful again.      </li>
      <li>But still works fine.</li>
      <li>but light was still on and making noise.  </li>
      <li>lol When you use the nutrasonic the cleanser gets so deep into your pores</li>
      <li>The body brush is great, too, to use on the back and chest.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First I called the 877 toll free number and after they answered I said, \\&quot;Hi would I be abled to send in my -\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Did a great job at deep cleansing.</li>
      <li>Now, if I put it on the charging cradle, I don&#x27;t even see the charge light coming on.</li>
      <li>I have even dropped it a few times and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>to the user guide, the charging light does not flash).</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>and when I was successful in achieving a neart was near full charge</li>
      <li>But manufacturer has good customer service so far</li>
      <li>I am sure that I made the right choice.</li>
      <li>Yes, the sonic brush costs more upfront than Oil of Olay and Neutrogena, but to me it is so worth it to get results without having to purchase special grit and disposable scrubbing pads again and again.</li>
      <li>It helps clean the pores in my skin and keep it smooth.</li>
      <li>it leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth and my moisturerizer goes on</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and can see a significant difference in the texture of the skin on my face.  </li>
      <li>so i was really excited to get it.</li>
      <li>Since I no longer had the original packaging I could not return it.</li>
      <li>nose has been significantly shinier, but I can tell the pores are not as visible as well.  </li>
      <li>After the first time, my skin looked much better.  </li>
      <li>But, Neutrogena made several changes that did not work for me - discontinuing their more effective exfoliating pads, alterning their original pad to one that feels like a foamy cotton ball (not exfoliating at all), and creating a pad that spins instead of vibrates</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m amazed at how clean my skin feels.  </li>
      <li>When I got the first one, I read the reviews, and there were a lot of reports of battery issues, which I have not (so far) experienced with my first unit.</li>
      <li>Another good thing is, it doesn&#x27;t require to be charged daily.  </li>
      <li>I loved the way the NutraSonic works, but after about 2 months, during which time I used it only once a week, it no longer charges up.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will say it arrived quickly and was accepted for a full refund without any problems.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of my skin after, but I previously cleaned with a ecotools sponge, which gives me a great clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>She was very pleased with the results she saw (me too), but after about 3 weeks of twice daily use, the item broke.</li>
      <li>-Nice weight and feel; easy to hold even when wet.          </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really clean and refreshed after using, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is well worth the money. After using it for a few weeks, I can say that my skin has never looked better. The only gripe I have is that it doesn&#x27;t consistently hold a charge. Sometimes I can get several uses out of it before it needs to be recharged, other times it will stop working after a few seconds even after it has been in the charging cradle for almost a whole day. But, I&#x27;m still happy I bought it.    Revised review: In less than two months, this thing totally stopped working no matter what I did. Started turning on by itself, would never hold a charge, and then just died. For almost $100, pretty disappointing. Good product when it worked.    Revised, revised review: The company sent me a new one and it works great! I also really missed not having one, and was overjoyed when the new one arrived. Makes a big difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I thought of buying the more expensive versions but now I am so glad I tried this first.    At 41, my skin was dull and i hated looking in the mirror, now with the Nutrasonic, the dullness is gone, it is clearer and I have that rosie glow.    I love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought the NutraSonic skin care system brush because I had alway wanted the Clarisonic one, but after reading all the information I could find on both I decided this one was the best choice for me. I am a frequent customer of amazon and I found this brush by accident while looking for the bigger name brand one. Now that I have it at home for the last few weeks I am sure that I made the right choice. It works great and leaves my skin tingly and clean with just the softest brush head. I would recommend this to a friend or family member. The only negative thing is the way it is a bit messy and slings the cleanser off the head and onto the surroundings. I am not sure if other brushes would do this cause this is the only one I have had, except for the very weak ones offered at the local wal-mart. I solved this problem easily enough by just standing in the middle of the bathroom floor unitl it gets off and running before I get near the mirror and counter. I almost forgot to mention that the price was wonderful and about 1/2 the amount of the pricer one I had wanted in the beginning.   Vickie</li>
    <li> I received the blue model of the NutraSonic as a gift from my husband.  We had to return the first one, and now second one, because both would not hold a charge.  Both items only worked for a short time before stopping, no matter how long I left them in the charger.  When they did work, they were excellent for cleaning and increasing circulation to the skin.  My skin became noticably smoother after the first use, and the color and tone of my skin seemed to be improving.  I like the product enough that I will contact the seller (not from Amazon) or the manufacturer to get another replacement.  If the 3rd one fails to hold a charge then I might try the Clarisonic or a different brand.  Bottom line ... I think it&#x27;s well worth a try and it does what the manufacturer says ... when it holds a charge.</li>
    <li> I had been saving for a Clarisonic, but when I saw the NutraSonic, I decided to try it instead.  I am very happy with this product.  The only difference I can really tell between this and the Clari is that there is not a built-in timer...but do I really need to spend an extra $150 to get a timer??? I noticed a difference in my skin after just a few days.  I has been a few weeks now, and my skin is looking so much better!  It comes with three brushes, sensitive, regular and body, and are easy to change out.  I mistakenly started with the regular brush (it helps to read the instructions), but was pleasantly surprised when I did not have any irritation, even on my ultra-sensitive rosacea skin.  The body brush is great, too, to use on the back and chest.  The charge lasts for about 5 days for me, with morning and night use, so I would even be able to take it on short trips without the charger.  I would highly recommend NutraSonic!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this because the cost simply seemed too high for a face care product.  But with forty looming, I decided it was not unreasonable to start paying a little more to maintain my skin.  I have to say the product has exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and can see a significant difference in the texture of the skin on my face.  And I&#x27;m amazed at how clean my skin feels.  I&#x27;ve also been using the body brush and notice softer, smoother skin from that as well.  This has changed my face routine from being a chore to a little luxury.  I have not used the Clarisonic, so cannot compare it to that as far as performance goes.  But to compare features, this one is less expensive than the Clarisonic, has four speeds including a pulsating one and has three brushes (sensitive, regular and body).  So here are the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s as I see it-    Pro&#x27;s:  -Can be used both in and out of the shower.          -Nice weight and feel; easy to hold even when wet.          -Keeps a charge for 4-5 days (this is using it twice a day on my face plus in the shower.)          -Charger is completely enclosed so water and contaminants cannot corrode the contacts.          -Four speeds.          -Three different types of brushes (and the brushes have nice, ventilated covers).          -Low charge warning:I don&#x27;t know if this is intentional or not, but when mine starts to get low, it will              turn on for a few seconds, then shut off temporarily.  It then turns back on and easily has enough power to           finish up.  This way I know it&#x27;s time to recharge, but I&#x27;m not left halfway through cleaning my face with           no power.          -While not exactly travel size, it is compact enough to pack in your bag.  And if you&#x27;re only going away for          a couple of days, a full charge should be enough to last you and you won&#x27;t have to pack the charger.    Con&#x27;s:  -Price.  I still think it&#x27;s a bit pricy for what it is, but it is a lot less than other similar products on          the market.  Despite the price, I&#x27;m pleased enough with it not to regret the purchase.          -Long charging time.  It usually takes 24 hours for the fully charged light to show.  But I use it when I           need it even if it isn&#x27;t fully charged, and just put it back on the charger when I&#x27;m done.  This doesn&#x27;t           seem to have caused any problems.          -No timer/ beeper like the Clarisonic.  I&#x27;ve read that the Clarisonic has a beeper that tells you when to           move to another part of your face, which I think would be a nice feature.    While this isn&#x27;t a product that is essential like I would say something like a toothbrush is essential, it is a very nice tool for your skin care routine.  If you can afford the splurge, I say go for it.  The money you spend will last longer than what you would spend on a facial, and you don&#x27;t have to tip!</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, unless it&#x27;s super good or super bad... this one SUCKS!!!!! It was broken the third week I got it... won&#x27;t recommend to anyone! - Vivi</li>
    <li> After listening to several friends talk about skin care systems I decided to research the popular products on the market.  The NutraSonic was far less expensive than the leading model and it is a great system.  Glad I saved money!</li>
    <li> The NutraSonic Face Brush is the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve brought for myself in years. I&#x27;m a male &amp; was looking for something to help alleviate those in-grown hair bumps I can get from shaving. I can only say this device was a god-send.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased the product I was hesitant due to the mixed reviews.  When it comes to my skin I want the best, yet I figured that even if this machine stopped working after a couple of months and I had to purchase another one, it would still be cheaper then the  calrisonic,plus if didn&#x27;t work then I would not feel as I had spent that much money.  Well I have had it 4 months and no complaints, I do like the way my face feels softer and cleaner after using it.  The  body brush also has worked wonderfully, the ingrowns on my legs have reduced, I can tell because when I go get them waxed, my beautician notices and I have a much smoother finish.  But I will say this when using it on my face it does spit some of my face wash/ water, but I just stay above the sink, but if that bothers you then you won&#x27;t like the product.  Another good thing is, it doesn&#x27;t require to be charged daily.  I can&#x27;t compare it to the clarisomic since I have not used it, but this product works well for me.</li>
    <li> The Nutrasonic is an amazing product that makes my skin softer, smoother, and clearer. I break out far less than I ever have and my skin has a healthier appearance. You can get this product wet when you take it in the shower with you, and it lasts a week or more without having to re-charge it. I have even dropped it a few times and it works perfectly. I would recommend to this to anyone with any skin type and you can use it with your favorite face wash.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Neutrogena wave.  I saw it in the drug store.  It was the only powered face/body cleanser that I was aware of.  But, Neutrogena made several changes that did not work for me - discontinuing their more effective exfoliating pads, alterning their original pad to one that feels like a foamy cotton ball (not exfoliating at all), and creating a pad that spins instead of vibrates (I wash my face in a circular motion anyway so this wasn&#x27;t additive).  That besides the forever hunt for a decent price on the single use pads caused me to look around.    I am now happily using Nutra Sonic (bought mine refurb for $55).  My first thought was no more pads!  And, I can use my own cleaner.  The brush is soft but it does the job.   After I turned the unit on, there was questioning whether my skin is exfoliated with the sonic brush. The brush was definitely a step up in terms exfoliating. The bristles feel prinkly against your skin like they really get in there.  My skin felt thoroughly clean in a short amount of time. After the first time, my skin looked much better.  No scratches.  After the third day, my skin looks beautiful again.      Yes, the sonic brush costs more upfront than Oil of Olay and Neutrogena, but to me it is so worth it to get results without having to purchase special grit and disposable scrubbing pads again and again.</li>
    <li> First of all I have the travel nutrasonic that is yellow. This was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made! I was skeptical about buying this product because I thought how can a BRUSH be so effective? I&#x27;ll tell you how! This brush somehow vibrates the cleanser into your pores. Prior to using this product I had to use prescription acne creams that were expensive and really spend a lot of time and maintenance on my face. But now I have been able to stop using the prescriptions and I am only using over the counter Neutrogena face wash and this product. How is this possible? Because something about the vibration of this brush actually gets the cleanser deep into my pores. I can feel it every time I wash my face. I spend a much longer time washing my face now, about 5 minutes, but I&#x27;m saving money! My prescription acne cream was over $100! After the first use I noticed that my face was incredibly soft and about 3 hours later I realized I needed a new moisturizer! lol When you use the nutrasonic the cleanser gets so deep into your pores your face will need a lot of moisturizer. Then after the second use I noticed a dramatic decrease in my acne. I still get break outs but when I do I spend extra time running the nutrasonic over that area and it&#x27;s gone after that. I&#x27;ve never used the face wash that comes with the nutrasonic, I just use Neutrogena from the drugstore. A friend of mine says she buys the microdermabrasion cream at the drugstore that is for sale with the oil of olay spin brush and that it works great but when I went they were out but I plan on getting it! I was really hesitant on buying this product because I saw people&#x27;s reviews about how the charger broke and also because I thought maybe I should just spend the extra money and get the clarisonic but I am SO happy I went with the nutrasonic! I don&#x27;t have a charger problem because I make sure the brush is always dry before I put it on the cradle. The brush can be used many many times without running out of a charge so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it. I even talked my fiance into trying it and he was astonished at how great it made his face feel lol! This is also the best exfoliator you&#x27;ll ever use. I&#x27;ve gone through many brands of scrubs and nothing is better than this brush! Don&#x27;t hesitant, just buy the nutrasonic!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I emailed clarisonic to verify that all of the sellers were unauthorized.  I understood that as of the time of purchase they weren&#x27;t really asking where you purchased your clarisonic unit- or that I could say it was a gift, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if that policy would change, so I bought the Nutrasonic Basic for 89.00 here on Amazon.  I knew I wanted a body brush, so the Mia wasn&#x27;t an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s really strong!  I&#x27;m not pressing or anything, but it definitely is strong- the sensitive brush is the right option for me, and I like to use it on sensitive and jitterbug.  While I can use it daily, I definitely cannot use it twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;-It needed the full 24 hours to charge the first time.&lt;br /&gt;-It does splash water in your face that first few seconds.  I just wet my face with my hands really good, and then wet the brush, but wait for the spray to finish before getting it near my face or my clean mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-Totally waterproof, I am a bathtub bather, and so far no issues whatsoever using my bodybrush however I wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the jitterbug feature, though I suspect it&#x27;s not really taking advantage of sonic anything.  It&#x27;s kind of like the \\&quot;massage\\&quot; function on a sonicare toothbrush, so really nice and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed myself using more or less facial cleanser either way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, so far, my results have been okay.  I have clear skin already, but I wanted the clarisonic to help me on my road to wrinkle prevention.  I like the feel of my skin after, but I previously cleaned with a ecotools sponge, which gives me a great clean too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually overdid it the first two days and went for twice a day, which had my face feeling quite raw and upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose has been significantly shinier, but I can tell the pores are not as visible as well.  SHINY, though.  I&#x27;m hoping once my skin gets used to this I&#x27;ll be really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this after a few weeks with my before/after photos. :)otos. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago back in April and the thing no longer works.I find that it cleans well,but my skin couldn&#x27;t tolerate the brushes everyday.Iam on Tazorac so my skin is a little sensitive to it.I like it but it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter for Xmas as she has some problem areas with her face.  She loves this product and I noticed the difference in her skin in just a short time using this.  I highly recommend this if you have oily or problem area of your face.  Sincerely  Patricia Liedel</li>
    <li> Would like to give ZERO STARS rating not on the product, but on FaceMedic&#x27;s customer non-service.    I loved the way the NutraSonic works, but after about 2 months, during which time I used it only once a week, it no longer charges up.  I used and charged it correctly and for almost [...], this is truly disappointing.  I asked FaceMedics for a refund, explaining the problem, and they quoted me their \\&quot;30-day return policy.\\&quot;  There was no way I could have found out prior to 30 days that the unit would totally crap out with only 4-5 uses.  I&#x27;ve filed an A-Z claim with Amazon and hoping someone will see reason on a defective product; I am very disappointed in FaceMedics unresponsiveness to their defective product, and as a 100% satisfaction eBay seller, know better about customer service!    New information 2/18/2011:  manufacturer will replace/repair if I send in for shipping; no problem.  Amazon did not back the A-Z guarantee (not pleased about that).  But manufacturer has good customer service so far and I&#x27;m willing to work with them; however, will probably never buy from FaceMedics again - their customer service replies were arrogant and non-responsive.</li>
    <li> For the first 2 months it operated as advertised. But than it started to turn itself off during use. First I&#x27;ve thought the battery is getting weak, put on the charger, OK for a few days, then the same thing started to happen every time. Now, if I put it on the charging cradle, I don&#x27;t even see the charge light coming on. I guess it doesn&#x27;t even charge it anymore. I&#x27;d say stay away from this product. Nice exterior, cheap inside...</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife. She was very pleased with the results she saw (me too), but after about 3 weeks of twice daily use, the item broke. NutraSonic was very helpful with a return item. We called them and they gave us the address and RMA to send the brush to. We had to ship it at our own expense, but we received a replacement with extra brushes and sample cleaners in about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife really, really likes this brush, but it seems to suffer from build-quality issues. Never the less, we would recommend this item to a friend.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to receive the nutrasonic in the mail today...I get it and low and behold the thing doesn&#x27;t turn on, nor charge...I m beyond pissed and now have to deal with the manufacturer to get it replaced and/or fixed. I also had it rush shipped to me and now the manufacturer is telling me that its going to take a week for the replacement to get here...NOT HAPPY.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! One of the best features and biggest benefits it has over other sonic facial systems is the ability to select from four speeds. I&#x27;ve only had my NutraSonic for a couple of weeks, but after using it twice a day with my current cleanser it has vastly improved my complexion. I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in blackheads on my nose (always been a problem for me). My pore size has also reduced. I&#x27;m confident that with a few more weeks of use my nose will fully clear and I&#x27;ll have minimal pore visibility. I love how my skin feels refreshed after use and my face glows. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I got one of these a couple of weeks ago, was very pleased, and ordered another to keep at another house we have.  When I got the first one, I read the reviews, and there were a lot of reports of battery issues, which I have not (so far) experienced with my first unit. However, when I went to use the second unit (this one) after fully charging it, it ran about 15 seconds and died. Uh oh!  So I charged it another 24 hours(contrary to the user guide, the charging light does not flash). That was five days ago. So far, it has run OK the last five days without recharging. Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these units.  It worked great.  One week after the year warranty it stopped working. I emailed customer service and they said they would fix it as long as it was within the year warranty.  I am out of luck.  For the price of this thing it should last longer than a year.  Dont waste you money on this thing.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk, stopped charging after about 2 months. I&#x27;m trying to contact the seller/manufacturer now for a refund or replacement. Not sure how far I am going to get with out the box but I hope the honor and acknowledge what a faulty product they have produced.</li>
    <li> I was comparing this product to the Clarisonic.  I chose this one because of the price and great reviews.  So far so good.  The brush doesn&#x27;t rotate but pulses like a sonic product should.  I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks and so far it hasn&#x27;t cleared up all my issues (blackheads/whiteheads), nor did I expect it to, but has helped give smoother skin and even out red areas on my face.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because when I had the sensitive brush on (initial brush attached) it seemed to stall/stop working but light was still on and making noise.  It could have been user error, I&#x27;m not sure if I had the brush head on incorrectly.  I switched to the normal brush and haven&#x27;t had that issue again.  Note that the actual system is pretty big - It fits on my shower ledge but takes up the entire space.  It makes my skin feel really clean and refreshed after using, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy the NutraSonic instead of the Clarisonic because of the price. I have the Clarisonic and am very pleased with the product &amp; quality. I did read the reviews - albeit mixed- for the Nutrasonic and chose this product for my daughters. Wrong decision. After 3 days the hand piece would not charge rendering the machine unusable. Since I no longer had the original packaging I could not return it. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me as a christmas present so i was really excited to get it. I shouldve have listened to the reviews saying it wont hold a charge. As soon as i got the brush from day one it did not charge.  Called the place where amazon had it fulfilled and it was like a recording came on each and every time i called.  Called nutraluxe and they said sometimes the brushes is not charged and have to be charged for at least 24 hours. Okay, did that. Nothing. Kept it for about two weeks thinking something will click on. Nope nothing. I finally returned it to amazon and got a full refund back. Please, please, please stay away from this product!!!</li>
    <li> This replaces a Prosonic unit that lasted 2 years and several months.  Holding a charge was the failing of that device.  The first replacement was another cleaning instrument labeled Prosonic. Its head revolved similar to an Olay face brush. It was returned for that reason.  The choice between Clairisonic and this brand was eased by an inability to speak to Clairisonic customer service.  I spoke to a human -- for about 12 seconds -- long enough for her to punt my call to a different extension and a long unanswered hold.  Subsequent attempts to contact Clairisonic customer service consisted of lengthy holds with annoying &amp;#34;music&amp;#34; and irritating sounds, never another connection with a representative. Reviews of Clairisonic products detailed a number of incidents when there was no warranty coverage due to purchase through a non-approved vendor.  These attempts to contact Clairisonic were to learn whom they consider an approved vendor.  Inability to talk with customer service made me wonder if there would be any remedy for a faulty product.  At the price charged by Clairisonic, I did not want to take a chance on this.  I went to a store and looked at  Clairisonic products and was not impressed.  The Mia and Mia II are close to reasonably priced, but are too small for easy use.  I had not heard of Nutrasonic at the beginning of this quest.  I am glad the manual sent with the product gives details on charging the device.  The system is different from Prosonic.  The size and weight of the Nutrasonic are excellent.  The rate of oscillation is superior to Prosonic.  I am really hoping that charging problems do not make this product unusable.  Quality and performance are excellent.  A fifth star is withheld due to uncertainty about longevity of the charging system and because the photo of the cream at the top of the item description led me to believe it or a sample or samples would be included with the product.  At the price, this would be a welcome gesture.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this product because I thought it might stop working, due to reviews i read of this type of device.  I have had it for over a year and like it very much.  Especially for my nose and chin.  It&#x27;s expensive but I am not sorry I have it.  I use it once a week and sometimes more if I have a trouble spot I want to zap.</li>
    <li> This face brush does a great job, and the price is very competitive. I only use it once a week or so. I have very sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t use it too often. It helps clean the pores in my skin and keep it smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this twice daily on my face for a week.  I use it with Phisoderm for sensitive skin with the sensitive head.  I love the way my skin feels.  I have sensitive skin with an oily T zone and it works for all areas of my face.  I compared this product with Sonicare and found this product gives more the the money:  cheaper, 4 speeds, 3 brush heads (sensitive, regular and body), and a universal charging base.  It can be used in shower or tub.  The Sonicare product charges $50 extra for a universal charging base.  This is a good product and a good deal.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I did the same thing most people complaining of charging problems probably did.  I put the item face up in the charging cradle like a phone, when it needs to be charged face down.  After charging properly, the unit works great, my complexion is better than ever - love it.</li>
    <li> I am so frustrated with this product. I want to love it SO bad. It works great....when it works...I had it for three months until the power button totally broke from the inside. I contacted amazon and they exchanged it right away with a new charging system AND brush heads! I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER less than a year later it stopped charging. I contacted FaceMedix and they said to contact manufacturer. Let me tell you contrary to another review saying the manufacturer was great - they are NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I called the 877 toll free number and after they answered I said, \\&quot;Hi would I be abled to send in my -\\&quot; and they lady just went, \\&quot;Noooooooo\\&quot; and hung up!! I was so mad! So I called their other number on their website and some guy answered and it was his cell phone number! Some random guys cellphone number....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I don&#x27;t even know what to say. I really wish I could get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you spend that amount of money on something that will LAST. Like I said, it works great....while it still works. But if you purchase this product you will be setting yourself up for disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am a male and I have started using it 10 days ago.  I was very confused whether I should go for the cheaper product ( worth 26 us$) or the more expensive one ( worth 135 us$) but I decided to go for it. I am to disapointed.I have to see the other products but this one does wonder to your face.  Pros  1. Nice color.  2. Nice covenant charger  3. No confusion on how to use  4. One extra brush  5. Nice price  Cons  1. None  No..No-one paid me to write this!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product after reading about it and reading the reviews.  Guess I am one of the ones who received a product that will not turn on, will not charge. It was dead on arrival. I tried several times, several outlets, which i tested. The product would not charge at all. so i returned it.&lt;br /&gt;I will say it arrived quickly and was accepted for a full refund without any problems.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I have had this product for only 3 months and it no longer works. After about 3 weeks it started acting funny; would just turn on by itself - completely drain battery. I had to charge it pretty much every other day. Now it does not turn on whatsoever &amp; will not charge at all. Figures, just after I can&#x27;t return the product it no longer works. It honestly is a poorly manufactured product. It absolutely does not move at the speeds it claims. Such a waste of $80. I knew I should not have purchased a product that large wholesalers won&#x27;t even put their shelves.</li>
    <li> Sorry to report that my wife&#x27;s Nutrasonic worked only for 1-2 second bursts, then click...click...click...dead. Tried charging unit in four different verified working outlets around the house, 24 hours minimum at a time -- still, 1-2 second bursts, then click...click...click...dead. Not quite DOA but I doubt any product could come out of the box much closer to dead than this one. Would give this product zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It&#x27;s a little smaller than my Clairisonic. But still works fine. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it,</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he dropped this in the shower once and it was broken.  Water got into it and it would not stop no matter how many times he turned it off, it would just keep turning itself back on.  We had to let the battery run out and now it&#x27;s just an $80 piece of trash.  And since I didn&#x27;t buy it from a retail store it is not covered by any warranty.  Worst XMAS gift ever!!!</li>
    <li> Agree with the other reviewers unfortunately.  I used it weekly for 4-6 weeks, took a break for about a month (tried a new skin cleanser), went back to use it and it won&#x27;t turn on, won&#x27;t charge, nada.  I thought I was doing something wrong (not that it&#x27;s complicated to plug the charger in), but now that I see the other negative reviews, I see this is a common problem.  My best purchases are usually from Amazon -- this one was a total dud.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m here to warn you about purchasing this product from anyone -- it is a cheaply made (yet expensive) piece of junk that doesn&#x27;t stand the test of time. I don&#x27;t write grouchy reviews, but, wow, for what I paid for this, I expected better. Kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t trust some of the negative reviews I stumbled upon when researching which facial exfoliating unit to buy. My unit rocked -- for all of two weeks. Then it went kaput. It won&#x27;t hold a charge. The red light flashes like it&#x27;s charging, but it never turns on. I called the manufacturer, NutraLuxe MD, and they didn&#x27;t have any troubleshooting tips to offer. They were very indifferent and didn&#x27;t seem surprised in the least to hear about this problem. They also said that this unit was discontinued two years ago, and that any still being sold are old and have been sitting on shelves. Just a word to the wise!</li>
    <li> I loved this at first.  It really made my skin feel soft after using it.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it splatters everywhere.  Even with my face down in the sink, the counters and mirror were a mess after using it.  But maybe they all do that.  At about the same time as the warranty expired, it started shutting itself off about every 5 to 10 seconds and I&#x27;d have to restart it.  Now it only runs about 10 seconds tops and goes dead completely.  I have to toss it out.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, it works beautiful..I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a timer, so I can brush as long as I need with out it going off on me, and the price is so much better on my wallet..it leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth and my moisturerizer goes on so well..if you are thinking of getting a brush..you should go ahead and get this one. I truely recomend it..and by the way I have the expensive brush and i hate that it has a timer and goes off when it does, heck i still have makeup on my face I have to turn it on 3 times before im done,and the price is crazy..I was crazy for even buying it at that price..  245.00 pluse tax :(&lt;br /&gt; so if you are looking for a brush this is the brush for you it will leave your skin glowwwing.</li>
    <li> The unit cleaned great, when it would turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had charging issues and also operational issues. It was hit-or-miss as to whether it would turn on or not. It worked so well, when it worked, that I might order another from a different seller.</li>
    <li> I used this a lot in the beginning but with my small bathroom vanity I can&#x27;t leave a lot of tools out and I often have to run out the door leaving little time to gather crap from all over. So basically it went unused for the past 6 months or so. Went to go use it and it was dead, figured it was just cause I haven&#x27;t used it and it needed a charge. Well the stupid charging base doesn&#x27;t show any indication of it charging and after leaving it alone all day if still won&#x27;t even power on. What a waste of $100, for that price I&#x27;d expect it to last way longer than a freaking year. Trust me- spend the extra money and get the real sonic version from those the sonicare toothbrush people. I wish I did.</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this, it worked great.  I got wonderful compliments on my skin (face and body).  That lasted about two months.  Then it became the ghost device.  It would turn on by itself, draining the battery, so it wouldn&#x27;t turn on when I wanted to use it.  for a few weeks, I got used to charging it everyday, in order to make sure that it would have a charge when i wanted to use it, but then it completely died and I haven&#x27;t been able to turn it back on (despite charging) in several months.&lt;br /&gt;Its a real disappointment, because it did work for about 2 months.  Unfortunately, its not priced to be a disposable product to replace every two months.  Just grateful that I didn&#x27;t buy replacement heads that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to use (the original ones are still fine)&lt;br /&gt;Very frustrating that it isn&#x27;t made to last more than two months.</li>
    <li> My husband bought my Nutra Sonic for me and at first I was very pleased with it. Did a great job at deep cleansing. I have only had it for a few months now and the charger will no longer charge the device anymore. Im so upset and do not want to spend that much money again on something that only worked for a few months. It is to expensive for a product like this to only last  that short period of time. I will definatly not buy another one and would not recommend wasting money on this.</li>
    <li> Had I reviewed this product early on, I probably would have given it a glowing recommendation similar to the others posted here. It really did seem to clean my skin well...when it worked. My issues with it are as follows: In the time that it worked I only saw it fully charged (i.e. red solid light while sitting in the charging cradle)once! And it sat in the charging cradle ALL THE TIME. I have no other face brush experience to compare it to, but holding a charge seemed to be a real weakness of the product. Along the same lines, it often stopped 10-20 seconds into use, but then restarted in 3-5 seconds on its own. I just thought my brush was a little quirky, so I overlooked that flaw. Overall for the short time it worked and when I was successful in achieving a neart was near full charge it seemed to do what it was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, almost to the one year warranty date it stopped holding any charge and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Being a busy woman I stuck it in the cradle (checking on it every couple of days) hoping beyond hope that it would miraculously turn on again, but eventually forgot about it. By the time I got around to digging out the warranty it was well past the one year mark and I was out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely give a product a 1-star rating, but I&#x27;m very suspect of products that either never work (as many other reviewers have indicated) or work right up until the warranty expires as this product obviously has a long history of doing. It just seems like too much of a coincidence. It is a fraction of the price of the Clarisonic, but IMHO not inexpensive enough to warrant a yearly repurchase.  I&#x27;ll be trying a different brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Do NOT BUY this item!  It stops working shortly after purchase.  Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> broke in less than a year</li>
    <li> I loved this at first-- worked beautifully for about the first 30 or so uses. Then it no longer worked. The red light came on indicating that it was charging, yet it was dead. I emailed Nutra Luxe (the makers) just wanting to know if there was something I was doing wrong. She asked how long I was charging it for, and then started grilling me about WHERE I got it, saying there are a lot of unauthorized sellers out there. Being that I got it from a former coworker who got it as a gift from her daughter, I was unable to find out exactly where it was purchased from even though I did try. Once I told this customer service woman (GLORIA) that I was unable to find out where it was purchased, I never heard another peep out of her despite sending her more emails. STAY AWAY FROM NUTRASONIC AND STAY AWAY FROM NUTRA LUXE.</li>
