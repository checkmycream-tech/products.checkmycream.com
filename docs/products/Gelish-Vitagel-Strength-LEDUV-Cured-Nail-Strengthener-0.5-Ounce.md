      <li>Apply 2 light coats of vita gel curing each coat for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>

      <li>I prepped my nails by lightly buffing them, removing dust and oils and even using a primer.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product after loving every Gelish color that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>I have tried cleaning nails with alcohol before application and even used special ph pre-gel liquid that removes any residue and works wonders with gel polishes.</li>
      <li>My manicure lasts a full 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>The only issue is that it will stay stuck to the nail even after the top colors have dissolved from the acetone!</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been more than seven days.</li>
      <li>Although I have to do a little bit of scraping, I don&#x27;t see a difference in how strong and long my nails are staying, I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
      <li>The problem was you must use this the right way.</li>
      <li>I saw results right away.  </li>
      <li>First off I&#x27;d like to say I was scared to</li>
      <li>I have NEVER had pretty nails until now.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it the First try, because I did not ruff up the nail plate evenly</li>
      <li>then I&#x27;ll polish  with regular nail polish and top it off with seche vite.</li>
      <li>Too many complaints about wear because it really is a professional product meant for professional purchase and use in the salon.</li>
      <li>I really like it but looking at the reviews I would not bought this product.</li>
      <li>I have very brittle nails</li>
      <li>It really does what it says.</li>
      <li>really??</li>
      <li>Overall, I love it because it keeps my natural nails from breaking as I&#x27;m growing them and taking care of them.</li>
      <li>I tried using it alone without any color coats on top only to have the same problem.</li>
      <li>Now as far as any added health for my nail, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
      <li>what a waste, structure gel works better than this...</li>
      <li>However, this one tends to lift quicker for some reason &amp; it only happens on my dominant hand (i&#x27;m right handed.  </li>
      <li>It can be used with color or as clear.</li>
      <li>Eventually you will wear this seal off if you&#x27;re as busy around the house as I am</li>
      <li>Not a fan of this, I bought it to protect my natural nails</li>
      <li>When I use this with gel polish I like it because it keeps my natural nails protected underneath.</li>
      <li>In one month my nails are so long and pretty.</li>
      <li>it will not strengthen your natural nail.</li>
      <li>I always get my Gelish from Sally Beauty Supply, and before this, I had long pretty nails.</li>
      <li>This is the professional size bottle, NOT a mini</li>
      <li>Have used it once so far.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the same as shellac normal polish.</li>
      <li>I wasted $20 on a full sized bottle of this stuff and now I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
      <li>Not even a clear gel coat made it last.</li>
      <li>Helps my nails stay strong and since I am so tough on my nails, it makes sense.</li>
      <li>I was a little hesitant to try this with some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Much prefer the vitagel strength to the typical gel base coat. Helps my nails stay strong and since I am so tough on my nails, it makes sense.</li>
    <li> Peels off if used alone. I find that it works well though with a color gel on top for some reason. Not even a clear gel coat made it last. :/</li>
    <li> I started my own at-home gel manicures about 2 months ago. I have NEVER had pretty nails until now. I only use gelish products. I love them. This Vitagel does keep my nails strong. Without this or any other gel, my nails are very weak. I use one coat foundation. Two coats Vitagel. Three coats June Bride color and One top-coat. Seems like a lot, I know... but it is what works and it does not peel off. My manicure lasts a full 2 weeks. That was un-heard of for me prior to this discovery. Am so happy and will purchase again !!</li>
    <li> Have used it once so far. Pt in on first then did the normal base coat over it then the polish, then top coat. No problem with peeling off.</li>
    <li> I have been using this and it does make your nails stronger. I really like it but looking at the reviews I would not bought this product. The problem was you must use this the right way. You must use a gel base coat first then you apply this and one thin coat only if it is to thick it peel and if you don&#x27;t use gel base coat it will peel. This is a good nail strengthener</li>
    <li> Very very unhappy with this product.  Does nothing that it say will do</li>
    <li> This actually really helps the gel polish to adhere to the nail better than anything else! The only issue is that it will stay stuck to the nail even after the top colors have dissolved from the acetone! Although I have to do a little bit of scraping, I don&#x27;t see a difference in how strong and long my nails are staying, I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s Heeling my clients nails strengthen from the outside in</li>
    <li> do you think your nails are getting ruined ny gel polish? you den;t have to worry anymore!! this product definetly helps</li>
    <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for almost a week and no lifting or chipping yet.  I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it makes my nails any stronger than usual.  The product came quicker than I thought it would and was well packaged.  This is the professional size bottle, NOT a mini and it costs less than buying the mini at the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I have only used twice but what a difference it has made in the strength of my nails and the length of time my manicure lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this vitagel so much. It has helped my nails. I feel they are much stronger and beautiful. I use this as a basecoat then I&#x27;ll polish  with regular nail polish and top it off with seche vite.</li>
    <li> Very impressed so far!!</li>
    <li> I have really loved all gelish products.  However, this one tends to lift quicker for some reason &amp; it only happens on my dominant hand (i&#x27;m right handed.  I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference</li>
    <li> I wanted more oily cuticle oil, but it is just watery. Scent is too strong to me.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something better.. I use it every time a change my shellac nail colors, but I do not see any difference in my nail.. It does not protect it... it&#x27;s the same as shellac normal polish.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a sampling of the product reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try despite some saying it peeled off immediately. I followed the instructions, preparing my nails by cleaning, shaping, and roughing their surface a bit, then applying the nail prep solution and got great results. It&#x27;s especially important to make sure you cover the ends of your nails with it on both sides. It stays on longer that way and doesn&#x27;t come off when you wash dishes. Eventually you will wear this seal off if you&#x27;re as busy around the house as I am but I&#x27;ve managed to keep this on my nails for about two weeks without it peeling. My nails are slowly growing out after having been weak and flakey. I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after loving every Gelish color that I&#x27;ve purchased. Unfortunately, this product just does not stack up to the others. It peels off within 2-3 days, whereas I can typically keep my gel polish on for 2-3 weeks. In my opinion, skip it.</li>
    <li> There is an issue with peeling with this product. It is also very thick.  I can say while it lasted little over a week, I did notice my nails are stronger after using it a few times. Just don&#x27;t expect to wear your polish 2-3weeks.</li>
    <li> This works great it will not strengthen your natural nail. But it does add support for flexible or damaged nails. If you are having problems with it peeling its due to prepping of your natural nail. I use it every time I do my nails and it never comes off till I remove it. And I have my hands in water all day. This is my process: make sure nails are clean of polish and remove any cuticle that is on your nail. Lightly buff shine off of your nail. Scrub nails with a nail brush and an antiseptic soap with No Moisturizers! Then I wipe my nails with rubbing alcohol. Apply ph bonding agent for gel nails. Apply 2 light coats of vita gel curing each coat for 2 minutes. Now wipe with gel cleanse or alcohol. Or if you want to apply color. Do not wipe sticky layer off and paint nails with your favorite gel or shellac per manufacturers instructions :) I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ved used on my mom. It&#x27;s a great product. Her nails have stopped peeling and have been growing a lot faster.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and used the right lamp to cure this and it peel right off after one day!!! really?? what a waste, structure gel works better than this...</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to continue using my gel polishes while still using a nail growth aid. I used it as a base coat under my usual two coats of gelish color and  was extremely dissappointed to find that it peels off in one day! I wasted $20 on a full sized bottle of this stuff and now I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. I tried using it alone without any color coats on top only to have the same problem.</li>
    <li> This product is not as good as I though it will be. The instructions are not clear stated on it. They don&#x27;t explain the users that you can not use this product in combination with any other Gelish porduct or it will pill off next day. This needs to be used by itself and actually it not worth the money it cost.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say I was scared to but this product because of the reviews (I have had LOTS of problems with nail hardeners in the past). However, I am thankful I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the sensationail starter kit and using their cleanser and lamp I apply a coat or two of this. When I use this with gel polish I like it because it keeps my natural nails protected underneath. When I use this with actual nail polish I  find that for me it helps keeps it on longer. Then, I use a non acetone remover to remove just the polish and just refill the gel as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, I love it because it keeps my natural nails from breaking as I&#x27;m growing them and taking care of them. Now as far as any added health for my nail, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. I mostly use cuticle balms and oils to help with that since I have peeling nails. However, if you looking for something to help your nails stay hard, I would use SUPER THIN coats of this.</li>
    <li> This works beautifully.  Gives a thicker base to my nail and protects them through each manicure.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> Mmmhmm love this stuff!  I use two coats of Vintage and then follow with foundation, two coats of Gelish color of my choice and finally top it off (1coat).  My manicure lasts 14 days and looks lovely with lots of strength and shine.  No chipping or peeling.  This product gave my average strength nails the extra &amp;#34;umpf&amp;#34;.  They need.  I plan to purchase again!!!</li>
    <li> Im a nail tech and I love this product! Didn&#x27;t like it the First try, because I did not ruff up the nail plate evenly the side walls shrunk. Second try was perfect. Had applied it on my pinky and ring finger I have been testing and working. So far it&#x27;s been more than seven days. I see nail growth but no peeling or chipping! Today I removed gel from my pinky, all it took was a saturated cotton ball with acetone on the nail for 5 seconds, one push with the orange stick off goes the gel. Nail is nice and smooth. Customer also reported vitagel makes polish last longer than usual. I did use the ph bond with vitagel I think it helps. Key is buff shine off nail plate, wash hand to remove dust, apply ph bond to dehydrate nail plate, apply vitagel in thin layers like you would with gelish base coat, don&#x27;t forget to cap the edge of the nail. Cure n only wipe the second coat with alcohol to remove tacky layer.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be used as a base coat, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same adhesion and I found it peeling off within a day or two.  The standard base coat usually lasts at least two weeks.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have not used it very long but it seems to be making my nails stronger.  We&#x27;ll see how it does over time.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Easy to apply. I apply this instead of the base coat and then I apply my nail color.</li>
    <li> It just peels of in several hours after application like a film.. I have tried cleaning nails with alcohol before application and even used special ph pre-gel liquid that removes any residue and works wonders with gel polishes. This think just doesn&#x27;t stay on and, if applied under gel polish, the gel polish peels off together.</li>
    <li> I prepped my nails by lightly buffing them, removing dust and oils and even using a primer. This peeled off within 2 days. I also tried it following my previous mentioned prep without primer and it peeled of the next day. I tried 1 coat on 1 hand and 2 coats on my other hand, it seemed as if the 2 coats peeled off quicker. Not a fan of this, I bought it to protect my natural nails but it didn&#x27;t hold up as expected.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to try this with some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  Having my hands in water most of the day was the reason I switched to gel polish.  Regular nail polish wouldn&#x27;t even last a day.  The water was also damaging my normally healthy nails.  I have tried other strengtheners, but they have never seemed to help.  This product is different.  I saw results right away.  I did not have any problems with it peeling as some others did.  I have used it alone, and as a base for other Gelish products.  A lot has to do with the application.  A tip I learned when I started with gel polish was to dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush.  Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush.  Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.  I even wipe the brush off between each nail.  This ensures a thin layer.  I prefer 2 thin layers of the Gelish strength, and now use it in place of the Gelish foundation.  My nails have never been healthier!</li>
    <li> Do not order Gelish from this place. The bottle I was sent was not the 0.5 ounce one, nor the bottle pictured. The gel had thick white chunks in it and did not cure properly. The parts that did cure peeled within hours. Worst of all, whatever was in the bottle ruined my nails. I always get my Gelish from Sally Beauty Supply, and before this, I had long pretty nails. Since using this (it burns and Gelish does not burn me) my nails have been below the nubs for two months. Not only is what you get a different size and not as pictured, there is a chemical in the bottle that is not Gelish and destroyed my nails.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but since I have very very weak and easily broken nails I decided to try it.  I do my own gellish system at home and started using this in place of the foundation coat.  In one month my nails are so long and pretty. It really does what it says.</li>
    <li> I love gelish and when I heard of this strengthening vitagel i was so excited. I have very brittle nails so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product. I cured the strengthener with my UV light for 2 minutes (per the instructions on the bottle). I cured 2 coats of color and then the topcoat (as I always do). Less then 24 hours later, my polish was peeling off. I am so disappointed. Total waist. I will try it again and post an update.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  Clearly, if you are having problems with peeling, then it&#x27;s your wrong application.  Be patient, use thin coats.  Your nails will appreciate it when you learn how to use it.  Check out on line videos for proper application.  It&#x27;s worth it. !!!  Great shipping, Great price.</li>
    <li> This, contrary to its directions cannot infuse, deposit or treat nails with vitamins or nutrients. The nails are made from proteins and everything they need is supplied from the nail bed. Nails do not absorb vitamins. Use oil to make them flexible and less prone to breaking and peeling. With that said vitagel strength is wonderful during wear for extra layers and needed support. Use it OVER FOUNDATION. Do not use it as your base coat. It will peel. It can be used with color or as clear. Too many complaints about wear because it really is a professional product meant for professional purchase and use in the salon.</li>
    <li> I used before and will continue to use.  great product!!!</li>
