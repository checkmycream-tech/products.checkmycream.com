      <li>cause no stores around me seen to carry them any more.</li>
      <li>I love these picks and always have to have one on hand now.  </li>
      <li>, the more i realize that your teeth represent your level of class.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them here</li>
      <li>love em .but</li>
      <li>so I ended up ordering them on Amazon and paying more.</li>
      <li>They will probably cause you to Floss more often.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying these!!!!!</li>
      <li>This $13.58 or so price that I bought them for, about 2 months ago now + shipping to UK, is the best price for a multipack that I could find, and mulipack discount too compared to buying a single pack :)</li>
      <li>I love that they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
      <li>I think these are the best flossers other than the electric/ water flosers, do let me know if you find better.</li>
      <li>Easy, convenient and</li>
      <li>These flossers are strong, east to use, and clean better than any others I&#x27;ve used...</li>

      <li>The twin lines make a huge difference.  </li>
      <li>Quite comfortable to use compared to a lot of others.</li>
      <li>Being the floss freak that I am, the idea of two pieces of floss cleaning my teeth simultaneously almost sent me into a fit.</li>
      <li>Superior strength and the double string gets way more \\&quot;debris\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>If you want to have clean, non-threatening breath, spend the five bucks and leave them in your car.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are too many varieties of these flossers and unfortunately the stuff that works the best often get&#x27;s overshadowed by the cheap and/or</li>
      <li>The Plackers Twin-Line, very visably, removes a lot more.  </li>
      <li>but I know everyone in my family will be very pleased to see these back again.</li>
      <li>so I had to order them online, but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>The twin line is far better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Buy from this company, they&#x27;re doing right by their customers.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you enjoy your teeth and want to continue having them for years to come.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for hooking around the last molar to scrape the plaque that hides back there too.</li>
      <li>His teeth are very straight and close together</li>
      <li>pretty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Plackers Twin-Line floss sticks for a couple years now, after trying many different brands.  </li>
      <li>these are my favorite because of the double string.</li>
      <li>I was having problems with bleeding gums, and the dentist was getting ready to get harsh with me, so I had to get better with flossing, and this made it easy.  </li>
      <li>My teeth could shred through the regular Gentle Fine Plackers with ease, but I have yet to damage one of these Twin Lines.</li>
      <li>Makes flossing so much easier and faster.</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this brand of floss because it was much cheaper than the glide floss picks.</li>
      <li>Simple, more than doubly effective and sturdy, these flossers will come up with food even immediately after flossing with any other single string floss.</li>
      <li>These are hands down my favorite flossers.</li>
      <li>I think it is odd to say I love dental floss, but since I want to keep my teeth and not spend time in a chair getting drilled, I use these.  </li>
      <li>But my dentist confirms my gums&#x27; steady improvement using this product.  </li>
      <li>the older i get</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>and the string does not come out as easily as with other plackers.</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that my dentist is no longer angry with me.  </li>
      <li>They stay completely intact!</li>
      <li>Recently, i went to the dentist for the first time in five years.</li>
      <li>The first row seems to loosen things and the second row digs it out.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and what I expected</li>
      <li>Love the duel line, it gets all the badness out.</li>
      <li>I have tight teeth and these clean</li>
      <li>The double line works better than any other similar flosser I have used.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not easy to get excited about dental floss</li>
      <li>I really needed these sooner and couldn&#x27;t find any better ones without being too expensive, in UK.</li>
      <li>so well; pick is kind of useless though.  </li>

<li> so well; pick is kind of useless though.  </li>
<li> Maybe that sounds a little cut and dry, but the first thing people see in you that defines you are your teeth.</li>
<li> You&#x27;ll feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Between the single and the double line flossers</li>
<li> This style is much harder to use on the back molars.</li>
<li> Not sure how anyone would actually think that a little piece of floss could really whiten anything anyway,</li>
<li> because the floss line was so narrow, it just wouldn&#x27;t remove all the debris without going back and forth several times.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth the savings to struggle with getting the floss in the back of my mouth.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have to jam half my hand in my mouth to reach the back teeth any longer.  </li>
<li> They make flossing much less of a hassle than traditional floss.  </li>
<li> you didn&#x27;t even know you had, even after flossing with a single string!</li>
<li> They use the most durable type of string I&#x27;ve come across, and the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
<li> I bought a bunch of these at the dollar store a few years back and everyone in my family got hooked on them.</li>
<li> plain and simple.</li>
<li> I was having trouble with floss sticks that had a single line,</li>
<li> If you value function over form these will NEVER let you down.  </li>
<li> I stopped buying these because the dentek stuff was half price...</li>
<li> The gap between my teeth are tight, and these go through with ease.</li>
<li> The secret is the double line of floss that helps to catch debris between the teeth.  </li>
<li> I discovered these about a month ago while purchasing my usual bag.</li>
<li> No more soggy fingers after flossing!</li>
<li> And by shame I mean please-continue-making-these-I-don&#x27;t-even-care-</li>
<li> I went through 120 of them (2 packs) and had a ZERO failure rate.  </li>
<li> They are quite tough compared to others but not as indestructible as advertised.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I can no longer purchase these in stores, so have to buy online.  </li>
<li> He was unable to find them in the store, so he was trilled when I found them on line.</li>
<li> the guy who when he&#x27;s facing you, if he;s closer than ten feet you can smell that nasty breath...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are the best flossers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Highly recommend if you enjoy your teeth and want to continue having them for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is one of those smack your forehead and say, \\&quot;why didn&#x27;t I think of that\\&quot; products. Simple, more than doubly effective and sturdy, these flossers will come up with food even immediately after flossing with any other single string floss. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have razors for teeth and have been using Plackers floss sticks for years. They use the most durable type of string I&#x27;ve come across, and the price isn&#x27;t too bad. I discovered these about a month ago while purchasing my usual bag. Being the floss freak that I am, the idea of two pieces of floss cleaning my teeth simultaneously almost sent me into a fit. These things are AMAZING. They will literally grab gunk you didn&#x27;t even know you had, even after flossing with a single string! They&#x27;re great for hooking around the last molar to scrape the plaque that hides back there too. I also find that the strings are indestructible. My teeth could shred through the regular Gentle Fine Plackers with ease, but I have yet to damage one of these Twin Lines. They stay completely intact! I don&#x27;t know why everyone on Earth doesn&#x27;t use these; I feel like I should start an evangelical (evanflossical?) group to spread the word. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon sells them in bulk! Now I can stock up and keep some everywhere, in my purses, car, workplace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their only downsides are that they are sweet-mint flavored (I don&#x27;t care for flavored floss), and they don&#x27;t actually whiten the crannies of your teeth. Not sure how anyone would actually think that a little piece of floss could really whiten anything anyway, but hey, they made the claim. Shame on you Ranir. And by shame I mean please-continue-making-these-I-don&#x27;t-even-care-if-you-make-them-fart-flavored.</li>

    <li> I have used these for years, and they are by far the best way to floss.  For some reason I can&#x27;t find them locally anymore so I had to order them online, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Plackers Twin Floss Picks are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Unfortunately, I can no longer purchase these in stores, so have to buy online.  But my dentist confirms my gums&#x27; steady improvement using this product.  The bonus is they do not shred.&lt;br /&gt; JSB</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t break.  I have tight teeth and these clean so well; pick is kind of useless though.  I stopped buying these because the dentek stuff was half price...I regret that decision until my stock of those dentek flossers are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are too many varieties of these flossers and unfortunately the stuff that works the best often get&#x27;s overshadowed by the cheap and/or pretty. If you value function over form these will NEVER let you down.  I went through 120 of them (2 packs) and had a ZERO failure rate.  Buy from this company, they&#x27;re doing right by their customers.</li>
    <li> These flossers are strong, east to use, and clean better than any others I&#x27;ve used...They will probably cause you to Floss more often.</li>
    <li> I just skip flossing if I&#x27;m out of these rather than use another brand (yes, I know that&#x27;s gross). It&#x27;s not easy to get excited about dental floss but I really love this product. Superior strength and the double string gets way more \\&quot;debris\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> These are hands down my favorite flossers. I&#x27;m glad I found them here cause no stores around me seen to carry them any more.</li>
    <li> I love these picks and always have to have one on hand now.  The twin line is far better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  Makes flossing so much easier and faster.</li>
    <li> This a great flossing option.  Easy, convenient and these particular style works the best.</li>
    <li> The twin lines make a huge difference.  If you haven&#x27;t tried them, you should.  And if you have already tried them, then you already know.</li>
    <li> These are the best flossers I have ever used.  The double line works better than any other similar flosser I have used.  I managed to pick these up at a local Dollar Store, but rats, they are sold out so I ended up ordering them on Amazon and paying more.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD DESIGNED PRODUCT TO DO THE JOB EXELENT.  CONSTRUCTION IS GOOD SO THEY CAN BE PUT IN THE CAR,IN THE WALLET OR JUSTIN THE POCKET  M ORE PEPERMENT TAST</li>
    <li> These Plackers Twin Line Dental Flossers do a great job of cleaning, and the floss is very strong where there is no worry of it breaking. The gap between my teeth are tight, and these go through with ease. I highly recommend buying these!!!!!</li>
    <li> these are my favorite because of the double string. and the string does not come out as easily as with other plackers.</li>
    <li> The double row of thread on these dental flossers makes all the difference. The first row seems to loosen things and the second row digs it out. I bought a bunch of these at the dollar store a few years back and everyone in my family got hooked on them. I have been looking in the drugstores ever since we ran out to no avail. Happy to find them on Amazon. I just paid more for them than I would like but I know everyone in my family will be very pleased to see these back again.</li>
    <li> best product out there</li>
    <li> I am a meticulous flosser. the older i get, the more i realize that your teeth represent your level of class. Maybe that sounds a little cut and dry, but the first thing people see in you that defines you are your teeth. Recently, i went to the dentist for the first time in five years. the only reason i didn&#x27;t have to buy a 2 part, $1,000 cleaning before they would begin treatment was because i passed the perio-dental disease test with flying colors. My dentist was amazed (and i hadn&#x27;t seen the guy in 5 years)&lt;br /&gt;Look, I&#x27;m not your dad, but this is the truth. You know someone with that breath... the guy who when he&#x27;s facing you, if he;s closer than ten feet you can smell that nasty breath... that&#x27;s plaque, my friends. plain and simple. That&#x27;s a guy who&#x27;s teeth are corroded with that yellow, hardening nastiness that will cause gum bleeding and recession from his teeth. if you want to have breath like that, save yourself the five bucks these flossers cost and be merry. If you want to have clean, non-threatening breath, spend the five bucks and leave them in your car. Just use them from and to work. You&#x27;ll feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Between the single and the double line flossers, it&#x27;s really three times more effective. try them, you&#x27;ll see what&#x27;s stuck in between your teeth because it will end up stuck between the threads of the flosser. I shouldn&#x27;t have to tell you... you either care about your class or you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I think these are the best flossers other than the electric/ water flosers, do let me know if you find better. They are quite tough compared to others but not as indestructible as advertised. Quite comfortable to use compared to a lot of others. This $13.58 or so price that I bought them for, about 2 months ago now + shipping to UK, is the best price for a multipack that I could find, and mulipack discount too compared to buying a single pack :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the delivery took for ever from probably US to UK. I really needed these sooner and couldn&#x27;t find any better ones without being too expensive, in UK. So I bought some in a supermarket as these were taking a while and I&#x27;ve ran out, and then these arrived the next day, making it extra annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took at least a month to be delivered to me, very disappointing. I know it takes a while with US laws, but over a month is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;But at least these are very good flossers and the best price I could find, about 2 months ago lol.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and what I expected</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this brand of floss because it was much cheaper than the glide floss picks. This style is much harder to use on the back molars. It&#x27;s not worth the savings to struggle with getting the floss in the back of my mouth.</li>
    <li> love em .but cheeper at walmart</li>
    <li> I think it is odd to say I love dental floss, but since I want to keep my teeth and not spend time in a chair getting drilled, I use these.  They make flossing much less of a hassle than traditional floss.  I was having problems with bleeding gums, and the dentist was getting ready to get harsh with me, so I had to get better with flossing, and this made it easy.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have to jam half my hand in my mouth to reach the back teeth any longer.  I am happy to report that my dentist is no longer angry with me.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I have a pack in my car / office / night stand and use them after every meal. No more soggy fingers after flossing!</li>
    <li> These are the only flosses my husband will use. His teeth are very straight and close together so he needs the double flosser.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST flossies ever and my husband loves them too!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my father because he really liked the Twin Lines we got as a sample.  He was unable to find them in the store, so he was trilled when I found them on line.</li>
    <li> Love the duel line, it gets all the badness out.</li>
    <li> This floss is amazing. The twin-line gives it enough tension to grab the guck out from between your teeth. And what a price for 4 bags! This will last me a loooong time!</li>
