      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>AMAZING stuff.  </li>
      <li>was amazing.  </li>
      <li>Those who have children with Hirschsprungs know how challenging this condition can be.  </li>
      <li>Moral of the story, Ilex is awesome.</li>
      <li>Of note, make sure you have Vaseline/petroleum jelly around to put on top of the Ilex to prevent it from sticking to itself</li>
      <li>I was actually able to use it to plug up the tube site until the doctors decided to close the site surgically.  </li>
      <li>It seems like putting Vaseline on top of it would wipe it off, but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>We now use this every day to keep the rash from coming back and it has worked so great!!!</li>
      <li>Just remember not to try to wipe it off, just pat off the stool and apply more.  </li>
      <li>This cleared up the sores/rash in 1-2 days like magic.  </li>
      <li>I wish this stuff was available at a pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much ILEX!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that my little boy no longer screams every time he pees or poops.  </li>
      <li>Ilex was exactly the right thing!  </li>
      <li>i bought this stuff and the rash looked better in hours and completely gone in 3 days</li>
      <li>We were able to use the ILEX to clear it up in 36 hours.  </li>
      <li>It works good on my little angle diaper rash.</li>
      <li>; This stuff has some pretty interesting properties; it also has no trouble adhering to wet wound surfaces, unlike most diaper creams.</li>
      <li>Use it for a patient with a g-tube and it is great for keeping the skin from breaking down!!!</li>
      <li>It comes of pretty easily when rubbed with a regular baby wipe.  </li>
      <li>how much Desitin, Aquaphor, or Triple Paste we slathered on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really protected her from the pain of stomach acid on her skin.</li>
      <li>It really does do the trick.  </li>
      <li>so sometimes it comes in the mail a whole week before promised.</li>
      <li>Plus regular creams rub off on the diaper pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>Works better than other products I have used on the rash</li>
      <li>Next time I would leave it on as long as possible - it seemed to be OK if you didn&#x27;t get every speck off of the paste after a poopy change, because the rash part was still clean and protected.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Ilex is the best stuff to use when it gets that bad we buy it all of the time</li>
      <li>What we have found to work is to clean him up with water, let his bottom dry out</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>If their skin is very sensitive due to a rash, you have to pat clean, or use water, never rub off.</li>
      <li>After only 3 days, my son&#x27;s rash has completely disappeared!!!!  </li>
      <li>She has very acidic stool because a short bowel syndrome, but if there&#x27;s any skin break down, this really clears it up RIGHT AWAY!</li>
      <li>It adheres to the moist skin area right away like rubber cement and stays on for at least 2 diaper changes--you just clean around it.</li>
      <li>It works really well to seal the rash area and prevent further irritation.</li>
      <li>The reviews on Amazon were good, but I was still skeptical.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We bought an extra tube to keep in our safety kit as a just in case - the hunt to find this particular product</li>
      <li>You must use another paste on top of it, else it&#x27;ll stick to the diaper, so I use a desitin/karaya powder mix on top of the ilex which is on the skin as a base protector.</li>
      <li>Our 2-month old baby had a severe diaper rash that didn&#x27;t go even after using multiple off the shelf &amp; presription creams.</li>
      <li>After battling for weeks with an open wound on my daughter&#x27;s bottom and trying what seemed like everything - leaving her undiapered, diet changes, maximum strength zinc oxide diaper creams, natural diaper creams, prescription ointment, antibiotics and antifungals -</li>
      <li>My 6-month old son has total colon Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease and we started dealing with a severe diaper rash almost 4 months ago.  </li>
      <li>This causes frequent open sores and bleeding rashes.</li>
      <li>Our newborn developed severe diaper rash, where two small patches of skin started to look more like a wet, weepy burn than just a simple red rash.</li>
      <li>Finally, our pediatrician did some research, consulted other doctors &amp; recommended iLex (it was her first experience with iLex).</li>
      <li>We use this for my son&#x27;s diaper rashes... as long as you use aquaphor on top of it, its seriously works in 1 day flat.</li>
      <li>really well then coat him in a thin layer of Ilex, let that dry a little then put a layer of Vaseline or Aquaphor on top to prevent the Ilex from sticking to his diaper.  </li>
      <li>A nurse at the Pediatricians office recommended ilex as part of a whole regimen: gently cleanse diaper area, dry thoroughly, dust some stomahesive powder to weeping/bloody parts, apply Ilex, cover Ilex with thick coat of Aquaphor or Vaseline</li>

<li> Nothing worked for long.  </li>

<li> Like the other reviewers we tried everything and at one point</li>
<li> My child has acidic stools due to an intestinal condition.</li>
<li> THE RASH WAS GONE IN LESS THAN 48HRS.</li>
<li> The diaper rash healed within just a few days of using iLex.</li>
<li> Mikey had palate surgery, then afterwards a round of antibiotics.</li>
<li> Bought it for a friend, it is not available in Germany.&lt;br</li>
<li> After surgery his bowl movements were akin to acid on his delicate little skin.</li>
<li> This really helps when my daughter has really bad diaper rash.</li>
<li> Any time my son gets a bad diaper rash we go straight to Ilex to help it heal.  </li>
<li> : it turned out that, being rookie parents, we were using diapers that were too small</li>
<li> We usually see drastic improvement within 12 hours.</li>
<li> was a little ridiculous.</li>
<li> Just don&#x27;t put it on too thick.</li>
<li> He continued to have weeping, bloody sores that would cause him to scream everytime we so much as sprinkled water on his bottom.  </li>
<li> cream is very thick, but not so thick that you need to worry about applying it over the opening.  </li>
<li> My daughter has bad diaper rash and this is the only thing that works.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick, like a paste.</li>
<li> With in an hour of putting it on, his bottom went from this horrible angry red color to turning pink and with in 2 days his burn was gone.</li>
<li> Alas, within a day of it arriving, the wound borders started improving and by a week it was 100% healed...</li>
<li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that she would get horrible diaper rashes - bleeding lesions and all.</li>
<li> , my daughters rash was soo bad, it bled and was extremely raw.</li>
<li> I worried that it would be difficult to deal with and difficult to remove.</li>
<li> When we found Ilex, we were skeptical and held our breath...</li>
<li> We were desperate.  </li>
<li> All this lead to horrible liquid diarrhea which caused by far the worst case of diaper rash any of my 3 kids has ever had.</li>
<li> This was recommended to us during a particularly bad bought of the flu for our infant daughter.  </li>

    <li> My 6-month old son has total colon Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease and we started dealing with a severe diaper rash almost 4 months ago.  We had tried everything including A &amp; D, Aquaphor, Desitin, Baking Soda, Cornstarch, Cholestyramine Compound, Vusion, Nystatin, Mupirocin, Desonide, Ketoconazole, Triamcinolone, Miconazole Powder along with having him go without a diaper all day, blow-drying his bottom, washing it after every bowel movement and nothing worked!  He continued to have weeping, bloody sores that would cause him to scream everytime we so much as sprinkled water on his bottom.  Those who have children with Hirschsprungs know how challenging this condition can be.  We were desperate.  When we found Ilex, we were skeptical and held our breath...we didn&#x27;t have to hold it for long because it worked!  After 4 long months of dealing with the skin breakdown, we finally caught a break!&lt;br /&gt;Ilex was amazing.  You can can see it work almost immediately!  After only 3 days, my son&#x27;s rash has completely disappeared!!!!  I wish I had found this product sooner!  Thank you so much ILEX!!!</li>
    <li> My son had liquid breastmilk stools that burned his bottom when using disposable diapers.  We were able to use the ILEX to clear it up in 36 hours.  AMAZING stuff.  Just remember not to try to wipe it off, just pat off the stool and apply more.  You have to use petroleum jelly to keep it from sticking to the diaper though.  We ultimately changed to cloth diapers.</li>
    <li> Our newborn developed severe diaper rash, where two small patches of skin started to look more like a wet, weepy burn than just a simple red rash. Our pediatrician assured us that it was just diaper rash, not a fungal infection, and advised us to cover the area with the stickiest diaper cream we could find.  However, NONE of the zinc-oxide-based diaper creams we could find in regular pharmacies would adhere to the moist part of the rash--they would only stick to dry skin. Even Desitin maximum strength did nothing because it would cover everything -except- the diaper rash. Plus regular creams rub off on the diaper pretty quickly.  This works! It&#x27;s very thick, like a paste. You put a dab of it on your finger and sort of pat a smear of it onto the rash area. It adheres to the moist skin area right away like rubber cement and stays on for at least 2 diaper changes--you just clean around it. Next time I would leave it on as long as possible - it seemed to be OK if you didn&#x27;t get every speck off of the paste after a poopy change, because the rash part was still clean and protected. Powdering it with cornstarch helped to keep the exposed side from sticking to the diaper too. It acts as a bandage.  After three days, we started to see results, and after a week her skin was all healed. Hooray for happy babies!     Followup: it turned out that, being rookie parents, we were using diapers that were too small and that was the reason for the rash.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is so sensitive that she would get horrible diaper rashes - bleeding lesions and all. I&#x27;ve scoured all baby and mommy forums looking for what other moms do to heal severe rashes. I have had her on liquid antacids, browned flour, you name it. Nothing worked for long.  Then, I saw one post about Ilex. I tried it on her rashes.  Wow! The lesions were 90% gone in 24 hours.  Amazing!  Thank Jesus for leading me to the pst about Ilex.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers we tried everything and at one point no cream would stick to the weeping bloody areas of skin.  A nurse at the Pediatricians office recommended ilex as part of a whole regimen: gently cleanse diaper area, dry thoroughly, dust some stomahesive powder to weeping/bloody parts, apply Ilex, cover Ilex with thick coat of Aquaphor or Vaseline (so it doesn&#x27;t adhere to diaper).  This cleared up the sores/rash in 1-2 days like magic.  Now we cannot go without, guess my baby is an Ilex junkie! I wish this stuff was available at a pharmacy.  Shipping times given are deceptive so sometimes it comes in the mail a whole week before promised. I am not complaining about that.</li>
    <li> My daughters gets horrible diaper rashes where she bleeds because of a disease she was born with.  Ilex is the best stuff to use when it gets that bad we buy it all of the time and I would recommend it t anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked that there aren&#x27;t more reviews for this stuff.  This cream is so awesome and works great to get rid of a non-fungal diaper rash. We have been struggling for weeks with our infant son&#x27;s diaper rash. He developed a big rash due to virtually constant pooping.  The rash started as just a burn looking thing and then turned fungal. It took weeks to get rid of the fungal rash using athletes foot medications, but the regular diaper rash just kept returning no matter how much Desitin, Aquaphor, or Triple Paste we slathered on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finially I did a Google search and found Ilex.  This stuff got rid of my boy&#x27;s regular diaper rash in one night!  It&#x27;s a godsend and a must have for those that find the other things just don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very thick, but not so thick that you need to worry about applying it over the opening.  When I read that it&#x27;s like rubber cement I worried that it would be difficult to deal with and difficult to remove. It&#x27;s not.  It comes of pretty easily when rubbed with a regular baby wipe.  I apply about a pea sized amount of the Ilex and then apply some Aquaphor over top of it to keep the diaper from sticking too badly.  It really does do the trick.  I&#x27;m so happy that my little boy no longer screams every time he pees or poops.  Hooray for Ilex!</li>
    <li> Our 2-month old baby had a severe diaper rash that didn&#x27;t go even after using multiple off the shelf &amp; presription creams. Finally, our pediatrician did some research, consulted other doctors &amp; recommended iLex (it was her first experience with iLex). The diaper rash healed within just a few days of using iLex. It works really well to seal the rash area and prevent further irritation. The good thing about this cream is that you apply once a day and it creates a \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; seal that doesn&#x27;t come off with every diaper change (it comes off only when you wash with soap and water). Once the rash has healed - we switched over to aquaphor.</li>
    <li> MY BABY GIRL HAD A SEVERE DIAPER RASH, I USE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE, OVER THE COUNTER PRODUCTS AND HOMEMADE, NOTHING LIKE THIS AMAZING PRODUCT!! THE RASH WAS GONE IN LESS THAN 48HRS.</li>
    <li> best stuff ever, my daughters rash was soo bad, it bled and was extremely raw. i tried every otc rash cream, none worked. i bought this stuff and the rash looked better in hours and completely gone in 3 days</li>
    <li> After battling for weeks with an open wound on my daughter&#x27;s bottom and trying what seemed like everything - leaving her undiapered, diet changes, maximum strength zinc oxide diaper creams, natural diaper creams, prescription ointment, antibiotics and antifungals - I ordered Ilex after stumbling across a recommendation on an online forum. The reviews on Amazon were good, but I was still skeptical. Alas, within a day of it arriving, the wound borders started improving and by a week it was 100% healed...hooray!  And the 2 oz. container seems like it will last her entire infancy and beyond.  Of note, make sure you have Vaseline/petroleum jelly around to put on top of the Ilex to prevent it from sticking to itself and/or the diaper.  It seems like putting Vaseline on top of it would wipe it off, but it doesn&#x27;t; This stuff has some pretty interesting properties; it also has no trouble adhering to wet wound surfaces, unlike most diaper creams. Moral of the story, Ilex is awesome. 10/10, would buy again.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s g-tube was removed with no stitches after several years.  When it wasn&#x27;t closing well we hunted for anything and everything to protect her skin from the stomach acids that were flowing out of her.  Ilex was exactly the right thing!  I was actually able to use it to plug up the tube site until the doctors decided to close the site surgically.  It really protected her from the pain of stomach acid on her skin.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else I&#x27;m here to sing the praises of this stuff. Mikey had palate surgery, then afterwards a round of antibiotics. All this lead to horrible liquid diarrhea which caused by far the worst case of diaper rash any of my 3 kids has ever had. I tried everything even a visit and nothing was helping. His skin was beginning to become weepy. I decided to try this stuff and it is AWESOME. We are at the not even 24 hour mark and the rash is 90% better! Will never be without this again!!</li>
    <li> This really helps when my daughter has really bad diaper rash. She has very acidic stool because a short bowel syndrome, but if there&#x27;s any skin break down, this really clears it up RIGHT AWAY! You must use another paste on top of it, else it&#x27;ll stick to the diaper, so I use a desitin/karaya powder mix on top of the ilex which is on the skin as a base protector. If their skin is very sensitive due to a rash, you have to pat clean, or use water, never rub off.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend, it is not available in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;He was blown away by the result. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My child has acidic stools due to an intestinal condition. This causes frequent open sores and bleeding rashes. This paste puts a durable rubbery coating on and keeps the skin away from contact. We could not survive without this. Just don&#x27;t put it on too thick. A smooth even coat with vaseline over is best.</li>
    <li> This product helped my baby great-grandson, who was born with Hirschsprung Disease. After surgery his bowl movements were akin to acid on his delicate little skin. Ilex paste was like a miracle in protecting his skin and assists in the healing process.</li>
    <li> My newborn boy has hirchsprung&#x27;s disease and gets horrible diaper rashes. He was hospitalized with second degree burns on his bottom and we ordered ilex hoping it would help as everything else we tried did not work. This stuff is amazing!!! With in an hour of putting it on, his bottom went from this horrible angry red color to turning pink and with in 2 days his burn was gone. We now use this every day to keep the rash from coming back and it has worked so great!!! It has been a life saver!!</li>
    <li> It works good on my little angle diaper rash. Works better than other products I have used on the rash</li>
    <li> Great product would reccomend.  Use it for a patient with a g-tube and it is great for keeping the skin from breaking down!!!</li>
    <li> My baby had a terrible diaper rash. After using several over the counter products with no results my pediatrician recommended Ilex.  This product was very hard to locate locally so thanks for amazon once I used it, I saw instant results overnight.  Now my baby is happy and that is priceless!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I found that truly work for my son that has hirschsrungs ...best for his rash since his pull through.</li>
    <li> Any time my son gets a bad diaper rash we go straight to Ilex to help it heal.  It is the best thing I have found to protect the skin and give it a chance to heal.  What we have found to work is to clean him up with water, let his bottom dry out really well then coat him in a thin layer of Ilex, let that dry a little then put a layer of Vaseline or Aquaphor on top to prevent the Ilex from sticking to his diaper.  We usually see drastic improvement within 12 hours.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to us during a particularly bad bought of the flu for our infant daughter.  It provided her skin with the protection needed to repair despite the near constant stomach issues that were causing her bottom to become extremely raw.&lt;br /&gt;We bought an extra tube to keep in our safety kit as a just in case - the hunt to find this particular product was a little ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Love it! My daughter has bad diaper rash and this is the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> We use this for my son&#x27;s diaper rashes... as long as you use aquaphor on top of it, its seriously works in 1 day flat.</li>
