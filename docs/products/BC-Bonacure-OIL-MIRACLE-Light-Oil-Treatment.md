    <li> This oil really does help reduce frizzies and gives my hair a nice feel.  Great stuff and a little goes a long way.  I just use one or two drops in the palm of my hand and then rub it into my hair.  I have tried other oils but they made my hair feel to heavy but this one is superior to the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Love this oil...I am blonde with fine hair..this DOES NOT make my hair feel heavy and oily.  WAY better pricing then in the salons plus you only use a dime sized amount...lasts forever.</li>
    <li> The product is very good, but it&#x27;s not the Miracle Oil, it is the Potion oil.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know the diference, but the package is not the same.</li>
    <li> product complies with the specifications&lt;br /&gt;no to claims&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend to all</li>
    <li> love this oil, gives me great curls for my naturally curly hair.  Have tried others and they make my hair frizzy</li>

    <li> I love this oil potin, it&#x27;s always a good treatment and it leaves a shiny and soft hair. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The Oil Potion Light is a miracle in a bottle for my blonde hair. Tames frizz &amp; flyaways, conditions damaged ends, protects hair, &amp; extends color --all with no oily look or tacky feeling left in my hair. Somehow this oil absorbs in hair, leaving shiny, glowing locks. Get some!</li>
    <li> I found this in Alaska and it has done wonders for my hair. I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the way this makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> The first time I had this product used on my hair was at my stylist&#x27;s salon.  I usually don&#x27;t like oil in the hair as it tends to weigh my hair down.  This stuff has the perfect amount of light moisture. I find it better than Moroccan oil. My stylist worked it through my wet hair, and then she blew it out.  Beautiful result.

    <li> smells soo soo soo good but if you expect real improvement to your hair than seriously lower your expectations as its just as useful as any other oil you can pick up in cvs, besides wonderful smell i have seen zero improvement in hair quality</li>
    <li> I use this with the BC Color save ends and it created a soft shiny blowout with out a heavy feel.</li>
    <li> Awsome smell, and it makes your hair less static, and smooth, does as it says, I carry it every where with me, good on your hands as well.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the oil with the argan in it.  The smell is awful. And I cant get a refund.</li>
    <li> I normally take a shower at night so the next day my wet hair is a moist frizzy mess that only gets worse with brushing. Putting this on at night helps it not be so crazy the next. And if I shower, put this on, and blow-dry my wavy hair comes out mostly straight, no straightner needed. Light enough so I can still shower every other day and not have greasy roots.</li>
    <li> Perfect. It&#x27;s totally light, not that oily!</li>
