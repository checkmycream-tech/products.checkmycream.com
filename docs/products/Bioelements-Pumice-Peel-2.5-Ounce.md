      <li>you feel the exfoliation, but a very very gentle one.</li>
      <li>awesome product - fee like something they would use at an expensive spa.</li>
      <li>I have used this peel twice so far, and it is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>After the second layer, the Gel Therapy was applied on top and it neutralized the pumice peel.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite facial scrub.</li>
      <li>Personally feel price on this could be more competitive.</li>
      <li>My skin tends to be more on the sensitive side and product sensitive but this doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>Leaving your skin fresh and new.</li>

      <li>This product from Bioelements really does enhance the appearance of your skin.</li>
      <li>Its so gentle and works like a dream</li>
      <li>I like that it is a mechanical peel, because with chemical peels sometime I feel like it&#x27;s not doing much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>or you could really irritate your skin</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t contaminate the whole jar.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised to feel activity on the first layer applied.  </li>

      <li>so I just add a little water to my fingers and scrub lightly to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>Its gentle but still deep cleaning.</li>
      <li>It consists of very fine exfoliating particles( almost dust like fine), so when you use it, you are getting rid of the dead skin cells but, at the same time, you are nor irritating your skin which a lot of the scrubs tend to do.</li>
      <li>just starting this product line, like so far</li>
      <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
      <li>After a few days of using it, I had better results than the super expensive Obagi system.</li>

      <li>I really like it comes with the little applicator</li>

<li> I have oily skin and my skin needs little rougher peel treatment-</li>
<li> bought a 2.5oz Pumice Peel from a spa a few years ago for over $50.  </li>
<li> I would recommend using this product once a week, to get rid of the dead skin cells.</li>
<li> so you know that you are exfoliating but not too harshly.</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s just this or combination of this &amp; my clarisonic &amp; the sleepwear from bio elements....</li>
<li> It can irritate if you scrub too hard.</li>
<li> Compliments on my skin lately!</li>

    <li> Love it! This exfoliator is gentle and very effective! You could use it daily if you wished. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Bioelements Pumice Peel, 2.5-Ounce is gentle on my skin  but feels like it is doing its job at exfoliating and leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent results! Loving this product! Can use as mask or scrub and excellent results with both.  This is one I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Pumice Peel has been my only choice for manual exfoliation for years. After using, skin will be the softest you have ever felt. This is a requirement of my beauty routine; I once a week. Make-up looks better because the dead skin will be gone! While working in a day spa, I learned this product was the safest manual microdermabrasion because all the granules are of uniform size as compared with others an therefore does not cause tiny tears in your skin.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with bumpy skin for years.  I had a facialist recommend this to me and it sat in my medicine cabinet for far too long before I tried repeated use.  After a few days of using it, I had better results than the super expensive Obagi system. I also didn&#x27;t have to put up with the skin peeling that I had when I did the full Obagi system (which I had to do to see minor results).  Of course, you&#x27;d probably have to have skin like mine, to get my results. I have had pimples for years, am in my fourties now and I seem to have combination skin that is not sensitive to products.  I&#x27;m excited to have something that is making my skin smooth. It does dry a bit, so I keep it away from my eye area and will have to find an excellent moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my original problem.  Maybe I&#x27;ll go back to Obagi for that piece of my routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since beauty school and love it! Your skin is so smooth after using.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in a total beauty collection box. I enjoyed it so much I decided to buy the full size. A little goes a long way so it will last a really long time. Product received was just the same as the sample, so I am happy with my purchase. I usually wash my face first, then towel dry, while my face is still a little damp I apply the pumice peel. It drys really quickly on your skin so I just add a little water to my fingers and scrub lightly to exfoliate. It can irritate if you scrub too hard. Then I just rinse it off and my face feels nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product from Bioelements really does enhance the appearance of your skin. It helps slough off all the dead skin cells and dry skin, revealing a much brighter, softer face.

    <li> Love it!  Not sure if it&#x27;s just this or combination of this &amp; my clarisonic &amp; the sleepwear from bio elements....but I have had sev. Compliments on my skin lately!</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter and it is her go to for those occasional outbreaks of acne. It is pricey though, not going to lie. Personally feel price on this could be more competitive.</li>
    <li> I love using this product. Its gentle but still deep cleaning. Leaving your skin fresh and new. I use it 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Introduced to this by a favorite esthetician.  I think it works great, but must rub gently or you could really irritate your skin</li>
    <li> I was reading a spa sight and it said that it used bioelements. I looked up amazon to see if it were cheaper (it is ) by  a 100 dollars cheaper. so I bought this and I have no regrets. face is smoother. great product</li>
    <li> Its so gentle and works like a dream</li>
    <li> I love this product.  After I use it my skin is so nice and smooth, moisturize and you won&#x27;t belief how good your skin feels.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. It consists of very fine exfoliating particles( almost dust like fine), so when you use it, you are getting rid of the dead skin cells but, at the same time, you are nor irritating your skin which a lot of the scrubs tend to do. I like that it is a mechanical peel, because with chemical peels sometime I feel like it&#x27;s not doing much. This peel is excellent you feel the exfoliation, but a very very gentle one. I would recommend using this product once a week, to get rid of the dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> just starting this product line, like so far</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!!  I have used this peel twice so far, and it is fantastic.  After it dries on my face, I use my Clarisonic with a very wet brush to slough the peel off.  I rewet my brush head halfway through the sloughing.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW SOFT AND CLEAN AND WONDERFUL MY FACE FELT AND IT LOOKED REFRESHED AND BRIGHT.  This peel is amazing!</li>
    <li> Bioelements Pumice Peel, 2.5-Ounce has been a staple item for my face care for 5 years. I wouldn&#x27;t go a week without it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by the Spa staff where I get my facials, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat buy. If you have tried this, then you are prob about to buy it again and again and again. The grit is fine, but not insignificant. it is like fine sand. so you know that you are exfoliating but not too harshly. Thats what i like the most, it is effective but not over the top.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub. I tend to get the scrubbing &#x27;beads&#x27; in my pores but not a problem with this one. I also like the warming affect on my face as I&#x27;m using it and has a light scent. My skin tends to be more on the sensitive side and product sensitive but this doesn&#x27;t bother me. A little bit goes a long ways. I use it once a week with my fingers. I really like it comes with the little applicator so I don&#x27;t contaminate the whole jar.</li>
    <li> awesome product - fee like something they would use at an expensive spa. The feel/smell mentally takes me there.  8)</li>
    <li> FAKE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 2.5oz Pumice Peel from a spa a few years ago for over $50.  I used the product on my dry skin once a week and my dry skin was controlled.  Bioelements is heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to my replacement container from Amazon. I had to use the Amazon purchase once a day to control my dry skin because the dry skin was reforming every morning.  Sometimes, I would get out of the shower and still have traces of dry skin where I had meticulously scrubbed- I NEVER had traces of dry skin after using the spa purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I dropped the Amazon purchase in the shower after a couple months of use.  I spent an extra $23 on the same 2.5oz Pumice Peel and bought it directly from Bioelements.com.  I received it in the mail today and what can you guess?  The containers are shaped differently in the slightest way, the blue lettering is a shade different, the letter spacing is smaller/larger, and the directions for use on the Amazon purchase are completely different than the directions for use on the Bioelements.com purchase.  Also, side by side, they smell completely different, and the REAL Bioelements is much more gritty than the Amazon purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you read any of the other reviews, notice how they are reviewing the actual Bioelements PRODUCT and not the actual Amazon SELLER.  $28 (Amazon.com) vs. $51 (Bioelements.com)?  Why would Bioelements sell their product at an almost 50% reduction on Amazon? They wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial scrub. My face feels smooth after use and helps keep acne away.</li>
    <li> Best peel ever! This price here is the lowest I could find! I have oily skin and my skin needs little rougher peel treatment- this stuff is the great. The grains are so fine, yet more effective than any peel I have tried. Lasts long time because little goes long way.  Hopefully once I need it again I would be still able to get it for this price.</li>
    <li> We use this product at my esthetics school as a manual microderm and I love it.  I was really surprised to feel activity on the first layer applied.  It was a warmth similar to an enzyme mask which I was wasn&#x27;t expecting but it wasn&#x27;t over powering.  After the second layer, the Gel Therapy was applied on top and it neutralized the pumice peel.  An enzyme mask after would be great to complete the treatment!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliator on the market!</li>
