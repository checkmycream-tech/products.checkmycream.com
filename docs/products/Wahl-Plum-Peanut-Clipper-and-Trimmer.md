    <li> As I stylist I have always used the peanut!  Great trimmer, I have been using this brand for over 8 years</li>
    <li> Love the peanut and also love the purple! Thanks</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist, I purchased these for neck trims because I work in a salon setting and needed a good trimmer. Well within a just a few weeks I noticed that the top of the clipper would become loose, and hair would get stuck down inside of the trimmer, within a few days after that the entire blade of the clipper kept falling off!!!! I do not recommend this seller because when I contacted them about the problem I had they informed me that the time had expired to return them when I haven&#x27;t even had the trimmers for 30 days!!!! Do not buy from this seller!!!! Also took longer to receive than listed.</li>
    <li> these are great as I remembered</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer!!!. perfect  for small jobs, lining  neck and edges, tapering, mustache, beard and love the fact that, they are purple my favorite color,  I think everybody else too because,...... they are  hard to find!!!!  MW.</li>
    <li> It great and artived so fast I think in 2 days</li>
    <li> small, works well. Does not require batteries. Purple is cheapest</li>
    <li> Works great for edges but the guards don&#x27;t work as well as they do on a standard sized clipper. Cannot handle thick hair well .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good item, it works great and will help me a lot on my stylist course. thank you</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE the purple whoop whoop lol :)</li>
    <li> Still in the packaging but it looks great. Will use soon!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for trimming my goatee, long sideburns, nose and ear hair as well and trimming the eyebrows. Love the extra long cord. Compact enough that I&#x27;ll never use a rechargeable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t dropped this yet so I&#x27;m cautious because I unbalanced the blades on a Groomsman I haven&#x27;t been able to true ever since.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great! I&#x27;m a woman with short hair and I use this to cut my own hair around all the sides and back. It&#x27;s small, but mighty, and really easy to clean. This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;ve now been using this for over a year--maybe even 2? I would totally recommend this to anyone who wants just the right size powerful hair trimmer. Can cut the whole head of hair, but also just the right size to trim sideburns and over the ear too (don&#x27;t make the mistake of getting cordless--this one has the power you need and a nice long cord that won&#x27;t get in your way). Still sharp and I use it heavily every month! Comes with 4 different size combs that allow me to even cut the back of my own head evenly!</li>
    <li> Thank you, best clippers that meets my needs.</li>
    <li> This works very well. It has plenty of power and seems to cut well. Bought it to replace a low end Conair that worked okay for a few years. Also, works better than a newer Conair that I have at the summer cottage. I use it mostly for shaving neck hairs about once a week and for a beard trim about every three months. Just for home use, I&#x27;m not a pro. Would be good for travel except the cord is very heavy and takes up as much space at the clipper. Expensive, but seems worth it.</li>
    <li> No problems with seller. Meet all expectations. Very good product...</li>
    <li> This is a great product for women that is in the hair industry that want something small to hold. Cuts nice and smooth and very easy to use. Good product!</li>
    <li> Its great, i needed to advance my clipper techniques and this has work good for me so far.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and I purchsed these for neck trimming. Since my purchse  they have been cutting up my clients necks. I have had good experiences with Wahl peanut brand in the past but these are horrible!</li>
    <li> I really do love this clipper. good for small dogs :)</li>
    <li> Love it ! Easy to use</li>
    <li> They work great! Even as a professional I still pick the peanuts!!</li>
    <li> These quit working within 2 weeks. I work in a barber shop and use trimmers on a minimum of 10 clients a day. They sound like a dying chainsaw currently. Not able to return or refund is a huge inconvenience.</li>
