      <li>Love, love fairy tales product.  </li>
      <li>OK, put it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, combed through, look at my hand, 2 lice.  </li>
      <li>Started to look through her hair and there they were on TOP of her hair, not underneath.</li>

      <li>(she couldn&#x27;t handle any more) and they started disappearing.</li>

      <li>I use this product on my two elementary age girls.  </li>
      <li>This is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really know if it works or not, but it&#x27;s worth using it just on the off chance that it really does work, because honestly, who wants to deal with the hassle of lice detection and removal?</li>
      <li>We use it for both 6 and 2 year old and it smells fine and works well.</li>
      <li>5 cases of lice in my daughters first grade class, but not my daughter.</li>
      <li>Still got lice first time it came around school.</li>
      <li>A major perk is that is makes hair very soft and silky. :)</li>
      <li>I much rather be preventive v. getting those critters.  </li>
      <li>I have also found that their hair is much softer and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I used this in my hair and it didn&#x27;t make it very soft though.</li>
      <li>So far, it has kept the lice from coming back to haunt us too!</li>

<li> absolute waste of my money!</li>
<li> I think me &amp; my daughter were giving them back and forth to each other.</li>
<li> We only use it about every other time they wash their hair too!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s slightly sticky enough to act as a styling gel, too.</li>
<li> used exclusively for a lice prone 6 year old with long thick locks.</li>
<li> Perhaps it repels mosquitoes or other bugs</li>
<li> I used it every time I washed the kids hair - every other day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth the amount of money you spend.</li>
<li> My husband doesn&#x27;t care for how it makes my son&#x27;s hair feel when it&#x27;s time to wash his hair at night, but again, I&#x27;d rather have a little greasy-feeling in his hair that we have to wash out at night than having to deal with a lice infection any day.</li>
<li> We use this all year round to ward off lice.</li>
<li> Tired chemical prior to this</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to say if this works or not.</li>
<li> The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
<li> It wouldn&#x27;t be bad if the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
<li> and so disappointed I put my kids through that.</li>
<li> We have been dealing with this nasty problem for months.</li>
<li> but she HATED the smell!  </li>

    <li> Smells wonderful and makes her hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> We have been dealing with this nasty problem for months. I think me &amp; my daughter were giving them back and forth to each other. So we both used the Fairy Tales shampoo, conditioner &amp; detangler spray and then combed our hair with LiceFreee and lice comb. I did it every day but I did my daughters twice a week (she couldn&#x27;t handle any more) and they started disappearing. It took about a month. Have been free for 2-months and it&#x27;s great. I think in was the combination of everything because when I tried these products individually they didn&#x27;t work. We still use the shampoo, conditioner &amp; detangular spray every time.&lt;br /&gt;And on a side note, my daughter started swimming at the Y pool &amp; at friends houses and I noticed them disappearing also. Coincidence?&lt;br /&gt;Just happy they&#x27;re gone.</li>
    <li> You would think by the smell of the product it would repel lice but in my daughter&#x27;s case they only multiplied and she was re-infected while using the product.  Perhaps it repels mosquitoes or other bugs but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I ended up using a basic conditioner in the end and between the two products I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  It&#x27;s not worth the amount of money you spend.</li>
    <li> This is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really know if it works or not, but it&#x27;s worth using it just on the off chance that it really does work, because honestly, who wants to deal with the hassle of lice detection and removal? When my son&#x27;s school had a lice infection notice, I immediately ran to my nearest beauty supply store to buy the top rated lice removal comb. In the process, I came across this Fairy Tales Energizing Leave-In Conditioner, which claims to prevent lice infections. I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for it at the time, but trust me when I say, it was worth every penny to stop my imaginary head itchiness, which started the moment I read the lice infection bulletin pinned to the classroom door. At any rate, this leave-in conditioner smells really nice, isn&#x27;t too sticky and I put it on my son every morning before school or any event where he will be amongst a lot of children. It&#x27;s slightly sticky enough to act as a styling gel, too. My husband doesn&#x27;t care for how it makes my son&#x27;s hair feel when it&#x27;s time to wash his hair at night, but again, I&#x27;d rather have a little greasy-feeling in his hair that we have to wash out at night than having to deal with a lice infection any day.</li>
    <li> Love, love fairy tales product.  This conditioner works excellent, leaves the hair soft and shiny.  Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this and the shampoo during a lice infestation.  After that experience, id do anything to keep the lice away. No idea if this really works to keep away lice, but its a good conditiner and smells nice, so i have no qualms about using it just in case. We will probably use it during lice season every year, but maybe not the rest of the year.</li>
    <li> This is our go-to haircare for the school year.  I much rather be preventive v. getting those critters.  We have been fine all school year and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> After about a week of using this product on my children, it worked wonders we have been lice free ever since! We only use it about every other time they wash their hair too!</li>
    <li> We used this product as it was recommended by a friend. A major perk is that is makes hair very soft and silky. :)</li>
    <li> My girls use nothing but the Fairly Tale products on their hair.  Have not gotten lice since its use and smells great.</li>
    <li> Good price and helpful product. We use this all year round to ward off lice. We like the smell too.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great for kids!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Fairy Tales shampoo, conditioner and leave-in spray.  The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  I use this product on my two elementary age girls.  They like it too because they say they don&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;medicine\\&quot; anymore.  I have also found that their hair is much softer and manageable.  I love this line of products and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> My daughter was told to buy this product to help prevent head lice which one of the kid&#x27;s in my granddaughter&#x27;s class had.  No head lice on our granddaughter so I guess it works!</li>
    <li> OK, put it in my daughter&#x27;s hair, combed through, look at my hand, 2 lice.  Started to look through her hair and there they were on TOP of her hair, not underneath. (stunned)  They definitely don&#x27;t like this product! Tired chemical prior to this and so disappointed I put my kids through that. BUY this, it works and it&#x27;s the repellant!</li>
    <li> Have been using the Fairy Tales conditioner for over a month.  After using it in my wooded location, I haven&#x27;t noticed any ticks.  It smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I like both the conditioner and shampoo. Good price, too!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter but she HATED the smell!  It wouldn&#x27;t be bad if the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
    <li> we had lice, got rid of it, started using this and BAM - more lice. I used it every time I washed the kids hair - every other day. didn&#x27;t prevent anything. :(&lt;br /&gt;smells nice though and conditions well. Will continue to use for those purposes but I will not rely on it for lice prevention.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if this works or not. They&#x27;ve had lice at school but we haven&#x27;t gotten it. I used this in my hair and it didn&#x27;t make it very soft though. It works well for my sons hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome, worked very well. Especially battling lice for over a month.</li>
    <li> used exclusively for a lice prone 6 year old with long thick locks. Still got lice first time it came around school. absolute waste of my money!</li>
    <li> Smells great, keeps hair soft.  So far, it has kept the lice from coming back to haunt us too! I will keep using.</li>
    <li> 5 cases of lice in my daughters first grade class, but not my daughter. Fingers crossed. It also smells really nice, and is a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> We use it for both 6 and 2 year old and it smells fine and works well.</li>
