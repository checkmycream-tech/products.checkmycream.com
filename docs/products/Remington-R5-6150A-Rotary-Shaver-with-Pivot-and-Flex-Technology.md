### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>very happy with my purchase</li>
      <li>Works perfect.</li>
      <li>Excellent product and great delivery service by Amazon using Prime.  </li>
      <li>Great product at a great price</li>
      <li>and it was great.</li>
      <li>Oh..is a great razor,</li>
      <li>Got a great deal from Amazon on this unit.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say this is a particularly great shaver.  </li>
      <li>Great purchase.</li>
      <li>It worked great, it had a smooth grill which gave a good close shave without leaving irritation</li>
      <li>I have discovered after purchasing many electric shavers over the years that Titanium it the best for me when it comes to a  close clean shave, and that does not pull the hairs out.</li>
      <li>The shaver gives an excellent close shave, is rechargeable.and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Even a greater concern to me is that it did not come with any kind of plastic cover for the shaving head.  </li>
      <li>this one by far has the best battery life and is top 3 in the quality shave it gives.  </li>
      <li>I have been using rotary razors for many years.  </li>
      <li>But it works and I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric razors for more than 50 years and</li>
      <li>This mens shaver is more than my hubby thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not sure if I am going to keep it or not.  </li>
      <li>The R5-6150 is a good shaver at the right price.  </li>
      <li>This Remington shaver provides as good or better shave than the Norelco shavers which cost twice as much.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the floating head and the ease of the wash feature to clean it.</li>
      <li>it does shave decent but i have to keep going over some areas to get a good shave..</li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver because I am a brand loyal customer, but after reading the reviews on a comparable Norelco I should have known better.  </li>
      <li>Shaver does a pretty good, love the time read out but,the shave isn&amp;#34;t as close as my older remington,but i&amp;#34;ll get by!</li>
      <li>He loves how quite it is, and how easy it is to clean the head of the shaver.  </li>
      <li>This razor is fine for a quick save in the morning, though it won&#x27;t save as close as a safety razor it will save you the time of lathering and all that morning ritual.  </li>
      <li>, I just received this item today, and in the pictures for this item it shows a charging stand, which is one of the reasons I bought another one of these - well it did not come with a charging stand, or a plastic cover for the blades, which I know my original one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives me a great shave, the battery lasts long, and I have no complaints.  </li>
      <li>The readout is nice because it lets you know how many minutes of shave time you have left till you need recharging.</li>
      <li>On a positive note, they are truthful about the battery life though.</li>
      <li>Quality made, daily use, good charging system.</li>
      <li>Once I switched to the Remington, I realized that I was paying too much for a Norelco shaver that didn&#x27;t provide any better shave.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t pull one hair and quickly shaved the area closer than any shaver I ever owned.</li>
      <li>Have owned this model previously and it works great for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it gave a better shave than the old one.  </li>
      <li>Better than my old one</li>
      <li>Three weeks is far more time than one should need to adjust in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Back in high school (about 10 years ago), I had a Remington shaver that I loved, as did anyone on the wrestling team that had to barrow it before a meet.  </li>
      <li>This new model works just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had Remingtons in the past and they were great.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>this is the first razor that I have ever had that did not come with these two things.</li>
      <li>Shaver worked OK after initial charge, altho</li>
      <li>its first charge I have gone thru</li>
      <li>Luckily I saved the charging cable from my older model.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works exactly as described and,&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the whole head pivots</li>
      <li>The sideburn trimmer works very well.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much evidence it was trimming.  </li>
      <li>It does the job for the most part, but if the surface of your skin has some rough patches (like I do)</li>
      <li>possibly Remington is getting cheap.</li>
      <li>I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to a Phillips in college which was a bit smoother, worked beautifully if I shaved in the shower, but had a hard time with the coarse hairs at the bottom of the beard hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the digital timer showing how much shave time is left.</li>
      <li>This Remington R5-6150A replaces an older model without an LED readout.</li>
      <li>The battery in my older model pooped out and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
      <li>Just got my razor, it replaced an older Remington that I dropped and broke.  </li>
      <li>This item was well priced it does have a decent shave</li>
      <li>Better in the tight spots - like the lip under the nose.</li>
      <li>It cuts much faster and closer than my old Remington.</li>
      <li>I get several days worth.</li>
      <li>No complaint about razor.</li>
      <li>To get a better shave you&#x27;d have to spend at least $30 more, the quality and value of this shaver far outweighs the cost of all other shavers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.</li>
      <li>works pretty well, holds a charge for at least two weeks, a stand would have been nice though i dont like how it doesn&#x27;t sit flat</li>
      <li>This one was purchased after the old one needed a new battery and nothing else.  </li>
      <li>This one is far coarser than either of the two, feeling like a cheese grater on my face in comparison.  </li>
      <li>It was old</li>
      <li>Wow what a shaver.</li>
      <li>Also, the trimmer pops itself closed when at certain angles.  </li>
      <li>Usually like 5 to 10 minutes worth.</li>
      <li>However, I am disappointed that this razor does not come with any kind of case, the old one came with a soft zipper travel case.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> pulls hair and chafes</li>
    <li> I have been using rotary razors for many years.  I have owned Norelco and Remington.  The Norelcos are always much more expensive and they never last longer than any of the Remington.  It gives me a great shave, the battery lasts long, and I have no complaints.  Every rotary I have every bought, eventually dies.  The remington lasts just as long as norelco for half the price.  I love the digital timer showing how much shave time is left.</li>
    <li> Back in high school (about 10 years ago), I had a Remington shaver that I loved, as did anyone on the wrestling team that had to barrow it before a meet.  It worked great, it had a smooth grill which gave a good close shave without leaving irritation and it got the hairs at the base of my neck.  I &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; to a Phillips in college which was a bit smoother, worked beautifully if I shaved in the shower, but had a hard time with the coarse hairs at the bottom of the beard hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the batteries are shot in both now, I&#x27;ve upgraded again.  This one is far coarser than either of the two, feeling like a cheese grater on my face in comparison.  The only thing I like is that it gives an even shave, as it gets the hairs on my neck, but the shave is far less closer than any other razor I&#x27;ve used, giving me my usual &amp;#34;5 o-clock&amp;#34; shadow around 2.  They state in the instructions that your face will need time to adjust, which I think is Remington&#x27;s polite way of saying that you will need time to grow facial skin that rival a cement worker&#x27;s hands.  Three weeks is far more time than one should need to adjust in my opinion.  On a positive note, they are truthful about the battery life though.</li>
    <li> The unit is a little bit loose when in use which makes it seem fragile. It makes little knocking noises. But it works and I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> The R5-6150 is a good shaver at the right price.  I&#x27;ve had around 5 different shavers over the last 15 years and this one by far has the best battery life and is top 3 in the quality shave it gives.  To get a better shave you&#x27;d have to spend at least $30 more, the quality and value of this shaver far outweighs the cost of all other shavers I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.</li>
    <li> The shaver gives an excellent close shave, is rechargeable.and is easy to clean. I like that the head is washable.</li>
    <li> Have owned this model previously and it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I just received this item today, and in the pictures for this item it shows a charging stand, which is one of the reasons I bought another one of these - well it did not come with a charging stand, or a plastic cover for the blades, which I know my original one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I am going to keep it or not.  Going to try contacting Amazon about the charging stand that it shows in the photo.</li>
    <li> This Remington R5-6150A replaces an older model without an LED readout. The battery in my older model pooped out and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge so I had to always use it plugged in to the electrical outlet. Used it this way until it became annoying. This new model works just fine. The readout is nice because it lets you know how many minutes of shave time you have left till you need recharging. I get several days worth. I let it deplete as low as possible before I recharge. Usually like 5 to 10 minutes worth. You don&#x27;t get the stand as pictured and mine did not have the coiled charging cable. Luckily I saved the charging cable from my older model. Works perfect.</li>
    <li> About my 3rd Remington. Works well. I like the small digital readout. Does not come with a 3 blade plastic protector nor a baggie &#x3D;possibly Remington is getting cheap. Reason for 4 not 5 stars is for the plastic protector missing in this model.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington razors for years.  This one was purchased after the old one needed a new battery and nothing else.  It was old so I upgraded to this one.  Excellent product and great delivery service by Amazon using Prime.  Thanks!  Ron</li>
    <li> Wow what a shaver. I have discovered after purchasing many electric shavers over the years that Titanium it the best for me when it comes to a  close clean shave, and that does not pull the hairs out. This unit was no different. I enjoyed the floating head and the ease of the wash feature to clean it.</li>
    <li> works pretty well, holds a charge for at least two weeks, a stand would have been nice though i dont like how it doesn&#x27;t sit flat</li>
    <li> While the display of minutes remaining and overall battery capacity is great, the shaving is terrible. It kept grabbing and pulling the hair instead of cutting. It makes shaving torture! I had previously a Remington and it was great. But they missed the mark on this model. No only does it pull hair but it misses a lot of hair even after repeatedly going over the area. I returned it and got a Norelco pt720xnt and its different like night and day. It didn&#x27;t pull one hair and quickly shaved the area closer than any shaver I ever owned. I didn&#x27;t think rotary could shave that close.</li>
    <li> No complaint about razor. I&#x27;d rather have the model that comes with the stand up charger. This model didn&#x27;t include it.</li>
    <li> The shaver was delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly as described and,&lt;br /&gt;with its first charge I have gone thru&lt;br /&gt;six shaves and it still has 36 min&lt;br /&gt;of shaving time left in the battery.</li>
    <li> This razor has a poorly executed floating head system.  The entire head, represented by the shiny area holding all three heads is the issue.  This entire area rocks back and forth, making a clicking noise as the plastics meet.  I can&#x27;t believe a company would design something so unappealing.  When trying to move the shaver across small areas, such as under the nostrils, the head assembly just rocks back and forth rather than shaving the area efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;  The power button is difficult to engage.  The digital readout was ineffective as it only moved about 20 points before giving a poor shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;  The heads only have 2 circles of blades as compared to the 3 on my norelco, that I will go back to after replacing blades. The shave quality on my thick hair was poor with the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;  The entire shaver is bulkier than you would expect.  All together a poorly engineered product, I&#x27;ll keep for a spare.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m replacing one that was lost. My last order included a charging stand and, I think, a cleaning brush. Missing those two things plus as I remember a while back when I bought one I got a zippered carry bag. Just seems like things get dropped..except price? Oh..is a great razor, tis why I re-ordered It!</li>
    <li> It cuts much faster and closer than my old Remington. Better in the tight spots - like the lip under the nose.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> Just got my razor, it replaced an older Remington that I dropped and broke.  I&#x27;ve only shaved with it once and it gave a better shave than the old one.  However, I am disappointed that this razor does not come with any kind of case, the old one came with a soft zipper travel case.  Even a greater concern to me is that it did not come with any kind of plastic cover for the shaving head.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with electric razors for more than 50 years and this is the first razor that I have ever had that did not come with these two things.</li>
    <li> Shaver worked OK after initial charge, altho I didn&#x27;t see much evidence it was trimming.  Recharged when battery low.  It no longer worked.  Opening it and checking heads, I couldn&#x27;t get them back in.  Am returning it to Remington.</li>
    <li> This mens shaver is more than my hubby thought it would be.  He loves how quite it is, and how easy it is to clean the head of the shaver.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This Remington shaver provides as good or better shave than the Norelco shavers which cost twice as much. This is my second Remington shaver since the other, after five years of service, simply wore out. Once I switched to the Remington, I realized that I was paying too much for a Norelco shaver that didn&#x27;t provide any better shave.</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I guess the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough.  Also, the trimmer pops itself closed when at certain angles.  Not good for thick hair.</li>
    <li> This item was well priced it does have a decent shave but the whole head pivots n i thought just the round part of the blades pivoted n this is annoying as it moves to fast n doesnt fill stable while shaving.. it does shave decent but i have to keep going over some areas to get a good shave..</li>
    <li> This razor is fine for a quick save in the morning, though it won&#x27;t save as close as a safety razor it will save you the time of lathering and all that morning ritual.  The sideburn trimmer works very well.</li>
    <li> takes longer than blade shaving, but it is cleaner in the sink.  Not quite as close....</li>
    <li> Shaver does a pretty good, love the time read out but,the shave isn&amp;#34;t as close as my older remington,but i&amp;#34;ll get by!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say this is a particularly great shaver.  I&#x27;ve had Remingtons in the past and they were great.  In fact, my last Remington stood the test of time and lasted almost 10 years.  I purchased this shaver because I am a brand loyal customer, but after reading the reviews on a comparable Norelco I should have known better.  It does the job for the most part, but if the surface of your skin has some rough patches (like I do) you&#x27;ll liable to feel some pain.  Suffice to say, I am disappointed with the product and will think twice about a re-purchase of this brand.</li>
    <li> Better than my old one</li>
    <li> Got a great deal from Amazon on this unit.  Quality made, daily use, good charging system.</li>
