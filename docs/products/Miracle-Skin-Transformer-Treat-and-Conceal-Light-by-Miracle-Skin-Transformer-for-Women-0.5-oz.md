      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like the texture of a primer, but it covers and blurs imperfections.  </li>

      <li>The texture is nice, almost like a primer and very smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would repurchase.</li>
      <li>I like to put aquaphor on before I put this one, it looks better that way,</li>
      <li>This is my favorite concealer</li>
      <li>I was able to return the concealer to amazon and ordered from miracleskintransformer.com</li>
      <li>Sephora no longer carries this product, so I ordered it on here for a better price, but don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not the authentic product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m going to keep making an exception for this one item because I love it</li>

      <li>Love this product.  </li>

      <li>The light is very light</li>
      <li>I have light skin and this light concealer works like magic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>if you use a moisturizer it will settle into your fine lines.</li>
      <li>I use it over Oil of Olay moisturizer and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>so it is a bit too light</li>
      <li>well though I feel it is a bit light for my skin.  </li>
      <li>but with this product I&#x27;m light.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge or crease into your skin, and tends to stay intact all day.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and does not cake, it does not accentuate wrinkles and the eye area feels light and airy.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this concealer from Sephora.com in the past and it worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I originally gave this a 2 star rating.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how it go so many positive reviews.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have pale skin and the light is a bit to fair-</li>
      <li>it was brand new in the box fresh and fabulous.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a really super fast timely manner too.</li>
      <li>I am plagued with very dark circles under my eyes and fair skin.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, goes on so easily, and covers blemishes and dark spots really really well.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried SO many different concealers</li>
      <li>It is so soft and smooth going on.  </li>
      <li>So when I did try it for the first time, it did not blend in and was cakey.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite concealer -- by FAR.</li>
      <li>I am 51, fair, with oily - sensitive skin and hereditary dark circles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used a concealer that really hid my purple under eye circles, but this really does it.  </li>
      <li>Really concentrated</li>
      <li>I prefer that method so I can adjust color depending on how much sun I have or have not gotten.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and it really could be used in place of foundation.</li>
      <li>It does not cover well and the color \\&quot;light\\&quot; is very orange toned.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more liquid, even with an oily discharge when I first opened it, and does not spread over my skin or cover dark spots as well as the ones I purchased at Sephora.  </li>
      <li>Product is not only more then I wanted to spend but completely ineffective and a rip off.</li>
      <li>When I use it BY ITSELF with out any other creams under the eye, I am getting MUCH BETTER results.  </li>
      <li>the best conceal or I have ever tried…just a little dab goes a long way and feels like your wearing nothing  which I had known about it a long time ago</li>
      <li>Miracle Skin Transformer is a great concealer, as long as it&#x27;s the real thing and what they&#x27;re selling on amazon is definitely not authentic.</li>
      <li>I have very dry under eyes and fine lines and can never find a concealer that looks &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>Highly recommendation.</li>
      <li>I have used it as a spot cover on other parts of my face and it works well (but light).  </li>
      <li>Honestly, this has been the only concealer that covers my very dark (bluish tin coloring) under the eye area.</li>
      <li>I like the coverage for my dark circles, but I do have aging skin under my eyes and it does settle a bit into the fine lines.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it on blemishes or dark spots as it is a bit too light for that use.</li>
      <li>The coverage is very good for someone like me who has bad under eye circles.</li>
      <li>The label looks almost identical but the label is slightly off in the location of \\&quot;eyes and face\\&quot; compared to the original tube.</li>
      <li>she told me about this and said it is a complete eye transformer.</li>
      <li>but then I just get coverage, not any of the benefits of putting it directly on the skin.</li>
      <li>I also love the thick texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m experimenting with different creams underneath with some minor success in improving the appearance.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times in the store at Sephora, but the tube I received from this online seller really does seem to have a different formulation.  </li>
      <li>I will use no other.</li>
      <li>It does lighten but it just seems to highlight every small wrinkle and make the wrinkles and fine lines look BIG.  </li>
      <li>The formulation was thick and did not go on smoothly AT ALL.</li>
      <li>It covers great, but it is a little difficult to blend.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff hard to find in the stores these days was half to find it.</li>
      <li>Definitely not full coverage, your acne will peek through no matter how much you put on.</li>
      <li>Hard to find in many shops without purchasing the whole line of unnecessary additions.</li>

<li> and i was looking for a concealer for my DARK undereyes.</li>
<li> but the medium is too dark.  </li>
<li> It takes very little to cover your entire face, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s small for the price.</li>
<li> Colors run a little dark.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t hesitate and buy this product at once, if you have very dark under eye circles.</li>
<li> I have used this product a few times and it seems to work</li>
<li> I recommend going to Sephora and getting a few samples to see what color you would need.  </li>
<li> Since there are only a few colors to choose from, color matching can be difficult.  </li>
<li> The formulation from amazon is similar in that it has a silicone, cream texture, but I find it to be dryer and difficult to spread.</li>
<li> With a small amount, strategically placed, you don&#x27;t need added foundation.</li>

    <li> the best conceal or I have ever tried…just a little dab goes a long way and feels like your wearing nothing  which I had known about it a long time ago</li>
    <li> Covers discolored spots amazingly</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;m 55 and I&#x27;ve tried SO many different concealers and there&#x27;s no doubt, this one is GREAT!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> Product is not only more then I wanted to spend but completely ineffective and a rip off. I won&#x27;t be purchasing anything from this seller ever again and I&#x27;d advise others to stay away</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stuff is no joke.  I received a sample of it a while back and oh my god.  It is so soft and smooth going on.  Really concentrated so you only need the tiniest bit.  It covers completely without being thick or cakey.  I&#x27;ve never used a concealer that really hid my purple under eye circles, but this really does it.  My only regret is not finding it sooner.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like the coverage for my dark circles, but I do have aging skin under my eyes and it does settle a bit into the fine lines. I like to put aquaphor on before I put this one, it looks better that way, but then I just get coverage, not any of the benefits of putting it directly on the skin. I have pale skin and the light is a bit to fair- I will be buying a darker concealer and blending the two.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite concealer -- by FAR. It&#x27;s very smooth, goes on so easily, and covers blemishes and dark spots really really well. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. I usually stick to drugstore makeup to save money... but I&#x27;m going to keep making an exception for this one item because I love it and it totally makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I had never tried this product before. So when I did try it for the first time, it did not blend in and was cakey. I requested a return or an exchange and they would not honor it. If I had bought this at a store, the store would&#x27;ve accepted a return/exchange. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again. I would not even give it 1 star.</li>
    <li> This concealer was nothing like some of the reviews had stated.. I use the Miracle Skin Face Transformer and love it but the treat &amp; conceal for eyes is not as wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am 51, fair, with oily - sensitive skin and hereditary dark circles.  I have used this product a few times and it seems to work well though I feel it is a bit light for my skin.  I have used it as a spot cover on other parts of my face and it works well (but light).  It has not caused any irritation in my eyes. The texture is nice, almost like a primer and very smooth.  I do recommend shaking the tube before using as it seems to separate a bit.</li>
    <li> I am plagued with very dark circles under my eyes and fair skin.  I have tried all kinds of concealers: cream base, powder and liquid from expensive to inexpensive with no true positive results.  Honestly, this has been the only concealer that covers my very dark (bluish tin coloring) under the eye area. I will use no other. It goes on smoothly and does not cake, it does not accentuate wrinkles and the eye area feels light and airy. It truly is amazing and will transform your eyes to appear well rested. Colors run a little dark.  I&#x27;m usually light/medium but with this product I&#x27;m light.  Don&#x27;t hesitate and buy this product at once, if you have very dark under eye circles.</li>
    <li> Very nice, covers but light.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best coverage ever even though it is not designed to be a foundation.  With a small amount, strategically placed, you don&#x27;t need added foundation. I use it over Oil of Olay moisturizer and it works fine.  It is a matte finish.  The light is very light but the medium is too dark.  If you cannot decide, go for the lighter one since it is designed to conceal under eye discoloration.  Good buy.  Hard to find in many shops without purchasing the whole line of unnecessary additions.</li>
    <li> If you have imperfections, or red spots. Anything to cover, this is it!&lt;br /&gt; I have used this product for years and it really could be used in place of foundation. It takes very little to cover your entire face, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s small for the price. This lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The formulation was thick and did not go on smoothly AT ALL. Don&#x27;t know how it go so many positive reviews. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great concealer. It is light-weight and blends well. I use this with the Miracle Skin Transformer for the face for a flawless foundation.  Highly recommendation.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer i&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many).  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge or crease into your skin, and tends to stay intact all day.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Maybe not a miracle, but the under eye coverage does stay on most of the day!</li>
    <li> I am searching for a product to deal with dark circles under my 52 year old eyes.  This was very expensive and it is just not working well,  I have to use a very small amount, but it makes my under eyes look WORSE not better.  It does lighten but it just seems to highlight every small wrinkle and make the wrinkles and fine lines look BIG.  I&#x27;m experimenting with different creams underneath with some minor success in improving the appearance.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  I paid a lot for this product and was hoping it would function well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04-06-13:  I&#x27;m revising my review.  I originally gave this a 2 star rating.  I&#x27;ve increased it to 5 stars.  I think the problem I was having with this product is that I was using it over an under eye cream.  When I use it BY ITSELF with out any other creams under the eye, I am getting MUCH BETTER results.  It is hiding the dark circles, stays in place and does NOT settle in the fine lines beneath my eyes and it only takes a very small amount to do the job.</li>
    <li> I have light skin and this light concealer works like magic. It covers all of my acne scars and feels great on my skin. I also love the thick texture.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t try up and cake up</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many, many concealers over the years and this is one of my favorites.  It covers great, but it is a little difficult to blend.  Since there are only a few colors to choose from, color matching can be difficult.  I recommend going to Sephora and getting a few samples to see what color you would need.  If you fall between, get two and blend the colors.  I prefer that method so I can adjust color depending on how much sun I have or have not gotten.</li>
    <li> my friend is a makeup know-it-all and i was looking for a concealer for my DARK undereyes. she told me about this and said it is a complete eye transformer. it brightens and smoothens and she wasn&#x27;t lying!! this is an excellent product and well worth the price. you HARDLY use any at all and it spreads!!! do not use any undereye cream before applying. it moisturizes and works much better without it. if you use a moisturizer it will settle into your fine lines. just let it do its job by itself!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite concealer and I was so happy to get it at the price offered here instead of at the retail store. It arrived in a really super fast timely manner too. Very happy and will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> I love this product for under eyes but also to mix with my moisture in the morning when I put my make up.</li>
    <li> I love this. I bought a shade lighter than I used last time so it is a bit too light but that&#x27;s my fault. The medium is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this concealer from Sephora.com in the past and it worked wonderfully. The texture is like a creamy, silicone consistency. The coverage is very good for someone like me who has bad under eye circles. Sephora no longer carries this product, so I ordered it on here for a better price, but don&#x27;t be fooled, this is not the authentic product. The label looks almost identical but the label is slightly off in the location of \\&quot;eyes and face\\&quot; compared to the original tube. The formulation from amazon is similar in that it has a silicone, cream texture, but I find it to be dryer and difficult to spread. It does not cover well and the color \\&quot;light\\&quot; is very orange toned. Miracle Skin Transformer is a great concealer, as long as it&#x27;s the real thing and what they&#x27;re selling on amazon is definitely not authentic. I was able to return the concealer to amazon and ordered from miracleskintransformer.com</li>
    <li> I use this to treat rather than conceal. Definitely not full coverage, your acne will peek through no matter how much you put on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times in the store at Sephora, but the tube I received from this online seller really does seem to have a different formulation.  It&#x27;s much more liquid, even with an oily discharge when I first opened it, and does not spread over my skin or cover dark spots as well as the ones I purchased at Sephora.  It doesn&#x27;t seem very different from the cheaper ones I&#x27;ve purchased at the drug store and I too question whether it&#x27;s the same formulation as what I bought at Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up: I emailed the manufacturer which stated that Beauty Innovation is not an authorized retailer and so they cannot verify the legitimacy of the product.  I won&#x27;t buy this again from this seller.</li>
    <li> This concealer exceeded my expectations.  I have very dry under eyes and fine lines and can never find a concealer that looks &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and stays on all day. This fits the bill.  It&#x27;s kind of like the texture of a primer, but it covers and blurs imperfections.  It stays on all day, but I do use a primer underneath. I have been using it almost every day.  I also use it around my nose.  I don&#x27;t use it on blemishes or dark spots as it is a bit too light for that use. I love it and would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff hard to find in the stores these days was half to find it. Arrived fast it was brand new in the box fresh and fabulous.</li>
