### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And it works great!  </li>
      <li>This epilator is great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an excellent choice for an Epilator!</li>
      <li>This has been one of the greatest benefits of using the epilator.</li>
      <li>It does a REMARKABLE job!</li>
      <li>My wife is happy with that.</li>
      <li>Great job without razor or depilatory.</li>
      <li>This unit is plucking hair as it passes over your skin, so of course it&#x27;s not going to feel great.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a great epilator.</li>
      <li>and im really happy with it  </li>
      <li>About 10 years ago i bought an emjoi epilator for $100 and it worked great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that I like it, I&#x27;m happy with it and will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>It work great.  </li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t press the device against your skin (it works best when held very lightly) because it will stop, and it wouldn&#x27;t pick up the hairs then anyway.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you read all the directions so that you use it correctly for best performance.  </li>
      <li>I have learned how to angle the epilator to get the best results for pulling out most hairs, so I should mention that good epilation takes practice.</li>
      <li>loved that it was rechargeable.</li>
      <li>and it did a really good job on my legs.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a good product for the price.</li>
      <li>:) Good day to all!</li>
      <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
      <li>I use it mainly for my underarms and it has worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It also works wonderfully well on the bikini line and it lasts for a decent amount of time.    </li>
      <li>and it is very easy to get used to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the better part of 5 years and love it!</li>
      <li>I feel so smooth right now that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
      <li>I used it on my cheeks (facial, lol), too and again it worked great.  </li>
      <li>My underarms have been very smooth going on four days with no stubble at all.  </li>
      <li>I love not having to shave shave.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with this one.  </li>
      <li>Never having used an epilator before, I wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>, so you have more flexibility.  </li>
      <li>I wish I could have gotten a better one</li>
      <li>definitely not the best</li>
      <li>its okay.</li>
      <li>It does work, but, because it misses more than it plucks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay -</li>
      <li>It came in a cute pouch too</li>
      <li>you can use it anywhere if you don&#x27;t mind the noisy buzzing sound!</li>
      <li>It came with a cute bag to store it in.</li>
      <li>Stay on top of your epilatation.</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t get shipping to Hawaii for the more pricey ones.</li>
      <li>Considering the price along with all of the above features I am really very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>and when you talk to fed ex people they&#x27;ll be glad to refund the money</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off shaving or waxing your legs or saving-up to have them laser&#x27;d.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have even tried this on my legs to see if it would make them hairless and lets just say that I could have done a better job shaving.</li>
      <li>This is probably not the best product in the world but it does much better than I expected</li>
      <li>I also use it on my armpits but it misses so many fine hairs that I still have what looks like a 5:00 shadow.</li>
      <li>Be sure to read the manual because there is important info on how to use it.  </li>
      <li>I makes hair removal quick and convenient, especially great for your upper lip!</li>
      <li>all the ingrowns are loosened and come out easily.</li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed using this product, it especially makes my underarms look great after use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s faster to blow on the hair or use a paper towel to get most of the hair out and then use your fingers to clean the hair out of the tweezer</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re new to epilators, this is a good start.  </li>
      <li>For example, when the unit is charged for 16 hours like the manual says to, it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>you get used to how it feels, it is fine.  </li>
      <li>Works fine for the price level of the model, yeah</li>
      <li>It did continue to work just fine on thicker hair.    </li>
      <li>I dies so quickly!</li>
      <li>my underarms look amazing and this epilator isnt costly at all   very good for the price &#x3D;]    by the way, emjoi customer service sucks!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great buy for the price, but because my hair has become too fine, I need to look for a different brand.     </li>
      <li>Thought i tried this since its cheap.</li>
      <li>and my face has been smooth for over a week.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, the brush that comes with</li>
      <li>Of course, if I paid more money for a product with more rotating disks, it would probably be so much easier to accomplish everything.</li>
      <li>Its a small practical device, not painful, good but no so effective, comapting price-quality is ok.</li>
      <li>Years ago, I originally owned an EpiLady</li>
      <li>I have used it on my chin and upper lip with great success.</li>
      <li>I used it for a good 2 years before the battery starting dying.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably the only good thing I can say about it.</li>
      <li>This was the second epilator that I tried and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect it to pluck out all your hair in one shot.</li>
      <li>Okay this works really well.  </li>
      <li>I make sure to turn this in different directions to be sure I got out the hairs.    </li>
      <li>I especially liked the cordless option, I agree that it doesnt last as long as Id</li>
      <li>But overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product!</li>
      <li>It plucks out my hair with a little bit of pain, but I can take that pain knowing the great results that will come out of it.</li>
      <li>but it is far better than tweezing.</li>
      <li>As far as pain goes, it will get better with time.</li>
      <li>I tried this epilator right away</li>
      <li>and I can very easily get away with buying the cheapest disposable razors now because I do not require such a meticulous can get out all but the shortest of hairs.</li>
      <li>This epilator was highly recommended for use on the face because of the way the head was contoured and that was an important feature for me.</li>
      <li>Be sure to exfoliate in the shower and make sure you are dried off before using this.</li>
      <li>Before I purchased this model I researched many of the epilators available by going to a variety of sites to read the recommendations the pros and cons and the varying opinions of other women.</li>
      <li>I did waxing (since it&#x27;s quicker) for some time at first until the hair become thinner.</li>
      <li>It is great for plucking out thick hairs.</li>
      <li>Used it many times and doesn&#x27;t deliver on what it claims to do,disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller Epilator that came with</li>
      <li>My first comment is that it does the job</li>
      <li>This is the first epilator I ever had.</li>
      <li>It works out pretty well</li>
      <li>This is the first epilator I have purchased.</li>
      <li>Better yet, avoid Emjoi and avoid the total headache.</li>
      <li>My favorite part about this is the ease with which it removes coarse underarm hairs.</li>
      <li>this is my first epilator</li>
      <li>However, after a few days everything looks good.</li>
      <li>It ends up so smooth and there is no dark stubble remaining afterward to make me self-conscious of wearing no sleeves.</li>
      <li>What  I have learned to do is epilate for a good 15 minutes or so one day and get what is left for the next day or two.</li>
      <li>Advice I would give is make sure the hair is grown half way as opposed to full grown.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t mind the cord as it is long enough to do my legs, the only area that takes up more time and where having strong sustained power makes the job go so much more easily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this product. It is not as painful as I expected and it is very easy to get used to. Wax hurts much worse and that is so much harder to do on my own and messier, too. I got everything I expected from this tool. It can even pull out very short, fine hairs that regrow on my legs just a few days after shaving. It&#x27;s not perfect, but for such an inexpensive product, it is very close. I have learned how to angle the epilator to get the best results for pulling out most hairs, so I should mention that good epilation takes practice. I make sure to turn this in different directions to be sure I got out the hairs.    It is very time-consuming, so I tend to do a little bit at a time. I still shave, but not nearly as often as I used to and I can very easily get away with buying the cheapest disposable razors now because I do not require such a meticulous can get out all but the shortest of hairs. Be sure to exfoliate in the shower and make sure you are dried off before using this. Wet skin makes the hairs lie too flat on you to remove. Exfoliation removes dead skin that gets in the way and the hair will be looser and more exposed for easier removal.    My favorite part about this is the ease with which it removes coarse underarm hairs. It works very well just one day after shaving. I love not having to shave shave. What  I have learned to do is epilate for a good 15 minutes or so one day and get what is left for the next day or two. It works out pretty well because I there because I have to do it so often. The epilator saves me so much time because I only have to touch up the area about once a week for the few hairs that have snuck back in. It ends up so smooth and there is no dark stubble remaining afterward to make me self-conscious of wearing no sleeves. It is definitely easier for me to remove the short, coarse hairs than it is to get the very fine hairs. It also works wonderfully well on the bikini line and it lasts for a decent amount of time.    I decided to review the Gently Silken because I just finished epilating today. I feel so smooth right now that it&#x27;s awesome. Of course, if I paid more money for a product with more rotating disks, it would probably be so much easier to accomplish everything. This is probably not the best product in the world but it does much better than I expected once I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Never having used an epilator before, I wasn&#x27;t sure quite what to expect. Using this in certain areas is quite painful at first. It also takes a number of passes to get every hair. However, after a few days everything looks good. I think this is a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> Okay this works really well.  but it does hurt! Doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the epilady that was out years back.</li>
    <li> I tried this epilator right away and it did a really good job on my legs.  I used it on my cheeks (facial, lol), too and again it worked great.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends and anybody else reading this.</li>
    <li> This was the second epilator that I tried and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect it to pluck out all your hair in one shot. you have to go over the same spot two or three times but as long as its well charged, it only takes two seconds so it&#x27;s not a big hassle. Also you have to have it turned the right way for it to work properly.  I always forget which side is correct, so if it isn&#x27;t pulling my hair out, i just flip it around and it usually works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean it, you take the top off and use the little brush to get the hairs out. there&#x27;s always a couple hairs that feel impossible to get out but 1 or 2 hairs doesn&#x27;t bother me anyway. It&#x27;s faster to blow on the hair or use a paper towel to get most of the hair out and then use your fingers to clean the hair out of the tweezer part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that it was rechargeable. With one full charge, I could get several uses out of it before having to recharge. It came in a cute pouch too so it was convenient to travel with.  you can use it anywhere if you don&#x27;t mind the noisy buzzing sound! I used it for a good 2 years before the battery starting dying. I had to plug it into the wall whenever I used it after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it had a hard time plucking very short hair. The hair had to grow to a certain length for it to work properly. If it was urgent I would have to tweeze or shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great epilator. I makes hair removal quick and convenient, especially great for your upper lip!</li>
    <li> i have to say this is a good product but to get it from this company its a very bad idea.   the delivery is very late and you won&#x27;t get your product on time. also they send it with fed ex and when you talk to fed ex people they&#x27;ll be glad to refund the money but becuase you did not send this item they won&#x27;t refund it to you and they company that send this item won&#x27;t refund the money.   so don&#x27;t buy it from this company.</li>
    <li> I had this epilator for several years. After about 2 years or so, the battery begins to die on you and the charge won&#x27;t last nearly long enough, but that&#x27;s simply because the battery only has so many cycles, just like with computers.     This one works well, but with time, maybe because my hair became too thin or maybe because the epilator got old, it wouldn&#x27;t pick up the thin hairs as well. It did continue to work just fine on thicker hair.    I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator, but I found that it didn&#x27;t work as well and I couldn&#x27;t get it close enough to my skin.     Overall, I&#x27;d buy this again if I was just starting out. I think it&#x27;s a great buy for the price, but because my hair has become too fine, I need to look for a different brand.     As far as pain goes, it will get better with time. I did waxing (since it&#x27;s quicker) for some time at first until the hair become thinner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for four years and it still works! Its all about getting used the the initial pain (just like when you first plucked your eyebrows) after that its okay. I go through periods of using it then taking a break. Once you stop, your pain threshold decreases and you almost back to square one. Doing large parts of your body like your legs does take a little longer. I like epilators because I easily interchange shaving and epilating since the hair does not need to be long in order for it to work. I have been very pleasantly surprised and how reliable this prodict has been over the last four years. My only grip is that I can no longer use it while its charging, I must wait until its fully charged in order to use it, but its a little old so its okay.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this product, it especially makes my underarms look great after use. It was painful to get used to but now I am very confortable using it every day. I especially liked the cordless option, I agree that it doesnt last as long as Id like when not attached but whatever, its not that big of a deal. The only real problem is that I do get ingrown hairs, I had ingrown hairs with shaving too though so this product does not solve that problem.</li>
    <li> Its a small practical device, not painful, good but no so effective, comapting price-quality is ok.</li>
    <li> It works but it is painful and time consuming</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am obsessive when it comes to body hair.  I carry tweezers in my pocket and can&#x27;t stop plucking.  I figured if I could get something that would do a lot of plucking at once, then I wouldn&#x27;t be picking at myself all the time.  And it works great!  You just have to use it properly.    Read the instructions carefully.  You can&#x27;t press the device against your skin (it works best when held very lightly) because it will stop, and it wouldn&#x27;t pick up the hairs then anyway.  I used it yesterday and the parts of my legs that I got are still hair-free today.  If I&#x27;d have shaved, they would be stubbly already.  It&#x27;s going to take me a while to get everything, but if you have the patience and you have a picking problem, then I would definitely recommend this.    It&#x27;s painful, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  :)</li>
    <li> this is my first epilator and im really happy with it  it IS painful but so worth it. my underarms look amazing and this epilator isnt costly at all   very good for the price &#x3D;]    by the way, emjoi customer service sucks!</li>
    <li> Maybe I have a high pain tolerance, b/c I didn&#x27;t find this product painful.  It works very well-if a hair was missed, I just have to go back over it.  Much more effective, time saving, and less messy than waxing.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice but my hair is already growing much sparser.  I like the fact that it is rechargable, so you have more flexibility.  I would definitely recommend it, but it seems it really is painful for some people.  However, I think you might get used to it over time.  I guess if you can tolerate waxing, then this might be the same in terms of pain factor.  Maybe pulling your skin very taut might help.</li>
    <li> This epilator is great! It plucks out my hair with a little bit of pain, but I can take that pain knowing the great results that will come out of it. My hair does not grow back in for at least another week. For this price, I highly recommend it. I&#x27;m buying a second one for my sister.</li>
    <li> it dose work on me it does  not pull my hair the way i would like it two thank you</li>
    <li> This is another example of a horrible waste of time and money. Our Emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair. And that brings around another problem -- Emjoi customer service and repair service. You&#x27;ll want to avoid both. Better yet, avoid Emjoi and avoid the total headache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only are Emjoi products cheap, they are painful to use.</li>
    <li> Never having used an epilator before, I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a more expensive model, yet also not one too small to do the job and give me a bad impression.  I was pleased with this one.  It&#x27;s big enough to use on legs and yet small enough for the bikini area.  If I wanted to do my legs quicker, I might buy a slightly larger model to use for my legs only, but I&#x27;m satisfied with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!! Be sure to read the manual because there is important info on how to use it.  For example, when the unit is charged for 16 hours like the manual says to, it works just fine.  Don&#x27;t press down on skin (it will stop itself if you do for safety).  Cut bikini hair if it is too long so you don&#x27;t damage the product. Pull skin taught before epilating. Use a loofah to help prevent/remove ingrown hairs, and don&#x27;t use this product if you&#x27;re particularly prone to get ingrown hairs.  Use a sothing product after epilating to get rid of the redness.  I recommend Fruit Of The Earth Vitamin E Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used to how it feels, it is fine.  This unit is plucking hair as it passes over your skin, so of course it&#x27;s not going to feel great.  The first time is probably the worst, since you have to epilate the whole area.  Clearing off re-growth won&#x27;t be as much hair at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this enough that I plan to get a slim one for the eyebrows now, too.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I have purchased. I went with this one because it is reasonably priced and I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in a product I might not like. In the future, I will likely purchase one with more tweezers to speed things up, this one takes a long time to do my legs. And the battery doesn&#x27;t last very long, so it really has to be used with the cord. But overall I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> Here are a few positives and negatives that I hope will help: &lt;br /&gt;(+) It DOES work, however in some places-like your bikini line-where the hair tends to lay flat you need to pull the skin tight. &lt;br /&gt;(-) It hurts, BAD.  It&#x27;s a slow painful process. &lt;br /&gt;(+) The hair doesn&#x27;t have to be nearly as long as if you were waxing. &lt;br /&gt;(-) The hair goes EVERYWHERE.  There&#x27;s no little storage area for the hair, this thing just rips it out and flies it all over the room.  You have to do it in the tub. &lt;br /&gt;(+) It&#x27;s easy to clean, the brush that comes with it works well, but I wish they gave an extra one because I just know the bristles will start sticking out any-which-way after a while. &lt;br /&gt;(-) The battery is NOT very good, you have to keep it plugged in if you plan on using it for more than fifteen minutes. &lt;br /&gt;(+) It came with a cute bag to store it in. &lt;br /&gt;(+) I haven&#x27;t shaved in two weeks! And I probably wont have to for another two. &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I like it, I&#x27;m happy with it and will continue to use it.  I wish I could have gotten a better one but I couldn&#x27;t get shipping to Hawaii for the more pricey ones.</li>
    <li> my sister bought this, i guess it worked.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, but having never used an epilator, I wanted to see what it&#x27;s about. At first it does hurt a little, but you get over it pretty fast, depending on your tolerance.  Make sure you read all the directions so that you use it correctly for best performance.  It takes forever and no matter how long you&#x27;re at it, it seems you can never get it all.  By the time I got all the hair (over a several day period) it was growing back.  To  me, it seems a lot simpler and less time consuming to just shave your legs.  Maybe a more expensive epilator would work better, maybe not, but I don&#x27;t forsee myself using this for long...</li>
    <li> I found the unit to be less than desired.  It does work, but, because it misses more than it plucks, you need to spend a lot of time every day.</li>
    <li> About 10 years ago i bought an emjoi epilator for $100 and it worked great. I bought this one to replace it after the last one stopped working as well and this one is terrible. I guess you get what you pay for...  This epilator is extremely weak, tugs at your skin and the top of it (the part with the tweezers) falls off easily. I would not recommend to buy this. If you are going to buy an epilator, spend a little bit more for one that has the gold plated tweezers, they are much stronger and don&#x27;t break the hairs.</li>
    <li> I have only had my epilator two weeks but so far I have no complaints. I have used it on my chin and upper lip with great success. The only really painful area was the middle of my upper lip under my nose. My skin was a bit red after finishing but the redness subsided promptly and my face has been smooth for over a week.   I also did my legs and then did have a bit of a problem near my bikini line. In retrospect and after reading another women&#x27;s review I know that I didn&#x27;t exfoliate with my loofah enough. I also think I should have trimmed the hair.    As I got more confident and less fearful of the pain (which for me was minimal) I used it on my underarms. This has been one of the greatest benefits of using the epilator. My underarms have been very smooth going on four days with no stubble at all.  Before I purchased this model I researched many of the epilators available by going to a variety of sites to read the recommendations the pros and cons and the varying opinions of other women. This epilator was highly recommended for use on the face because of the way the head was contoured and that was an important feature for me. I personally don&#x27;t mind the cord as it is long enough to do my legs, the only area that takes up more time and where having strong sustained power makes the job go so much more easily. I knew I didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with buying batteries.    Considering the price along with all of the above features I am really very happy with this product. I wish I had gotten it sooner!!!</li>
    <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t work. as soon as it touch the skin it stops(and that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s plugged). totally disapointed in this brand and i am skeptical about the newest models they released. i am gonna use my old panasonic, it&#x27;s not perfect but 100x better than this stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim back in 2010 because of the price and I was skeptical. I use it mainly for my underarms and it has worked wonderfully. Unfortunately it is now on it&#x27;s last leg but for less than 50 bucks and 4 years of service I am definitely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I ever had. To be fair I have dark hair that needs shaving every single day. Of course it hurt a lot - that I could get used to. The problem was that it didn&#x27;t pick up more than half the hair, so needed multiple passes and I needed to shave to get rid of the rest of the hair once I couldn&#x27;t stand using this device anymore. Total failure for me.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that I NEVER RECIEVED this article I bought from the seller. I tried to contact the supplier but never had an answer</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one of these, the first lasting 10+ years until the gears starting hanging-up trying to turn.  I use it on my face (chin, upper lip, sideburn area), underarms &amp; arms.  I use the Emjoi Soft Caress Corded instead for my entire &amp;#34;Brazillian&amp;#34; zone.  I don&#x27;t use any epilators on my legs; it&#x27;s too tedious and painful to do with epilators.  You&#x27;re better off shaving or waxing your legs or saving-up to have them laser&#x27;d.  I buy this one because it can also run with it&#x27;s cord and my advice is not to bother with any of them that are rechargeable only because none have enough power without being plugged-in.  This model pulls the hair, doesn&#x27;t just pull/shave it as some others do, although it is somewhat less effective on my arms and I&#x27;ll have to go over the area twice.  It has two speeds although I&#x27;ve never used it anything but High. It takes light pressure and you can go nice and slow with just a few tweezers at a time when doing more sensitive area like directly under the nose.  If you&#x27;re used to waxing or using epilators, you&#x27;ll find the pain to be quite minimal once you get used to it.  If you&#x27;re new to epilators, this is a good start.  This model has worked for me and I hope to get another 10 years out of this one too.</li>
    <li> Returned, would not hold a charge</li>
    <li> Used it many times and doesn&#x27;t deliver on what it claims to do,disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller Epilator that came with it didn&#x27;t work at all,no power,no nothing,&lt;br /&gt;like it was made missing some part or something,very disappointing due to&lt;br /&gt; the fact that the smaller face device was something I&#x27;d use more often than&lt;br /&gt;the bigger model.Too bad,especially for what I paid for it!</li>
    <li> Emjoi AP-9PB Gently Silken Rechargeable Epilator.  I bought it for my wife.  She has been using it.  It work great.  My wife is happy with that.</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars because I know it is not best on the market, however it is decent. It is great for plucking out thick hairs. Specifically the pubes &amp; arm pit hairs. As far as fine hair and leg hairs, it doesn&#x27;t do a proper job. you have to keep epilating the area over and over again. It is convenient and I don&#x27;t have to epilate as much as I did shaving. I do recommend this product to anyone starting out in the epilating world. Advice I would give is make sure the hair is grown half way as opposed to full grown. If it isn&#x27;t full grown it will hurt less. Another word of advice I want to give is if you epilate your pubes for the first time &amp; some hairs are starting to grow back, tackle them as soon as possible. Don&#x27;t wait until all the hairs grow in because its going to hurt just as bad as when you first epilated. The less hairs, the less it&#x27;ll hurt. Stay on top of your epilatation. :) Good day to all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it&#x27;s still working. That&#x27;s probably the only good thing I can say about it. It pulls one hair in 20 and that&#x27;s after going over it for 5 times. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, I&#x27;m used to them, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to. I have one bought in Europe which does miracles, but it doesn&#x27;t work on 110V. So, I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for something else to use home, this one was waste of money.</li>
    <li> I dies so quickly! I only used it maybe 3 times and it doesn&#x27;t charge it anymore I have to use it with power!</li>
    <li> Works fine for the price level of the model, yeah it&#x27;ll hurt when first starting out, I had red bumps from the first time but its reduced upon further use...</li>
    <li> As with all epilators, they can be painful --- Especially if you use it on your Face.  I bought this Unit a number of years ago, and just reordered another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this one for the Face.  It does a REMARKABLE job! --- Painful, but very easy and effective!  You just have to be very careful when using it around the lips.  You need to hold the skin taut in that area, and you should be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent choice for an Epilator!</li>
    <li> I have one of these that is battery operated and got this rechargeable one for my dil.  We both love it for the little mustashe and tiny sideburns ladies get now and then.  I highly recommend this and if my ever dies, I will get this rechargeable emjoi.</li>
    <li> I chose this epilator because it was the cheapest one out there with a cord. i can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m too disappointed because this item does do what I bought it for (gets rid of unwanted peach fuzz) but it tends to take a long time. I also use it on my armpits but it misses so many fine hairs that I still have what looks like a 5:00 shadow. I have even tried this on my legs to see if it would make them hairless and lets just say that I could have done a better job shaving. In my opinion you should only get this product if you have noticeable facial hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay - definitely not the best but I guess you get what you pay for.  Years ago, I originally owned an EpiLady and I really liked it.  This Emjoi does not possess the same strength for removing hair.  I have to pass it over the hair 3-4 times before it will grab and remove the hair.  It works - it just takes longer.  I don&#x27;t find it painful at all but then I&#x27;ve been removing hair from my legs this way for 30 years.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using this unit for about two years on mainly my chin area. I have very little regrowth and do not need to use it as often. You do get a little tugging/pulling sensation when using it but it is far better than tweezing.I am purchasing one for my mom.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for a long time and bought this when mine broke down after 10years. Thought i tried this since its cheap. My first comment is that it does the job but it takes a long time. Maybe its due to the number of tweezers on the head / the tweezers are quite far apart. I would have to run through the section a couple of times to get the hair out. I also have to do it very slowly so that i dont miss the hair. I have also tried moving it from left to right to increase the chances of the hair being grabbed. Overall, its quite inefficient, but i only do this every 3 weeks, so i can live with it. Not something i would recommend for regular users.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the better part of 5 years and love it! (getting ready to replace with new ones for myself and my daughter) Yes, it&#x27;s irritating when a hair gets missed or the battery pack slows down, but overall I&#x27;m thrilled. If you read the directions (and set aside at least 30 minutes) it does exactly as described. I do have a problem with ingrown hairs (thanks to the manual shaving razors of long ago) but I&#x27;ve learned to shower first with a loofah, gently scrubbing before shaving - all the ingrowns are loosened and come out easily. Also, if using for the first time, grab a piece of ice and numb the area to be shaved - it&#x27;s not as painful - until you get used to it. Applying lotion for dry skin helps afterwards. Hey, I can live without shaving for a month!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well for the price</li>
    <li> I have used an Emjoi for years and was looking to get a backup for when my next one dies.  Price was the driving force behind this purchase and I don&#x27;t care for it as much as my other one.  But it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I have only used it TWICE with the cord and it already died... I couldn&#x27;t use it without the cord because it would instantly die I am trying to see if I can get this replaced it is not worth the money</li>
    <li> Great job without razor or depilatory.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to indicate pleasure for a product like this other than to say it is satisfactory and gets the job done. It works well on coarse hair and if you can stomach the discomfort, it will ultimately make your legs and bikini area much nicer than shaving could.</li>
