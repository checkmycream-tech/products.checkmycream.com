<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Very good, I would re-order.</li>
    <li> Love it though it&#x27;s not as good as the Cucumber one so I have to give 4 instead of 5!</li>
    <li> Not so moisturizing, but there are firming and whitening effect.</li>
    <li> I use it as a night cream with a thin layer , not the best mask but works really well as a nightcream</li>
    <li> The pink rose fragrance is so nice! For a lazy women like me it&#x27;s very easy to apply after shower and also easy to clean with warm water. Usually I apply this mask 3 times per week and I think it does help moisturize my face</li>
    <li> I wish I could say I loved this. It made my skin burn for some reason. I did breakout from it in some places and others were left really dry. I may be  better served with the cucumber mask.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. the product itself smells like the flower, very nice, and elegant. Ive only used it for masks, and it leaves a great scent on the face. My face does feel softer too after the mask.</li>
    <li> Very good mask is very useful!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this gel mask does nothing for me though it smells great. One way to use this was to leave it on as an overnight masks but it flakes off when it dries.</li>
    <li> It is a fake. The label on the bottle say cucumber mask.... But it should be rose stem cell.</li>
    <li> I got this product as part of a kit a few months back. I have a scar that&#x27;s pretty deep along the side of my face right where the line that goes from your nose fold to your mouth is. A dog scratched me there. I&#x27;ll still have to fill it but I was surprised by the fact that this product actually shortened the scar! I&#x27;ve been using it off and on for months and noticed today the scar was noticeably shorter. I have been using it with a pumpkin scrub and I do believe that helps the product get into my skin better. Are the results amazing...no...but as I never expected it to work at all I was pleasantly surprised.i think this product would work great in conjunction with Botox/fillers. I&#x27;m definitely going to be getting more products under this brand now.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty product hoarder and I gotta say, this is one of my favs. Rose water is so good for your skin. When I apply this, I love the cool feel especially under my eyes and the scent is fabulous and ultra feminine. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> For my friend，she likes it.</li>
    <li> Bought this after a friend raved about it. I am giving it a 3 because it seems to have given me bumps when I wore it overnight. I have not been faithful in my use of the product, because of the bumps and fact that I didn&#x27;t see any real results after a week of use. I will continue to use the jar. If there are any changes I will update my review.</li>
    <li> I love this!  After a store sample Resulted in Baby soft skin with better tone right away I bought the gel for regular use.  I like to apply and leave on as a night time treatment.</li>
    <li> It worth buying !Less exoensive than in stores.</li>
    <li> i love this mask its so soothing and refreshing on the skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!  I have rosacea and I put it on every night before I go to bed.  I wash it off in the morning.  It hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and youthful.  I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product cause I read the reviews. It does leave your face soft I must say :)</li>
    <li> Nice to apply as sleeping mask.</li>
    <li> My skin gets very dry and I have visible pores.  After reading all of the positive reviews on this product, I was very excited to try it out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and have noticed no difference in my skin.  The jar states it can be washed off, or applied as a mask overnight.  I&#x27;ve tried both methods several times and have seen no effect on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t even give my face that soft, ultra-moisturized feeling like a lot of the cheaper, drugstore products do.  The only positives to this product are that it&#x27;s pretty and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> The bottle is broken when I got it. The gel is everywhere in the box. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> good stuff. Fast deliver</li>
    <li> Very good,I like it very much!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference after using this product several times on my ultra dry skin. It is pretty though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soothing mask.</li>
    <li> Wonderful !!!  I put this product on at night before bed and my skin feels amazing in the morning.  I also put a small amount on before my make-up because it gives you a flawless, tiny pore appearence.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and the smell. This product line is really quite nice.</li>
    <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> A gift for my mom, she likes it.</li>
    <li> NO WORDS!!! THIS IS AWESOME and I love the way my skin feels after this facial</li>
    <li> Soothing, hydrating, repairs and brightens tired skin, and has a lovley scent. What more can I ask?</li>
    <li> I was super excited to try the PTR Rose Stem Cell Gel, but it wasn&#x27;t as great as I imagined. Feels great going on and smells amazing. But I didn&#x27;t see any significant change in my normal/dry skin. Jar is huge so it def lasts for a while! If looking for a good mask to hydrate your skin def try Glam Glow Hydrating Mask! I sleep with it on it&#x27;s amazing. That is def one I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love!  I wash my face, apply Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel and Rose Hip toner, then apply this Rose Stem Cell Bio Repair and top it off with Boots anti-aging night cream!  They all work wonders together!  I am 32 with minimal lines and those lines have gotten way less visible in the month that I have started using these products together.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful effects from using this gel.  Great service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product very much..Will buy it again..</li>
    <li> I buy a TON of masks and This is definitely my favorite mask/skin care product I have ever purchased!  Gives immediate results.  Skin is clearer, softer and left with a dewy glow! Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> Great , use as a mask or put a thin layer over your night cream and your face will glow in the morning. I keep mine in the fridge.</li>
    <li> Gentle and hydrating even for extremely sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough. I have super sensitive combination skin, and it is very difficult to find a product that doesn&#x27;t break me out like crazy, but after a few weeks of using the bio repair gel, I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, and my skin looks smooth and feels soft. It has also helped even out my combination skin by moisturizing the dry parts and controlling the oily parts. I knew rose water was good for skin, and I&#x27;ve used it as a toner in the past, but this stuff is so much better. Best impulse buy I&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would buy again.</li>
