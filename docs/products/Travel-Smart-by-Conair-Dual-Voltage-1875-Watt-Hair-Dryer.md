<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to Holland, Belgium, France, and England.  There was no converter needed, just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 V mode and used only on the low setting.  To clarify, you can ONLY use it on the LOW setting, however on the low setting it runs like it is on high - very easy, and worked perfectly.  It is also extremely compact for easy packing, but still worked like a bigger, nice hair dryer.  Hope this helps someone :)</li>
    <li> I had a Conair, dual voltage travel dryer that served me well for more than 30 years, at home and in my travels overseas.  What finally died was the wire where it attaches to the plug (it wore out and shorted).  I replaced it with this one and am happy so far.  Some of the other ratings weren&#x27;t that great, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with mine in the year or so I&#x27;ve owned it.  My only negative comment is that, unlike my original, the handle doesn&#x27;t fold up on this one.  That means it takes up slightly more space in my suitcase.  But that is not a big deal.  I use it daily.  If it&#x27;s as reliable as my former one, it will last me the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> We went out West traveling, I took this mini hair dryer. It worked great. It was small,but it worked better than my full size one at home. It didn&#x27;t take up much room, and it was light. Would recommend this to anyone traveling . Perfect!</li>
    <li> Brought this to Thailand. Although there were blow dryers in the rooms, i always prefer to have one that is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. This is awesome! Compact and worked great. Just make sure you read directions before using in a 220 v outlet!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to Europe.  It&#x27;s still going strong.  So, I purchased this for a young friend, just graduating from high school and headed to Spain for some future studies. Hopefully, she will have as good luck with her&#x27;s as I have had!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because it&#x27;s strong and light weight and small. I&#x27;m not disappointed. The cord is long enough. I don&#x27;t enjoy the high-pitched sound the dryer makes but it&#x27;s more than tolerable. Compare prices for this model, it might be cheaper in Target or other local stores.</li>
    <li> I use this hair dryer every day and I don&#x27;t feel as if it&#x27;s doing a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; drying job.  I previously had a Revlon mini which worked just great.  In any case, will continue to use this one until it dies.</li>
    <li> burned out in 3 weeks...</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago for a trip to the UK. When I switched it on for the first time in Scotland, I used the slow/lower heat setting, but decided It would take to long and went to the higher/warmer setting. As soon as I did that, the element became bright red and the dryer died. I tried resetting, but nothing happened. I ended up throwing it in the trash can. Furthermore, the description of two speed and two heat settings, is not really true. There is only one switch and you can either do slow/cooler or high speed/warmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for gym bag</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for international travel. Great size.</li>
    <li> I owned a previous model of the Travel Smart and expected a small, folding dryer that could easily fit into a carry on or overnight bag. Although this one is so powerful it only takes about two minutes to dry my hair (great!), it is heavy and large. So I&#x27;ll leave it at home and air dry my hair on the road.</li>
    <li> Cord is TOO stiff.  I would have expected the cord to be supple.  Alas, the cord behaves as if it&#x27;s frozen even at a temperature of 84 degrees F.</li>
    <li> Love the smaller dryer. Easier to manage and does the job!</li>
    <li> Love this! I needed something small when we travel..it is very handy and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Super powerful and versatile!</li>
    <li> Blows too much air and isn&#x27;t very warm. Going to return it.</li>
    <li> I did a LOT of research for a trip to England/Scotland I was using this for. I had no problems at all with this, it was light and compact, perfect to cram into an already full suitcase. PLEASE NOTE- this hairdryer is necessary to have dual voltage (they use other voltage there) BUT you still need an actual wall converter so it will fit into their plugs!! This only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the States won&#x27;t fry your head or die on you, a wall converter is very cheap (about $8 and can be bought almost anywhere). I used the wall converter for multiple appliances (phone charger, etc.) but you need to check voltage on other appliances as well.</li>
    <li> worked as expected. was not able to use on high for some reason but did the job.</li>
    <li> Not very travel friendly.  I was hoping that it would fold up.. it doesn&#x27;t.  It works great as a back up to my normal hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The Conair TS127 travel smart mini hair dryer is not as small as I thought.  Be sure to read the dimension.  The handle of the blow dryer folds down which is good if you need to conform to a space within your luggage.  The high speed option on the dryer is powerful and it does dry hair quickly.  I do wish there was a low, medium, and high option.  Overall I am satified with the purchase since I only travel 2-3 times a year.</li>
    <li> Worked really all through out Thailand and Cambodia!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my hairdryers!!!  I already had purchased this same dryer for my son in the past and really liked it so much that I wanted it for myself.  Great design, small, not heavy and bulky to hold.  It has the right air pressure and 2 perfect temperature settings.  The seller packaged it superbly and in a timely fashion.  Extremely content!!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for compact travel and ease of use.  It is of fine quality and provides long lasting servcice.</li>
    <li> I found this hair dryer perfect for travel.  It packs easily, is light weight to handle, and dries efficiently.</li>
    <li> Worked great with adapter.  Just follow instructions on proper settings.</li>
    <li> used in Italy and was great</li>
    <li> Much bigger than expected. I was looking to replace a tiny yet powerful hair dryer. This one is not as compact as it appears.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother-in-law before she went on a cruise.  She was very happy with the dryer, light but enough power to dry her hair quickly.  Worked in foreign hotels and on the cruise ship.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on a recent trip to Africa. Worked perfectly and was the solution to managing my hair in the third world. I left it there with a young lady who couldn&#x27;t afford to buy one for herself.  Two happy girls.</li>
    <li> Nice lite and compact design, perfect for traveling in Europe on rail or rental car when you have to pack lite</li>
    <li> I would have gone with 0 stars if I had that option. I gave this to my daughter for her semester in Spain. She said it overheated this first time she used it and has been afraid to use it again. So this product was basically a complete waste of money. The bad part is I got an email saying the first one I ordered wasn&#x27;t coming so I ordered a second. The first one came as well as the second. I didn&#x27;t need a blow dryer to use in the states so now I have one that can&#x27;t be used and I that I don&#x27;t want</li>
    <li> Had the same item before and it lasted me about 10 years, then died. Then again, I used it every day. Loved it so much that I bought a new one just like it. Love it just as much as the old one. Is great for travel overseas, blows a ton of air and turbo dries long hair. Highly recommend this dryer as an everyday dryer, not just for travel.</li>
    <li> I acctually purchased this dryer to dry my watercolor paintings but liked it so much, now using it for my hair. Small, good flow of air.  I have smaller travel dryers, but probably not as efficient.  Like the size.  Does not take up much room in a drawer.</li>
    <li> It *works* at both voltages, but at 220v, it will only work on low, not high!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does fold and travel very well, and not needing a converter is nice.</li>
    <li> It fulfills all of my needs for overseas travel.  It is light and powerful all in one.  Easy and convenient.</li>
    <li> It used this in several different countries in South America.  It worked great!</li>
    <li> Like it  it is pretty powerful. Took on vacation and use it in my RV too.</li>
    <li> Compact and works very well. We used it on our trip to Italy. However, when in Europe it seems only to work on low gear, we could not make it work on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting. Also, it would be nice to include as a an extra the plug converter.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works fine but I can&#x27;t see it as a travel item. It&#x27;s almost full size with a folding handle. OK, it has the power adjustment for foreign travel but the size is way too big if you are trying to save space or weight.&lt;br /&gt; I could not find a baby sized travel dryer, don&#x27;t they make them any more ?</li>
    <li> Got this for a trip to Italy.  It packed easily and took up minimal space.  You still need the plug adapters for it but it worked great while on the trip.</li>
    <li> It worked fine on my trip to Israel.  It is easy to pack for travel and has a lot of power.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great hair dryer as I have had other 1875 Watt Conair dryers that have been long lasting and powerful.  From other reviews I see that this one is powerful too.  I jumped at the power of this product in a travel hairdryer and the great reviews.  However, the dryer is quite large and heavy.  It&#x27;s probably only an inch smaller than my regular conair dryer (which also has a folding handle).  I was looking for a much smaller lighter product.  It makes sense that you simply have to give up power for a smaller size/weight.  I&#x27;m choosing to return it because it&#x27;s more than I want to travel with.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled with this blow dryer. It is so compact, that it makes packing it a breeze. It is a little heavier than you would think it would be though.</li>
    <li> It folds, it has duel voltage, and the fan cover comes off so you can clean hair from the fan and extend its life.  Of course, with any travel dryer there is a power trade off - but this one is still strong enough for me and I have thick hair.  I love it for travel adn for home.</li>
    <li> It is just what we expected; is compact; easy to slip into a suitcase, or for that matter a purse; works well!</li>
    <li> This is a strong little powerhouse of a hair blower. Took it on vacation, heats quickly, the blower motor is surprisingly strong&lt;br /&gt;(with 1875 watts, one shouldn&#x27;t be surprised) and it gets the job done. Folds nicely and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Worked out perfect for a trip overseas.  Just changed the voltage on the handle and your ready to go without an adapter. It also stored nicely. I now use this hairdryer every day and haven&#x27;t had a problem with it.</li>
    <li> I happened to need 2 hair dryers, so I ordered one each of the &amp;#34;Travel Smart by Conair 1875-Watt Folding Hair Dryer&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Conair 1875 Watt Dual Voltage Folding Handle Hair Dryer&amp;#34;.  I can report that they are identical except for the logo printed on the side and the price.  Same size, same color, same settings, same airflow, same control knobs, same cord length, but one costs twice as much.  I was hoping to get the prettier silver color pictured in the photo for my extra money, but they are the same dull grey.  Nice, lightweight hairdryer, and they both seem to work fine.</li>
    <li> I got it for daily use, not just travel.  (It would be pretty big for travel, but not many are as small as they used to be.)  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s dual voltage</li>
    <li> Nice quick way to warm up my feet</li>
    <li> Works Great.  Folds up small. Packs in a suitcase easily.</li>
    <li> Used this dryer during a recent trip to Europe.  So easy to use in different countries and compact to carry. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better, more efficient dryer.  I even used it to warm cold food in my hotel room, but don&#x27;t tell anybody.</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer who noted how big and heavy this dryer was.  I didn&#x27;t even take it out of the package; ended up returning it on my own dime.</li>
    <li> What can you say--it is a good product and does exactly what I wanted.  There are no bells and whistles, but I&#x27;m traveling.  I wanted something collapsable and easy to carry.  Although it&#x27;s a tiny bit larger than I had hoped for, it is still better than my at home dryer.</li>
    <li> My mom travels a lot and this small size and ability to change electrical current for overseas a plus....no additional adaptor needed. 1875 watts is quite powerful. All you need for on the go or at home is storage is an issue.</li>
    <li> Very compact and does the job. Very light weight and easy to handle. Would recommend this product for anyone who wants a convenient light weight hair drery which is very good for travel use.</li>
    <li> This does the job for my gym bag. It has the basic, low, high and cool shot settings and best of all, it folds and is compact for travel.</li>
    <li> Packed easily in my one carry-on bag for flight to MA.  Was strong enough to blow dry my hair straight just as my larger home dryer does.  (Might have taken a few more minutes but perfectly satisfactory).  It will work when I fly to Europe also, which is very helpful.  Seems as reliable as my previous Conairs--have always liked this brand.</li>
    <li> I ordered the dryer for my wife.  She love it.  According to her, the dryer has strong wind, easy to pack and with the dual voltage so she can use it oversea.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this drier as it is compact, folds, takes little space in the suitcase and works well. I don&#x27;t use it often as it stays in my suitcase and is ready for the next trip.</li>
    <li> Small, powerful, lightweight and folds nicely for travel.  I have no complaints about this product.  I&#x27;l glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> An excellent hair dryer for home and travel.  I tried it at home and have not  put it away for travel, as I had planned to do!</li>
    <li> This is my second version of this hair dryer.  The first one I used for several years and it finally gave up the ghost.  I like the fact that it folds to a small size and it gets hot enough to actually style my hair.  I hope this one lasts as long as the first one.  I have had a couple of travel hair dryers, but this one is better by far.  One good feature is this one does not have such a loud, high pitched scream as most small hair dryers.  The cold air button is also a BIG plus, since I use that when styling my hair with a round brush.  Overall, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I studied abroad in Italy and then traveled to the UK and other places in Europe for over 4 months and this worked perfectly the entire time. It only had a &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; option though when you&#x27;re using it abroad so that was inconvenient but not a problem. It also didn&#x27;t do much damage to my hair, which is what I was most concerned about. I like how it folds in half too so it&#x27;s easy to fit in your luggage.</li>
    <li> Used this when I travelled to Europe and even now when I travel anywhere in the states. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair dryer that actually works and that wasn&#x27;t the size of a bazooka!  This is the one.</li>
    <li> I like a blow dryer that is small but works well and this one gives a lot of &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; for the bucks!  Easy to hold, 2 speeds and also cool setting.  Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer performs well and was appreciated by my wife -- I bought it for our tour of Italy. She exclaimed that it did a really good job. I of course was very pleased because I had purchased it as a SURPRISE! The handle folds against the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The voltage adjustment is a small &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; on the base (front) of the handle that requires a flat blade screwdriver-type tool. I used my Swiss Army knife. When adjusting to 220 volts there is an audible click. On the 220 volt setting there is only one speed. (The 110 volt setting has two speeds.) The plug has the American-style flat prongs  so you will need a simple adapter to fit receptacles in other countries. We used a simple 2 round prong adapter in Italy. By the way, we ran into two other types of receptacles: three prong and three prong bigger/wider. The third prong was the gounding connector.</li>
    <li> People told me that I didn&#x27;t need a hair dryer in Italy.  I should have listened.  This dryer that was specifically for Italy/Europe kept getting overheated and stopping.  I really didn&#x27;t need to bring one, every Hotel had very nice hair dryers.</li>
    <li> Heats up great. Small size is excellent for travel. Bought for a trip to Europe.</li>
    <li> We travel a lot, and wanted a multi-voltage hair drier that will also work on 220 volt. The handle folds, and it is a wonderful addition to our travel.</li>
    <li> This dry works very well for drying ladies hair.  It is small but powerful.  Highly recommend for travel use.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product - compact and powerful - worth for money</li>
    <li> Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it never worked. It obviously is not dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Great for travel or every day!</li>
    <li> Great little dryer. I bought 2 to keep at relatives&#x27;  houses for when guests  (like me) visit them.  I have  visited and used both dryers.</li>
    <li> Excellent travel dryer for our European trip.  The only downside is that when used with higher voltage you can only use one setting.  The low setting is high at 220V, but it worked well for our purposes.  I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a recent trip to Scotland, Ireland, and Northern Ireland. Worked flawlessly for the 17 day trip. Some reviews panned this dryer, but I think the reviewers may not have switched the dryer to 240 before plugging it in. It&#x27;s not an easy switch to see, nor is it easy to switch.</li>
    <li> A little heavy for a travel dryer</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product!  Perfect size and very powerful and dual voltage!  I would recommend it highly, it would make a great travel gift.</li>
    <li> Lots of air and heats quickly. Very light and compact. Used in Israel...or can use in USA. Just need to turn the small switch to the correct voltage. Needed a type H adapter to plug into wall in Israel. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Took to Argentina for a month and it worked great.  I actually like it better than my regular hair dryer.  Just follow the directions for dual voltage and you will have no problem.  This does not come with an adaptor which I had to bring myself.</li>
    <li> Worked good but too heavy for travel.</li>
    <li> Nice and light weight, folds up easily and quieter than my &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; hair dryer.  Recommended for USA/ Canada travel !</li>
    <li> Confortable to use and handy, dryes hair quick and it is small enough to travel and it is not too loud</li>
    <li> This is a very nice compact (foldable) hand held dryer.  There are two heat settings and the power is just perfect for my application which is simply to have an on hand portable dryer to dry clothes when I travel.  I occasionally need to hand wash a few clothing items in hotels when out on the road and this is perfect for this mission.</li>
    <li> Good use. It&#x27;s very compact. Make sure to buy plug head adapters because it is dual voltage use but you still need head adapters to fit the sockets abroad.</li>
    <li> The best part about this hair dryer is you don&#x27;t need a converter for International use. It&#x27;s built in. All you need are the adaptor plugs.</li>
    <li> A compact and very powerful hair dryer, easy to pack and as good as any full size dryer. Also, very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I agree with the comments that this hair dryer works even better than the one I regularly use and is regular size!  I haven&#x27;t used it for travel yet as I am still planning my trip to Italy -- I look forward to using the dual voltage feature.  And this isn&#x27;t too large for packing as some have indicated.  The handle folds nicely and will take up far less room in my suitcase over my regular dryer.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for one I burned up! Now being used twice a week.</li>
    <li> It does not give enough power using the 220v</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought this for our travels in Europe.  It works well here in the U.S., but much louder and hotter in Europe.  So far, it worked, though.</li>
    <li> Good product, worked well.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this in Italy it blew the fuse inside the dryer.  I checked with the motel and I used it correctly.  Finding a new fuse in Florence was difficult especially with the language difference but I did find one. I have not dared to use it again.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much ,bought two. Works great  does the job even though it is a small hair dryer.Thank you</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is far better than the one I have at home and was perfect for a suitcase.  Well worth every penny!!!!! When it&#x27;s folded the dimensions are about 5\\&quot;x5\\&quot;.  Very easy to pack and travel!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works fine in the EU and in the states.  Works on 120V or 250V... kinda.  Only one thing kept this from being 5 stars:  You can&#x27;t run it on &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; when your power supply is 250.  We managed to remember that when we were in the EU, although most places we went had a hair dryer in the room.  I keep the instructions tied to the unit just as a reminder.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer to use for international trial--and this one has plenty of power, unlike one I had purchased previously. While this one is larger, it is still easy to pack.</li>
    <li> My wife complained about the color but the fact that it is dual voltage (although no automatically adjusting, which would be wonderful) makes it useful for her.  She also loves the amount of power it has.</li>
    <li> I tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer.  Unfortunately this one was not very much like the old one.  This one is bigger and bulker, weighs quite a bit more, does not come with a carrying case, and does not have a built-in loop with which to hang from a hook. Also, it is supposed to be two speed, but the low speed is too weak and delivers a stream of coolish air.  The high speed is too powerful and delivers an excessively hot stream of air.&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment!!!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect blow dryer for travel or home use.  It is small, light-weight, folds in half, and is dual voltage for use in or out of the United States. You just turn the little dial for the proper voltage.  Yet, it is very powerful and will dry your hair quickly.  I used it for a month in Europe and never had any problems with it.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight and easy to pack.  It does not take up much room.  It replaced another dryer that lasted only a year.</li>
    <li> Great item - lots of power and very compact and really works with dual voltage. Have purchased 4 - 2 for me and 2 for gifts since last summer. I use mine every day and keep the other one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and worked as expected in Europe.</li>
    <li> Felt weaker than my other 1875w hair dryer. That said, it is affordable and compact. If one uses it for travel and not daily use, it is probably fine.</li>
    <li> I have for a long time a smaller in the same brand, also it can folder , the size was  the better.</li>
    <li> My youngest daughter recently spent six weeks in Argentina. Among the items I purchased for her in preparation for the trip were several outlet adapters and this Conair hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ideal for travel.  It is compact (the handle folds), it has two speeds, 1875 watts, and best of all it is dual voltage. What this means is you don&#x27;t have to purchase an electrical converter--just change the setting from 110v to 220v and you&#x27;re good to go. [Note: I had to use a coin as a screwdriver to change the setting, so you are not likely to accidentally change it.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved it. Overall, a great little hair dryer for the money.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Great travel hair dryer</li>
    <li> This a good hairdryer. I use it as my everyday dryer. It is a bit heavy for packing if weight is an issue.</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT size for me.  I use it after my water aerobics class and it is so compact and easy to use.  I especially like that it folds up into a very small size and it takes up very little space in luggage, if you need to travel.  I highly recommend this Travel Smart Conair 1875 Watt Mini Hair Dryer.</li>
    <li> a bit large for a travel dryer, but really good power and heat</li>
    <li> I was looking for a smaller unit than this and stil I am.; the one I got is still to bulky to go in my bags.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is small, folds nicely for in my suitcase but is very powerful.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> Most of the B&amp;B&#x27;s we stayed in during our 3 week European trip had hairdryers in the bathrooms (and these were in small towns).  However, I did use this hairdryer several times and really liked it.</li>
    <li> I love it!!  It&#x27;s  well built, strong stream and easy to manage -- it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
    <li> Compact, folds,  and has great power. This is my second one, I purchased it to leave at the beach condo.</li>
    <li> Powerful, fairly compact.</li>
    <li> Awesome, powerful little dryer!</li>
    <li> great product.  Good price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit bigger than what i expected it to be. I haven&#x27;t used it and wanted to return but the return policy has a 3-month window (i don&#x27;t like that).</li>
    <li> This product is great for international travel.  Works great.  Would of liked a diffuser with it.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer to use for travel. The first time I used it, it caught on fire!  The manufacturer reluctantly exchanged it for a new hair dryer because it was after the return parameters. Really?  It caught on fire!  The replacement went on a trip to Europe with me and the VERY FIRST TIME I attempted to use it, it AGAIN CAUGHT ON FIRE! I&#x27;m lucky it didn&#x27;t catch my hair on fire...and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel towel!  Very scary.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Great ; little dryer for Africa!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t worth the money and doesn&#x27;t work on fine hair ... only makes more static.  Not for me.  Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well...came to late for a recent trip but it seems like it will work well. Very compact</li>
    <li> Worked perfect! Good quality and good size</li>
    <li> This mini hair dryer is just about perfect for me. Light weight, with high and low heat (plus cool), it dries and styles perfectly. I have the same model, bought almost 20 years ago, which just began to make a whistling sound, but is still working! Unbelievable! I hope this new one has similar durability.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Also, it has a safety cutoff switch if it gets too hot when you&#x27;re drying your clothes in a hotel room at 3 am, as I found, but it worked just fine afterwards.  Please note that when you go to 220V with it, you will not have a low setting.  The low setting becomes &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in UK and her friend used it. She apparently did not flip switch so it stopped but did not short out. Once they got the correct setting it worked well.</li>
    <li> works great on 110, or 250 volts, and packs easily.</li>
    <li> I have a mini pro and thought the one I ordered was similar. It was bulkier to use and heavier. I returned it. The &amp;#34;Mini Pro&amp;#34; is what I hope to purchase as my current blow dryer, still working well, will need to be replaced in the near future.</li>
    <li> It is nice and compact, however not showing in the description on-line is that it will only run in low speed when using the 220 voltage.  This wouldn&#x27;t work with my hair therefore I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Has a lot of power for the compact size.  I use it daily - takes up minimal space on the counter and will be convenient for traveling too.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to go in my gym bag.  I was really impressed with it drying my medium length, thick, blond hair in ~3 minutes (yes... I did actually time it). Now, I find myself getting this one out of my gym bag to use it at home too... therefore I&#x27;m buying another one that will stay in the bathroom at home.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my trip.  Even when I did not realize I had to turn the dial to a different voltage in Singapore - it just flipped the breaker and did not burn out the dryer.  When I was finally smart enough to realize I needed to select the voltage I could not have been happier.  I have long hair and like to dry my hair upside down at times.  I hate when my hair gets caught in the fan.  This dryer had the perfect cover and my hair never got caught or tangled.  It folds up for easy packing too.</li>
    <li> Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI&#x27;s on the same circuit and there hasn&#x27;t been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.  About 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing, then quit.  We will see if they honor the warranty.</li>
    <li> I have a conair Mini from years ago fits in the palm of my hand .. this one is almost regular size.. I was looking for a very small hair dryer for trips.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be helpful to travel with a smaller size hair dryer but this did not do the job I was used to.  I will take my regular size dryer from now on.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this hair dryer didn&#x27;t work well in Europe.  We used the appropriate adapters and plugs, but it still got overheated and quit working after the first time.  I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Powerful as any other hairdryer out there. Compact and ligthweight enough for my overseas travel.  And so convenient to not have to carry a converter.  I absolutely recommend at this price.</li>
    <li> I am replacing a Conair hair dryer which has lasted for about 15 years.  Hopefully this one will last as long.</li>
    <li> Lots of heat and power, love it!. Easy to travel with or fold up and put in a drawer. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for travel with my wife to the U.K., where the current is 220 V.  The appliance is compact, light-weight, folds, blows with high power, and is easy to operate.  It&#x27;s dual-current feature is designed for safe operation, and the directions are extremely detailed and clear.  It made travel very convenient.  Travelers should be aware that they will need to purchase a plug adapter for the country they will be visiting, as the plug on this dryer is configured for U.S. outlets.  I recommend an universal, combination plug adapter that works with any plug/outlet configuration; I purchased such a one in London.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer as it is convertible from US wattage to European wattage and is nicely compact and powerful. It has US plug end so you will need to plan accordingly.</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s advertised as a blow dryer which will work in Europe, it didn&#x27;t even turn on once!  I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought it a long time ago and still working well. Doesn&#x27;t take up much space and works well.</li>
    <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It will work for travel. Small enough to fit in your hand&lt;br /&gt;It has a switch you can turn with your fingernail or a screwdriver 125 to 250V&lt;br /&gt;Cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of cheap plastic. The folding handle feels like it&#x27;s going to break when I fold it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s REALLY noisy. The pitch will hurt your ears!&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t even remotely blow hot air. Essentially, you&#x27;re blow drying on a lukewarm/cool setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: I ended up buying a&lt;br /&gt;Conair YOU Reel 2-in-1 Folding Handle Hair Dryer which I LOVE. It worked perfectly in the UK with a 10 amp converter and my hair looked so much better than when it did using this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the power of hair dryers in smaller hotels in Italy and wanted to bring my own.  This little dynamo took care of my long, thick hair during the three weeks I spent there.  Great product for the money...don&#x27;t forget to bring an adapter for it!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly if you follow the directions for use. Folds nicely and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.Glad to have it with me on my European travels!</li>
    <li> Have only used in this country so far but it is small but does good job drying hair.  It has optional conversion to foreign electrical systems.  Just your standard dryer for a pretty fair price and without running around in crowds hunting for model on sale.</li>
    <li> works fine, and is compact, but there was a weird moldy smell that blew with the hot air...made it slightly unpleasant to use.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as my larger non-travel hair dryer.  Friends have noticed how great it is too!  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> We took a trip to Europe, and this little thing worked great!  No problems at all.  It will definitely be used on the next trip!</li>
    <li> This is compact and puts out more air than my full sized blow dryer.  I bought it because of it&#x27;s dual voltage settings because I work internationally and will be traveling to Ireland soon.  I have been using it every day since I got it because I like it so much.</li>
    <li> Great little drier. Heats up quickly and blows hard. I wish it had an attchment to direct the air better.</li>
    <li> very compact, handy..worked well in australia..a bit noisy...though it is a mini dryer it works like a normal size dryer, even better...my daughter liked it very much</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model of the same. Not as good as my older one but a great little dryer nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I used this in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, where electricity is very poorly done and is very weak. I never blew a fuse and was absolutely amazed!</li>
    <li> This little hair dryer is small enough to travel with, but is powerful enough to dry long, thick hair.  I recommend it for travelers or if you live in a small apartment.</li>
    <li> to large than was pictured.After I ordered this one I found a smaller one ,the 124 AR Vagabond and it meets what I needed</li>
    <li> This product works good for drying my hair quickly. It is very hot and drys my hair very fast but it is noisy and loud.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea that you could switch the voltage, however, you only get the low speed. I have a lot of hair so it took forever to blow dry my hair. On a positive note, it is small and fits well into a carryon.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer blew out the second I plugged it into the wall.</li>
    <li> Beware, it doesn&#x27;t work on HIGH when switched to 240 Volts.  I purchased this hair dryer to travel abroad.  I tested it at home as soon as it arrived at 110 Volts/ US and I loved it.  I was impressed at how powerful the HIGH speed setting was for a travel hair dryer.  Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter&#x27;s dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their&#x27;s did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you&#x27;ll see that the switch won&#x27;t move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW. If you are happy with the power at the LOW setting and your hotel doesn&#x27;t provide a hair dryer, them this is better than nothing, otherwise don&#x27;t even bother taking up space in your suit case to carry this dryer, you are better of just using the one the hotel provides.</li>
    <li> Very powerful dryer and in Europe I only needed to use it on the low because it dried as if it was on high.  I still use it at home and here I use the high setting.  Great Dryer!!</li>
    <li> very nice small convenient dryer for travel. I liked this and its a good purchase who need dryer on travel.</li>
    <li> Size and weight are what I had hoped for when purchasing this dryer for my upcoming trip overseas! Can&#x27;t wait</li>
    <li> I bought my first Conair Travel Smart to take to Europe. It&#x27;s light weight, compact, &amp; dried my thick hair quickly. I had hand surgery this summer &amp; the hair dryer was easy to hold with my cast. I wore out the first one &amp; did not hesitate to order another. The price is right and performs great!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t return this, but it seems a little wobbly and doesn&#x27;t work particularly well with my beth room outlets.  The folding mechanism doesn&#x27;t seem to lock the the unfolded position.  Good power and blowing temps.</li>
    <li> Says it&#x27;s perfect for traveling, and she loves the cold temp button for when she doesn&#x27;t want the high heat.</li>
    <li> Well, this is an update to my previous review.  This blow dryer has stopped blowing hot air, only blows cold now.  It happened right after I pushed and held the cold shot button in for a minute, maybe less.  I feel this dryer should have lastest longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS LITTLE HAIR DRYER IS POWERFUL, IT&#x27;S NICE AND PETITE, AND THE AIR IS NOT TOO HOT THAT IT BURNS AND NOT SO COOL THAT IT DOESN&#x27;T DRY WELL. IT&#x27;S THE PERFECT TEMP.  SO FAR IT IS THE BEST LITTLE HAIR DRYER I HAVE EVER OWNED.  THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS THAT THE CORD DOESN&#x27;T RETRACT. HOWEVER, THOSE USUALLY BREAK SOONER THAN LATER, SO I AM HAPPY.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars. It burned the first time I tried to use it, so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for our recent Europe trip.  Small, though not tiny like her old one, but plenty of power, folds for packing, dual voltage means no convertor needed for use on 240V/50Hz in Europe (you do need the little plug adaptor, which is not included).  She says sh&#x27;ll use in place of her old one when we get home.</li>
    <li> Great dual voltage device.  Did not overheat like many US appliances do when you use them internationally with a transformer.  All you needed was a universal plug device and it worked like a champ.</li>
    <li> great size for travel!!!!</li>
    <li> I use the dryer everyday at home.  It is a little large to take in your suitcase.  If you want it for traveling go with the Brookstone traveling dryer.</li>
    <li> easy to use in europe as well as america, just switch the voltage. powerful in both voltage settings and compact, perfect for traveling! just purchase a little plug adaptor and you have a great dryer. worth the price</li>
    <li> I made sure it was on 220v, plugged it in and bam!  Fried.  Can&#x27;t return it because I&#x27;m overseas and the cost of shipping outweighs the item.  Screw it.  Just don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> great product did not have any attachments for a blow out.  but thats okay.  still workds great and gets real hot</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is quite compact yet very powerful. It produces amazing heat and has two blower speeds which are just perfect. I always purchased the Revlon 1600 watt and decided to give this hair dryer a chance. It&#x27;s great! Wonderful for travel as well as home use. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Wanted a light weight hair dryer for everyday use.  This Conair is just what I wanted, 1875 watts dries my hair fast and is quiet compared to my old one.  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed tha it is so large; not what I envisioned for a travel dryer. Certainly NOT Mini! Works ok at home.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to my friends. These are very durable and I think they would last a long time.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect size, power and convenience when traveling abroad.  It has the button to change voltage.  I loved it!</li>
    <li> I needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer, and this one not only fit but also works well.  With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn&#x27;t have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you&#x27;re visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I&#x27;ve never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> Heavy and clunky for a travel dryer. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Good price,  light weight.  Works good!</li>
    <li> This is a great travel hairdryer.  It works well.  Plenty of heat and power.  I&#x27;ve taken this sucker to the other side of the world and back and it&#x27;s still working like new.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair dryer that was nice and compact to use at home, and sometimes when I travel (very rarely). I like that the air it puts out is not very hot, to the point that you feel like your head is a sauna. My hair is thin and long, and it doesn&#x27;t take me long to dry it. The design is nice and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Powerful little travel dryer.  I actually used this in England as well as on my US vacations.</li>
    <li> I ordered it to take to Israel.  The first time we went, most of the hotels didn&#x27;t furnish a dryer in the room.  So thinking I would be smart and take me a travel dryer, this time all of the hotels provide dryers in the room.  I haven&#x27;t used mine, but glad I have it just in case I need it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair-dryer for the past 3 months while studying abroad in Spain, and it is fantastic! The converter worked and did not fry my hair at all. I only needed a converter to use in the outlets You only have one airflow option, but that was enough for me. It folds up nice and small and is easily packed in a carry-on or larger suitcase. I will definitely be keeping this for future travels both in and outside of the states!</li>
    <li> Used this on a 3 week vacation to Europe. It worked great. no issues.</li>
    <li> The 1875 dryer is an excellent product. Heats fast with with both High and low speeds.Has a slide high, low, and off switch which I liked.  The low speed is higher than I expected but still a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for an upcoming trip to abroad. During the second use it blew and I didn&#x27;t have a blow dryer for the rest of my trip as I trusted that this product would work. To make things worse, I was being proactive and bought this item in advance for my trip so I wouldn&#x27;t be scrambling last minute. Now that I went on my trip and found out it doesn&#x27;t work abroad I have passed my return date and cannot send back this dead blow dryer that didn&#x27;t work! Out the $$ and didn&#x27;t have a blow dryer for my trip.. what a waste!</li>
    <li> Initially purchased this for traveling since it has the ability to work with European voltage as well as US. I now use it every day. Its light and powerful. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The off-on switch on my old Conair travel dryer broke after 5-6 years, so I purchased this one after reading reviews. It&#x27;s even more compact than the old one, and I was pleased to find that it came with a 6&#x27; cord, unlike the old dryer that had a curly cord that wouldn&#x27;t stretch far. It dries my hair in about 3 minutes, and the long cord and two heat settings make it ideal for drying my dogs after bathing, too. The only thing missing is a case for the hair dryer. The old Conair came with one and I saved it - the new one fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. Despite it&#x27;s dual voltage claim it worked for all of 60 seconds in Europe and never worked again.</li>
    <li> hav enot used it yet as am taking it to ireland for my vacation. I did plug it in and works fine.</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because there are none lower.  It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.  Find another one.</li>
    <li> The perfect traveling companion for women in need of hair maintenance each day on European tours. Loved the switch that allows 220 usage in Europe (with adapter), plus 110 usage here in the United States.  The folding handle that allows compact packing is great.</li>
    <li> The Conair dryer is small for traveling and easy to use.  Great product and I highly recommend it. Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Work great,it is very powerful. I have thick hair and it dries it quickly. It is a great travel hair dryer.</li>
