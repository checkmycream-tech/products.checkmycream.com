    <li> Got this for my BFF for her birthday. She absolutely LOVED it!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  What makes it great.  A pleasant full lavender aroma.  The consistency of the soap is solid, feels like liquid soap should feel.  Isn&#x27;t runny or slimy.  This soap is almost lotion.  Great lather and leaves your hands feeling clean with a linguring aroma.  The dispenser dispenses just the right amount of soap to use.  Not too much and not too little, someone thought this through.</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer. Love this product. Great smell, leaves hand clean and soft. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Yardley English Lavender hand soap is the only soap we use.</li>

    <li> This is the hand soap that is in some of the rest rooms at restaurants.  The smell is wonderful.  When washing hands, it fills the bathroom with the wonderful scent.  I received the order promptly and I am very happy with it.  I only wish I ordered bigger size.</li>
