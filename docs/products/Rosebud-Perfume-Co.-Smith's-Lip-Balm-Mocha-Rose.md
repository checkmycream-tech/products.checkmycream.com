      <li>i love the scent too - like chocolate and coffee, which is good because that&#x27;s what mocha is.</li>

      <li>This is easily my favorite lip balm I own (and I own a LOT of lip balms/glosses, it&#x27;s kind of an obsession).</li>
      <li>but this Mocha Rose Rosebud balm is my favorite of them all because of the texture and scent.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this lip balm!  </li>
      <li>It smells very nice, has a lovely taste, and chapped lips go away quickly.</li>
      <li>but it is a good mixture and a unique taste on your lips.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for alternative uses like I would with the original, but still great to have along with the original, strawberry &amp; mint salves.</li>
      <li>I figured the smell would be ok</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the chocolate/vanilla smell</li>

      <li>OK I like Rosebud better</li>
      <li>Product is ok.</li>
      <li>What I like best about this lip balm though aside from the stuff already mentioned is that it doesn&#x27;t cause those white goopy bits in the corners of your mouth after a while.   </li>
      <li>but I love the formula of the Rosebud lip balm.</li>
      <li>The smell is okay</li>
      <li>I love Rosebud Balm.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I bought this at a shop during a trip and I am thrilled to find it available on Amazon.  </li>

      <li>Will reorder more when done with this.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lipbalm for ages, and i&#x27;m so glad i found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>Wish I bought more.  </li>
      <li>and it looks way better than vaseline...</li>
      <li>Love all the Rosebud Lip Balms, but the Mocha Rose isn&#x27;t quite as creamy as the Original.</li>
      <li>It softens and hydrates lips just like the original rosebud salve, but it has the nice flavor and scent of Mocha.  </li>
      <li>And it feels good on your lips for the first 10 minutes,</li>
      <li>I tried the tubes and at first loved them but over time I will not buy the tubes again, stick with the tin.</li>
      <li>Maybe even better than the Original Rosebud Salve.</li>
      <li>Love Rosebud products, but original salve formula is still the go to for chapped lips.</li>
      <li>I am a very loyal buyer of the Smith company.  </li>
      <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
      <li>Best lip moisteriser hands down.</li>
      <li>It feels really smooth and creamy as well.</li>
      <li>It is not as good as the minted rose one, not very moisture</li>
      <li>I MUCH rather prefer the original Rosebud Salve, which is amazing.</li>
      <li>If you like the feel of the original Rosebud Salve, then you will like this newer flavor.  </li>
      <li>The scent is unique, like others have said, it&#x27;s chocolate and coffee.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, the tin is pretty.</li>
      <li>This salve has the scent of the original formula with just a hint of chocolate.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it mixed with rose</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a strong chocolate or mocha flavor but it works just right.</li>
      <li>Great for babies dry skin too!</li>
      <li>I am over these decorative tins of fancy Vaseline - They are overpriced and not all that special or well-made.</li>
      <li>Love it so much</li>
      <li>My 14 year old son told me he had been using it too and wanted his own because it worked just as well for him</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really smell the coffee most of the time but one</li>
      <li>The soft rose scent and chocolate go so well together.</li>
      <li>Love this lip balm, very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>Not too sweet.</li>
      <li>It was thick and moisturizing which was perfect for my feet.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve both tried every brand we can find at drug stores, and even some higher end shops but nothing has ever worked good enough to make a difference.</li>
      <li>if that&#x27;s true, this will be great for chocolate lovers who need to lose a few.</li>
      <li>I have used this lip balm in the past and loved it!  </li>
      <li>I love that these come in a giant tin because I tend to lose the stick lip balms easily</li>
      <li>and I love so soft it makes my lips feel.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have finally found it here!</li>
      <li>it tastes good too, not like some other rosebud lip balms.</li>
      <li>As for the balm itself, the flavor is basic chocolate fragrance, with a very strong taste of petrolatum Vaseline.</li>
      <li>except from that, this lip balm is amazing and worth every cent i spent -</li>
      <li>and my lips are smooth the next morning and stay smooth all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this stuff before so i knew what i was getting into- it&#x27;s just an all around great balm- buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the tin is pretty. Product is ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of the Rosebud balms and this is no exception. It smells heavenly! The soft rose scent and chocolate go so well together. I can&#x27;t really smell the coffee most of the time but one in awhile I pick it up. This balm just smells warm and comforting without being overly sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula of these is very moisturizing. This version seems a bit less thick than others I&#x27;ve tried but just as hydrating. I love that these come in a giant tin because I tend to lose the stick lip balms easily and there&#x27;s no dropping this one without hearing it clunk on the floor. It also makes it easier to grab in my bag. Plus, it lasts forever (I&#x27;ve had tubs of this last me over a year with heavy, daily use).</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse, its an excellent lip balm. It smells very nice, has a lovely taste, and chapped lips go away quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically tinted scented petroleum jelly, but man do we looove the smell.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this lip balm because to me it was kind of pricey. I finally broke down and purchased it and OMG this stuff is great. Its so moisturizing better than any other lip balm or lip, chap stick extc. It does not leave any residue in the corners of your lips like other glosses. Actually if you combine with a another lip gloss it will prevent the white stuff from appearing. This stuff is great and I definitely have to keep a tube on me at all times. love it!</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my lips well and is soft enough to smooth on my lips. My lips are very dry so some lip balms are too hard and it either ends up rubbing the skin off my lips or I have hard time applying it. This one is great and I love the mocha smell!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is the best thing since fried chicken on a Sunday hay ride with the preachers cousin! Chile this is long lasting lip licking goodness!</li>
    <li> My son and I suffer from dry lips year round, but it&#x27;s even worse in the winter months. We&#x27;ve both tried every brand we can find at drug stores, and even some higher end shops but nothing has ever worked good enough to make a difference. I did some googling and this brand was recommended so I ordered a single tin of the Mocha Rose. After a few applications, my lips are so soft and smooth. My 14 year old son told me he had been using it too and wanted his own because it worked just as well for him, he didn&#x27;t even care that this tin had the pink colors, it just worked! This lip balm is long wearing also so you don&#x27;t have to keep applying it over and over. I&#x27;m so glad to have found this.</li>
    <li> The scent is unique, like others have said, it&#x27;s chocolate and coffee. And it feels good on your lips for the first 10 minutes, but then it&#x27;s gone. It also leaves me with no long-lasting moisture benefits. It doesn&#x27;t repair your lips, either. I MUCH rather prefer the original Rosebud Salve, which is amazing. I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> Best lip moisteriser hands down. Love it so much I bought all of the flavors rose, mocha, mint, strawberry. I keep one in my purse as well as my nightstand. Great for babies dry skin too!</li>
    <li> This is easily my favorite lip balm I own (and I own a LOT of lip balms/glosses, it&#x27;s kind of an obsession). Like someone else mentioned it doesn&#x27;t last super long once applied, but I don&#x27;t think any lip balms last ridiculously long so this isn&#x27;t really an issue for me. However, speaking of lasting long, the actual balm isn&#x27;t even halfway finished and I&#x27;ve had it since early February (it&#x27;s now October) and I use it every day.   It smells wonderful, just like the name it&#x27;s a chocolatey vanilla smell, and while it&#x27;s not a huge color boost or anything it&#x27;s still a light tint of pink, it evens out my lip tone so it looks really nice on. It feels really smooth and creamy as well. What I like best about this lip balm though aside from the stuff already mentioned is that it doesn&#x27;t cause those white goopy bits in the corners of your mouth after a while.   When it eventually runs out, which I&#x27;d imagine isn&#x27;t going to happen until next year at this rate, I&#x27;ll definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Nasty to my taste. Too much of a coffee scent and taste. I trashed it. Never again.</li>
    <li> Love Rosebud products, but original salve formula is still the go to for chapped lips. The Mocha Rose has a great chocolate scent however.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive yet dry lips to start with and burt bees was a total disaster for me- it itched my lips so badly and my lips was chapped. i tend to avoid lipstick because my lips are so dry that whatever lipstick makes my lines on lips show terribly: high end and drugstore such as ysl and revlon just do not work for me. what i like about this lip balm is the slightest hint of coral pink makes my pale pink lips terribly beautiful and pouty with a hint of shine. yet the scent of the lip balm was not as long lasting as i thought it would be, so it is a 4 star from me. except from that, this lip balm is amazing and worth every cent i spent - i mean its a big as regular vaseline and it looks way better than vaseline... this thing makes me happy!</li>
    <li> this is a great lip gloss, but beware, it is addicting. it doesn&#x27;t last long - but then, it doesn&#x27;t claim to last long. i love the scent too - like chocolate and coffee, which is good because that&#x27;s what mocha is. i&#x27;ve read research that says smelling food instead of eating it can help curb appetites. if that&#x27;s true, this will be great for chocolate lovers who need to lose a few. my husband says he doesn&#x27;t like it, but every time i use it, he comments that something smells good, like chocolate. (he&#x27;s silly.) it tastes good too, not like some other rosebud lip balms. (i personally don&#x27;t like the taste of the regular rosebud lip balm/salve.)</li>
    <li> Yum, yum - what&#x27;s not to like about Mocha?  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it mixed with rose but it is a good mixture and a unique taste on your lips. It isn&#x27;t a strong chocolate or mocha flavor but it works just right. If you like Rosebud lip balm, you&#x27;ll like the flavors, too!  Chocolate lips!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> The smell is okay but I love the formula of the Rosebud lip balm. I have been using the strawberry flavor for over 6 months. My lips are so soft and have not had any drying out like you do with other balms. The Mocha Rose scent isn&#x27;t bad but probably won&#x27;t purchase this scent again. Love the product though!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Smells like Mocha and works well. Wish I bought more.  Will reorder more when done with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a shop during a trip and I am thrilled to find it available on Amazon.  My lips get severely chapped very quickly and this product gives me instant improvement.  I like to put it on before bed and my lips are smooth the next morning and stay smooth all day.</li>
    <li> This salve has the scent of the original formula with just a hint of chocolate. It doesn&#x27;t really have color and absorbs really fast. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for alternative uses like I would with the original, but still great to have along with the original, strawberry &amp; mint salves.</li>
    <li> This balm smells so good. I&#x27;m always very happy with Rosebud products. Delivered very quickly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love all the Rosebud Lip Balms, but the Mocha Rose isn&#x27;t quite as creamy as the Original. The scent is light enough that it won&#x27;t bother you if you are sensitive to strongly scented products.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lip balm!  If you like the feel of the original Rosebud Salve, then you will like this newer flavor.  It softens and hydrates lips just like the original rosebud salve, but it has the nice flavor and scent of Mocha.  I buy extras: 1 to keep at home, 1 for my purse.</li>
    <li> OK I like Rosebud better though</li>
    <li> Smells great! Doesn&#x27;t last super long but long enough for me!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It smells great and it makes your lips soft.&lt;br /&gt;I got 2 of them :)</li>
    <li> This is a very moisturizing lip balm, but the smell and the flavor turn my stomach. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy rose salve in this flavor again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the jar only. Crazy? Just a bit. I figured the smell would be ok and I could use it as a lip product, hitting two birds with one stone. Not so much. The mocha scent was too overpowering. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get rid of it so instead of using it on my lips, I used it on my feet and knees. It was thick and moisturizing which was perfect for my feet.</li>
    <li> Very nice lip balm. Smells great, tastes nice, and works well.</li>
    <li> Timeless.  Classic.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love Rosebud Balm.  Not a fan of the Strawberry, this Mocha is OK, Menthol and Regular are my favorites by far.  I tried the tubes and at first loved them but over time I will not buy the tubes again, stick with the tin.</li>
    <li> I love the chocolaty taste!</li>
    <li> Rosebud Rosebud Rosebud.  I am a very loyal buyer of the Smith company.  The smell is unusual, but it works.</li>
    <li> I have used this lip balm in the past and loved it!  I noticed when I got this one that they had changed their packaging, but thought nothing of it.  I ended up with an allergic reaction and upon comparing labels I found they had added Red #7 to the ingredients :( :(  I will not be using this product again-I&#x27;m bummed I bought two.</li>
    <li> Wonderful presentation in a very decorative tin. I would, and will, buy this as a gift again. Wonderful product and smells really good, too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled or the fact that is burned my lips when I applied the product.  I sent it back so I could get my money returned</li>
    <li> The first one arrived unsealed with a huge gash out of the balm - The second one had a different design on the tin, which is flimsy and irritating to open and close (becomes bent with even the slightest pressure when opened, then needs to be bent in order to close again). As for the balm itself, the flavor is basic chocolate fragrance, with a very strong taste of petrolatum Vaseline. I am over these decorative tins of fancy Vaseline - They are overpriced and not all that special or well-made.</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the minted rose one, not very moisture</li>
    <li> I want to try all of them ! I&#x27;ve tryed many lip balms but this is so buttery soft and is very present ,put over long lasting lipstick it was perfect! Highly recommend!😁</li>
    <li> Been using Rosebud salve for years and decided to try this variation. Nice subtle chocolate tint. Not too sweet. Very nice,</li>
    <li> Great product, comes from a great brand.  Feels like cocoa and rose petals blended together on your lips.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to purchase Rosebud Lip Balm from Amazon but NOT my first time to purchase and use Rosebud Lip Balm. I love this product! I am a head and neck cancer survivor for 8 years. I still suffer from dry mouth and dry lips due to the radiation treatment. I have tried many lip balms and moisturizers but while some helped, none has made as big a difference in moisturizing my lips as Rosebud has. It also works wonders on my cuticles helping them stay soft and not dry. I apply this to my cuticles and lips morning and night and use it on my lips as needed during the day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative is that the tin while a convenient size is difficult to open. I tend to keep one partially opened in my medicine chest and then a tube of Rosebud Rose Balm (that I purchased on Amazon) in my purse. I am not sure if the Mocha Rose comes in a tube or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Rosebud Lip Balm for 3 years and will not be without it any more.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Good for night time use.</li>
    <li> Not much color and heavier than I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite lip balm. I love the chocolate/vanilla smell and I love so soft it makes my lips feel. I&#x27;ve tried softlips, EOS, chapstick, even Korres lip balms, and probably several more... but this Mocha Rose Rosebud balm is my favorite of them all because of the texture and scent. I often put it on to smooth out my lips before wearing lipsticks that enhance any dry skin you may have on your lips. It works like a charm. I received this as a gift around 6 months ago and have been looking for where I could repurchase when I run out. I&#x27;m thrilled to have finally found it here!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lipbalm for ages, and i&#x27;m so glad i found it on amazon. Excellent value for the price. Tastes good, gives you the bit of shine and little color so you dont look so crappy in the middle of a crazy day when you cant reach a mirror to do lipstick!</li>
    <li> After being a fan of the Rosebud Salve and Strawberry Salve from the same brand, I thought I&#x27;d try this one out and it is lovely! It smells very good, like mocha/vanilla, and moisturizes your lips great! Maybe even better than the Original Rosebud Salve. This one leaves your lips soft and doesn&#x27;t let it get peely (the lips start to peel) when it wears off. I highly recommend this!</li>
