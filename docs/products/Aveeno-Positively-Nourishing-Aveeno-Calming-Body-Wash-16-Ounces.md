<li> A half dollar sized dollop used with bath gloves goes a long way.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good stuff and pretty well priced coming from Amazon.  I use various brands but always seem to have a bottle of&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno on hand.  It is the best standby and never seems to irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> So my \\&quot;aveeno fanatic\\&quot; friend gave this to me when her skin broke out in a rash and her doctor forbid her to use anything except cetaphil (This product was not the cause of her rash, come to find out) but I wasn&#x27;t about to give it back cuz I fell in love with it!  It is an all purpose body wash/shaving cream/bubble bath in our household.  My toddler has excema and the baby bubble bath we were using was irritating to his skin, and once I realized how incredibly F O A M I N G this was, we have begun to use this as his bubble bath instead. And to our surprise, his excema has cleared up! Seriously, once you aerate the water a bit~ lots of nice plump little bubbles that smell delicious.  And as a body wash, it is a nice &amp; creamy, moisturizing gentle wash~ not to mention it has the most pleasant lavender smell that just makes you inhale and smile... Did I already say how incredibly wonderful and complex it smells!! MMMMM, really! It truly is CALMING, and perfect for bedtime bath. When this is gone I will buy more.</li>
    <li> After trying many different products for my dry skin, I found this and figured I would give it a try. This product does works well and has a nice smell to it. Package arrived on time without any issues/damage</li>
    <li> Love this body wash- the scent is pleasant and light.  It does linger after the bath but if you use other perfumes, it will not fight them.  It is creamy and lathers well.  A half dollar sized dollop used with bath gloves goes a long way.    The product shipped quickly (with Prime) and all three bottles were inside, but with different levels of the body wash inside.  The levels were not low enough to lodge a complaint to the seller and return the box, but I will be sure to check the product amount in the next shipment I get.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to use bar soap and now I&#x27;m a convert. This is gentle and the smell is wonderful. I can never go back to bar soap or any other soap again. I&#x27;m sold on this and my skin feels good and not dried out. I&#x27;m buying in bulk now.</li>
    <li> I ordered a dual pack because I love this product so much. It is good for all skin types and leaves a lovely lavender frangrance.  It&#x27;s not overehelming, just very relaxing.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great product for your skin; helps with a dry skin problem.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Rinses clean, no slip left on skin.  Refreshing.  Worth the money.  Highly recommend this.  Jennifer Aniston is right.  Try it.</li>
    <li> The price was very reasonable especially with the prime account shipping.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Great Scent too.</li>
    <li> This smells nice and does not irritate my skin and it seems to cut down on the dryness after the shower</li>
    <li> Love this body wash.  It works great as a bubble bath too.  Smells wonderful and calming! Leaves my skin feeling very soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Packaging I&#x27;ve seen yet!

There was absolutely no leakage at all.. thank you so much!</li>

    <li> Great scent. Does the job! No ashiness!</li>
    <li> Smells so good, lathers really well and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  All pluses.</li>
    <li> I tend to buy soap and body wash based on scent.  I am not fond of products that have too strong a scent, but at the same time, I also don&#x27;t like the smell of unscented soaps.  This body wash has a nice and fairly subtle smell.</li>
    <li> Great product the best.</li>
    <li> Great smell, soothing aroma and feels good!</li>
    <li> Love!!!! But it leaked in box!</li>
    <li> Have used this product forever.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and it&#x27;s as good as expected.  may order some more when i&#x27;m done with this pack</li>
    <li> reason is because two of the bottle come dripping the liquid so now I don&#x27;t know what to do towo of them are almost half of liquid isn&#x27;t fear that I have to paid for a product didn&#x27;t come in good condition I hope you give some answer and solution about it&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Smoothes skin and has a wonderful fragrance.  Delivery was quick.</li>
