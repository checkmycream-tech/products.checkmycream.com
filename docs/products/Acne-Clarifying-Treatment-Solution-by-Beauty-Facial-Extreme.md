<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m at the age now where toning my skin is especially important.  BUT I still have adult acne.  If you want to tone your skin while reducing your pimples and blackheads, this is for you.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This stuff gets rid of acne fast!! I definitely recommend it for the $</li>
    <li> This Acne Toner is awesome. It unclogs your pores and helps get rid of dead skin. And leaves your face feeling refreshed and clean. Women, men, and teens all can use this  product.</li>
    <li> I’m suffering with acne since long time and observed a very good result after using this cream. I recommend this cream to the people who are suffering with acne.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much.  I&#x27;ve used this nightly for four weeks now and have seen no improvement.</li>
    <li> very good acne treater took about 3 weeks to get rid of acne to a point where it was easy for me not to see it. I use it to get rid of my pores and use it to get rid of my pores on my face very good product</li>
    <li> I love this toner. Using it with other products from the same line is the best way to get killer results. The toner works well and complements all skin types. Great for someone who wants a product that does multiple things for their skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. I have not seen any improvements. At the beginning the problem got worst. I thought that is was because of the transition from my previous treatment to this one, but at the moment i am still having the same issue i was having before (acne and acne scars). And i have to remark that my acne problem is not terrible and if it can´t deal with mine how can it work on worse acne problems. I´m really disappointed with this toner. It works just as any other toner in the market and it is way more expensive. I bought this product because it had such good reviews and I thought that this was the real thing! That´s why I´m doing this review: if you have acne issues and are thinking that this product is going to help. NO. IT WILL NOT HELP YOU.</li>
    <li> If you have ance and have done everything from changing your overall diet to washing your face hundreds of times a day.&lt;br /&gt;Its time to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;This acne wash is powerful and the salycillic acid is an organic and strong astringent that gets in your pores and kills any pathogens found.&lt;br /&gt;Whiteheads, blackheads, whatever. You will see a noticeable difference within days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And who wants pimples, you didn&#x27;t want them when you were fifteen and you don&#x27;t want them now.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and take care of your pretty face. c:</li>
    <li> This works really great on your skin!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, would recommend to those seeking a solution to their bad acne</li>
    <li> I have had acne ever since I began high school(I&#x27;m a senior now) and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactiv to Xout to prescriptions to putting toothpaste and mint leaves all over my face and honestly, I had given up. If you&#x27;re like me, acne has been ruining your life from job interviews to dating and if you too are sick of it, buy this. At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but I wasn&#x27;t looking hard enough. My blackheads began disappearing, my cystic pimples began shrinking and now i&#x27;m in my 3rd month of this stuff and my skin has never looked healthier. This is totally worth the investment because you will feel soo much better about yourself once you start to see those pimples disappear.</li>
    <li> This has helped me with all my acene problems I have had in the past. It&#x27;s affordable and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always have acne problems. But when I do I use Acne Corrective Toner.</li>
    <li> I have bad acne and I have tried this and it works. I love having a clearer face. And I feel more beautiful too because I am not self conscious about whether will be looking at the acne or looking at me. I appreciate that. Because now I can get through interviews with confidence.</li>
    <li> All around great product! I&#x27;ve had acne since my teen years, I&#x27;m now in my early 20&#x27;s and still have some lingering ones or the occasional sprouts. I decided to try this product out, considering others had failed before. The product is amazing. It works very fast gives great results. I use it on a semi-daily basis now. Using the product regularly really helped diminish what acne I had.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell and all but it actually made my daughter break out and sore so we discontinued and returned.  It just didn&#x27;t work for her.  Prompt refund.  One month later I was charged for it again.  Amazon quickly rectified it and refunded again.</li>
    <li> Totally helped clear my monthly breakouts. Be sure to moisturizer well afterwards if you have dry skin, maybe with almond oil.</li>
    <li> I was in the look out for a miracle because my face was in a state of emergency, I&#x27;m almost 30 and I thought the acne was behind me but i guess not, i love this toner because is great with my sensitive skin. I began to see results within the first week, and by the first month of use my skin was almost completely clear. my acne scars were significantly diminished and at this point I am a very pleased customer and this has being the only product that had ever had this great of a result on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for my son and it is working great. It is a bit pricey...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this Toner since May, and I have to say that it&#x27;s helping me so much !. I was so ugly with acne on my skin, but this is helping me so much, i&#x27;m feeling so good ! I tried like 5+ products, but this one is the cheapest and THE ONLY ONE that is working. The toner is very efficient and I recommend for you to use it.</li>
    <li> Great item for the skin!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Since struggling with acne my entire life even in my 20s... After my first pregnancy too I had the worst breakout ever which left me with dark spots that I thought could never go away. I tried this and after I&#x27;d say 3 weeks I saw those spots disappearing. 2 weeks later it was completely gone! I&#x27;m so amazed and happy! Thank you !!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne since I was a teenager and have tried many different products. I recently found Beauty Facial Extreme&#x27;s Acne Corrective Toner. It is proven to reduce pimple size, blackheads, redness, and swelling for visibly clearer skin for women, men and teens. It gently exfoliates the skin to reduce the appearance of acne scars and marks and penetrates deep to unclog pores, remove dirt, and cellular debris. After just a couple of days, my skin looks and feels amazing. There is no shine since it controls excess oils. ACT has worked great for me! I am very impressed and am now a firm believer in this product!!</li>
    <li> My acne cleared up in only 1 week. This product feels very soft on the skin and is very effective. I will recommend this product for anyone needing acne relief.  http://www.amazon.com/review/RR9GVB9PDPU7J/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00THPMUFM</li>
    <li> Thank heavens I finally found a product that really works good. I recently had my baby girl and my face went crazy with pimples . I was researching and found this product  it really does work I&#x27;m seeing a difference already and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks. Definitely will keep buying !!!!!!</li>
    <li> These days the level of difficulty seems to rise without limits. Being I&#x27;m usually active, my skin seems to perspire on abnormal levels.. leaving my skin really oily and dirty; don&#x27;t even get me started about the clogged pores. Aside from being a corrective toner, this does a wonderful cleaning job all while exfoliating the skin. I hate putting those rough exfoliators up against my face, that&#x27;s why I need something that does the exfoliation job. Thank you beauty facial extreme!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> So happy I found this product for my oil skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Works well.</li>
    <li> It puts the completion to shame! Proactive was a waste of time and money and irritated my sensitive skin.  It gets rid of oil and dirt while it shrinks pores. It also reduces redness and helps keep your skin more balanced so that your skin won&#x27;t have so much shine throughout the day. It&#x27;s amazing how much gunk gets in our pores every day. Using an astringent may feel like an extra step, but when you&#x27;ve got pimples all over your face maybe an extra step is what it takes to help out.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is excellent, my skin was filled with acne, I could not even look at me in the mirror, had shame of going out, this under my self-esteem enough, but thanks to this miraculous cream I finally go with confidence into the street, already not afraid that people see me, I leave not covered or with caps as used to exit&lt;br /&gt;I should give Seven Stars but sorry, having 5 Stars only! :) Great item for the skin! Highly recommend!! This product is great!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best corrective toners I&#x27;ve used for clearing acne off my face.&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing acne wash, probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever used in my lifetime&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I honestly tried it on a lark. My friend&#x27;s dad recommended it to me when i was asking around for a good dermatologist. It had apparently worked for his wife, so I figured I&#x27;d try it myself.  I have definitely had noticeable acne on my face that would sometimes hurt, and I was tired of all that. So I got this stuff, turned it into a ritual, and started getting results pretty quickly. It&#x27;s amazing how much gunk gets in our pores every day. Using an astringent may feel like an extra step, but when you&#x27;ve got pimples all over your face maybe an extra step is what it takes to help out.</li>
    <li> Just like most people with acne I have tried dozens of products and home remedies and this is the one I&#x27;m sticking with. Fast and noticeable results and a totally reasonable price. A+ in my book!</li>
    <li> If you have problem skin like I do, you might find this to be the best product on the market for you! This toner, in conjunction with the Beauty Facial Extreme wash, cleared up my blemishes without causing much dryness, safe to use everyday!  As with any product containing benzoyl peroxide, make sure to moisturize after washing and toning, and be prepared to fall in love with your skin!</li>
    <li> I suffered from horrible acne. Proactiv wasn&#x27;t helping me, I figured why not? Let&#x27;s give this a shot and see how good it is and guess what? In only a matter a days I saw a huge change in my face. It&#x27;s very smooth, blemish-free and it looks vibrant and lively! No longer will I be called pizza face as a joke by my friends.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have horrible acne like most of the reviewers on her, but I do get horrible scaring after a pimple or zits clears.  This corrective toner really helps in keeping my skin tone even and the scaring away.  I also noticed its lessened the oil on my face and helped with the dark circles under my eyes.  I think it&#x27;s truly beneficial.</li>
    <li> It is a good product to use together with an exfoliant, has good skin care and my opinion products skin care of this brand are the best in the market, this toner i bought at a nearby store with other products against acne, etc. I like it because it is not harmful to my face and I do not cause dry skin, it is perfect for those who have problems in the face and they need soft and nice products.</li>
    <li> After trying way too many other acne products, I found this. This is probably the best acne product on the market. This has helped my acne in a matter of days!</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected. More acne</li>
    <li> I will probably stick to proactive because I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results. I was given this as a Christmas Gift and it worked fine. But honestly, I&#x27;m happy with the results from proactive. I think they probably use the same ingredients. Not much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Before I used this product, I had very bad acne, it was all over my face. My mother ordered me this product and I thought it was just going to be another one of those basic products, but under 1 WEEK I started to see a difference! My acne is now almost all cleared up and just on time for the summer :)</li>
    <li> If your face gets that ugly shine like mine, then this is definitely the product you are looking for. Instantly after using it, it took away that hideous greasy look and it made my skin look and feel super smooth. I have kept using it regularly and i love it.&lt;br /&gt;Its really soft on the skin, yet it gets the job done. Its a must on any girls beauty list.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne every since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve tried everything from ProActiv to over-the-counter potions and lotions to some of the crazy home remedies I found on the internet. Nothing worked and I always felt like I was caking on makeup to hide the embarrassment I felt from my problem. After using this product for just a couple days, I immediately noticed that my blackheads started to disappear and shortly after that, my pimples started shrinking and I finally started smiling! I will never go without this toner!</li>
    <li> Acne Corrective Toner has really helped clear up my acne; I also like the fact that it does not dry out my skin. Very impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> Almost all acne over the counter medications include the active ingredient salycylic acid 2%. This one just happens to work great.</li>
    <li> This toner is perfect. It gets rid of oil and dirt while it shrinks pores. It also reduces redness and helps keep your skin more balanced so that your skin won&#x27;t have so much shine through out the day. It&#x27;s a wonderful astringent for a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> It not only good for acne its also good to  clean the dirt and grease my face accumulates throughout the day. Plus its good for my sensitive skin and makes me skin feels smoother. I need to buy another bottle...</li>
    <li> If you care about your complexion and want a clean and clear face, you should buy this product. At first I was a little apprehensive to buy as a result of the less than professional packaging, but what is important is what is inside of this bottle! Powerful and gentle face cleaner, leaves me feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> This is a good acne treatment product.</li>
    <li> Finally a toner that works! As a 30 year old woman I have been suffering from really bad acne and had a particularly bad breakout this month but after using this product for 2 weeks I have to report the breakouts have stopped! This toner doesn&#x27;t leave my face dry and its has a nice tingly feeling after use. I should also say that I use this toner in connection with the facial wash. My only gripe with this product ..is that there isnt enough! its a good sized bottle but after two weeks of using this toner twice a day I am almost halfway done with it. so I wish we could get more for the money...since it is pretty pricey,..but I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Iv been using this acne wash for a few weeks now and it seems to work well. It helps get rid of the acne you have, helps lighten dark spots and is easy to use but it doesn&#x27;t prevent acne and for the price you think it should. I still get acne all the time but it does help get rid of what you have so  guess its ok.</li>
    <li> I’ve struggled with pimples and blackheads for years that made me feel self-conscious and shy whenever I came into contact with people. My social life was non-existent because I was too embarrassed to go out. I wish I had found Acne Corrective Toner sooner. My skin has never looked younger and healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything but this is the winner.I think I&#x27;ve used every home remedy I can think of and I almost gave up hope until I found this product.The outside of the product was what really lured me to make a purchase.</li>
