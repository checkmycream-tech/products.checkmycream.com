      <li>I love the way this makes my eyes feel.</li>

      <li>It leaves my skin feeling wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
      <li>I wish I could return it and would strongly recommend to everyone to test it before purchasing.</li>
      <li>Helps smooth out skin under my eye and lighten the look under my eye.</li>
      <li>I received this product from influenster for free for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.</li>
      <li>Despite my best and most naive hope that it would work.  </li>
      <li>an so for 300.00 worth of nothing ?!</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly, brightens skin, light scent, moisturizes well and not greasy.</li>
      <li>cream itself has a shimmery quality, but rubs in nice and clear.  </li>
      <li>Has not been a super winner yet, but I like the product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels really nice and smooth going on and after a few weeks of use, I do feel like the skin around my eyes is looking better--</li>
      <li>I use Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream at night with great results (it really helped with some fine wrinkles - I&#x27;m over 40), but it does not absorb well and tends to leave white residue, so in the morning I&#x27;ve been using Clinique All About Eyes that is very lightweight.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun to have on my counter!&lt;br</li>
      <li>cuz it doesnt seem to be easily absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I have to put warm compresses on my eyes for 5 minutes every night which makes the skin dry.</li>
      <li>Soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Wanted to buy this to try for the first time it was showing a 3.00 dollar coupon</li>
      <li>Rarely an eye cream has such strong reaction on my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is not very sensitive and I&#x27;ve tried many eye products before.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few weeks, and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>but this one really gave an unusually intense burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve really been liking the way my skin looks.</li>
      <li>This product does absolutely does nothing.</li>
      <li>Really burned.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really found anything to battle them yet, and Regenerist Luminous isn&#x27;t doing the job for me.  </li>
      <li>It does its job for the most part; I do notice it decreases the starkness of my dark circles.</li>
      <li>It not hard to use and doesnt leave any residue if you dont use too much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say my dark circles are gone, but I know the skin around my eyes isn&#x27;t as dry as it was.</li>
      <li>I started using this product 2x per day, 3 weeks ago, and the darkness has decreased by more than 50%!</li>
      <li>I usually really like Olay and use several of their products</li>
      <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE  EYES</li>
      <li>do not recommend this product if you have any sort of sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel anything when I put it on, and so far no effect on me at all.</li>
      <li>It is soft and doesn&#x27;t pull on the eye when you apply it.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately after the very first application I felt strong burning sensation all around the eye where cream was applied.</li>
      <li>--I have a small scar under my left eye from an allergic reaction many years ago--now this scar is barely noticeable!</li>
      <li>I use a very tiny amount and have not had a problem with it not absorbing adequately.</li>
      <li>a flaky cheap foundation cream look which as a man is not appealing to me.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it a couple of times so far and only see a small difference - hopefully continued use will provide better results.</li>
      <li>I wiped my hands on my black t-shirt and it took some of the color right out oor it.</li>
      <li>It just has smooth effect on the dark circles and no tingling feeling or wet look.</li>
      <li>Still have dark circles but eye area much smoother .</li>
      <li>Dark circles aside, I really like this eye</li>
      <li>It also didn&#x27;t do anything for the dark circles and I still had to use as much concealer as before.</li>
      <li>However, after about a week or two of application I&#x27;ve developed red dots under my eyes (noticed immediately after application just today) and they&#x27;re still there about 14 hours later, now starting to itch...</li>
      <li>I always had trouble with dark circles under my eyes; this product helped me look much younger and stress free because of how it hides the undesirable eye bags.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African American, 59 years old, and had developed dark circles under both eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way this makes my eyes feel. I would have given it five stars, but I&#x27;m not sure it actually removes wrinkles and dark circles. I would say it helps prevent. The price point is hard to beat for the quality it turns out.</li>
    <li> this product is better then the Olay Definity Illuminating Eye Treatment.  I notice a difference since using this one. I believe a lot of my dark circles around my eyes are hereditary. I like this product.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely does nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  No irritation and now I only look like I missed one week of sleep &amp; not two!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Feels like a combination of a cream and gell. No overpowering scent. Half of a pump is enough for both eyes.  I use it more as a prevention eye cream than for correcting abilities. Use a mosturizer with spf afterwards.  Haven&#x27;t had problems with caking like other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion, works well. Amazon is cheaper than local retail.</li>
    <li> ...but - what was this product supposed to do?  It didn&#x27;t.  Despite my best and most naive hope that it would work.  Nothing.  I should know better, but I am always holding out hope that some product will work - maybe not perfect results but SOME results.</li>
    <li> It does its job for the most part; I do notice it decreases the starkness of my dark circles. However, after about a week or two of application I&#x27;ve developed red dots under my eyes (noticed immediately after application just today) and they&#x27;re still there about 14 hours later, now starting to itch... delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product if you have any sort of sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It worked for a few days, I was surprised with the results. Nothing else has ever worked for my undereye circles before.&lt;br /&gt;But after about a week, I had the WORST rash I had ever gotten on my face. It was all around my eyes, I almost looked like a raccoon. It even started to spread down my nose and around it, too.&lt;br /&gt;After it went away (after about a week or so) I decided to try it again, just in case it wasn&#x27;t this product.&lt;br /&gt;Still got the same nasty rash. I JUST got over it yesterday. It&#x27;s been about a month since I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Really burned. I have used a lot of different products (including some known to be irritating) but this one really gave an unusually intense burning sensation.  Out of curiosity, put some on my forehead and it too began to burn.  I also dries to a flaky cheap foundation cream look which as a man is not appealing to me.  I usually really like Olay and use several of their products but this one ain&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, seems to be helping</li>
    <li> Product did what it proclaimed</li>
    <li> I really like it. It not hard to use and doesnt leave any residue if you dont use too much. seems be working. your suppose to use it for 8 weeks so got another month to go but so far so good.</li>
    <li> This product is working miraculously to help minimize under eye darkness.  I&#x27;m a huge Olay fan because the products work!&#x27;  Love the a Regenerist  line.</li>
    <li> I received this through influenster, and I must say using this for 7 days and I can already see progress. The dark spots around my cheeks are fading, you must use this routinely and don&#x27;t skip a day.  I will repurchase this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m simply in love with it. it&#x27;s great for my skin, moinsturizing and it feels so good! Glad to have it!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. It is soft and doesn&#x27;t pull on the eye when you apply it. I honestly can&#x27;t say my dark circles are gone, but I know the skin around my eyes isn&#x27;t as dry as it was. I have to put warm compresses on my eyes for 5 minutes every night which makes the skin dry. So this helps and I have added it to my subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I received this product from influenster for free for testing purposes.This product is amazing just after a day or2 you can see the difference!! I will be using this stuff the rest of my life!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my skin feeling wonderful and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I would recommend it to anyone. The pro is that it can be used on any skin tone. Amazing</li>
    <li> Olay regenerist luminous dark circle cream</li>
    <li> This Olay product is amazing. I&#x27;m African American, 59 years old, and had developed dark circles under both eyes. I know the circles are age related. I started using this product 2x per day, 3 weeks ago, and the darkness has decreased by more than 50%! I have no irritation problems,the cream blends in well, and does not leave a white residue on my brown skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about two weeks and can see a little lightening around my eyes...so far so good!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Unlike other I can actually feel this one working. Tingles slightly but only for a minute or so. Definitely can tell a difference with my dark circles</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT MADE MY EYES WATER SO  TOP AND BOTTOM  IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE  EYES I WOULD NOT USE IT,  IF YOU DO NOT IT MIGHT BE GREAT FOR YOU.  L</li>
    <li> not seen the result as mention on the product</li>
    <li> Too white, doesn&#x27;t blend in and absorb at all.  Looks very obvious and iridescent under eyes,  One of the worst Olay products I&amp;#34;ve used.  Save your money..</li>
    <li> I love this product Oil of Olay has the best products out there</li>
    <li> I use this as a serum under my eye cream and it works great-</li>
    <li> Its ok I did not see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Not seeing results as indicated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month, and it in no way has reduced the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Not only does the product not work but, wrinkles around my eyes I couldn&#x27;t see yesterday look awful today!  The product cakes horribly under foundation.  Useless product!</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple of times so far and only see a small difference - hopefully continued use will provide better results.</li>
    <li> This seems to have some type of bleaching component in it. I wiped my hands on my black t-shirt and it took some of the color right out oor it. I don&#x27;t use it all the time out of concern for this.....so only once a week for me.</li>
    <li> I sometimes wake up with dark circles under my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t really found anything to battle them yet, and Regenerist Luminous isn&#x27;t doing the job for me.  Dark circles aside, I really like this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#x27;m a sucker for the hydraswirl. The futuristic look of swirled creams and gels gets me every time.  It&#x27;s fun to have on my counter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself has a shimmery quality, but rubs in nice and clear.  I don&#x27;t notice the shimmer around my eyes at all.  This is a bonus for me.  I&#x27;m not fond of shimmer under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really nice and smooth going on and after a few weeks of use, I do feel like the skin around my eyes is looking better--although I can&#x27;t specify how it looks better.  It just does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it truly battled my dark circles, I&#x27;d be over the moon.</li>
    <li> Feeling great on my eye lids.  Soft and smooth.  Feels good</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream as it starts working within a week.It just has smooth effect on the dark circles and no tingling feeling or wet look.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as I had hoped</li>
    <li> Still have dark circles but eye area much smoother . Will continue to use and will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb as well as I thought.</li>
    <li> I received a full-size product in a beauty box recently. I have been using it for a few weeks, and I am very pleased with the results. It has had one benefit that I did not expect--I have a small scar under my left eye from an allergic reaction many years ago--now this scar is barely noticeable! My fine lines and wrinkles under and around my eyes have diminished greatly. I honestly do not have a major dark circle problem, but it has improved as well. I would recommend this product for the wrinkle reduction alone. I use a very tiny amount and have not had a problem with it not absorbing adequately. I am light-skinned and have not noticed a shimmer problem as some have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Helps smooth out skin under my eye and lighten the look under my eye.</li>
    <li> loving it and lving the results. So u want to pay doctor so an so for 300.00 worth of nothing ?! this is the answer every time, Olay.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile and I&#x27;ve really been liking the way my skin looks. Absorbs quickly, brightens skin, light scent, moisturizes well and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Has not been a super winner yet, but I like the product.  I have sensitive skin and it has not been irritating.  I still have some dark circles, but it has only been two weeks.  Arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels after using it.  Hoping this product actually does what it says it will.  Time will tell!</li>
    <li> I use Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream at night with great results (it really helped with some fine wrinkles - I&#x27;m over 40), but it does not absorb well and tends to leave white residue, so in the morning I&#x27;ve been using Clinique All About Eyes that is very lightweight. This cream seemed like it could be a good cheaper alternative to Clinique and I was also hoping to reduce concealer use.    Unfortunately after the very first application I felt strong burning sensation all around the eye where cream was applied. It went away after about 10 min. and didn&#x27;t cause any visible effect, but pain is just not the best way to start the day for me. The Age Defying cream has retinol but I&#x27;ve never felt the slightest discomfort with it.    I&#x27;ve tried 2 more times and it still burned. It also didn&#x27;t do anything for the dark circles and I still had to use as much concealer as before. I wish I could return it and would strongly recommend to everyone to test it before purchasing. My skin is not very sensitive and I&#x27;ve tried many eye products before. Rarely an eye cream has such strong reaction on my skin. Extremely disappointed in this product. Packaging is very odd too, way too much plastic for such small volume.    Update: not sure what has changed (maybe or bathroom temperature - it got a bit colder) but after trying this product again recently I&#x27;ve also noticed the excessive irridescence. It looked literally like some sort of negative racoon eyes, I had to wipe it all off. Really wish I could give this 0 stars, what a bad, bad product.</li>
    <li> Wanted to buy this to try for the first time it was showing a 3.00 dollar coupon so I thought after saving the 3.00 it would be good to try went to the buy product and cannot get the 3.00 coupon to work when you get it to where I can use the 3.00 coupon I will try it</li>
    <li> I always had trouble with dark circles under my eyes; this product helped me look much younger and stress free because of how it hides the undesirable eye bags.</li>
    <li> Cant say I have noticed any difference. Disappointed</li>
    <li> After several months of use, I do notice less puffiness and dark circles than before. It&#x27;s also great to put on under makeup.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  The skin around my eyes is so much softer after just a few days of use.</li>
    <li> This product does not help in any aspect. I don&#x27;t feel anything when I put it on, and so far no effect on me at all. Also it forms a white paste under my eye cuz it doesnt seem to be easily absorbed.  It is the worst eye cream I have ever bought. Will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cream is thicker than other eye teams I have tried in the past, but hat doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
