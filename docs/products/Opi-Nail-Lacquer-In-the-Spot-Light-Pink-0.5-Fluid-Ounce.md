<li> It is a faint pink color.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that even after 3 coats, it is VERY pale pink.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s one of those nail polishes where you have to do two or three coats for it to show up, which was sort of disappointing.</li>
<li> I hate going through the hassle of returns, I just kept it, after all its OPI.</li>

    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;In the spot- light pink&amp;#34; but instead got a cream beige color with the same name? Not as pictured. I hate going through the hassle of returns, I just kept it, after all its OPI.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that even after 3 coats, it is VERY pale pink.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I will not change it for any other brand. Hope will be available in the future. Great quality.</li>
    <li> I love opi nail polish , but this one disappointed because it is totally shear on. You can barely tell there is anything on the nail. It might work good for French manicures as the pink part, but you can&#x27;t see it , it&#x27;s like a clear coat. I wanted the pink In the pic on my nail. Kinda feel misled.</li>
    <li> Love all OPI nail polish.  This is a natural color, even with two coats you can still see the while of the nails underneath.</li>
    <li> Great sheer polish that holds up well to lots of hand abuse.  Looks great, even if you&#x27;re not steady handed to apply.  Clear enough to look natural with a slight pink undertone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this nail polish before and I wanted to buy some more since mine ran out but this nail polish was not the same, it came out to be a clear coat. I will never buy from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Had quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I think this color is really pretty and subtle, although it&#x27;s not exactly what I expected. I was expecting it to be brighter. It&#x27;s one of those nail polishes where you have to do two or three coats for it to show up, which was sort of disappointing. I still like it though.</li>
    <li> Love this nail lacquer. I do not like to constantly change nail polish. I play a lot of sports and this polish color lets you wait longer to reapply.</li>
    <li> First used this color at the nail salon. My nail bed is short and may nails are short as well so I like a natural looking nail. It is a faint pink color.</li>
    <li> I like very translucent polish with a hint of pink.  This polish is VERY translucent. Even 2 coats are &amp;#34;see thru&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;If you just want to put a little shine on your nails, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> absolutely  my new favorite color can&#x27;t get enough</li>
