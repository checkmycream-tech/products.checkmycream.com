<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought the inner base would have a stronger magnet, but otherwise I like the product.</li>
    <li> I like the color and shape ... the actual magnetic parts - do not hold my pans in. I stood my palettes on the side, the next morning, they were all over the place. YIKES, it was a mess, especially since I painstakenly depotted several eyeshadows to put in this palette. But, if I lay the palette flat, all is good.</li>
    <li> The adhesive on the metal stickers didn&#x27;t stick to my shadow pans well but it could have been something I did wrong. I ended up gluing my pans onto this palette. However, if you remove the glue from the original pans and give them a swipe with alcohol I&#x27;m sure this will work just fine. I ended up getting Wet N Wild 3 pan shadows &amp; 6 pan shadows in this palette. I love this &amp; will definitely be ordering more of these ! I only gave it 3 stars because the adhesive wouldn&#x27;t stick to the Wet N Wild pans.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest invention for cosmetics ever. Just wish I knew about it sooner. This case condenses every piece of impact cosmetic you have. I am a national traveler and this could not be anymore convenient for me than these Z palettes.  Plan on buying a couple more to further condense everything. And love the patter and colors they come in. A BIG Thank You for the fast shipping too. Just in time for my next trip.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Z palettes are really great and very useful. I use mine to keep drugstore and single shadows in. I love the leopard print and the magnet on it is really strong. The only thing is that some shadows might not magnetize, but the palette comes with circle and square metal adhesives to magnetize shadows.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more. I might try to get the pro, just for extra room.</li>
    <li> Excellent palette! Am only giving 4 stars for now because I haven&#x27;t yet travelled with it, so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in a suitcase. This works perfectly for my MAC and makeup geek pan shadows. So far, those two brands are the only thing I&#x27;ve placed in there, and the magnet gds them securely!</li>
    <li> Very cute and great for storage but it didn&#x27;t bring enough magnets for the pods.</li>
    <li> This palette works great but it was not what I would consider large. If you&#x27;re looking for something the size of a Mac pro or morphe size then get the x-large</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick which was great! The pallet looks just the picture and feels sturdy. My only problem is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it closes very securely. I don&#x27;t think this would be very good for travel for that reason but for sitting safely in my makeup drawer it does wonderful!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak for putting other depotted products in here, because I bought it specifically for a bunch of Makeup Geek (MUG) eyeshadows that I bought all at once (which by the way I am a super fan of now).  The palette did exactly what I needed it to! The MUG eyeshadows are already magnetic, it seems like this palette was specifically made to go with those eyeshadows.  I love it and would buy again! I just wish it had a mirror.</li>
    <li> Love z palettes.  I only wish the magnets included were a tiny bit smaller/there were more of them. The magnet is strong adn the case is sturdy. I travel with mine and I&#x27;ve never lost a shadow due to breaking. This color was a gift for my mom, who loves hers.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with his palette. Super cute and totally functional. I will be buying more</li>
    <li> Great durable case, looking forward to getting another since I have so many eye shadows/ blushes</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money! Best magnetic holder ever! Great size and will hold so many shadows and pigments!</li>
    <li> im in love with this Z palette, is so beautiful ans sleek great for my singles makeup geek and coastal scents pans.</li>
    <li> I purchased this palette to try to slim done the amount of huge palettes I have for eyeshadow. I love the size of this palette and the fact that the entire palette is magnetic but the 10 square and 10 round sticky magnetic strips provided do not stick to the makeup pan. I had to superglue my pans to the palette. I would not purchase this palette unless you know for sure that your pans are already magnetic and will stick.</li>
    <li> I love how sturdy this custom palette is and that it has a see-through window at the top!  I&#x27;ve just started my Makeup Geek collection but so far, so good!  I&#x27;m loving their products!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I plan to order more to streamline my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought I was ordering.  But smaller than appears in pics.</li>
    <li> I own 3 other Z palettes and this one does not disappoint. Great quality, sturdy and worth the price. Speedy delivery and packed nicely. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love my z palette!! It got here very fast</li>
    <li> AWESOME PALLET!!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT MATERIAL AND AFFORDABLE</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few of the Z Palette&#x27;s over the past few months and am very happy with the quality.  They work perfectly for my MAC shadows and blushes.  No complaints, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just perfect. Wasn&#x27;t too sure on the leopard print but after receiving it in hand it&#x27;s adorable. Love it.</li>
    <li> I like this palette to depot &amp; store my single eyeshadows. I also like buying sample shadows from Indie sellers and pressing into pans , it works out so much cheaper than big brand name eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette is great, love it, wished it had a mirror in it though!</li>
    <li> It was a hassle of finding metal to glue onto my shadows because they wouldn&#x27;t stick. They give you  metal pieces in the palette but they are huge, there&#x27;s not many that come with it, and the sticky side for the shadow isn&#x27;t that great. It&#x27;s a cool concept but it&#x27;s just not worth the money for some cardboard with a magnet.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and holds all of my MakeupGeek/ Bh Cosmetics/ and MAC shadows perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of z palettes and I love them all. This design is so cute and came with a bunch of magnets in different sizes and shapes. My others only came with circle ones so having an assortment is awesome. Definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> SO pretty and easy to use and customize. Fun to depot things as well! As a result, all my stuff is together, and I can use everything as a palette, therefore getting more choices and uses of all the products I have. Also nice to shrink the size of my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> I thought i bought the largest palette but this is the second largest, it fits most of the eyeshadow i have. Its a great size.</li>
    <li> I love the concept and the way that it looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Price is about on point with other websites. It came within 2 days with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality: Seems to be very good, seems like it will hold up when I have to wipe it down from make-up. The Magnet is nice and strong as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNFORTUNATELY: It comes with some magnet stickers for the back of the pots if they don&#x27;t stick.. some cheaper pots aren&#x27;t magnetic. BUT the stickers arent sticky AT ALL! I had to glue them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT overall I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I already had a z pallet in an aqua color, and I wanted another one so I could use more products that are suck in the back of my make drawer. I love these and great price for something I use everyday. Keeps me using more make up</li>
    <li> Great quality and fits plenty single shadows. Very pleased. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love! It does the job and it&#x27;s leopard print (my signature print)! Will absolutely recommend this. I can&#x27;t wait to show it off at my MUA convention.</li>
    <li> LOVE this pallet, I keep both my MAC and Makeup Geek shadows in this and wouldn&#x27;t be without it now! I have the small size as well and plan on purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I was kind of on the fence about ordering this palette and also about the size but after reading reviews on here and on Youtube  I decided to get the large leopard palette instead of the pro palette and I&#x27;m glad I did. 1st the palette is very well made and sturdy in my opinion....it is cardboard but you can barely tell by just looking plus I couldn&#x27;t see how you could easily damage it unless you just really tried to but I guess over time I could see maybe it separating from the base but nothing you couldn&#x27;t fix with some type of glue.....plus I read that it holds about 22-23 MAC eyeshadows , well I put my coastal scents hot pots in mines which I believe to be the same size as the MAC and it actually holds 27 with no problem and slight space in between each....it does come with magnets but my shadows were already magnetic so I didn&#x27;t have to use them, I will be purchasing another one in the hot pink.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Z Palettes are so great for eye shadows. They even send some magnets for you. Leopard print is beautiful. Real Z Palette. So happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great palette for consolidating your cosmetics and it includes the magnets for unmagnetized pans. Good luck depotting your cosmetics. This is ideal for any make up junkie :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Great quality. Holds lots of shadows and it comes with magnets. Which some shadows don&#x27;t require magnets. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Love this! Fast shipping, packaged well, included several square and round magnets. Great for saving space and compacting all my single shadows. Will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It holds two of my favorite full sized Urban Decay palettes as well as a couple of random single shadows so that I can bring them with me while traveling without the bulky packaging or worrying about my shadows being broken. The magnetic base is very strong and the top is the exact height to provide adequate protection in a purse or carry on. The pattern is very cute and it comes with more than enough magnets for those pans that don&#x27;t stick on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great organizational tool: will be buying another for all the loose blushes and shadows that get lost in my huge collection of makeup.</li>
    <li> I love the z-palette! I can&#x27;t to add my shadows to it!</li>
    <li> I love this leopard makeup case, it makes me see all the colors in my collection, Instead of guessing what colour am looking for to do my makeup! I highly recommend getting one of these makeup cases! They definitely help me to organize my single eyeshadow pots.And they are so affordable and cute, I love it.</li>
    <li> The palette is durable. I fit around  around 21 small eyeshadows. I give 4 starts bcz i had to buy more magnetics for the eyeshadows. Little pricy!</li>
    <li> Love this Z-palette!! Perfect!! Just what I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> Works really well to hold a lot of make and it looks cute at the same time.</li>
    <li> Was dissapointed when i saw it has a crack</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She was happy with it, but I thought it was slightly pricey for what she got.</li>
    <li> Found THE BEST dupe to this product!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/03/z-palette-dupe-mac.html</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased this product..very well made and good quality 😀</li>
    <li> Very convenient, travel friendly. Do recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is so cute and excellent for my MUG eyeshadow pans! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This Z Palette is awesome. The leopard print is so cute and I am already going to need to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I want and need more. I love how you can depot all your items and remove clutter from your makeup. I love the colors they come in but the leopard it my favorite. I need one more for blushes.</li>
    <li> I love these, I bought two because I knew I was going to depot everything that I could.  They come with plenty of magnets.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, comes with magnetic stickers and it was packaged very well. Shipping was fast, overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, wish the magnet was a little bit stronger.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I&#x27;ve started to depot my makeup, and only purchase tins vs getting all of that bulky packaging. These cases are great. You can see what&#x27;s in them through the clear window. I love how they now have different colors to choose from. I am hooked on these! It&#x27;s making my makeup collection look so much more organized! This is the PERFECT size for keeping a lot of eyeshadows or whatever you want. When I travel now, I&#x27;m able to pick out the shadows, blush, powders etc that I&#x27;m going to use, they are all together (I have the medium size for less items)&amp; all I have to do is toss my Zpalette, foundation, mascara&amp; a few brushes...I&#x27;m good to go! Seriously, if you are a makeup hoarder&amp; know what it&#x27;s like to have to tote around a giant case, JUST for your makeup products&amp; usually end up only using a few things (so ridiculous), then this will SIMPLIFY &amp; ORGANIZE things beautifully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to get one of these and finally I have one!! I freaking love it too! Fantastic craftsmanship, no flaws.  Holds a bunch of product.  I love that it came with some magnets too since not all my pans were magnetic.  Excellent product, HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
    <li> Just what you need to get rid of bulky packaging. Stirdy, compact and pretty. Totally recommend it. I bought another one as soon as I saw the quality.</li>
    <li> Loved them they were perfect! !!</li>
    <li> Great product at an affordable price. Love the leopard print. Will definitely be buying more z palettes in the future.</li>
    <li> Came with magents for other non magnet shadow pans and is really good to hold up my makeup geek eyeshadows ❤️❤️ love it</li>
    <li> These are such space savers! I love my z palettes!</li>
    <li> Love it! Exactly what was picture and described.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I was expecting this to be a tad larger than it is, but I like the product overall.  As other reviewers have noted, I think it is made mainly out of cardboard, so I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but I have already traveled with it and it&#x27;s held up nicely.  I like the leopard print and the magnet seems to hold the pans in place really well.  My only complaint is that while the pans stay in place during travel, carrying around the pallet, etc., the pans do move around when I dip my brush in to get some product.  So I end up having to hold the pan with one hand while dipping my brush with the other hand.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it would have been nice if they would&#x27;ve made the magnet a tad stronger so I could get product on my brush using just one hand (the one holding the brush).  Overall, I think this palette is a really great idea and recommend it to anyone who is looking to consolidate and de-clutter.</li>
    <li> Perfection! I love having the patterned Z Palette because now I can tell them apart from each other.</li>
    <li> Very efficient way of storing makeup !</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Makes organizing my makeup kit so much more easy and lite.</li>
    <li> edges are peeling. :(</li>
    <li> Great for storing multiple single pan shadows!</li>
    <li> Arrived at estimated time. In good conditions. I&#x27;m glad I got this palette it is the perfect size for the few eyeshadow that I have.</li>
    <li> This was Fab! Too bad its a bit pricey otherwise I&#x27;d buy a few more.</li>
    <li> Really pretty palette , all intact and in great shape</li>
    <li> Perfect! Came in great condition &amp; I already love it for my single eyeshadow pans!</li>
    <li> Plastic top is all blurred and scratched from normal use and what not... but that is uncontrollable. Other than that, love it.</li>
    <li> I returned this, because the magnets popped right off. The thing wouldn&#x27;t even stay shut because it&#x27;s too thin for makeup to fit inside. All in all, it wasn&#x27;t a good purchase at all. A waste of time.</li>
    <li> The greatest palette EVER! i have a double sided pro mac palette and when it breaks  will buy more Z palettes because they are just leaps and bounds better</li>
    <li> Love it! High quality! I&#x27;ve bought so many of them! You won&#x27;t regret it. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!😊</li>
    <li> Liked the print of this one. Plus it was a bit cheaper than the plain black. Since I already have a plain black palette, I figured I would get a different one so that I can differentiate. Now my depotted blushed and bronzes have a pretty new home!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, comes with a good number of magnets for pans that aren&#x27;t already magnetized. What a fun way to streamline your makeup collection</li>
