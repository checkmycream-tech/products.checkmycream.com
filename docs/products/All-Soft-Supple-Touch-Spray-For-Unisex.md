      <li>You never have to worry about whether the sale hype for Redken products are true because they always are.  </li>
      <li>It is thick and brittle and although I have used the best products on it, I could never really get it to feel or look good.</li>
      <li>Instead of being stiff and brittle, it would move so beautifully.</li>
      <li>but I really wish it were fragrance free.</li>
      <li>know that going fragrance free is practically too much to ask of any body product, but I buy cosmetics for how they make my face and skin look, hair products for what they do to my hair and specialty scented lotions/sprays because of the way they smell.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser uses and recommended that I try the Redken All Soft Supple Touch Spray, but it is so lightweight, I find myself using more of the product.  </li>
      <li>It is obnoxious that all of one&#x27;s body products smell and you are screwed if the products dont have complimentary fragrances.</li>

      <li>Leaves hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>You can always trust a Redken product to do exactly what they say they will do.</li>
      <li>And it is priced much lower than Redken!</li>
      <li>It loses a star rating since my SO finds my hair more appealing without the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is really inexpensive for what you&#x27;re getting</li>
      <li>This product worked really well for me.  </li>

      <li>I will continue to use the All Soft spray until it is gone, but  I prefer the results of Pantene&#x27;s Ultimate 10 BB cream on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Just spray a little on and you can comb right through.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Came just as described, and cheaper than my hair salon! This stuff makes my hair feel amazing!</li>
    <li> im 62 with grey hair i color blonde that is horribly damaged from the color and corseness of gray. this turns my hair to silk. i can get a comb through it, and i dont just spray it on after washing, i spray it on once a week on dry hair.  my hair has never felt like this, or shined. i love redken products.</li>
    <li> I was cursed with horsetail hair. It is thick and brittle and although I have used the best products on it, I could never really get it to feel or look good. I came across this in my salon and instantly fell in love with it. My hair felt so soft and looked so healthy. Instead of being stiff and brittle, it would move so beautifully. I found that it stopped a lot of the breakage as well. Unfortunately my salon quit carrying the spray but did have all of the other All Soft products. I do use those but don&#x27;t have the same results from them that this spray gave me. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and will never go without it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and prduct.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very soft</li>
    <li> I love redken but, I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my hair with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Work as well! I recommend for all customers. 110% correct.</li>
    <li> My favorite for overprocessed hair. Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product provided with excellent, fast service.  I have course, unruley hair and using this product makes it soft as butter and for once in my life, shiney.</li>
    <li> Works great! Thought it might be greasy but it isn&#x27;t at all and really makes my hair soft!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite product in the world</li>
    <li> I like this better than the other RedKen leave in conditioners out there,  It leaves a smooth as silk clean feeling unlike the other one (Redken Smooth Lock Stay Sleek Leave In Cream for Unisex, 5 Ounce) I got which made my hair feel dirty, even if I had just washed it.  This product detangles too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> You never have to worry about whether the sale hype for Redken products are true because they always are.  This product says it provides soft and supple hair and it does not dissappoint.  You can always trust a Redken product to do exactly what they say they will do.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my wife&#x27;s hair... she uses it more than any other product.</li>
    <li> Works great. Leaves hair soft and smooth. Just spray a little on and you can comb right through. Love it. Will buy item. again.</li>

    <li> I have dry color treated hair. This product is easy to use and it makes my hair feel so soft. It adds healthy shine too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months and it really really makes my hair soft if I use it all over right before I blow-dry my hair. It is really inexpensive for what you&#x27;re getting so if you&#x27;re considering it, just try it. If you don&#x27;t like it, give it to a friend who will love you forever.</li>
    <li> This product eliminates static if sprayed on when the hair is wet. Does not make your hair feel over moisturized either. A great product that is always stocked in our house. Works well on fine hair, too.</li>
    <li> Keeps my wavy hair from over frizz.</li>
    <li> not exactly what I thought I bought but seems to be like a spray in and leave conditoner.</li>

    <li> I have very dry thick coarse hair and really needed something to bring it back to life. Didn&#x27;t do anything but weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I only use Redkin and Biologue products on my hair. My suggestion is to stop buying the cheap stuff at the grocery store and go big on either Biologue or Redkin - you won&#x27;t regret it if you like your hair. My hair is approximately 3 1/2 FT long (yes, Feet long). Spray this into your hair when it is drying for extra softness.</li>
