<li> but it breaks off way too soon even if you&#x27;re careful.  </li>
<li> I tried it straight out of the pencil on to the lid, I tried putting a base of powdered neutral eye shadow first, then applying it, just nothing seems to keep it on.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t think I will be using any other color.</li>
<li> I always used black or charcoal</li>
<li> But it also didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other liners have done in the past.</li>
<li> I have been using this for about a year now, it brings out the green in my eyes...</li>
<li> I discovered I have a serious allergy to any products with purple dye in them.  </li>
<li> Also the eyeliner lead fell out immediately, so was obviously broken before I ever got it</li>
<li> Not happy with that.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> Terrible at applying it.</li>

    <li> I discovered I have a serious allergy to any products with purple dye in them.  My eyes were extremely red and swollen within hours of application.  I cannot use.</li>
    <li> Too bad the a Bare Minerals discontinued their twist up pencil last year and switched to a gel pencil, which is softer but more staying power and doesn&#x27;t last as long (needs to be purchased more frequently).</li>
    <li> Formula changed so color really not plum and not as easy to apply</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  It goes on very smoothly for a pencil liner and the color is amazing. I was a bit hesitant to buy it online since some \\&quot;plum\\&quot; colored liners are actually just purple like a crayon.  This is beautiful rich plum color which accents my green eyes very well. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is great eyeliner.  I have been using this for about a year now, it brings out the green in my eyes... goes on smooth and lasts all day.  Love.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is the best for me to use. It goes on smoothly and stays intact.  I have given this product to my daughters and they love it as well.  So glad to find the plumb color and just to find the product.  Thank you to the company who got this to me so quickly.  Another Amazon home run!</li>
    <li> Awesome...Awesome...Awesome......the color is perfect.  I always used black or charcoal but this is my new color and I don&#x27;t think I will be using any other color. It is a dark plum and looks so pretty w/green eyes.. it works well with any eye shadow, in my opinion. The quality is awesome and goes on perfectly.  I have not had any problems at all with this.  I recommend the color and product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I cant tell if its purple or brown.  I bought purple because i like color around my eyes.  Truly looks like a brown. Not happy with that.</li>
    <li> Not in love with it, the \\&quot;plum\\&quot; looks pretty much black on and it doesn&#x27;t wear the best. But it also didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other liners have done in the past.</li>
    <li> I like the color and the way it goes on. It does bleed a bit under my eye throughout the day, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I really like the color. It glides on easily but only stays on about 2 hours. Very disappointing. There are definitely less expensive products that do a much better job and last longer, like Mabeline.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner did not come in a box so might have been used.... Also the eyeliner lead fell out immediately, so was obviously broken before I ever got it</li>
    <li> You can make the line fine for bold, it&#x27;s up to you. I have allergies to cosmetics and Bare Minerals is the only cosmetic I can wear. I normally go natural, but I can also use Bare minerals and look natural also. The Plum color is great for my green eyes. It makes them look a lot brighter. Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-None&lt;br /&gt;Who is it for? Anyone who wears eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Love love this makeup. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I wear this every day and it stays on for my 12 hr nursing shifts.  The best makeup hands down</li>
    <li> This is in no way waterproof. It wears off within just a couple hours. I tried it straight out of the pencil on to the lid, I tried putting a base of powdered neutral eye shadow first, then applying it, just nothing seems to keep it on. Bummer. The color is pretty though.</li>
    <li> Always keep coming back to this color.</li>
    <li> I am what you would call a make up noob. Terrible at applying it. But this eyeliner is sooo easy! Goes on smoothly and last all day long. Also easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> Nice pencil but it breaks off way too soon even if you&#x27;re careful.  Very pretty color and lasts long too.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes so was happy when this came out.  Then Bare Minerals stopped making it so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It did not come boxed but other than that it was fine.  Came when promised too.</li>
    <li> Replaced the one I used up.  Love it.</li>
