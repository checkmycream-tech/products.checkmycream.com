### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The pump gave out the perfect amount of wash for me.</li>
      <li>For a guy the best part is the smell is not a perfume and does not linger.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve especially loved their shampoos.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been great for every use.  </li>
      <li>good product, and my college-aged daughter who used most of it reported that it is a top-notch product.</li>
      <li>the body wash provide a good lather?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll consider it every winter from here on out though, since it does a good job.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes fairly well for a cleanser, and (as well it should)</li>
      <li>I am no expert on botanical matters, but I know that papaya is the source of papain, a fairly aggressive meat tenderizer.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer, even though the winter air is fairly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>First of all, the smell of papaya and pineapple is delicious.</li>
      <li>But when I get a hankering for a pleasant smelling body wash, I&#x27;m glad I have it on hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to be a really nice smelling product as I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and really liked it, however, this wasn&#x27;t very appealing to me at all.  </li>
      <li>The Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Body Wash goes on smoothly, and does a great job as a cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Wash smells good and works even better, smoothing and hydrating the skin.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice but does not perfume you up.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is handy and the soap lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>The good thing is if you like the smell of ripe papaya, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
      <li>Although this product smelled nice, family members who used it broke out in a rash.</li>
      <li>There wasn&#x27;t a nice smell to it and the product itself was rather watery, and as I said \\&quot;disappointing\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The aroma is nice, and we have no complaints.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate is soukaina (refreshing, exhilarating).</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this body wash and was hoping it would be a great moisturizing wash.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>The pump is really good, it neither squirts aggressively nor drips, so it&#x27;s easy to control the amount of soap you get.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still an excellent, all natural product.  </li>
      <li>It lathers fairly well and smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>I would have liked it more if it was more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice but it didn&#x27;t seem any better than most brands out there.</li>
      <li>This product is good for the environment and boasts many animal-testing free ingredients.</li>
      <li>noticed my skin was brighter and very smooth after each use.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but not too strong.</li>
      <li>The top of the pump has a chip out of it, but still works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering like many scented body washes.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin nicely exfoliated and comfortably moisturized; I&#x27;ve found I can use this &amp; skip the after-bath lotion</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;It is a great towel, exfoliating but much softer than loofah.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, Nature&#x27;s Gate is a better moisturizer than Dove?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think I tend to apply more soap looking for suds which is a downside.&lt;br /&gt;Strange to say for this soap</li>
      <li>On an exfoliating pad, it feels silky and doesn&#x27;t generate too many suds, so no suds run into my eyes.  </li>
      <li>scent is lovely.</li>
      <li>Which body wash do you like better, Dove or Nature&#x27;s Gate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like the papaya body wash better.</li>
      <li>This is a nice lightly scented body wash.  </li>
      <li>This is a lovely body wash that can be used as bubble bath as well.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m ok with it.  </li>
      <li>I have used many Nature&#x27;s Gate products for over 25 years.</li>
      <li>Just one more thing to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they love the fruity papaya scent.</li>
      <li>I love tropical fragrances so decided to give this papaya fragrance I try.</li>
      <li>I love how the wash gives you a good clean and moisturizes the skin without sudsing up to extremes, too, meaning it rinses off cleanly.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and the soap lathers nicely.</li>
      <li>It has a mild nice fruit scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a very sweet smell of an almost overripe/fermented/rotten fruit.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and coconut-like, nothing overwhelming.</li>
      <li>And the pump is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t clog.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents,</li>
      <li>It is a good time of year to test the claims of a high moisture body wash.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it smelled a whole lot like papaya, but it does smell good and sweet.</li>
      <li>It takes a lot of the product to work up a lather, so you will probably go through this more quickly than others.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t drying, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;overly\\&quot; moisturize and has a soft, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>so you can enjoy the skin nurturing benefits guilt-free.</li>
      <li>Secondly, it cleanses and adds great moisture to my skin, without it being greasy.</li>
      <li>It washes well and feels smooth.</li>
      <li>She received a free bottle of Nature&#x27;s Gate via the Amazon Vine program.</li>
      <li>It did not make me itch as some cheap body washes do</li>
      <li>In this case, I&#x27;m happy the smell didn&#x27;t linger, as I&#x27;m not a big fan of it.</li>
      <li>The product has a great smell, and that might be enough for me.</li>
      <li>I like the idea of natural products and this is a good one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It gets me clean.</li>
      <li>You get clean.</li>
      <li>, my wife liked it enough that she bought some more.  </li>
      <li>but I assume most are more to the natural side</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t like sweet smells, stay away from this.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve ever smelled ripe papaya, it has a sweet, earthy bouquet.</li>
      <li>It seems to me that this suggests rubbing papaya extract all over your body isn&#x27;t such a good idea.</li>
      <li>The body wash ingredients are:  water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultain, sodium cocoyl isethionate, glycerin, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, polysorbate 20, carica papaya fruit extract, pineapple fruit extract, sodium hyaluronate, shea butter, sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, soybean oil, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ginkgo biloba leaf extract, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, glyceryl undecylenate, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, citric acid, and fragrance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it really works as advertised (except for some of the more esoteric claims)and</li>
      <li>/&gt;The smell is not unpleasant, not quite a full blown fruit basket but close to there.</li>
      <li>but this is not an offensive smell at all, and it fades fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t consider it as having any extraordinary moisturizing powers, but I do think my skin enjoys the nutrients it provides.</li>
      <li>This is a pleasant body wash with a nice subtle scent.</li>
      <li>Did an excellent job overall, lasted a long time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to more concentrated soaps that really lather, and in my estimation, I have to use about 6 times as much of this to feel fully clean -</li>
      <li>it is free of phthalates, parabens, and sulfates, which have been shown in some medical studies to be powerful endocrine disruptors (most of which have estrogenic effects--leading to weight gain and increased breast cancer risk).</li>
      <li>what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s also not tested on animals and contains no palm oil</li>
      <li>I think that I would have preferred a different kind besides papaya.  </li>
      <li>soap is more natural.  </li>
      <li>It smelled like fresh papaya and not like some chemically</li>
      <li>/&gt;Summary: Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Wash is refreshing with a natural scent</li>
      <li>applied directly with the hands, it&#x27;s got a rich smooth texture.  </li>
      <li>It says you should right on the bottle, I&#x27;m not making this</li>
      <li>, there&#x27;s a papaya right on the bottle, but the product doesn&#x27;t smell like papaya to me, it smells like candy.</li>
      <li>If you are one of those people who just doesn&#x27;t feel right without \\&quot;lots o&#x27; lather\\&quot;, then, you might not like this</li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate struck me as a very pure brand of bath/body product.</li>
      <li>hypoallergenic, natural ingredients and pleasant enough scent!</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this body wash is up to Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s usual standard - excellent texture and feel, rinses clean and moisturizes reasonably well -</li>
      <li>upside on this soap is it is very gentle.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about the ingredient list (not disclosed on the Amazon product page, but available in several of this product&#x27;s reviews).  </li>
      <li>Overall, I like it but don&#x27;t love it and do recommend it as a quality product.</li>
      <li>The stuff smells like coconuts to me, and the first time I used it I felt like</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Americans have this facsination with lather.  if you see a lot of bubbles, then the soap is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some soap makers actually add things to soap to make it lather more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is more natural.  There is some lather, but, not nearly as much as other soaps.  If you are one of those people who just doesn&#x27;t feel right without \\&quot;lots o&#x27; lather\\&quot;, then, you might not like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second comment I have about this soap is that it requires a washcloth to work well.  Yes, you can use a pouf or a loofa too.  It says you should right on the bottle, I&#x27;m not making this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other liquid soaps without a washcloth, I don&#x27;t feel using a washcloth is very sanitary or environmental.  Just one more thing to wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other regards it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you could use it without an applicator (sponge, cloth, pouf) then I would give it a higher rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/29:  the bottle now empty, my wife liked it enough that she bought some more.  Did an excellent job overall, lasted a long time.  So I will upgrade the rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love tropical fragrances so decided to give this papaya fragrance I try. The upside on the fragrance is it is subtle and pleasant; but for me a little too subtle.  If you are worried about being overpowered by the scent, no worries.  But if you are looking for a whiff of tropical fragrance, you have to really whiff hard.&lt;br /&gt;The upside on this soap is it is very gentle.  My skin is sensitive and I did not react at all to the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;The soap consistency is a little different.  The description on the product title is \\&quot;velvet\\&quot; and that fits.  The soap is not sudsy.  For me I miss foaming up.  This soap stays in liquid form and the thickness and smoothness of the soap could be described like \\&quot;velvet\\&quot;.  I think I tend to apply more soap looking for suds which is a downside.&lt;br /&gt;Strange to say for this soap but every upside has a downside! Subtle fragrance but too light.  Velvet smooth but not sudsy enough.  But one upside remains:  hypoallergenic, natural ingredients and pleasant enough scent!</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be a really nice smelling product as I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and really liked it, however, this wasn&#x27;t very appealing to me at all.  There wasn&#x27;t a nice smell to it and the product itself was rather watery, and as I said \\&quot;disappointing\\&quot;.  Would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It is a good time of year to test the claims of a high moisture body wash. This product is good for the environment and boasts many animal-testing free ingredients. The scent is light and coconut-like, nothing overwhelming. In fact I would like more scent (but not more coconut scent!). There is no fruity smell with this, despite the Papaya in the title. It takes a lot of the product to work up a lather, so you will probably go through this more quickly than others. As for it&#x27;s moisture skin saving claims, no better or worse than others. Too bad!</li>
    <li> My wife, Yumi, likes [[ASIN:B002AMUIBM Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Wash]] better than her previous body wash, [[ASIN:B000NFB8S0 Dove Deep Moisture]]. She received a free bottle of Nature&#x27;s Gate via the Amazon Vine program. I interviewed Yumi after a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was your first impression?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The smell was natural. It smelled like fresh papaya and not like some chemically perfume.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, does Dove smell like perfume?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yes, Dove has a stronger fragrance that stays on my skin. Nature&#x27;s Gate didn&#x27;t leave a papaya smell on my skin after my shower.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the body wash provide a good lather?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It lathered really well, but I used my towel.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, the [[ASIN:B000CSDDDG Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel]]. You recommended that last year on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;It is a great towel, exfoliating but much softer than loofah.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else did you like about Nature&#x27;s Gate body wash?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I noticed my skin was brighter and very smooth after each use.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Nature&#x27;s Gate is a better moisturizer than Dove?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Not really, after using the papaya wash I had to put lotion on my legs and arms. My skin is very dry. With Dove I don&#x27;t need to put on lotion after my shower.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m confused. Which body wash do you like better, Dove or Nature&#x27;s Gate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I like the papaya body wash better. Nature&#x27;s Gate is soukaina (refreshing, exhilarating). Can you look up the word? It is hard to translate. You might try &#x60;sappari&#x27; (refreshed, neat), too.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Wash is refreshing with a natural scent but you might still need some lotion after your shower if you have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Five stars.</li>
    <li> This is an opaque body wash and therefore doesn&#x27;t offer much moisturization, but it isn&#x27;t too bad. It lathers fairly well and smells pretty good. I didn&#x27;t think it smelled a whole lot like papaya, but it does smell good and sweet. I would have liked it more if it was more moisturizing. My skin felt dry after I got out of the shower and I don&#x27;t usually have that problem with my usual brand.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant body wash with a nice subtle scent. It gets me clean.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely body wash that can be used as bubble bath as well. It is a completely animal-friendly company (doesn&#x27;t test or use animal products) so you can enjoy the skin nurturing benefits guilt-free.</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Moisture Body Wash smells good and works even better, smoothing and hydrating the skin.  I&#x27;ve used mine for about a month &amp; it has made a noticeable difference. I had a patch of uneven tanning on my forearms that is gone completely and I have no doubt that this Body Wash is the reason why.  Other washes have left my skin dry and itchy, but not this one.  It leaves skin nicely exfoliated and comfortably moisturized; I&#x27;ve found I can use this &amp; skip the after-bath lotion routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list helps explain why this seems to work so well:  papaya and pineapple for fruit acid exfoliation; shea butter, apricot kernel oil, almond oil, soybean oil, glycerine, and Vitamin E for natural moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like what&#x27;s NOT in it:  it is free of phthalates, parabens, and sulfates, which have been shown in some medical studies to be powerful endocrine disruptors (most of which have estrogenic effects--leading to weight gain and increased breast cancer risk). Definitely ingredients to avoid, but, if you read labels, you&#x27;ll see that most body washes DO contain these chemicals.  Kudos to Nature&#x27;s Gate for making this Wash without these kamikaze toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended; I will DEFINITELY buy this again!</li>
    <li> The Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya Velvet Body Wash goes on smoothly, and does a great job as a cleanser.  The aroma is nice, and we have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews that are this short, but, frankly, there&#x27;s not much else to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product, and my college-aged daughter who used most of it reported that it is a top-notch product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lightly scented body wash.  I like the idea of natural products and this is a good one.  It lathers well.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me.  Also seems to moisturize.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> The product has a great smell, and that might be enough for me. However, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for what it claims to do, which is hypermoisturize your skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard enough to find paraben free liquid cleaners...that alone becomes a big selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and has less (or potentially less harmful) chemical ingredients than most brands. Unfortunately, unless you buy homemade or make you own in small fresh batches, that&#x27;s pretty much the best you can hope for on the commercial market. It moisturizes fairly well for a cleanser, and (as well it should) it cleanses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s also not tested on animals and contains no palm oil (the harvesting of palm is depleting the natural habitat of orangutans).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my children use this and they love the fruity papaya scent.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash because it makes a gentle lather rather than sudsing too much, which indicates to me it has less harsh chemicals. It has a mild nice fruit scent.  I don&#x27;t recognize what alot of the ingredients are but I assume most are more to the natural side and I generally like Nature&#x27;s Gate products. The portion is huge and lasts a long time. Overall, I like it but don&#x27;t love it and do recommend it as a quality product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use body wash, preferring artisan soaps. I like other Nature&#x27;s Gate products, so thought I would give this a try. It smells nice, but not too strong. It washes well and feels smooth. The pump makes this really convenient and there is no soggy lump of soap that one often finds in the shower...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle arrived slightly damaged. The top of the pump has a chip out of it, but still works. Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag in the box, because it leaked a little. It still works so I&#x27;m ok with it.  I would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash.  I don&#x27;t generally care for fruity scents, but this one is not overpowering and has a smooth creamy smell to it too.  It did not make me itch as some cheap body washes do and I would recommend it for anyone with dry/sensitive skin who likes fruity scents.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t drying, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;overly\\&quot; moisturize and has a soft, pleasant scent. My skin feels clean and the soap lathers nicely.</li>
    <li> I decided to switch to a different type of body wash, in order to cleanse my body of toxins and bad ingredients in my personal hygiene products. Nature&#x27;s Gate struck me as a very pure brand of bath/body product. First of all, the smell of papaya and pineapple is delicious. Secondly, it cleanses and adds great moisture to my skin, without it being greasy. I was surprised that the product had a gel consistency, instead of being more like a mousse or thick, soapy consistency. I feel like I am feeding my body, whenever I use it. This is definitely a body wash I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by how much I like this cleanser.  The scent is delicate, fresh, and not a fake citrusy smell.  It&#x27;s noticeable without being overpowering like a lot of body washes are.  I love how the wash gives you a good clean and moisturizes the skin without sudsing up to extremes, too, meaning it rinses off cleanly.  I&#x27;ve used this on my back scrubber, in a pouf, just on my hands, and even for shaving in the shower and it&#x27;s been great for every use.  The bottle is handy and the soap lasts forever.  Right now I&#x27;ve used about 20% of the bottle after nearly 3 weeks of daily showering.  The body wash claims to leave your skin shinier, but I confess I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the brightness of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have to admit upfront that I&#x27;m partial to Nature&#x27;s Gate products and have bought many of them in the past. This one is somewhat disappointing, but is still worthy for those that like scented body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this body wash is up to Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s usual standard - excellent texture and feel, rinses clean and moisturizes reasonably well - it does have one flaw that really bothers me. The smell. I know, you might think what do you expect, there&#x27;s a papaya right on the bottle, but the product doesn&#x27;t smell like papaya to me, it smells like candy. This is not a huge deal, since the scent fades quickly and you will not smell like a box of candy after your shower, but it does bother me a bit in use. I prefer a less sweet scent in my personal hygiene products. That said, it works quite well. It doesn&#x27;t foam up excessively (in fact it may not foam enough for some)but I prefer a low foaming body wash. The pump is really good, it neither squirts aggressively nor drips, so it&#x27;s easy to control the amount of soap you get. As a moisturizer it works gently, i.e. you don&#x27;t feel greased up like with some other moisturizing washes. That may not be enough for some, but I find it just right, since I prefer a nearly dry feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it really works as advertised (except for some of the more esoteric claims)and the only aspect that would keep me from buying it again is the scent.</li>
    <li> The plan was to pick this up and try it for a few days, then put it in the guest bathroom so that the visiting family could have something nice to shower with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve tried this, no way.  It&#x27;s all mine.  I&#x27;m not sharing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents, but this is not an offensive smell at all, and it fades fairly quickly.  It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser and it is moisturizing, so now I use it on my face and I don&#x27;t need a moisturizer, even though the winter air is fairly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied directly with the hands, it&#x27;s got a rich smooth texture.  On an exfoliating pad, it feels silky and doesn&#x27;t generate too many suds, so no suds run into my eyes.  And the pump is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been thrilled by Nature&#x27;s Gate products in the past, but this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this body wash and was hoping it would be a great moisturizing wash.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lovely. It&#x27;s not overpowering like many scented body washes. It&#x27;s a very fresh, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a moisturizing wash.  My skin is always dry and this wash seemed to make it drier (which is the case with most brands of body wash).&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was unimpressed.  The scent is nice but it didn&#x27;t seem any better than most brands out there.</li>
    <li> Although this product smelled nice, family members who used it broke out in a rash. I am no expert on botanical matters, but I know that papaya is the source of papain, a fairly aggressive meat tenderizer. It seems to me that this suggests rubbing papaya extract all over your body isn&#x27;t such a good idea. If you have sensitive skin, you might want to steer clear of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I use quite a few Nature&#x27;s Gate products, from shampoo to lotion. I generally don&#x27;t use things that have much of an odor to them, but I was curious about this Papaya body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever smelled ripe papaya, it has a sweet, earthy bouquet. However, slightly over ripe papaya starts smelling like rot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully this body washed smells like just-ripe papaya. Every time I use it I get an aftersmell of chocolate, almost. Not sure why, but that&#x27;s what my nose tells me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used this everyday since getting it because, like I said, I&#x27;m not big on odors. But when I get a hankering for a pleasant smelling body wash, I&#x27;m glad I have it on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t consider it as having any extraordinary moisturizing powers, but I do think my skin enjoys the nutrients it provides. I especially like using it after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a middle-of-the-road body wash for me.</li>
    <li> I have used many Nature&#x27;s Gate products for over 25 years. I&#x27;ve especially loved their shampoos. When I saw this body wash, the name alone drew me in. Papaya Velvet just sounds so decadent! I expected a stronger scent, but it&#x27;s more subtle and mild than I thought it would be. It leaves my skin feeling soft and nurished, which is what you expect from a body wash. I&#x27;m just slightly disappointed that I have to use so much of it. I&#x27;m used to more concentrated soaps that really lather, and in my estimation, I have to use about 6 times as much of this to feel fully clean - even compared to other all-natural, organic products. I always believe that less is more when it comes to cleaning products, both household and personal. Cost per use in my estimation is a little high for my family. Hope they consider a reformulation.</li>
    <li> This product is ridiculously overpriced and there&#x27;s no evidence that it&#x27;s any more effective than anything you can buy at your local store.  There&#x27;s nothing special about the ingredient list (not disclosed on the Amazon product page, but available in several of this product&#x27;s reviews).  Don&#x27;t be fooled into spending extra money on Nature&#x27;s Gate hype.</li>
    <li> This body wash is similar in moisturizing quality to Philosophy (my current favorite) body washes. I didn&#x27;t particularly notice exfoliating results, as mentioned on the packaging. The pump gave out the perfect amount of wash for me. Didn&#x27;t feel like anything was getting wasted, but didn&#x27;t have to pump twice. It has a very sweet smell of an almost overripe/fermented/rotten fruit. The good thing is if you like the smell of ripe papaya, you&#x27;ll love this. If you don&#x27;t like sweet smells, stay away from this. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your body - there&#x27;s just one big burst of smell when you initially lather up, and it dissipates fairly quickly. In this case, I&#x27;m happy the smell didn&#x27;t linger, as I&#x27;m not a big fan of it. I would prefer a different scent, but otherwise, the wash is decent and gets the job done it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This body wash was a major disappointment. Reminded me of dish washing liquid. I would pass this up and spend a few more dollars on well known name brands that can deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the smell of this body wash it&#x27;s still an excellent, all natural product.  The smell of the product is a minor complaint.  I think that I would have preferred a different kind besides papaya.  What else can really be said about a body wash?  It does it&#x27;s job.  However, the use of all natural ingredients makes a difference to some.  As for myself, I enjoy using as many all natural products as possible.  The pump is a bonus as well.  Nonetheless, the product is a little steep on it&#x27;s price, but that is to be expected with most natural products.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this body wash actually \\&quot;brightens dull skin,\\&quot; as mentioned; I didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was exceptionally dull to begin with, and I don&#x27;t feel like the skin in question is any more or less dull now.  It did seem like my dry winter skin stayed away for longer when I used the body wash.  The stuff smells like coconuts to me, and the first time I used it I felt like a tropical goddess.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is HDPE--#2 plastic.  The body wash ingredients are:  water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultain, sodium cocoyl isethionate, glycerin, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, polysorbate 20, carica papaya fruit extract, pineapple fruit extract, sodium hyaluronate, shea butter, sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, soybean oil, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ginkgo biloba leaf extract, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, glyceryl undecylenate, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, citric acid, and fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of stinky perfumed soaps. So I was unsure when I decided to try this.  The winters here are dry. This year seemed dryer than most and I wanted to try something other than slathering on something after I washed up.  So after reading the info on this product, I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. It&#x27;s not a substitute for lotions or other things if you have cracked skin, but it does a great job in not drying out your skin like typical soaps.  You will not feel slimy or moisturized either. Call it skin neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not unpleasant, not quite a full blown fruit basket but close to there. For a guy the best part is the smell is not a perfume and does not linger. Either in the washroom or on your skin.  So you get a little more than &#x27;walking down the produce aisle&#x27;  but not in a bad way and you don&#x27;t reek afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it works as advertised. You get clean. Smells nice but does not perfume you up.  You will notice a difference in your skin tone and dryness, but if it is winter or you have very dry skin you&#x27;ll still need to treat that in some other way.  Bang for your buck? Average. It&#x27;s not overly expensive for this kind of of product, but it&#x27;s not your local drug store aloe liquid soap either. I think I&#x27;ll consider it every winter from here on out though, since it does a good job.</li>
