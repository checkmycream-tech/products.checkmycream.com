      <li>my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Been wearing it for 20 or more years.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the smell of this perfume.  </li>
      <li>I used to be able to buy at Marshall Fields/Macys etc., but no one carries it anymore</li>
      <li>Moschino is my all time favorite scent</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance and love that you always have it in stock.</li>
      <li>I wonder if the opening is tinier (creating more force) thus giving me more than I want when I apply it.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume..</li>
      <li>I was thoroughly satisfied with the promptness of the shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing this scent, and am so glad I can now purchase it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments of this scent.</li>
      <li>going to buy more as I use it every day..</li>
      <li>Excellent price $$$ for this item, not so easy to find in local stores, very reasonable prices (S&amp;H)</li>
      <li>Is there free shipping to return</li>
      <li>So, I thank you, Amazon, for being there for customers like me, who still enjoy this scent, but have difficulty finding it.</li>
      <li>It was the original like always.</li>
      <li>not all flowery and sickly sweet.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh</li>
      <li>I was so excited worried it was not the same ,but it still smells so sexy as I remember it..love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I have paid less at other sites but any price is worth it for me because it smells awesome!!  </li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Very different and unique!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a large bottle</li>
      <li>/&gt;Also, on the toilette spray that I bought, one pump allows too much of the fragrance to escape.  </li>
      <li>My wife really loves Moschino for Women.  </li>
      <li>The original is the only scent I like.</li>
      <li>It was a great deal less than other online dealers.  </li>
      <li>The shipper was very prompt and the product was brand new, as stated.</li>
      <li>Give it out to your love, she&#x27;ll enjoy the soft, subtle scent!</li>
      <li>In the future, when trying a new purfume, get the sample size first.    </li>
      <li>This latest bottle seems to have a slightly different fragrance, though it&#x27;s hard to tell, because as the seller points out, lots of things influence the way a fragrance smells.  </li>
      <li>At one time, only Neimon Marcus and other high end stores carried it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell AT ALL!....It was like if I didn&#x27;t spray anything on. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Moschino is a very fragrant, deliciously yummy eau de toilette. Nice fragrance--blend of the exotic orient and light, fragrant flowers and fruits! Very different and unique!</li>
    <li> I get compliments when wearing it.  Too bad it isn&#x27;t being made any longer!</li>
    <li> It was the original like always. Great! Been wearing it for 20 or more years.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this purfume at all!!! The problem is once you open it, it is non returnable. In the future, when trying a new purfume, get the sample size first.    Guess I will put it out at the next yard sale.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves Moschino for Women.  Got it for her for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  Give it out to your love, she&#x27;ll enjoy the soft, subtle scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing this scent, and am so glad I can now purchase it on Amazon. At one time, only Neimon Marcus and other high end stores carried it. One day, I called every NM store and started to purchase some of their Moschino For Women stock as they were no longer going to carry it. So, I thank you, Amazon, for being there for customers like me, who still enjoy this scent, but have difficulty finding it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Moschino since it came out in the U.S.  Now, of course, it has to be ordered online to find it.  This latest bottle seems to have a slightly different fragrance, though it&#x27;s hard to tell, because as the seller points out, lots of things influence the way a fragrance smells.  I do know that it comes out smelling stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, on the toilette spray that I bought, one pump allows too much of the fragrance to escape.  I wonder if the opening is tinier (creating more force) thus giving me more than I want when I apply it.</li>
    <li> Moschino is the perfect fragrance for those of us who enjoy a more &#x27;spice&#x27; and NO FLOWER smell.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have looked for this perfume for along time I used it in my 20&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s stopped caring it. So when I seen Moschino on amazon I was so excited worried it was not the same ,but it still smells so sexy as I remember it..love this perfume. .... going to buy more as I use it every day..</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years.  Love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I Love This Fragance&lt;br /&gt;If somebody ask me about my prefered parfum, my answer: its This Moschino&lt;br /&gt;I want to know if The Parfum of this fragance be onlyne store, this is eau of cologne I want a Parfum&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Elena Blanco</li>
    <li> This product is not authenic. I have used Moschino by Moschino for years and this is an impostor.</li>
    <li> Great scent.  Perfect winter time scent that I always get compliments on.  The original is the only scent I like.</li>
    <li> USED IT FOR YEARS.  M YEA  LO9OJ OO L  LPOP O O  OP OP LP OP P P P P P</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Sorry I ordered it from FragranceNet as it is $5 cheaper&lt;br /&gt;at PerfumeWorldwide.com.  Is there free shipping to return&lt;br /&gt;to Fragrancenet??? I ordered 2 bottles so this would be a $10 savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance, and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Get many compliments!</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  I used to be able to buy at Marshall Fields/Macys etc., but no one carries it anymore so I have to buy it online.  Everyone comments on how nice I smell.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments of this scent. I can be in an elevator and people I don&#x27;t know will tell me how beautiful my perfume is.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and love that you always have it in stock.</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume. not all flowery and sickly sweet. hard to find in stores anymore so glory to thee, thy internet</li>
    <li> Good product and on time</li>
    <li> my wife loves this and was happy she could buy this from the internet as we had looked around here and was led to believe this product was no longer available..</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.. It is very  hard to find so I was happy that Amazon carries it.  I have paid less at other sites but any price is worth it for me because it smells awesome!!  I get a ton of compliments whenever I wear it!!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this! It&#x27;s my favorite perfume and it had been discontinued(?) I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. It smells fresh, it&#x27;s a large bottle and I&#x27;m super happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years. It is MY smell! It is very hard to find these days and out of stock everywhere but here!</li>
    <li> I hope Italy never stops making this scent!</li>
    <li> Excellent price $$$ for this item, not so easy to find in local stores, very reasonable prices (S&amp;H), I will buy this item again. I alwas trust the name \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; as a seller. No porblems Whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Moschino is my all time favorite scent and I got tons of compliments on it. Still get compliments on this bottle purchased, but didn&#x27;t have the same scent as in the past.  Weaker, or not quite the same.  Not sure why it wouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the smell of this perfume.  It was a great deal less than other online dealers.  Can&#x27;t find this in stores.  It lasts all day long but is not overwhelming.  Sort of a spice of the Orient smell, reminds me of Opium.  I will be ordering this again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I was thoroughly satisfied with the promptness of the shipment. Item was exactly as described. Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for about 15 years. If they discontinue it I don&#x27;t know what I will do. It would be a sin if I didn&#x27;t have it anymore. It is the best in the world.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years, since buying it overseas.  I get compliments everytime I wear it and I do mean everytime.  The shipper was very prompt and the product was brand new, as stated.</li>
