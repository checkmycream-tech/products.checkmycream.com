      <li>I was very happy to receive my order in a very short time frame and in tact.</li>
      <li>This product was okay.</li>
      <li>The silicon comes out really easy.  </li>
      <li>, I WILL RECOMMEND SMOOTH TRANSACTION.</li>
      <li>beads are perfect came in 2 containers i would recommend to ppl very gd deal beads last for awhile to!</li>
      <li>Overall, I liked it.</li>
      <li>My duaghter and I had fun styling our hair with them.</li>
      <li>SUPER STRONG, THEY HOLD STRONG, THE COLOR LAST LONGER THEN</li>
      <li>and I thought they would slide right out</li>
      <li>Very cheap, as well, and the same quality of bead you could get from your beauty supply store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna buy more in the future,</li>

      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>They are easy to work with, and the inside gives a better grip that prevents them from slipping down the root of the clients real hair root.</li>
      <li>They are exactly what I thought they would be so far.</li>
      <li>Once the aluminum beads are bent too many times (3) you have to either cut your hair off or use a nail tool to cut the darn thing in half.</li>
      <li>Love the beads ill order more soon</li>
      <li>It will take a little longer to receive it, because it come from China, but it&#x27;s OK with me .</li>

      <li>They were exactly the color that I ordered and they were here not only on time</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product so far.</li>
      <li>Get a ziplock bag ready for when you open it up.</li>
      <li>oh and the only thing I&#x27;ll have to complain about, if I have to is the packaging but other then that it came quick</li>
      <li>and when I put them in it didn&#x27;t last long or hold much hair.these were bigger and cheaper</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I needed to constantly change the feathers I have in my black hair.</li>

    <li> Very good products and seller made it easy to understand on colors and sizes!  I recommend it to anyone who need this type of products!</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought some at sallys for $30!!and they were so small! and when I put them in it didn&#x27;t last long or hold much hair.these were bigger and cheaper and it had a good grip on my hair. I loved these I&#x27;m gonna buy more in the future, oh and the only thing I&#x27;ll have to complain about, if I have to is the packaging but other then that it came quick and I love them !!</li>
    <li> These are great if you follow the instructions to creating longer hair, they&#x27;re secure upon clamping them the right way!  Especially since they are lined!</li>
    <li> I used the aluminum beads before and they practically ripped my hair out. These beads are lined with silicon and they even grip better for a malaysian weave. I also believe they are easier to use, because I took them out without assistance. Once the aluminum beads are bent too many times (3) you have to either cut your hair off or use a nail tool to cut the darn thing in half. DO NOT USE ALUMINUM LINED BEADS IN YOUR HAIR...which are usually sold at Sally&#x27;s. It is not worth it.  I used these on a client who has oily hair and they stayed put for her too!</li>
    <li> I was concerned with how small they are because I had bigger beads in before but these work great! I like the silicone inside. I would order these again.</li>
    <li> beads are perfect came in 2 containers i would recommend to ppl very gd deal beads last for awhile to!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to receive my order in a very short time frame and in tact. Furthermore, the product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> good item they held up well . I have thin hair and I thought they would slide right out but they didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> these work great for feathers in the hair</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say. I ordered these. Arrived in a normal shipping time frame. They are exactly what I thought they would be so far. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the product so far.</li>
    <li> These are good quality beads and held my hair in place securely. They did not crack and stood up to the itip fusion hair process.</li>
    <li> The beads are as expected. When I started noticing they were not here I reread and noticed they say shipping will be slow. but they ARE GREAT beads.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I needed to constantly change the feathers I have in my black hair. They are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected...came in the allotted time. The feathers stay in the hair, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage it like the ones without the silicon. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Love the beads ill order more soon</li>
    <li> Love them great will be ordering more</li>
    <li> They do what they are suppose to do.</li>
    <li> What a great value!!  I only wish it came in a small reusable container.  Item was shipped in a small non re-closeable bag.</li>
    <li> I give it t stars. Product was exactly what I was hoping for. The end result using these micro links was amazing.</li>

    <li> SUPER STRONG, THEY HOLD STRONG, THE COLOR LAST LONGER THEN OTHERS, VERY GOOD PRODUCT, I WILL RECOMMEND SMOOTH TRANSACTION. THANK YOU:)</li>
    <li> These will work in a pinch but you get what you pay for.  The silicon comes out really easy.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> They work very well. My duaghter and I had fun styling our hair with them. Looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
    <li> These micro rings are perfect for better sized amounts of pre tip hair extensions. They are easy to work with, and the inside gives a better grip that prevents them from slipping down the root of the clients real hair root. They last months longer than the mirco rings w/o the inner lining. Great seller, product always arives quickly, and is a way better deal than the hair stores! they chare aprox $20 for only 50 piece rings. Buy these, I just did.</li>
    <li> This product is just what I want. It will take a little longer to receive it, because it come from China, but it&#x27;s OK with me .</li>
    <li> I love these they work perfectly for my fine hair keeping my weft extensions in place for weeks.  I will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> item took a long time to arrive but products was as described</li>
    <li> This product was okay. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because of the packaging. Overall, I liked it.</li>
    <li> Nothing was damaged or broken. They were exactly the color that I ordered and they were here not only on time but they were here early. :D</li>
    <li> Prefect for my halloween costume!I&#x27;m putting feathers in my hair.</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I needed. The silicone lining was perfect and isn&#x27;t as damaging and doesn&#x27;t pull my natural have at all.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
