    <li> Great product.  Smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have fine hair and was looking for something that would give me body and keep my scalp healthy. It smells pretty good and makes my hair feel soft but I don&#x27;t feel like its doing much for my scalp or giving my hair body but for a shampoo I like it. Probably will not buy again.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars For This Shampoo ! I love this shampoo it nourishes your hair and it causes less breakage as well. I switch off with Say Yes To Blueberries shampoo every other week.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this shampoo</li>
    <li> Love it, will stay with using it in the future.  Hair seems to have more body and feels healthier</li>
    <li> minty smell. i didnt know it was shampoo thou. awesome for a irrated scalp n for hair growth. would buy it again</li>
    <li> I have used many expensive and even cheap shampoos and all I really excepted was clean hair. With this shampoo my hair actually feels soft and managable before I even use the conditioner. Usually my hair is straw after the first shampoo but not with this. It has also helped with breakage. My hair still looks good even if I air dry my hair after using the shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
    <li> Beauty on a Budget.  Can it be done? Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of using salon quality products, I read a lot of reviews and watched a lot of youtube video reviews before arriving at \\&quot;John Frieda&#x27;s Breakage Prone, Root Awakening, Strength Restoring, Shampoo.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the atrociously long name, all this shampoo had going for it was a ok smell in the shower and a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was so wrong?  It made my hair fall out.  I know you lose between 50-100 strands a day.  But I had very thick, virgin, Asian hair before this product.  I had very thin, virgin, Asian hair after using this product for less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, if you want beauty on a budget, run away from this product!</li>
    <li> No &amp;#34;Awakening&amp;#34; feeling... I guess I expected it would feel closer to a Tea Tree product and make your skull feel nice and cool but it didn&#x27;t come close enough for me.  I actually bought new shampoo/conditioner without using this more than about 5 times.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry. After using this product, it becomes better and healthier.</li>
    <li> nice product! love the scent!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because we couldn&#x27;t find it in any store and it is the best shampoo that I have ever tried. This shampoo leaves your hair soft and smooth while treating a dry scalp. It is also excellent for styling.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use the shampoo and conditioner costing $11 total and I cannot believe how much better my  hair feels. I color my hair frequently, blow dry and straighten daily and this stuff makes my hair look and feel shiny and soft. I let the conditioner sit on my hair for about 2 min then rinse with cool water and I cannot tell you how amazing my scalp feels. The cool water plus the mint seriously stimulates my scalp. I come out of the shower with non-tangly hair everytime. I recommend this to everyone and anyone. WONDERFUL! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it feels like working on the scalp, excellent smell and excellent price!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s my fav shampoo</li>
    <li> I tried lots and lots of very expensive and not expensive at all shampoos, but i dont remember my hair so silky and shiny after using this shampoo and conditioner. I cant stop making pictures of my hair...i love it! Hair feels very clean even after i use the conditioner on my roots. And this shampoo makes hair feel very clean and my scalp is tingling. I feel like my hair is coming back to life!!!!</li>
    <li> Made my hair soft and more smooth. So I would say that I liked it.</li>
    <li> awesome product,,especially for fine har</li>
    <li> I have been using some very expensive brands based on salon advice and they were good for awhile but my hair hasn&#x27;t been feeling very good for a while. I switched to this Root Awakening Restoring line for shampoo, conditioner, and two other finishing strength products by John Frieda and it is an amazing overnight difference. Way better then salon expensive products at a fraction of the cost! Incredible. truly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two years now. I normally buy it from a retail store, but I saw that it is now being sold here on amazon for a lot cheaper.  Before I started using this product, I fine hair and it was usually dry because I swim everyday.  After I started using this shampoo and conditioner, I have noticed that I have less hair on my comb and in the tub.  My hair now soft and does not look or feel like I swim everyday.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and leaves hair feeling clean not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the John Frieda root awakening shampoo and conditioner + leave in serum for about 4 yrs. My hair was dry and quite damaged. However, this product changed that to better hair. I completely adore this hair care system. Mind you, Before that, I tried a lot of other products but nothing came close. All hats off to you J. F.! and thank you...</li>
    <li> I looked for this product in Wal-Mart and other stores for a while with on luck. One day it hit me ,&amp;#34;why not try Amazon.com?&amp;#34; Sure enough I found the product there. I&#x27;m very pleased with the shampoo. My hair looks fuller and is easier to style.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Hydrate and nourish for dry scalps is exactly what it does. The product works great!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is gentle, yet it cleans well without stripping the color, for those of you who color your hair like I do.  A little goes a long way.  I will be purchasing this shampoo again, and again.</li>
    <li> I love this product but can&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live. Thank goodness for the internet! Makes both my hair and scalp look and feel healthy.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wrong type shampoo for my hair. This is for dry scalp. I have purchased this brand through amazon previously and really liked it. Upon reordering, I got the wrong kind!</li>
    <li> like it before i have full set i will recommend all my family to use it and to buy it</li>
    <li> This is Great stuff!!!  It definately awakens your scalp &amp; hair.  I use it once a week in addition to Aveeno Nourish and Volume.  It smells awesome.  Because I don&#x27;t use this \\&quot;Stand alone\\&quot; I can&#x27;t say how well it works as a daily shampoo..however I give it high ratings!  I also use the Root Awakening Strength restoring spray - and it&#x27;s great...gives extra body to hair. It&#x27;s also soft and doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff or sticky!!</li>
    <li> Good product for dry scalp.  Made my hair look great.</li>
    <li> I only used this during the most driest days because my hair still had a residue after washing it with this</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great! Feels invigorating on the scalp. I didn&#x27;t notice any nourishing benefits, but I have extremely dry, damaged hair from overprocessing color dyes. If your hair is &amp;#34;normal,&amp;#34; I think this would be an excellent shampoo. I detracted one star because it didn&#x27;t really change my dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I picked up this shampoo because I received a coupon for a substantial discount and thought someone in the family would use it. I tried it and my hair came out great, so I kept using it, though I&#x27;d always used expensive salon brands. It&#x27;s been about 6 months. Now I have all this new hair growth in addition to great shine.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what they mean by root awakening...but I am thrilled.  This stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> It works well for my hair. It makes hair soft, smooth and shine. I will keep using it from now on.</li>
    <li> Love the way it leaves my hair feeling, and the scent is nice.</li>
    <li> Love this line of products. The shampoo especially keeps my hair so clean and fresh! I have tried to find this in stores, but haven&#x27;t had any luck.</li>
    <li> I chose this shampoo because it is free of many of the harmful ingredients in other shampoos.  Because it also smells great, I am a repeat purchaser.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and it&#x27;s one of my favorite. This is first time I bought it online.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t use this regularly but my boyfriend absolutely raves about it. it is the only shampoo he likes. i have tried it and it does leave the hair soft and there&#x27;s a slight scalp tingle that&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have very long, thick hair. I have tried many haircare products and I love John Frieda Root Awakening Shampoo and Condition for Dry Hair/Scalp. They truly help keep my hair soft and resilient without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Easy to order.  This product makes my hair feel healthy.  My hair is more shiny.  I typically don&#x27;t think shampoo makes that much difference, but this does.</li>
    <li> I Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. We have very hard water here and it works well.</li>
    <li> This is my absolutely favorite shampoo.  I love the smell.  I love the creaminess of the shampoo.  I love what it does to my hair, but in my area, it is almost impossible to find.  I was worried that they stopped making it so I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this, especially when paired with the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for three years, since getting samples on a cruise.  I usually don&#x27;t stay with a product this long!  However, I am finding it difficult to find in stores locally and was happy to see Amazon has it on their site and at a lower cost than the stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using john frieda products  and they were good and perfect. I decided to change for this one, my hair hasn&#x27;t been feeling very good using this one.It was a ok smell in the shower and a good lather.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel great!</li>
    <li> Great product for hair.  Will buy again...</li>
    <li> My daughter has an extremely dry scalp and it causes her to also have an itchy scalp all the time.  We have tried every shampoo out there and none of them work very well to alleviate her dry, itchy scalp until we tried this.  She noticed the difference immediately and this is the only shampoo she uses now.</li>
    <li> I have not used it much still just trying it out. So far seams to help.</li>
    <li> Used with the conditioner and it smells good but my hair was super hard to comb through after using the two.</li>
    <li> I like how this works and smells and that I can have it delivered as part of my monthly order.</li>
    <li> Great product, makes the scalp feel good.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is easy to comb without extra products. Would buy this over and over.</li>
    <li> I love washing my hair with this shampoo!!! I have miserable curly dry colored damaged hair and now its soft silky and shiney!!!! So many compliments!!! Amazing product!!! I had highlighyed my hair eight months ago... My color is still rich and gorgeous looking !!! Usually after a month the color fades and my hair looks very damaged and ugly!!! Im a brunette with long hair and slow hair growth.  So the natural hair color coming in at the roots blends in well ... Only four inches probably grew anyways!!! Hope they never discontinue this product!! Tired of expensive products that dont work well for my hair type!!!</li>
    <li> Really does add lift to roots.  Have ordered more than once.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and I keep this in my constant shampoo/conditioner rotation.  It gives my hair body and then I apply some olive oil leave in conditioner when I get out of the shower. : )</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helps my dry scalp better than anything else I have used.</li>
