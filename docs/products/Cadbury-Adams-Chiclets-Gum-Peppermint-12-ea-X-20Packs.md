      <li>My wife&#x27;s favoring gum was surprised by the packages of Chiclets received as a present to her.  </li>

      <li>I had a hard time finding this particular gum as other flavors were available in stores.  </li>
      <li>They are nice and sweet for a few seconds but after chewing a while they are completely tasteless and I can&#x27;t wait to spit them out.  </li>

<li> They are nice and sweet for a few seconds but after chewing a while they are completely tasteless and I can&#x27;t wait to spit them out.  </li>
<li> All that i can remember about the chiclet chewing gum is the long lasting minty flavour.</li>
<li> As kids a pack of chiclets would go a long way..one could stick it up on the upper palette and recall when required!</li>
<li> The flavor lasts about that long, too.  </li>
<li> I hope these stick around for a long time.</li>
<li> In the past, it would stay soft for hours.  </li>
<li> You can only chew it for a few minutes.  </li>
<li> Although it is the only gum I usually chew, it definitely is not the same as it was in the past.</li>
<li> hard to find at any nostalgic candy store and easy to find on here.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t think that you need to go that extreme.</li>
<li> These little gems are just enough gum to give you a burst of flavor and a little pop.  </li>
<li> This gum also doesn&#x27;t give me acid reflux like the other gums.</li>
<li> It is very hard and doesn&#x27;t stay soft.  </li>
<li> They are almost impossible to fnd in stores, but luckily Amazon and Penguin are there to fill the gap.</li>
<li> I hate that all the other gum that is available has a bunch of chemicals.</li>
<li> Sometimes I just need a little something.     </li>
<li> I no longer find Chiclets in retail stores as I have in the past.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find chiclets in the stores.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t eat anything that contains artificial sweeteners, and I have had a hard time finding any gum locally that does not contain them.  </li>
<li> I would rather take my chances with just regular sugar than all the artificial chemicals that they put in gum.</li>
<li> Within minutes I am running around my office like a gerbil on an exercise wheel, after which I feel like total crap for an hour and a half.  </li>
<li> That&#x27;s ridiculous, do the math.</li>
<li> I was shocked to find they weren&#x27;t on local shelves anymore.</li>
<li> These are very hard to find</li>
<li> And when I find them, they are outrageously expensive.  </li>
<li> I like this gum because it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial sugar.  </li>
<li> So i was disappointed with the lack of sufficient mintiness and the duration of the flavour in these gums.</li>

    <li> My grandma always had these in her purse! The CVS stopped carrying these and I was stuck buying gum that was too strong or soft or giant pieces. Chiclets are just the right size and flavor.</li>
    <li> On my quest to find a gum that doesn&#x27;t&#x27; have one of those chemical sweeteners in it I ran across Chiclets. They are great tasting, and last a long time. I also like that I can put one piece or more depending on how much I want to chew. Sometimes I just need a little something.     If you are looking for a gum that doesn&#x27;t have aspartame in it Chiclets are a good choice.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Chiclets Gum for a dear friend after she told me she can&#x27;t find it any more.  I told her I would send her some from where I live.  However, I couldn&#x27;t find it either.  It&#x27;s not sold in any of the major grocery stores, pharmacies, or variety stores like Target or WalMart.    I went to Amazon.com and was able to purchase Chiclets Gum through the Cadbury Adams company.  I was happy to be able to send it all on to my friend who was delighted. She got it on Valentine&#x27;s Day which made it even more special.  I wish the Cadbury Adams company would have a wider distribution.  The public still loves the gum and would buy it if it were available.  Thank you for your helping me find it.    Joyce H. Mills</li>
    <li> Thank you, AMAZON.  I love Chiclets and they are so extremely hard to find.  And when I find them, they are outrageously expensive.  Just on a lark, I checked Amazon.  These little gems are just enough gum to give you a burst of flavor and a little pop.  Those of us who can pop!  A throw back from my childhood.  Thanks so much.  Chicklets: the best gum ever.  Box says made in Columbia.  Why!  On well. I found them. I&#x27;ll worry about whether they pass the Food and Drug Administration standards later.  LOL</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find chiclets in the stores.  The last place I got them, stopped stocking the item so I went to Amazon.com, connected with whoever and it came without any problem.</li>
    <li> I love Chiclets they are the only gum made that does not have sugar free chemicals.  I love the taste and at only 1 carb per piece it is totally low cal.  The seller was prompt with shipping.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t eat anything that contains artificial sweeteners, and I have had a hard time finding any gum locally that does not contain them.  Peppermint Chiclets is perfect for me!

    <li> These are very hard to find so I was happy that I did.  I like this gum because it doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial sugar.  It&#x27;s a great tasting gum, and a great value.</li>

I understand that people want fresh breath but I don&#x27;t think that you need to go that extreme. This gum also doesn&#x27;t give me acid reflux like the other gums.</li>
    <li> No longer anywhere to be found in the grocery stores, these little Chiclets are just perfect in taste and size. Every year my sister requests them as her birthday gift. She and I agree, they&#x27;re the greatest. Whenever I visit my grandchildren they want to know if I have Chiclets, and of course I do. They never see them anywhere except when Grammy comes to visit. A special treat.</li>
    <li> none like chiclets ,the best gum in the market</li>
    <li> My beloved needs to chew gum as prescribed by the doctor to keep his system free from acid reflux. The problem was that all chewing gums have Splenda or Sucralose, which have shown to be toxic in some people, especially, my husband, giving him headaches and dizziness. It is a blessing that we could find good old-fashion Chiclets in Amazon, so he can keep a healthy digestive system. Thanks, Chiclets, for not compromising.</li>
    <li> can no find locally really love the peppermint no sticking to the teeth, even like spearmint better can not find&lt;br /&gt;that at all..... tell me how?</li>
    <li> I never thought I would rate chewing gum, however, I have purchased this gum for several years.  In the last year or so the texture of the gum has changed.  It is very hard and doesn&#x27;t stay soft.  You can only chew it for a few minutes.  In the past, it would stay soft for hours.  It appears they have done something to the ingredients.  Although it is the only gum I usually chew, it definitely is not the same as it was in the past.</li>
    <li> These Chicklets bring back many good childhood memories. I was shocked to find they weren&#x27;t on local shelves anymore. The gum is refreshing and tastes very good. As always, th  flavor isn&#x27;t the longest lasting but it&#x27;s still enjoyable. I hope these stick around for a long time.</li>
    <li> These Chiclets do not taste the way I remember them.  They are nice and sweet for a few seconds but after chewing a while they are completely tasteless and I can&#x27;t wait to spit them out.  Way inferior to Dentyne Ice Peppermint.</li>
    <li> I remember Chiclets from my childhood, many, many years ago.  They were a treat then and they are a treat now.  I love the combination of the candy shell melting away from the refreshing gum.  They are almost impossible to fnd in stores, but luckily Amazon and Penguin are there to fill the gap.</li>
    <li> I no longer find Chiclets in retail stores as I have in the past.  I ordered a good supply through Amazon and now have more of my favorite gum.  Thanks Amazon for making it available so easily.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the best buy out there if you like chiclets, in the store I paid 1.25 per pack. That&#x27;s ridiculous, do the math.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a 30-second sugar rush, this is the gum for you.  The flavor lasts about that long, too.  Sometimes after lunch I get an intense sugar craving.  I whip these out and commence to chewing, and it works best if you chew a whole pack at one time.  Within minutes I am running around my office like a gerbil on an exercise wheel, after which I feel like total crap for an hour and a half.  Because (makes sideways peace sign) that&#x27;s how I roll.</li>
    <li> hard to find at any nostalgic candy store and easy to find on here. the price is also right as well.</li>
    <li> Each chiclet is smaller than I remember from my childhood, but the taste is the same and there&#x27;s no artificial bitter taste at the end.  Delicious.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in Spearmint too.  Wrigley&#x27;s has spearmint, but it has aspertane.</li>
    <li> All that i can remember about the chiclet chewing gum is the long lasting minty flavour. As kids a pack of chiclets would go a long way..one could stick it up on the upper palette and recall when required! So i was disappointed with the lack of sufficient mintiness and the duration of the flavour in these gums.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this gum as much as I remembered.  Glad we can still get gum without aspartame, old style.</li>
    <li> Gum arrived well packed and fresh. A good quality chew. Easier than trying to fine it in the grocery stores.</li>

    <li> This is the good-fashioned gum you remember, but it isn&#x27;t as flavorful I I remembered, and I can&#x27;t recommend it as highly as some other gums with real sugar.  It also contains BHT.</li>
