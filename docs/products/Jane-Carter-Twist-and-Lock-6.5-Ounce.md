      <li>I have been on a search to find a good product for a twist out style.</li>

      <li>This product has a nice scent and moisturizes my hair</li>
      <li>I want to start retwisting my own locs since its been 8 months since i started.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair (non ethnic) and it really is the best product for keeping the frizzes in check.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my hair well, keeps it healthy, and it smells good.  </li>
      <li>consistence is more like a lotion than an twist/lock pomade,cream, custard, etc.&lt;br /&gt;However, like all Jane Carter products it smells amazing, but</li>
      <li>The container is bright and cheerful and the smell is nice, but the product has more water in it than I like.  </li>
      <li>I have natural shoulder length hair and Twist &amp; Lock is perfect for my twist outs and braid outs.</li>
      <li>It has a strong undertone of some citrus, I don&#x27;t know what kind</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff&lt;</li>

      <li>This product has a great smell and really moisturizes my locs, but that is wear it ends.  </li>

      <li>I love that.</li>
      <li>It keeps it so moist and it looks really healthy.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell.</li>
      <li>Love this product I put it in after I swim for my textured hair.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this product for my locs.  </li>
      <li>I have had locs for seven years and this is one of my favorite loc products.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>They \\&quot;kept\\&quot; for many days.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>I use this product to retwist my locs and I love it.</li>
      <li>It smells great, makes my hair soft and moisturized, and the ingredients don&#x27;t scare me away.</li>
      <li>There was no flaking and the product kept my hair shiny, smelling great, and soft.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold this is NOT the product for you.</li>
      <li>I do have fine hair</li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
      <li>,it&#x27;s really light</li>
      <li>Now I have a tube of it that I don&#x27;t like and will probably sell for cheap because I am never going to use it again.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>My friend gave me the pointer so far it&#x27;s been good to me.</li>
      <li>Very fresh.</li>
      <li>When I take them out, my hair is always moisturized  with very little frizz, great definition and a really nice sheen.</li>
      <li>It is rich and oily</li>
      <li>I do have very very very thick hair and Twist &amp; Lock does not provide the best hold, but I am ok with that trade off.</li>
      <li>I have natural kinky, curly hair &amp; I absolutely love this product for my braid outs!</li>
      <li>The 4oz jar, I received from the Vitamin shoppe via Amazon, is now 6.5 oz with the same good ingredients as I remembered.</li>
      <li>I use Curly pudding on a more regular basis (I have a greater supply of that).</li>
      <li>This holds my hair well for locs and it is great moisturizing while not weighing hair down.  </li>
      <li>I am VERY surprised and pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>and I was finally able to get the natural hairstyle I&#x27;ve wanted for years.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would be effective in starting locs</li>
      <li>I was hoping this product would be good for twist outs, but all it did was make my hair frizz and gave absolutely no hold.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been worth my time and every penny.</li>
      <li>I am 59 years old and have never been so satisfied with a hair care</li>
      <li>This is one of the best treatments for natural African American hair in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I was turned off by the smell first.</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of ANY Jane Carter products, with maybe the exception of her Heat Protectant Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Twist and Lock on my braid out since I had received a free tub of it in one of the bags of samples that I used to get from my old job at an organic grocery store.</li>
      <li>Do not put too much on!</li>
      <li>After several misses and beauticians, along with money , I was able to find a salon that use product</li>
      <li>This was my first time using Jane Carter Twist and Lock on my son Locks</li>
      <li>OK,I TRIED FIRST JANE CARTER NOURISH AND SHINE</li>
      <li>I am pretty generous with the amount I use, and my hair does not feel greasy or sticky after it dryes.</li>
      <li>First I put shea butter on each section, then the Twist and Loc</li>
      <li>I have a very soft fine hair and had been trying to find a product that I could use with my natural hairstyle.</li>
      <li>My hair is not coarse, so it takes to the product just fine to my liking.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I really, really like this for twisting.</li>
      <li>but it really hydrates and softens the hair.</li>
      <li>I have several of Jane Carter&#x27;s product as I do enjoy their quailty.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s to much on the pricey side for me</li>
      <li>BABY.THIS PRODUCT GIVES MY HAIR THAT SOFTNESS I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR,AND IT HOLDS A TWO STRAND TWIST VERY WELL, BUT</li>
      <li>It really moisturized his locks after swimming.</li>
      <li>I like it okay, but it  doesn&#x27;t soften my coarse natural hair the way Twist &amp; Lock does.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way and it does great to hold twists in place.  </li>
      <li>I was extra excited that my twist out held up for longer than a couple of days.</li>
      <li>I only require a small amount and it works great.  </li>
      <li>If you have locs, though, apply this product sparingly and only when needed, as it could easily cause buildup through frequent usage.</li>

    <li> I have a very soft fine hair and had been trying to find a product that I could use with my natural hairstyle. After several misses and beauticians, along with money , I was able to find a salon that use product and I was finally able to get the natural hairstyle I&#x27;ve wanted for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least the last three years... Love it great product for re twisting your locs.</li>
    <li> I have natural shoulder length hair and Twist &amp; Lock is perfect for my twist outs and braid outs. I put a dab on damp hair from root to ends before braiding or twisting. When I take them out, my hair is always moisturized  with very little frizz, great definition and a really nice sheen.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice scent and moisturizes my hair well but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for locks just because it offers no hold. I could use anything if all I wanted was a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I usually wear my hair in twists and need a twisting cream to moisture each twist as I go through sections of my hair. Up until this point, I used Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus and Qhemet Biologics Amala Heavy Cream, both my staples. I tried this Twist &amp; Lock cream just to see how it compares to the others. I have to say that I really, really like this for twisting. I am pretty generous with the amount I use, and my hair does not feel greasy or sticky after it dryes. I have to say that I will probably switch off between Shea Moisture and Twist &amp; Lock. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would be good for twist outs, but all it did was make my hair frizz and gave absolutely no hold.  It was also not as thick as I would have preferred it to be.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product. I have locs and I&#x27;m extremely cautious about what I put in my hair. As a naturalist and a minimalist, this is one of the only \\&quot;products\\&quot; I actually use. It smells great, makes my hair soft and moisturized, and the ingredients don&#x27;t scare me away. No petrolatum, no waxes--and best of all, my first bottle of Twist and Lock lasted me over a year! If you have locs, though, apply this product sparingly and only when needed, as it could easily cause buildup through frequent usage.</li>
    <li> I have had locs for seven years and this is one of my favorite loc products. It does not leave build up in my hair. I do have very very very thick hair and Twist &amp; Lock does not provide the best hold, but I am ok with that trade off. The hold lasts a few days less than other products but my hair feels soft and moisturized, not hard and sticky like other products I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have used Twist and Loc on freshly washed wet hair.  First I put shea butter on each section, then the Twist and Loc &amp; then I twist each section.  When all twists are done, I spray the locking spray and then sit under the dryer.  My twists were so firm and defined, they reminded me of locs.  They \\&quot;kept\\&quot; for many days.  I am VERY surprised and pleased with this product. I use Curly pudding on a more regular basis (I have a greater supply of that). The twists from Jane Carter&#x27;s product, however, are more firm and defined, whereas with the Curly pudding they are, plump, shiny and not as firm.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of ANY Jane Carter products, with maybe the exception of her Heat Protectant Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Twist and Lock on my braid out since I had received a free tub of it in one of the bags of samples that I used to get from my old job at an organic grocery store. This came in the bag as well as the Heat Spray. I was turned off by the smell first. It&#x27;s horrible. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but it smells like a weird, dead flower. Not overpowering, just not pleasant. It has a strong undertone of some citrus, I don&#x27;t know what kind but it is not a good scent. I did not use this product for a very long time because I could not get past the smell. When I used it on my braid out I was so dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to sleep with my braids in and unwound them and found that though the Twist and Lock had prevented frizz (a bonus) it had left a very greasy feeling on my hair. It was also weighed down and the consistency of the cream was tacky, like glue. It stuck to my fingers as I applied it. I&#x27;m not impressed with the product and will not use it again. Now I have a tube of it that I don&#x27;t like and will probably sell for cheap because I am never going to use it again. I may stop using the heat spray too as that also leaves my hair feeling very greasy after I flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s better for those with kinkier textures? I feel like it&#x27;s too heavy for my fine curls. Oh well. I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it, so no loss to me.</li>
    <li> This holds my hair well for locs and it is great moisturizing while not weighing hair down.  I&#x27;ve tried others but I keep coming back to this because nothing works as well for my hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and have been using it on my locs for about 3 years.  I don&#x27;t know if it would be effective in starting locs but it definitely works well for loc maintenance.  It moisturizes my hair well, keeps it healthy, and it smells good.  I do have fine hair so maybe that&#x27;s the difference between my experience and some of the other posts.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and really like it.  I will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for pureology texture twist but this wasn&#x27;t it.  It works okay but does not give me the look and feel I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! So did my clients, and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Give good hold it that&#x27;s what you are looking for. But leave hair stiff. Need very small amount.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to coil your hair then this is a wonderful product. I used my finger to coil my hair and a comb to coil my sons hair and it worked great for both. In fact I am able to keep both our hair in the style for at least a month before re-coiling.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product for myself I have natural hair and this product is too oily for my hair texture. But my mother has sister locks (similar to dread locks) and she loves this product.</li>
    <li> I want to start retwisting my own locs since its been 8 months since i started. I use this product to retwist my locs and I love it. Great smell hold wells. Not sticky type. I enjoy this product. I don&#x27;t sit under the dryer I let it air dry. My friend gave me the pointer so far it&#x27;s been good to me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would sustain my twists.  I have a problem with my two-strand twists unraveling and was hoping this product would finally be the solution I was seeking.  This product is a great moisturizer and softener, but for me, did not give me the results I was seeking; which was maintaining my twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a softener and moisturizer, than this is a great product.  If you are like me and looking for a product to keep your twists in tack, then this did not work for me.  I have soft hair and need a product that will maintain a hold, without compromising softness/moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any recommendations?</li>
    <li> I have been on a search to find a good product for a twist out style.This worked so well. There was no flaking and the product kept my hair shiny, smelling great, and soft. I have already re-ordered this product. I will it came in a bigger jar.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my locs.  I wash and condition my hair and then I use my Twist and Lock. I only require a small amount and it works great.  I have  discontinued going to the beauty parlor to re-twist my hair since I can do it at home with this product. I don&#x27;t even have to sit under the dryer in order for it to set. I put it on, twist my hair, use a clip and walk around and let my hair air dry. This is a great product for locs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have wavy hair (non ethnic) and it really is the best product for keeping the frizzes in check. I live in the South so the humidity is awful. I am really happy to find a product that helps control my hair.  Be careful! Do not put too much on! You only need a finger-tip amount to work into non-ethnic hair.  I would definitely recommend this product to any person who wants to keep the waves/curls in check but not weigh the hair down with junk.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> I purchase this after purchasing the Jane Carter Nourish and Shine for Dry Hair and Dry Skin (which I LOVE) - but this product doesn&#x27;t work well for my 4C natural hair when I&#x27;m doing two strand twist, etc. It&#x27;s not thick enough, and has no hold at all.&lt;br /&gt;The consistence is more like a lotion than an twist/lock pomade,cream, custard, etc.&lt;br /&gt;However, like all Jane Carter products it smells amazing, but it  just doesn&#x27;t provide any hold for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle worker for 4C dry dry did I say DRY hair.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent! This product softens and conditions my coarse hair,  leaves no residue and smells wonderful.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my city so I always have to search online to buy it. It&#x27;s been worth my time and every penny. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now (at least 4) and I consider it a high quality product. I am 59 years old and have never been so satisfied with a hair care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve also purchased the Nourish and Shine, also by Jane Carter Solution. I like it okay, but it  doesn&#x27;t soften my coarse natural hair the way Twist &amp; Lock does.</li>
    <li> i am of mixed ethnic lineage, my hair is wavy/curly and extremely dry. for many years i used heat on my hair every single day to style it (blow dry, flat iron, etc) and because of this i had a ton of damage, and my hair stopped growing. i work out every day as well, so i need to wash my hair daily, which also ads to dryness and damage. i decided to go all natural with my hair and stop using heat all together. this product is an amazing leave-in moisturizer that keeps my hair shiny and my waves/curls defined and beautiful. my hair no longer looks damaged and brittle. also, it smells incredible! i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have natural kinky, curly hair &amp; I absolutely love this product for my braid outs! The smell is awesome! It&#x27;s to much on the pricey side for me but if I splurge this product is on my list! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! divinenubienne on youtube.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  A little bit goes a long way and it does great to hold twists in place.  I used this product on my two strand twists and it had a very pleasant citrus scent and a creamy consistency.  It was also moisturizing and when I took the twists out, they didn&#x27;t feel dry or brittle and there was NO frizz.  I was extra excited that my twist out held up for longer than a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This product is not for everyone. I use it for loc maintenance ONLY. If you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold this is NOT the product for you. I like it because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. It dissolves into the hair &amp; smells awesome. Its also not for all textures of hair. To my fellow men of color, women also, if your hair is thick &amp;/or coarse, I&#x27;d recommend the sculpt &amp; hold to use along side it. U can mix it with that, if your main focus is hold. My hair is not coarse, so it takes to the product just fine to my liking. I hope this review helps. It&#x27;s expensive for the amount of product you get, so know what you&#x27;re looking to get out of it before you purchase. I DON&#x27;T do beeswax or gel. Those products take the life out of locs &amp; damage the hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years &amp; NOOOOO build up or damage ever. The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t hold long. Not an issue for me.</li>
    <li> The container is bright and cheerful and the smell is nice, but the product has more water in it than I like.  My hair did not appear shinier and was not softer. I&#x27;m somewhat neutral related to the product and will continue to use it, but would try another product of JC&#x27;s before making a final decision.</li>
    <li> THE BEST NOURSHING PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR! LOVE IT! THE SMELL AND THE WAY IT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL IS WAS A GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> Love this product I put it in after I swim for my textured hair. It is rich and oily I love that. Must have for multicultural textured hair</li>
    <li> The best locking cream for my locks,it&#x27;s really light and the smell is amazing.I have used a lot of heavy creams to twist my locks in the past but since I found Jane Carter a few years ago it&#x27;s all I use.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best treatments for natural African American hair in my opinion. It is a bit pricy but it really hydrates and softens the hair.</li>
    <li> This product has a great smell and really moisturizes my locs, but that is wear it ends.  I washed and twisted my locks on Saturday afternoon and by Saturday evening when I was putting it up for a night on the town, my hair was fuzzy as ever! This product as absolutely no hold... I will not be buying this again.  For the price, I am very disappointed...</li>
    <li> Love this cream!! Use it several years ago, but strayed away to try other products.  Happy to be returning to it as it does provide moisture and sheen.  I have several of Jane Carter&#x27;s product as I do enjoy their quailty.  The 4oz jar, I received from the Vitamin shoppe via Amazon, is now 6.5 oz with the same good ingredients as I remembered.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Jane Carter Twist and Lock on my son Locks &amp; I love it. It really moisturized his locks after swimming. I also love the smell. Very fresh. After purchase, it was shipped to my home in 3 days. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so little in the jar. That&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars. She needs to put this stuff in an 8-12oz jar or a pump.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to do double strand twists on my and my daughter&#x27;s hair. It keeps it so moist and it looks really healthy.</li>
    <li> OK,I TRIED FIRST JANE CARTER NOURISH AND SHINE, IT WORKED GREAT.NOW I&#x27;VE TRIED JANE CARTER TWIST AND LOCK AND I HAVE TO SAY YEEEEES! BABY.THIS PRODUCT GIVES MY HAIR THAT SOFTNESS I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR,AND IT HOLDS A TWO STRAND TWIST VERY WELL, BUT I&#x27;M STILL HAVING PROBLEMS FINDING THAT PRODUCT THAT KEEPS MY HAIR MOISTURIZED AND A PRODUCT THAT GIVES ME A NATURAL DEFINE CURL PATTERN WITHOUT TWO STRAND TWISTING ALL THE F* TIME. I&#x27;M THINKING ABOUT TRYING ANOTHER PRODUCT LINE FOR MOISTURE AND DEFINING MY CURLS ITS CALLED 4 NATURAL AFRO STRETCH CURL CREAM,SOME PEOPLE SAY IT&#x27;S GOOD FOR HAIR TYPES 4A-4C/KINKY-COILY HAIR.(PROBLEMS WITH KEEPING HAIR MOISTURIZED AND A DEFINE CURL PATTERN). I WILL LEAVE A REVIEW FOR THIS PRODUCT SOON.</li>
