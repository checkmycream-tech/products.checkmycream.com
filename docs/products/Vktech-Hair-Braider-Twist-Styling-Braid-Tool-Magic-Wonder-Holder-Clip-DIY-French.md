### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s works wonderful for my hair.</li>
      <li>looking forward to having many wonderful braided hair days</li>
      <li>the idea is good ..</li>
      <li>good thing</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>Could not figure out how to use and make hair look good.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not too adept when it comes to hair gadgets.  </li>
      <li>Maybe for a 6 yrs old learning to breid her dolls hair would be perfect.</li>
      <li>im sure once i figure out  how the thing works it&#x27;ll be nice....</li>
      <li>Maybe it works out better with longer hair.  </li>
      <li>love this product.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I need more practice.</li>
      <li>just love it love it</li>
      <li>Start from the top and keep alternating sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wow works like a dream my daughter put it in for me and it work great</li>
      <li>Easy to use, looking forward to many uses of this fine product.  </li>
      <li>love it love it love it, thanks for having such a great product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see how you can fit a lot of hair in it.</li>
      <li>They probably thought I was cheap</li>
      <li>it was so cheap</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s better for thicker hair like mine because other wise it wouldn&#x27;t all  be covered at the end.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s just much faster and better</li>
      <li>and Im not out much by not being able too use it.</li>
      <li>I got this with the intention of using it to French braid my own hair.</li>
      <li>Since all the hair ends up gathered under the braider, the ponytail at the end is not as nice as in a real French braid.  </li>
      <li>It helps, but not crazy about having to leave it in my braid.  </li>
      <li>very user friendly.</li>
      <li>However, for the price and the super fast shipping it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>I had success the first time I used this</li>
      <li>and it will probably snap into after the first wearing.</li>
      <li>It can only look better with practice</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to french braid.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great as a guide for French braiding other people&#x27;s hair, though!</li>
      <li>Have looked for this item for quite some time as this is a much easier way to get a Viking like look to ones hair.</li>
      <li>Will continue to work it but not seeing much hope.</li>
      <li>It makes it so much easier</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hide very well</li>
      <li>It does a straight braid and many other type braids.</li>
      <li>It stayed in all day with fine hair (albeit a lot of it, making her fine hair thicker) and wasn&#x27;t so hard to figure out.  </li>
      <li>The sections are too small for any kind of hair unless you barely have any.</li>
      <li>Came 14 days early!</li>
      <li>If it were available in black, brown or blond, that would camouflage better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Crafty person could possibly find other uses for it.</li>
      <li>I suppose it might be easier to use on somebody else, but for something marked as a DIY, it was certainly not easy to do to myself, and I&#x27;m better off doing a regular french braid.</li>
      <li>So far following the videos, this tool is a disappointment, it just does not look good when done.</li>
      <li>The concept behind the Magic Wonder Holder Clip is very simple.  </li>

<li> The concept behind the Magic Wonder Holder Clip is very simple.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad braid, just not a great one.  </li>
<li> The shipping take long</li>
<li> This item ships from Hong Kong, so it takes a long time to get it.</li>
<li> Basically, take a strand from one side of the head, cross it over the braider and place it in the groove on the other side.  </li>
<li> This item was bought to be added to a Christmas stocking for our 11 year old daughter along with a few other hair products.  </li>
<li> Buy this thing rather curious ..</li>
<li> Sturdy plastic, not much description on how to use.</li>
<li> The instructions do not really explain it...</li>
<li> No English instructions, small pictures.</li>
<li> I would suggest you look at other products in regard to this item.</li>
<li> The product did not come with thorough instructions and also seemed way to small to actually hold all of my hair in place.</li>
<li> It was hard to take my hair back out of.</li>
<li> I must not have thick enough to use it.</li>
<li> Wish it did, good concept horrible product.</li>
<li> No real instructions packaging a bit hard to read/</li>
<li> It is cheaply made and I hate it that I bought it for a gift.  </li>
<li> After a few strands have been gathered, we can let go and use both hands to just gather hair.  </li>
<li> There are few instructions and her</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but I always had trouble with it.</li>
<li> I had a hard time using this.  </li>
<li> A bit hard for me to do</li>
<li> At least that&#x27;s how it is with shoulder length hair.  </li>
<li> Sucks.</li>
<li> I cannot figure it out by myself plus it must be for those with thick hair.</li>
<li> They are thick and if you have thinner hair I would not recommend them.</li>
<li> This is very small.  </li>
<li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t like this because i found it nearly impossible to use on myself seeing as the instructions were a bit unclear.</li>
<li> dont bother getting this.. what a waste of money!!!  </li>
<li> no directions, not for thin or curly hair</li>
<li> I felt silly getting this.  </li>
<li> but their use is complicated ...</li>
<li> I ended up cutting off a bit of it and that worked.  </li>
<li> Cutting off the end also helps the pointy end from pointing out of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very disappointed with this item.</li>
<li> This is a piece of crap.!!</li>
<li> It is really awful for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> im sure once i figure out  how the thing works it&#x27;ll be nice.... definitely not something doable on yourself until you master it.</li>
    <li> I wish the instructions were clearer on how to use the product! The instructions do not really explain it...I am still trying to figure it out</li>
    <li> wow works like a dream my daughter put it in for me and it work great just love it love it</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure it out</li>
    <li> Have looked for this item for quite some time as this is a much easier way to get a Viking like look to ones hair.</li>
    <li> this must be a two person contraption.  I cannot figure it out by myself plus it must be for those with thick hair.</li>
    <li> No instructions and obvious knock off</li>
    <li> I got this with the intention of using it to French braid my own hair. It is really awful for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great as a guide for French braiding other people&#x27;s hair, though!</li>
    <li> I could not use it by myself at all. Once I got it in it showed. It was hard to take my hair back out of.</li>
    <li> Sucks. It doesn&#x27;t stay in place. Wish it did, good concept horrible product. Piece of garbage. Don&#x27;t recommend. Good thing I know how to French braid, can&#x27;t give it as a gift...</li>
    <li> love it love it love it, thanks for having such a great product.  looking forward to having many wonderful braided hair days</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this if I knew it came from China.  It is cheaply made and I hate it that I bought it for a gift.  They probably thought I was cheap and it will probably snap into after the first wearing.</li>
    <li> It helps, but not crazy about having to leave it in my braid.  Crafty person could possibly find other uses for it.</li>
    <li> This item was bought to be added to a Christmas stocking for our 11 year old daughter along with a few other hair products.  We have had it a week and we still don&#x27;t get it.  There are few instructions and her and I still cannot braid.  However, for the price and the super fast shipping it was worth it.  Will continue to work it but not seeing much hope.</li>
    <li> No instructions Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it.</li>
    <li> dont bother getting this.. what a waste of money!!!  does not even work, and the directions on how to use it you need a magnifying glass..</li>
    <li> did not come with instructions</li>
    <li> Easy to use, looking forward to many uses of this fine product.  Will recommend to family and friends.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product did not come with thorough instructions and also seemed way to small to actually hold all of my hair in place.</li>
    <li> Came 14 days early! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to french braid. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I always had trouble with it. This product helps me to french braid my daughter&#x27;s hair. It does a straight braid and many other type braids. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time using this.  I even tried it on my daughter and still had a challenge.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to actually get this to start a braid...I tried using it on my daughter.  The sections are too small for any kind of hair unless you barely have any.</li>
    <li> The concept behind the Magic Wonder Holder Clip is very simple.  Basically, take a strand from one side of the head, cross it over the braider and place it in the groove on the other side.  Start from the top and keep alternating sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of the braid, we have to hold onto the hair and the braider.  After a few strands have been gathered, we can let go and use both hands to just gather hair.  It&#x27;s easier to use this on someone else than on oneself.  If you&#x27;re like me and are not coordinated enough to French braid your daughter&#x27;s hair, this might help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the length.  I often want to end but can&#x27;t.  I ended up cutting off a bit of it and that worked.  Just use scissors.  Cutting off the end also helps the pointy end from pointing out of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is visibility: the gray color peeks through the hair.  If it were available in black, brown or blond, that would camouflage better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad braid, just not a great one.  Since all the hair ends up gathered under the braider, the ponytail at the end is not as nice as in a real French braid.  Instead of having three groups of strands to work with, we get a big, fat wad.  At least that&#x27;s how it is with shoulder length hair.  Maybe it works out better with longer hair.  Maybe I need more practice.</li>
    <li> Buy this thing rather curious .. the idea is good .. but their use is complicated ... need a lot of skill .. with practice make it. The shipping take long</li>
    <li> Sturdy plastic, not much description on how to use.</li>
    <li> Personally, I didn&#x27;t like this because i found it nearly impossible to use on myself seeing as the instructions were a bit unclear. I suppose it might be easier to use on somebody else, but for something marked as a DIY, it was certainly not easy to do to myself, and I&#x27;m better off doing a regular french braid.</li>
    <li> this came and had no instructions or anything..have NO clue how too use this! good thing it was so cheap and Im not out much by not being able too use it.</li>
    <li> love this product.  very user friendly.</li>
    <li> Too comolicated.  Never used it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do a French braid on my self but with this tool I can. It makes it so much easier</li>
    <li> This is very small.  I don&#x27;t see how you can fit a lot of hair in it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I felt silly getting this.  Maybe for a 6 yrs old learning to breid her dolls hair would be perfect.</li>
    <li> I must not have thick enough to use it. Some instructions on its use would have also helped.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s works wonderful for my hair. I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s better for thicker hair like mine because other wise it wouldn&#x27;t all  be covered at the end.</li>
    <li> A bit hard for me to do</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap.!! No wonder it is so low in cost. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> No English instructions, small pictures. Could not figure out how to use and make hair look good. It is not like pictured.</li>
    <li> If I could read Chinese I would use it</li>
    <li> No real instructions packaging a bit hard to read/see what&#x27;s happening in the photo.</li>
    <li> Did not come with any instrustions</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hide very well</li>
    <li> I had success the first time I used this and I&#x27;m not too adept when it comes to hair gadgets.  It stayed in all day with fine hair (albeit a lot of it, making her fine hair thicker) and wasn&#x27;t so hard to figure out.  It can only look better with practice</li>
    <li> This item ships from Hong Kong, so it takes a long time to get it. NO instructions come with it, just the tool in a bubble mailing envelope. I had to search you tube to try to find out how to use it. This is not a &#x27;do it yourself&#x27; item, you will need another person to use this. So far following the videos, this tool is a disappointment, it just does not look good when done. So it&#x27;s just much faster and better looking to have my husband braid my hair. Very disappointed with this item. I should have bought the more expensive one with instructions written in English as opposed to not having any directions at all.</li>
    <li> They did come sealed in a packages but the directions appeared to be copied. You will have to figure out how to use this yourself. They are thick and if you have thinner hair I would not recommend them. I would suggest you look at other products in regard to this item.</li>
    <li> just a piece of plastic. didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> no directions, not for thin or curly hair</li>
