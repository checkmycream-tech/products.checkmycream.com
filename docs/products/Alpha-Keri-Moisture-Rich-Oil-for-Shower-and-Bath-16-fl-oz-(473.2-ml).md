      <li>Alpha Keri moisture Rich Oil for shower and Bath</li>
      <li>Rich Oil for YEARS.  </li>
      <li>This is the only bath oil that successfully treats my eczema.  </li>
      <li>The price is right, too!  </li>
      <li>It works great and is not as oily as other brands.  </li>
      <li>So glad to be able to obtain it through Amazon because my local drug store no longer carries it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other brands of bath oil, but Keri Oil is by far the very best.</li>
      <li>Nothing is as good as Alpha Keri for dry skin in the winter.  </li>
      <li>This oil doesn&#x27;t have amazing results, but has definitely become a part of my regular regimine, as it does feel good and helps improve skin enough to be worthwhile.</li>
      <li>but well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I got this nice, big bottle</li>
      <li>Not the easiest thing to wash out of the tub, but worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are generic products available from all the major drug stores, but none have as pleasant a scent.</li>
      <li>My skin smoothed right out and looks hydrated and silky where before it looked like alligator skin.</li>
      <li>Plus during the winter my hands/knuckls chap and bleed badly, so useing this in the shower or soaking in it in a bath is the best remedy I foundc even better than lotions.</li>
      <li>Thanks for carrying this product at a very reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Works well for my dogs sensitive skin and the smell is light</li>
      <li>My skin is so much softer, flaking and itchiness gone!  </li>
      <li>I have used it as such for most of those 20 years and it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate your eyes.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>products are first class</li>
      <li>Forget all the fancy, high priced ones!!</li>
      <li>It can make the tub or shower very slippery, so I put it on after showers and very lightly towel dry.  </li>
      <li>If you have seriously dry skin but don&#x27;t like the oily feeling many bath products leave, try this stuff.</li>
      <li>I use a little after each showe in lieu of lotion, amazing.</li>
      <li>Came as promised and thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice oil, although not outstanding.</li>
      <li>(but it can - by definition - so be careful) and it washes away relatively easily with some shampoo or cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Of all the products I have purchased for many years...this is the ONLY one that actually works!  </li>
      <li>this go round and love it.  </li>
      <li>Put some in your bathwater, or to maximize skin moisturizing, rub some on your skin after a shower while still wet and let it dry on its own.</li>
      <li>You will have a little residue in your tub, so be prepared for more frequent cleaning of the tub.</li>
      <li>Too lazy to go to the drugstore to buy more, so I went to Amazon</li>
      <li>This made such a difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>One large bottle will easily last six months.</li>
      <li>Somehow it is hard to find, and was glad that Amazon carried it.  </li>
      <li>My doctor recommended this oil years ago for dry skin, but I didn&#x27;t use it for long because my skin was fine once winter ended.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was bought for my sister who insists that it is the best after shower moisturizer that she&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> better than baby oil. skin feels smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I was 10 years old, and unfortunately, it has been taken off the market!      This product really works on those of us with very dry skin and it leaves my skin soft and not greasy!    Thanks for carrying this product at a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this order and the product.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent to prevent dry skin. Use it after, but while you&#x27;re still in the shower. &lt;br /&gt;There are generic products available from all the major drug stores, but none have as pleasant a scent. The generic always seem to have a hint of rancid vegetable oil.</li>
    <li> Keri products are top class and my grandmother (from California) introduced it to my Mother and she to me. Unfortunately, the only time I can get it is on my visits back home but then it is difficult bringing back, even in luggage.&lt;br /&gt;If you order it online it costs a fortune in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The products are first class but I would not recommend having them shipped. Far too expensive</li>
    <li> Nothing is as good as Alpha Keri for dry skin in the winter.  Hard to find in drugstores.  Came as promised and thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have so much trouble with dry skin in winter that I will scrath until it breaks the skin. I just use a small amount of Alph Keri and rub it in like lotion after my shower and I don&#x27;t have any trouble with dry skin all winter long.     I have used this product for over 20 years. Once or twice I have tried a discount store brand, but it is never the same. I won&#x27;t waste my money doing that again. I have recommended this product to a few co-workers and my daughter and they are now devoted customers also.     I don&#x27;t know why this product is so difficult to find in stores now, because the very few that do carry it sell out quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the only bath oil that successfully treats my eczema.  What a relief from all the itching and scarring.  I got the product very quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I was thankful to find this soothing oil again. I use it to soak painful hands and feet in from psoriasis. I have not been able to find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep a dog&#x27;s skin and coat moist and irritant free. Mix equal parts water and Alpha Keri in a spray bottle. Wet the coat of the dog and rub it in as needed. Relieves a lot of itching and dry areas.</li>
    <li> If you have seriously dry skin but don&#x27;t like the oily feeling many bath products leave, try this stuff. Just squirt a little on a facecloth and rub all over, or put a small amount in a bath and soak in it. When I use it, my skin comes out feeling normal and doesn&#x27;t itch or feel dry for days afterward. Starting buying online a while back as it&#x27;s very hard to find in stores...but well worth the price. One large bottle will easily last six months.</li>
    <li> Order it by the case so I always have it on hand.  I live in a dry part of the country and it is a necessary item for my shower.</li>
    <li> This product has been used for years to treat dry skin...it was the product of choice in the hospitals. You can put it in the bath or apply it directly to your body before getting out to dry off. The only problem is the fact that it is hard to find in 16oz bottles. If you suffer from dry skin, try it....you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I have used Alpha Keri for 35 years.  It was recommened by a dermatologist as I have very dry skin. I use it after I shower on wet skin.  It is the best product that I have found for all over your body dry skin.</li>
    <li> Used to us it.  Then stores didn&#x27;t carry.....why?  So happy Amazon carries it......it&#x27;s totally the best.  Doesn&#x27;t get on clothes, and does wonders for the skin....I even smear some on my face while in the shower.  The scent is great....everything aboout the product is great...love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil, although not outstanding.</li>
    <li> Purchased for dry skin on our German Shepherd.  Works great and smells lovely.  She did settle down with her itchies- mixed half with water in spray bottle to use as needed.</li>
    <li> Nothing better to use in cold weather than this product!  So glad to be able to obtain it through Amazon because my local drug store no longer carries it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alpha-Keri Bath Oil before.  It works great and is not as oily as other brands.  Apply it to a damp washcloth and wipe on, especially areas with dry skin or apply it from your hands. A quick rinse will help it disperse more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;It also does not make the tub/shower floor deadly slippery as other brands do (but it can - by definition - so be careful) and it washes away relatively easily with some shampoo or cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I should go upstairs and test it again, but my experience in the past is that it appears to disperse in water (vs. separating and making you and the shower slick).</li>
    <li> Only thing to use in the bath or shower for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Alpha Keri Mositure Rich Oil for YEARS.  Unfortunately I cannot find it in my local stores.  Once in a while K-Mart has it but it is the smaller bottle, 8 fl oz.  I bought two of the 16 fl oz bottles this go round and love it.  I love the non-greasy feeling once it has been administered to my skin to prevent dryness. My items arrived packed very nicely with no leaks or drips.  Thank you for such an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for people with very dry skin and not for those with oily skin. I have used this in the bath and shower. In the shower, pour a small amount into your hand and rub it into your skin, especially along your arms and legs, after washing or exfoliating. Be careful not to drip it directly onto the tub as the surface of the tub will become extremely slippery. When applied in the shower, it goes on white and then can be rinsed off. The oil stays on the surface of the skin. When pouring into the bath for the first time, ere on the side of using too little. A small amount goes a long way and you can definitely feel it on your skin when you get out of the tub. You will have a little residue in your tub, so be prepared for more frequent cleaning of the tub. Once you towel off, the oily feel will be gone, but your skin remains subtly moisturized. I find this to be a quicker alternative to putting lotion on and lotion tends to melt off in heat, whereas this oil leaves such a thin layer on the skin that you never feel like you&#x27;re melting. It does not come off on clothing and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace on towels. This oil doesn&#x27;t have amazing results, but has definitely become a part of my regular regimine, as it does feel good and helps improve skin enough to be worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere in the stores now! God Bless You Amazon for having this!! It is just the Best for my skin and I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Alpha Keri oil for over 30 years. There is nothing else on the market that comes close to working as well as it does on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Too lazy to go to the drugstore to buy more, so I went to Amazon</li>
    <li> Works really good and 16 oz bottles are more economical than 8 oz bottles.  Will buy this product again soon!</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff years ago, but couldn&#x27;t find it when stores stopped selling it. Very happy to have found it here on amazon. It leaves a light clean sent and leaves you feeling soft and moisurized. Plus during the winter my hands/knuckls chap and bleed badly, so useing this in the shower or soaking in it in a bath is the best remedy I foundc even better than lotions.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT FOR MY KIDS DRY SKIN.</li>
    <li> This product is great for moisturizing the skin. Just a bit in your bath goes a long way. My child has very dry skin and was scratching a lot. Now, no more scratching.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this oil years ago for dry skin, but I didn&#x27;t use it for long because my skin was fine once winter ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, my skin started to look like parchment - all wrinkly on my arms like dried out leather. An older woman, a friend of my mother&#x27;s, has arms that look awful because of massive wrinkling. My arms were starting to look like hers and I&#x27;m years younger than she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Alpha Keri &amp; started using it everyday.  It took a few weeks, but the wrinkles went away. My skin smoothed right out and looks hydrated and silky where before it looked like alligator skin. Easy fix to an annoying problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> We love this oil. It was recommended to my elderly parent by her dermatologist. It is now part of our everyday routine as well</li>
    <li> was delighted to find this product online as it had disappeared from stores. 7 more words required, but nothing to add</li>
    <li> Felt like I wasted my money.  My skin is softer when I use Epsom Salts in my bath.</li>
    <li> This works great for Winter Skin and feels very soothing!</li>
    <li> Ordered this after getting a paper on dry skin care from my dermatologist. Also read the reviews, which sounded great.  Glad I did,&lt;br /&gt;my skin is so dry during the winter, flaky and itchy. This made such a difference after the first use. My skin is so much softer, flaking and itchiness gone!  I was so impressed, I ordered the two pack for next year. If you are having dry skin problems like me, get this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was in  my 20&#x27;s.  It is very difficult to find in the stores and especially in the large size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for a few years now.  It is very good for moisturizing the skin. It keeps my skin from drying out in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other brands of bath oil, but Keri Oil is by far the very best. Put some in your bathwater, or to maximize skin moisturizing, rub some on your skin after a shower while still wet and let it dry on its own. It seems a bit expensive for bath oil, but it is well worth it. It seems to be hard to find in stores.  Also, I received my order in just a few days after ordering. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Of all the products I have purchased for many years...this is the ONLY one that actually works!  It can make the tub or shower very slippery, so I put it on after showers and very lightly towel dry.  I only have to use it every 2-3 days.  The price is right, too!  Forget all the fancy, high priced ones!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  I am  about to renew my order.</li>
    <li> A dermotologist told me about the Alpha Keri Shower/Bath Oil product for dry skin over 40 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it  after my showers ever since.  It is great for keeping my skin soft and supple without feeling oily.  I&#x27;ve had to try other products when I couldn&#x27;t find the Alpha Keri but nothing measures up. I&#x27;m concerned because it&#x27;s getting increasingly difficult to find. It&#x27;s a shame that it isn&#x27;t advertised and marketed effectively-most people have never heard of it.  They&#x27;ve heard of the lotion, but not the Shower/Bath Oil. Please get the word out on what a great product this is and increase the advertising so that merchants will again carry it in their stores.</li>
    <li> We like the product.  Service was by Amazon Prime with 2 day delivery.  We are pleased  in all respects.</li>
    <li> I have been the customer of this product since it was made back in 1960&#x27;s. It is hard to find at regular stores lately.I was happy to have found it on Amazon.It is great skin moisturizer rejuvenator and anti aging.</li>
    <li> Love this. Works well for my dogs sensitive skin and the smell is light and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
    <li> I used this oil almost 14 years. For me is the best</li>
    <li> I USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS &amp; COULDNT FIND IT IN THE STORE SO I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE I COULD GET IT ON LINE. IT IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED, PLUS THE SMELL IS GREAT,</li>
    <li> This helps my dry, itchy winter skin a lot. Not the easiest thing to wash out of the tub, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Alpha Keri lotion for more years than I want to admit I&#x27;ve been using it.  I have extremely dry and itchy skin and without Alpha Keri, I&#x27;d be one miserable person.</li>
    <li> Alpha Keri moisture Rich Oil for shower and Bath it make your skin feel soft and moist. PB</li>
    <li> Nice bath oil to put in a spray bottle to use after your shower.  Nice light fragrance.  Difficult to find in the store lately.</li>
    <li> I have used Alpha Keri Oil for years then I didn&#x27;t. what was I thinking? I got this nice, big bottle and  I&#x27;m so happy with it all over again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 20 years. It&#x27;s wonderful, and is great for dry skin like mine. It&#x27;s also good to use as an eye makeup remover. I have used it as such for most of those 20 years and it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate your eyes. I have very few under eye wrinkles, and I&#x27;m 65 years old. I swear by this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for thirty years. There is no better dry skin application that works as well. I put it in the bath and when I am done, while still in the tub-BEFORE I towel dry I squirt it on my arms, legs etc. THEN, I apply Elizabeth Arden Visable Difference Body Lotion, which actually keeps your skin soft, soft and not dry for three days, even longer. It also makes your legs glisten.</li>
    <li> I love Alpha Keri products.  They are great.  In fact, I started using them years ago after a Dermatologist recommended it for my dry skin.  It works great and I like the fact that there is hardly any scent if any.  Some products have a scent that is either too strong or not pleasant. This one is good.  I would recommend  it to anyone who needs that extra smoothness or for the dryness on their skin.  It can be used in the bath or after showering.</li>
    <li> This product is a one-of-a-kind body oil product.  It does not have the texture of a heavy oil, but is absorbed readily and doesn&#x27;t  leave a heavy coating on the skin.  Somehow it is hard to find, and was glad that Amazon carried it.  Viva Keri Lotion!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when a clerk in a local retail store told me that Keri Lotion was no longer available.  We used it for years on our dogs by mixing with water and lightly spraying their coats.  Recommended by a vet and it made their coats shiny and no longer dry.</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion decades ago.  Either a half-capful in the bath or a little spread on wet skin after a long shower makes a huge difference in my comfort throughout the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I use a little after each showe in lieu of lotion, amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years,But have not found it in the stores any more.The order arrived as stated. thank you</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT! Unfortunately it does not come with a safety seal and when mine was delivered it leaked and I lost about 1/4 of the product. NEXT TIME I will go to a store and pick it up. Not worth the aggravation of having it delivered. My seller did not pick up the phone although I called several times to complain.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; claim. I mean, it&#x27;s an OIL. But it really doesn&#x27;t feel oily once you pat your skin dry. I wash my hands or use hand sanitizer 50+ times a day (I work in healthcare) so my hands are always dry and flaky. But not anymore!</li>
    <li> Whether putting this oil in the bath water or rubbing it  on your body after a shower, your skin will never be softer.  I cannot find this oil except on AMAZON.  IT IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN LOTION AND SMELLS GREAT.  I AM SO GLAD THAT I FOUND THIS LUXURY AGAIN.</li>
