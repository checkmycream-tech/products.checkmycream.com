      <li>I was kind of on the fence about getting this wig</li>
      <li>It is not the thinnest wig, I think, but I also think there&#x27;s a good possibility you&#x27;ll be able to see the mesh through the hair while wearing it.  </li>

      <li>a nice wig</li>
      <li>nice wig....</li>

      <li>but when I contacted the seller, the seller was really nice and respectful and made sure I got my product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The wig in the picture looks like a very light blond</li>
      <li>I gave it a high rating because it was a good price as well as good quality.</li>
      <li>This is just what I wanted and I was lucky and happy to find it available from Amazon at a good price and brought right to my door!</li>
      <li>during our musical and still look great!</li>
      <li>I love this wig.</li>
      <li>For the price, it was great since I didn&#x27;t want to spend much on something that was going to get used maybe once if the person lost the bet.</li>

      <li>I got this wig for my Halloween costume (Bernadette from the big bang theory) and it is nearly perfect!</li>

      <li>love this wig.</li>
      <li>I love the color and fits quit well.  </li>
      <li>Lovely curls.</li>
      <li>It feels just like real hair and is at a great length.</li>
      <li>The product its self was okay and</li>
      <li>Very natural and a great price.</li>
      <li>This seller was very easy to work with and facilitated my special needs.</li>

      <li>I had not expected this wig to be so beautiful.</li>
      <li>It looked authentic and was comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>A more Medium Blonde than Light Blnde color wise !</li>
      <li>Easy to brush the hair.</li>
      <li>OK wig, pretty curls, nice and full, cap doesn&#x27;t show through.</li>
      <li>just fine.</li>
      <li>but when I got it, it was more of a golden blond.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a cheap wig for a costume party, you found it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cheap and</li>
      <li>Its way comphy to wear and light.</li>
      <li>It has combs underneath in the wig cap so is secure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s technically a light brown.</li>
      <li>I have braided it, pinned it up, worn it tied back, and it still looks as great as the day I bought</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t expect it to be a lightly side swept look.</li>
      <li>Fantastic color and styling (the curls look amazing), high quality feel as well.</li>
      <li>THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WIGS I HAVE BOUGHT YET TO CARE FOR AND WEAR IN GENERAL GOOD ITEM</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very attractively made and with the proper care should last longer than most.</li>
      <li>This wig is nice, but the color is COMPLETELY misleading in the photo!</li>
      <li>They responded quickly and were kind enough to make sure it shipped in a day after I emailed them.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a fun wig to just play dress-up, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I liked it and took a picture pretty much straight out of the package.</li>
      <li>It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, full.  </li>
      <li>Shade is true to the picture.</li>
      <li>White-blond in color, true to picture.  </li>
      <li>Ordered for a costume party - surprisingly not bad for an inexpensive wig and it lasted through the evening.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Received the wig in a little over a week and I live in California. My first wig ever and it is absolutely beautiful. I had so much fun with it upon receipt and can&#x27;t wait until halloween. It is not paper white as other had described. I would call it pale blonde. The company was so helpful. I emailed them twice about shipping as I was worried that I may not get it by Halloween. They responded quickly and were kind enough to make sure it shipped in a day after I emailed them. I recommend getting this wig if you want to be a pretty blonde for a day!</li>
    <li> Soooo fake looking, ok for a gag gift but not for actually wearing out</li>
    <li> Looks thicker than it is and bands are not structured like the image.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a play, and our actor wearing it had really dark hair and dark eyebrows. despite this, the wig looked great on her, and we could style it as we pleased.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price, work workmanship too.</li>
    <li> The wig was much softer and silkier than I expected  (I&#x27;m a hair twister).  The color is as shown on my computer.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> a nice wig and it wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
    <li> This took forever to arrive so I was not able to use it&lt;br /&gt;for Halloween. The product its self was okay and&lt;br /&gt;basically as described. I just have no use for it.</li>
    <li> You know, I&#x27;m not very experienced in the realm of wigs, but of the 4 or 5 wigs I&#x27;ve seen (normally part of a halloween costume) this one is by far the best. The hair sits realistically and matches the thumbnail image. Also comes with a hair net.</li>
    <li> The wig was nicer than I expected as I wanted it for a costume. The only problem is that it did not arrive in time for the party I was going to.</li>
    <li> fast shipment, quality product, thanks</li>
    <li> the wig is very nice and soft, the quality is way better than expected and looks exactly like the picture.  Delivery was perfect. two thumbs up for this product and delviery.</li>
    <li> Very thin and color is white. Husband said it made me look old.</li>
    <li> Looks really fake and not natural</li>
    <li> It fits very well. This company also includes a mesh hair cap which is a plus when you wear wigs. The color I got was a brown/blonde. The wig is not shinny it looks some what real. I would buy more wigs in different colors.</li>
    <li> The wig is very then and moves awkwardly​ :(</li>
    <li> Ordered for a costume party - surprisingly not bad for an inexpensive wig and it lasted through the evening.</li>
    <li> The curls are really tight, but I love the pale blonde color of this wig. It isn&#x27;t the thickest thing, but for the price it is a ton of funt oplay with!</li>
    <li> it was a bit small, but I have a TON of hair and with some wrestling, it fit!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig on March 8th and it took until the last week of March to get it. A total of 3 weeks. To me that is unacceptable. I know it is coming from China, though I didn&#x27;t know that at first. If I had known it was coming from China, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig in the picture looks like a very light blond but when I got it, it was more of a golden blond. So not quite what is pictured and it took too long to get.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a wig that makes you happy why did you come to Amazon for crying out loud. Its not the &#x27;&#x27;cheapest&#x27;&#x27; wig you could get. It&#x27;s not from Paula Young or Raquel. Its only $20 bucks so shut up and put it on your dam head. I bought it , I&#x27;m happy with it. See my comment below.</li>
    <li> Expedited shipping doesn&#x27;t help it arrive on time. Ordered it two weeks before Halloween and it arrived the next freaking day. &amp;#62;:(&lt;br /&gt;Nice wig though, would have gone perfectly with my costume. Comes with a hair net and fits nicely, with no netting showing through. Pretty for the $.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this wig it&#x27;s cheap and it don&#x27;t look anything like the pic ! Total waste of money</li>
    <li> It is sooooo pretty for such little money! I have a lot of thick dark hair and the wig fit over it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be shedding too much and I haven&#x27;t brushed it. But I thought it was even nicer than the pictures showed.</li>
    <li> love this wig. It looked authentic and was comfortable to wear. I was very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this style.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Worked perfectly for costume.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay wig, but the wig itself is too small it fits my 8 year old sister but not me.</li>
    <li> Great wig just as it appears</li>
    <li> Great looking wig. Very natural and a great price. I luv it!</li>
    <li> a little too plastic feeling but otherwise very nice, looks fairly natural until you actually put your hands on it</li>
    <li> This is just what I ordered.This is just what I wanted and I was lucky and happy to find it available from Amazon at a good price and brought right to my door!</li>
    <li> I received this 9 business days after ordering - not a problem.  It arrived in a small plastic shipping bag, and was in its own plastic bag.  The wig came out of the bag in reasonably good condition, just a little mussed and already shedding.  It is not the thinnest wig, I think, but I also think there&#x27;s a good possibility you&#x27;ll be able to see the mesh through the hair while wearing it.  It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, full.  The color is golden, not at all a whitish blonde as it may appear.  Also, the info says it comes with a fishnet wig cap which I assumed would be a separate item.  The wig itself has the fishnet mesh that the hair is attached to, but there was nothing else.  Not a big deal, but why state it that way if it isn&#x27;t so?&lt;br /&gt;I added pictures of it right out of the bag.</li>
    <li> ordered this wig but was sent a different version. the one i received was longer, and the hair seemed to shed alot. i cant say if this reflects the quality of this wig but i would certainly not order the one they sent.</li>
    <li> I may just have a big head cause it&#x27;s a little tight but it&#x27;s great regardless.  Showed up earlier than expected.  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> nice wig....I actually cut this wig into a bob style....and it&#x27;s very light (almost white).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very well made wig for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Looks good&lt;br /&gt;fits well&lt;br /&gt;long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;NOT the color I wanted... more of a dirty blonde then white :(&lt;br /&gt;Tangles easily&lt;br /&gt;TOOK FOREVER to come in!!</li>
    <li> Just received it today, I must say. This wig Is beautiful! Worth the wait</li>
    <li> Wig&#x27;s style is pretty, but the blonde color is very unnatural looking in my opinion. It has combs underneath in the wig cap so is secure.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a cheap wig for a costume party, you found it.  It was so bad that I tossed it into the trash.  It cost more to return it then throw it away.  :(</li>
    <li> Cheap, fake looking &amp; does not fit well.</li>
    <li> We bought this for parties. It&#x27;s very attractively made and with the proper care should last longer than most. The color was spot-on as advertised!</li>
    <li> Great for my Halloween costume !</li>
    <li> This wig is a lot nicer than I was expecting it to be.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, some good some poor I decided for 12 dollars I&#x27;d give it a try.  To my surprise it is a very nice wig.  Best 12 dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent.  I love the color and fits quit well.  For me, it is a lot of hair, very long and I really like the curls.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another from this company maybe not quit so long, at 5 foot 6 it hits me close to my waste.  I just love it!  Did I mention it arrived 6 days earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> To be honest I only bought this because I am a dark brunette (never strayed color wise ever), and really want a big change in looks. I want to go blonde. I bought this to see if I would look rediculous as a blonde or not and it was cheap and looked to be a nice shade. I&#x27;m loving the wig.  No thin spots. No huge knots.  Shade is true to the picture. Lovely curls. Would make wonderful costume wig.  I don&#x27;t know about wearing all the time, because personally,  I can&#x27;t stand to wear them very long.</li>
    <li> This wig is much shorter than it looks in this picture. It doesn&#x27;t have very much hair and is made for a tiny head. It&#x27;s not even convincing enough to use for sexy-time costumes. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I had not expected this wig to be so beautiful. The color is very pretty it is actually alot darker than pictured but once you put it on its such a beautiful shade of blond very natural. I Love it! Money well spent! It actually didn&#x27;t take that long to ship either 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> The wig is very nice. it looks very similar to real hair. I have notes to make though. The wig isn&#x27;t very full. its like they used the minimum amount of hair they could possibly use, so if you want to pull the hair forward, over your shoulders, the net will show. also my second complaint isn&#x27;t really a big deal. the company totes that they send with the wig a complimentary wig cap. They did. and it works very well, the only problem is that it is a BLACK wig cap and the wig is platinum blonde! i&#x27;d suggest using a different wig cap because the black is obvious. but other than than, you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> this wig is way too small for me and i dont have a big head. however it fits my 4 yr old daughter just fine. Not not order</li>
    <li> I was a little let cow by the color which was much more yellow the in the picture and much shorter</li>
    <li> very nice wig. It has a thin cap though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a really quality wig, but it will work for&lt;br /&gt;a costume.</li>
    <li> Okay this was a cute wig, I never really wear wigs but decided YOLO. I liked it and took a picture pretty much straight out of the package. Bangs are a little long but a side swipe works with the design and style of the wig. So far I like it thanks!</li>
    <li> GREAT WIG I WOULD GET ANOTHER WHEN IF EVER THIS ONE GETS OLD YOU CAN BRUSH IT COMB IT WASH IT AND THE GIRLS KEEP ON KEEPING ON GIRLS THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIEST WIGS I HAVE BOUGHT YET TO CARE FOR AND WEAR IN GENERAL GOOD ITEM</li>
    <li> Fun wig. Easy to brush the hair. The one I received was more of a dark blonde than the one in the picture but still a good wig.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this wig today but was totally worth the money and the wait. I was kind of on the fence about getting this wig cause it does not look all that full in the back and looks kind of sparce. My only complaint was the wait. It feels just like real hair and is at a great length. Its way comphy to wear and light. I would so highly recomand this company and this wig. I am totally buying from them as soon as i can.</li>
    <li> IT was just what I wanted. There are clips on the wig that help hold it in place</li>
    <li> I got this wig for my Halloween costume (Bernadette from the big bang theory) and it is nearly perfect! The bangs are a little long so I plan on trimming them so they aren&#x27;t poking me in the eyes, but the length is great (maybe a little shorter than pictured?) and the color is just how it looks in the picture. It was shipped to me fairly fast, but I ordered the one that was fulfilled by amazon. It does fit a little snug on the largest setting (there is are bands inside to make it smaller).</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig.  It fits my head comfortably and is very light and breathable--surprising, since it also has a very thick, I want to say natural amount of hair fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color and length in the display photo are spot on.  The wig holds its curls, even through light teasing and gentle combing.  I have braided it, pinned it up, worn it tied back, and it still looks as great as the day I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purchase, zero regrets, I want more in this style with different natural hair colors, I would gladly buy a dozen more.  It is absolutely worth the couple weeks&#x27; wait for shipping.  Buy this item.</li>
    <li> This was amazing!!  Perfect with my angel costume from amazon.  A keeper!  Good quality. .</li>
    <li> This keeps showing up on my &amp;#34;Review&amp;#34; page, but  never received it. Wondering.....I ordered the 3 I received, but will make an inquiry to Amazon. Also, I did order 3 very inexpensive wigs.. Bought  this one in hot red on another page, $6.99... to use for art projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do shed, look fake, and that&#x27;s why I ordered them for non-humanoids! But what would anyone expect for that price? See my other review for one that was far better and as shown, but still, for a mannequin head. (I looked so good in a silly photo posing with it on, that some friends thought it was real, and thatI restyled and added more color to my own hair!)</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but messy. Very impressed by the glossyness of the hair.</li>
    <li> OK wig, pretty curls, nice and full, cap doesn&#x27;t show through.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig. Nice curls. Well worth the wait. Excellent bargain! Buy this.</li>
    <li> Too large for my small head. A little above average costume wig</li>
    <li> For the price I paid (much less than $20), this wig was a great purchase.  I was really trying to avoid the fake plastic-y shine in photos that you usually see with inexpensive blonde wigs especially with flash, and this did the trick.  I have very long, thick dark hair that i was worried it would look lumpy, but after putting it under a wig cap, there were no weird lumps thanks to the fullness of the wig.  I could even put the wig hair in a low ponytail and clip the bangs and it still looked pretty natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Package did not include the wig cap specified in the info.  On me the wig was slightly shorter than it appears on the model head, but it suited my needs.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the Price !  Love wearing it, nice Color a bit Darker than Photo shown here !  A more Medium Blonde than Light Blnde color wise !</li>
    <li> The piece was exactly what I needed, I very happy with what came in the mail. I gave it a high rating because it was a good price as well as good quality. The reason I didn&#x27;t give the wig 5 stars would be that the wig itself was slightly more blonde then the white blonde provided in the picture. But it&#x27;s still a great wig and I recommend buying it for any cosplay or costume!</li>
    <li> Excellent wig for cosplay</li>
    <li> It was described as blond but it is paper white.</li>
    <li> Super high quality for the price! And it came really fast. It went perfectly with my costume.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for a costume party. I didn&#x27;t expect it to look like real hair or anything but I was very disappointed with the color. As pictured, I expected to receive a light blonde wig. What I got was medium reddish blonde with streaks of the light blonde.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price... and came in time for Halloween even though its shipped from China. .. only took 2 and a half weeks for me to get it .... it even came with a hair net to hold my hair under the wig.... great buy</li>
    <li> This seller was very easy to work with and facilitated my special needs.</li>
    <li> I had to do some trimming on this, which my friend did for me, but it&#x27;s amazing and I love it. :)</li>
    <li> Purchased it for use with a costume. Have not yet used it, but the appearance is great.</li>
    <li> Nicer than expected! Color is great</li>
    <li> excellent product for the price</li>
    <li> love this wig..... I used it more like a half wig...  so my hair blended great. I do wish they would come with the clips. don&#x27;t know how ANYONE could wear one without them.  for the price..... you can&#x27;t beat it. Yes at the very top you could see but  I wore a hat</li>
    <li> Totally fake looking and feeling. Worth the 10 bucks but not more</li>
    <li> A lot yellower then the picture. Also really small. Does not fit my large (23 inch) head.</li>
    <li> This wig is a really nice surprise! it looks like how it does in the photo. Unfortunately, I had to wait an extra week than predicted, but the wait was worth it. Not only that, but when I contacted the seller, the seller was really nice and respectful and made sure I got my product. The customer service was what stood out. The wig is a little itchy, so just buy a wig cap.</li>
    <li> White-blond in color, true to picture.  Hair is a little thin and so you need a skin colored wig cap to wear with the wig.  Bangs are very long and will need to be trimmed. Not quite as curly as the picture seems to show, but definitely has a nice waviness to it. Cap is a little bit on the small size for my big head.  Appears to be Kanekalon. Good deal for a costume or a party.  For example it would be very good for Avengers \\&quot;Storm\\&quot; costume.  My husband wore it for a Hunger Games costume party.</li>
    <li> I love this wig. I&#x27;ve worn it twice so far. No shedding, not ripping when brushed and it looks natural.</li>
    <li> This wig is nice, but the color is COMPLETELY misleading in the photo! The photo makes it look Platinum Blonde, and it is very, VERY clearly \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; or \\&quot;sandy\\&quot; blonde at best. It&#x27;s technically a light brown. I know the description says that PC monitors may affect how the color is viewed, but that is a flat-out trick that must allow the seller to get away w/ selling a brown wig labeled as blonde. Even if I darken my PC, the photo still clearly looks like a totally blonde wig w/ no brown hairs in it. But the wig barely has ANY blonde hairs in it at all. If you are looking for a fun wig to just play dress-up, it&#x27;s fine. But I bought it for a celebrity costume, and I searched high and low for the perfect platinum wig in this style, and now I have wasted my money. FALSE ADVERTISING IS A CRIME!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic color and styling (the curls look amazing), high quality feel as well. Watch for the bangs though, they can get a little out of hand. Bobby pins or hair clips were the only way to keep the bangs out of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I did not like this wig at all. Its alot more yellow than the picture, it tangled very easily, and looks extremely fake. I&#x27;d only recomend it for a halloween costume or something. Definitely not even worth the $15. Lol.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t stay on my head</li>
    <li> The color isn&#x27;t platnium... it does have a very slight yellow tone to it. The bangs are pretty intense. It&#x27;s very heavy and the bangs go from one temple to the other and a lot of hair is used... so don&#x27;t expect it to be a lightly side swept look. It&#x27;s a fun wig so it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a gag gift to use at work.  For the price, it was great since I didn&#x27;t want to spend much on something that was going to get used maybe once if the person lost the bet.</li>
    <li> Great wig! Easy to style, looked and acted like real hair and withstood the tossing and dancing of 4 &amp;#34;Silly Girls&amp;#34; during our musical and still look great!</li>
    <li> arrived quick was nice pale blonde really soft and silky id buy it again ;) happy</li>
    <li> The wig was terrible quality and cant even wear it because its to small. The people would not refund my money so i have a useless wig now. DO NOT recomend this people</li>
    <li> Looks pretty real as long as you don&#x27;t look too close.  The hair is thin, but for the price its a pretty nice wig.</li>
