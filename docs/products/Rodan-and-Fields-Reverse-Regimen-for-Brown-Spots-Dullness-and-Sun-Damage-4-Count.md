### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>In fact I&#x27;ve always had really great skin!</li>
      <li>Tart Amazonian clay foundation has given me the best coverage.</li>
      <li>and it smells great.</li>
      <li>I like the sunscreen, works great.  </li>
      <li>Buy a goot exfoliating scrub, witch hazel for the toner and a good moisturizer with sunscreen</li>
      <li>Probably a good product</li>
      <li>People please chose wisely before finalizing your decision on R&amp;F Reverse.</li>
      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>If you follow the regimen as directed, you will see amazing results.</li>
      <li>My skin also has a healthy glow that it never had before</li>
      <li>The best part is, if you buy from an actual consultant, and if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, R+F gives you a 60-day, money-back guarantee.</li>
      <li>I wanted to be in love with this regimen, and I do think it would probably do a wonderful job, if I could actually wear it twice a day as instructed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper products out there</li>
      <li>I have gotten better results from Nuance and Neutrogena.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd purchase and feel great about my age spots vanishing before my eyes!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about 5 weeks free of the product and the huge pimples are mostly gone</li>
      <li>Sure, we all want results, and we want them quickly, but this sun damage took years to show.</li>
      <li>Excited that I tried this.</li>
      <li>After using the product and having such great success, I became a consultant for R+F.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many face products and this regime really works for me.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t sell it myself if I didn&#x27;t love it so much.</li>
      <li>I like reverse&#x27;s facial wash, smells good.  </li>
      <li>my skin has improved  tremendously.</li>
      <li>But, the creams are so overly rich that I can&#x27;t wear them during the day - my makeup slides right off.  </li>
      <li>Save your money for something better that spends the company&#x27;s money on high quality components instead of marketing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is way overpriced...not worth it.</li>
      <li>I am seeing some results by using it at night only, but I&#x27;d prefer to be able to wear it twice a day per the instructions and get the full benefit.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various products and I&#x27;ve had the most success with Aveeno day and night lotion...</li>
      <li>It did not irritate my skin (fair, European skin), and moisturized fine, but did not really do anything to lighten my melasma as promised.</li>
      <li>My skin feels good though, but for the price, I am not sure it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>Glad I just sent it back.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to take again.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re interested in a discount, email me amorin31@yahoo.com</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>I just honestly really like their products.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love rodan and fields.</li>
      <li>The toner has a nice cool feeling on my skin but it has a few harsh chemicals that isn&#x27;t good for you to use daily as it doesn&#x27;t give your skin enough time to heal and you end up over-exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Certainly not enough to pay that much for it.</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of products from department stores, direct sellers, and even my dermatologist</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin for soothe, and I don&#x27;t have acne breakout for unblemish.  </li>
      <li>I use less concealer and am no afraid to go out without makeup.</li>
      <li>After one use looks and feels like I had a major chemical peel.</li>
      <li>Oh for those who wants to know, I was only trying to get rid of the melasma on both sides of my cheeks and a few brown spots from old acne scars, which was not bad compared to other users based on the pictures I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>The price is very well not worth it.</li>
      <li>It CAN be harsh on your skin, which is why you have to start off by using it once a day for the first week, gradually working up to twice a day.</li>

<li> It CAN be harsh on your skin, which is why you have to start off by using it once a day for the first week, gradually working up to twice a day.</li>
<li> I followed directions, used it until I emptied it, but it did not clear nor lighten any sun/dark/brown spots at all.  </li>
<li> So due to my simple skin condition(s), I thought it would be a no brainer for Reverse to work</li>
<li> but I still have hundreds of tiny bumps along my jawline and down my neck.</li>
<li> Maybe it will work if you spend money on the other products but that is not a risk</li>
<li> I&#x27;m extremely allergic to something in this product.  </li>
<li> I looked at the other regimens to see if I could use it, but I don&#x27;t have wrinkles for redefine</li>
<li> I think you have to buy the Accelerator Pack in addition to the Reverse Regimen for noticeable fading due to hydroquinone in those.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed because I was excited and had high hopes in this product based the reviews and celebrity endorsements.</li>
<li> So it gets 2 stars for moisturizing but is really not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
<li> There is no hydroquinone in this line--all the ingredients are typical of what you would see in the Neutrogena, L&#x27;Oreal, Lumene or Strivectin products.</li>
<li> The sunscreen is too greasy for my face and the toner has an odd smell.</li>
<li> I wanted to like it so badly and had such high hopes.  </li>
<li> It got worse and worse until I had to go buy foundation for the first time in years.</li>
<li> Not worth the money!</li>
<li> This will help remove any unwanted dark spots!</li>
<li> Not happy with their products...tried several.</li>
<li> They tried to tell me to take a break, I was scrubbing too hard.</li>
<li> I seriously want to recommend this product because I have friends who are consultants, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me like those before and after pictures on Facebook or Twitter.  </li>
<li> but I was dead wrong.  </li>
<li> My daughter bought this for me-I am not sure what she paid for it-surely not almost $200!!!</li>
<li> I am a former sun worshiper and had horrible melasma and had to cover up with makeup for years.</li>
<li> I am a very skeptical person when it comes to skincare but</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had bad skin.</li>
<li> Go to the rodan and fields website and you can see just how badly this person is trying to scam you.</li>
<li> But I had horrible reactions to it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This will help remove any unwanted dark spots! If you&#x27;re interested in a discount, email me amorin31@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t order this product for retail price.</li>
    <li> Not happy with their products...tried several. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I wanted to be in love with this regimen, and I do think it would probably do a wonderful job, if I could actually wear it twice a day as instructed. But, the creams are so overly rich that I can&#x27;t wear them during the day - my makeup slides right off.  I am seeing some results by using it at night only, but I&#x27;d prefer to be able to wear it twice a day per the instructions and get the full benefit.  Probably a good product but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely allergic to something in this product.  I had to get a shot for my reaction and I looked like I&#x27;d had a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> I followed directions, used it until I emptied it, but it did not clear nor lighten any sun/dark/brown spots at all.  I did a before and after picture and didn&#x27;t see anything different.  My skin feels good though, but for the price, I am not sure it&#x27;s worth it.  I looked at the other regimens to see if I could use it, but I don&#x27;t have wrinkles for redefine, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin for soothe, and I don&#x27;t have acne breakout for unblemish.  I like reverse&#x27;s facial wash, smells good.  I like the sunscreen, works great.  The toner has a nice cool feeling on my skin but it has a few harsh chemicals that isn&#x27;t good for you to use daily as it doesn&#x27;t give your skin enough time to heal and you end up over-exfoliating.  In fact if you look at witch hazel and alcohol, those two ingredients are what a lot of dermatologist do NOT recommend for toners anymore.  You can Google that information too.  I seriously want to recommend this product because I have friends who are consultants, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me like those before and after pictures on Facebook or Twitter.  I wanted to like it so badly and had such high hopes.  I think that&#x27;s why they have money back guarantee because it will probably work on some skin types but not all.  Just like medication, sometimes you have to try different ones as everyone&#x27;s body reacts different to each medication.  One star for the wash and one star for the SPF sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months and have not seen any difference in my melasma, sun spots, or acne marks. The sunscreen is too greasy for my face and the toner has an odd smell. I&#x27;ve tried various products and I&#x27;ve had the most success with Aveeno day and night lotion...go figure. I&#x27;m diligent about sunscreen and wearing hats in the sun.  Tart Amazonian clay foundation has given me the best coverage.</li>
    <li> I am a former sun worshiper and had horrible melasma and had to cover up with makeup for years. I am a very skeptical person when it comes to skincare but Rodan and Fields changed that for me. After using Reverse, I no longer need foundation to cover up! My skin also has a healthy glow that it never had before and it smells great. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t work.  This company is a pyramid scheme.  Consider that there are numerous levels of salespeople about the person selling to you.  Each one of those layers is taking 5%.  Stay away. Save your money for something better that spends the company&#x27;s money on high quality components instead of marketing.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give 0 stars. I do wanted it to work. But I had horrible reactions to it. After one use looks and feels like I had a major chemical peel. I have hives and swelling all per my face. Can&#x27;t even go out in public because I look contagious. Watch out. Wish I knew what I reacted to.</li>
    <li> Excited that I tried this. I&#x27;m on my 2nd purchase and feel great about my age spots vanishing before my eyes!!</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for me-I am not sure what she paid for it-surely not almost $200!!! She said it had helped her get rid of a couple of brown spots. I have been using it for about a month and I am not seeing any results. Certainly not enough to pay that much for it. I think you could get similar results by going to the drug store and buying cheaper ,similar products. Buy a goot exfoliating scrub, witch hazel for the toner and a good moisturizer with sunscreen and you will get the same results.</li>
    <li> If you follow the regimen as directed, you will see amazing results. It CAN be harsh on your skin, which is why you have to start off by using it once a day for the first week, gradually working up to twice a day. Sure, we all want results, and we want them quickly, but this sun damage took years to show. Results are not going to be overnight. I have also used the REDEFINE regemin, and it dramatically changed the look and feel of my skin. I use less concealer and am no afraid to go out without makeup. After using the product and having such great success, I became a consultant for R+F. I wouldn&#x27;t sell it myself if I didn&#x27;t love it so much. The best part is, if you buy from an actual consultant, and if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, R+F gives you a 60-day, money-back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of products from department stores, direct sellers, and even my dermatologist but this did the trick. I got it from a consultant I found on line and it has only been 2 weeks and 3 days I have been on it and my skin has improved  tremendously. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It did not irritate my skin (fair, European skin), and moisturized fine, but did not really do anything to lighten my melasma as promised. I think you have to buy the Accelerator Pack in addition to the Reverse Regimen for noticeable fading due to hydroquinone in those. There is no hydroquinone in this line--all the ingredients are typical of what you would see in the Neutrogena, L&#x27;Oreal, Lumene or Strivectin products. I have gotten better results from Nuance and Neutrogena. So it gets 2 stars for moisturizing but is really not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many face products and this regime really works for me. Please note I am NOT a R&amp;F sales rep...I just honestly really like their products. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> This product works but you have to use it diligently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had bad skin. In fact I&#x27;ve always had really great skin! But I wanted to lighten some brown spots id gotten from pregnancies. After two weeks I started breaking out. It got worse and worse until I had to go buy foundation for the first time in years. They tried to tell me to take a break, I was scrubbing too hard. Give it 3 days&#x27; rest and the start up again. Glad I just sent it back. My skin has all kinds of issues that I&#x27;ve since found out are from over drying. I&#x27;m about 5 weeks free of the product and the huge pimples are mostly gone but I still have hundreds of tiny bumps along my jawline and down my neck. I am so upset!!!!</li>
    <li> OVERPRICED!!! Go to the rodan and fields website and you can see just how badly this person is trying to scam you. Other than that, I love rodan and fields.</li>
    <li> People this stuff does not work and I bought it from a consultant. I&#x27;m very disappointed because I was excited and had high hopes in this product based the reviews and celebrity endorsements. I was what you call bamboozled. There is nothing more frustrating than using a product as instructed day and night for 2 months with no results!  The price is very well not worth it. People please chose wisely before finalizing your decision on R&amp;F Reverse. Please don&#x27;t let your consultant talk that consultant talk by making you feel compelled to buy.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper products out there that works and works sooner than 2 months. Oh for those who wants to know, I was only trying to get rid of the melasma on both sides of my cheeks and a few brown spots from old acne scars, which was not bad compared to other users based on the pictures I&#x27;ve seen. So due to my simple skin condition(s), I thought it would be a no brainer for Reverse to work but I was dead wrong.  Maybe it will work if you spend money on the other products but that is not a risk I&#x27;m willing to take again. This stuff is way overpriced...not worth it. I officially don&#x27;t believe pictures and reviews that I read on the internet!</li>
