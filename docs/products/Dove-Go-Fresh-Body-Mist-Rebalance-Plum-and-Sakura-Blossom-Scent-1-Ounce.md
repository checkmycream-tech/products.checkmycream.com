    <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.  I miss being able to buy it in the stores.  i wish Dove would bring it back.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent. Wish they didn&#x27;t stop selling them in stores, and wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much for just a few bottles. Alas, my addiction to the smell keeps me purchasing.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite body spray. It smells so clean. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should. Only problem, which isn&#x27;t really a problem, is you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I can only order it on line.</li>
