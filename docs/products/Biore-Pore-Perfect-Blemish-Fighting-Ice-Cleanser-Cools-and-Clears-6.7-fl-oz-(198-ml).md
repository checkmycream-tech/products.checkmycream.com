### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;This is a marvelous product.  </li>
      <li>Squeezing the pus out of blackheads until they decoupage the bathroom mirror is not the best way to address ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice--not too flowery and very pleasant.</li>
      <li>I did not find a great degree of tightness.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
      <li>so I happily agreed to review the Blemish Fighting Ice Cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and she saw a great improvement.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need a lot at all, so for the price it is a great value.</li>
      <li>This cleanser contains 2% salicylic acid, which is great for those who have acne.</li>
      <li>is very effective.  </li>
      <li>Beyond that, this is about as good a cleanser</li>
      <li>It did a good job of cleaning off all of my makeup.  </li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It applies as a nice foam that feels and smells good.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore - I love this product!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice...not overwhelming but pleasant and within an acceptable limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the results are amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a nice cleanser.</li>
      <li>Seems to be effective too.</li>
      <li>This is a nice face wash.  </li>
      <li>icky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a lot like dish soap...kinda like a soapy liquid feel although it does provide a nice lather.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve honestly been using this since I was in my teens and never found another product that does the job like this does.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s best to use with a decent moisturizer</li>
      <li>this cleanser feels great,  squeaky clean feeling and the salicylic acid  </li>
      <li>Love it and will keep using it for sure!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that paired with Neutrogena&#x27;s Natural moisturizer, for me is the best combination.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and makes my skin feel clean.  </li>
      <li>Despite the fact that initially I was impressed by this product...soon after using it started to &#x27;warm up&#x27;.</li>
      <li>This Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser lathers pretty nicely and feels good being applied to my face.</li>
      <li>Indeed, I believe many people will love this about the product:</li>
      <li>This cleanser was too runny, so make sure to pump it into the palm of your hand and not on your fingertips</li>
      <li>I think they have been an innovative addition to the world of skincare products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, my grand experiment was a bust...</li>
      <li>It seems to be more of a surfactant (foaming agent) than a blemish fighting agent.  </li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite product for face.  </li>
      <li>I use the cleanser each night and love it.  </li>
      <li>Sure, some is the product itself, but I was amazed at the amount of dirt that came off a \\&quot;clean\\&quot;</li>
      <li>/&gt;I can&#x27;t fault either in terms of results and performance, but the Biore is more enjoyable to use.</li>
      <li>My skin does feel cleaner and looks better.  </li>
      <li>Biore foams and rinses, leaving my combination skin nice and clean.</li>
      <li>This Biore Blemish Fighting \\&quot;Ice: cleaner makes your face feel very clean, indeed.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and my skin feels clean and fresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although middle-aged, I&#x27;m still prone to the sporadic blemish and liked the idea of salicylic acid which leaves skin with a fresh look and healthy appearance.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s winter now and my mom skin is fighting dryness rather than the bumps that come with summer oil, so it&#x27;s really not the best time to be testing an acne product with 2% salicylic acid.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, fresh scent that I quite like.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall though, I liked the mild scent and the rich, oily texture.  </li>
      <li>It has a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or my skin at all.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily.</li>
      <li>While I did get a bit in my eye it flushed out easily and didn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
      <li>My teens have used Biore products with good results for years and this is decent addition to their skin care</li>
      <li>The Biore has a fresher scent that is more botanical in nature, and my face feels cool after using it.</li>
      <li>I have mild Rosacea so many cleansers with a litany of ingredients tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am just thinking that with MY type of skin I am better off using a really mild cleanser and then just spot applying a blemish cream where needed instead of all over the surface of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am just thinking that with MY type of skin I am better off using a really mild cleanser and then just spot applying a blemish cream where needed instead of all over the surface of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>The primary ingredient salicyclic acid has been associated with Reye&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
      <li>Fighting Ice Cleanser uses salicylic acid as its primary anti-acne ingredient.</li>
      <li>This wash has a light, fragrant scent which I like.  </li>
      <li>After watching a YouTube video where this product was recommended, I decided I would buy it since it is cheap</li>
      <li>It reduced the visibility of my clogged pores, so it was worth it. :)</li>
      <li>I gotta begin by saying what I loved most about this cleanser was its \\&quot;ice\\&quot; effect, that tingly, cooling sensation left on the skin afterwards</li>
      <li>Now, this new stuff has a more chemically, eucalyptus smell compared to the older formula (which had a pleasant, cucumber scent), and it does nothing for my oily, acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and smooth after being washed off.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once a day though at first.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been using this with a shower puff to scrub my back and that is also clearing up nicely!</li>
      <li>I like facial washers that are more substance and have some kind of exfoliating beads that dig into my pores.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soothing, reassuring, and just leaves the skin feeling absolutely clean.  </li>
      <li>This Biore Blemish Fighting cleanser works well to clean my skin.</li>
      <li>I find this face wash to be effective in keeping my skin clear.</li>
      <li>This is a fair cleanser, and needs to only be used once a day.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I really think some of the many surfactants are under fire and unnecessary.\\&quot;ICE\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;After washing this leaves my face feeling clean and non-oily although it didn&#x27;t seem to have that promised fresh and invigorating feeling.</li>
      <li>product works, clearing up my blemishes fairly quickly, and it requires figuring out how often to use it.</li>
      <li>This is the second Biore product that I&#x27;ve used and I have to say that overall I&#x27;m really impressed with it and the company itself.</li>
      <li>but at what cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild Rosacea</li>
      <li>A warm rather than hot facial wash seems to allow the product to clean your face but is not overly drying.</li>
      <li>This means it will likely be effective.</li>
      <li>So, in our experience, for intermittent problems with acne, this is an effective facial</li>
      <li>and I rarely see ant pimples anymore at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but the results are so good that I can easily look past the smell.</li>
      <li>The right balance for me was using it before going to bed and then applying a moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin so this is huge for me.</li>
      <li>I actually have to use a moisturizer afterwards, except I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer on my t-zones where it&#x27;s most oily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been hitting the gym more often and was getting the dreaded back acne from where my sports bra was rubbing on my skin...</li>
      <li>&quot; My skin feels really soft and smooth after I use it.</li>
      <li>If this is a problem, we have found that hot water exacerbates the drying problem.</li>
      <li>The end result is the same: VERY clean</li>
      <li>If you want to see how well this works, take a clean face cloth, soak it and wring out - the water is clear.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser works well and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I only need a very small dot of this cleanser to clean my face and it feels great on my skin.</li>
      <li>Do not use this product more than once a day - it will DRY your skin out!  </li>
      <li>so I will return to straight pin and tweezer artwork when so required.</li>
      <li>and it seems to really suck the oil off my face.</li>
      <li>I do notice that I don&#x27;t have breakouts as much.</li>
      <li>It really helps with oily skin, and calms irritated spots as well.</li>
      <li>It is VERY drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of Nature&#x27;s remedies that really works, and is found in willow tree bark.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m stocking up as much as I can.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found success using it every other day and applying a light moisturizer afterward</li>
      <li>My skin looks smooth and clean and it hasn&#x27;t dried me out at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore - I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cleanser for years now. It&#x27;s the only product that manages to keep my skin clear. However, it can be a bit drying so it&#x27;s best to use with a decent moisturizer, otherwise dry patches will pop up like crazy. I&#x27;ve found that paired with Neutrogena&#x27;s Natural moisturizer, for me is the best combination. The menthol in it feels wonderfully cool, especially during summer when I&#x27;ve been in the heat all day (Just be careful not to get in your nose or eyes!! I learned that the hard way!). I have very sensitive skin so it takes me a while to find something that truly helps keep my break-outs at bay. Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser has been a miracle for my skin and I&#x27;ll be a customer until they stop selling it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the blemish-fighting ice cleanser since Biore was still using the green packaging, and I just re-purchased this.  Now, this new stuff has a more chemically, eucalyptus smell compared to the older formula (which had a pleasant, cucumber scent), and it does nothing for my oily, acne-prone skin.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed anything, but now, I have a really bad rash on my face instead of the fresh, clear skin I used to have when I used the older formula.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very hard to find and I am wondering if it has been discontinued.  I use the cleanser each night and love it.  I hope I can continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other facial cleansers, but none seem to have any really noticeable effect on my clogged pores. After watching a YouTube video where this product was recommended, I decided I would buy it since it is cheap and I have nothing to lose. It is not some miracle face cleaner, but it has worked better than any other product I have tried. It reduced the visibility of my clogged pores, so it was worth it. :)</li>
    <li> Love the ice cold sensation of this product.</li>
    <li> I find this face wash to be effective in keeping my skin clear. However, it is a bit drying. If you use it once a day or once every other day, you can combat the dryness.</li>
    <li> This Biore Blemish Fighting cleanser works well to clean my skin. It lathers well. Only a small amount is needed or else it&#x27;s difficult to completely rinse off. It has a pleasant scent and my skin feels clean and fresh after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use it daily though, it&#x27;s too drying to my skin. The active ingredient is salicylic acid 2% and it seems to really suck the oil off my face. I&#x27;ve found success using it every other day and applying a light moisturizer afterward (I use Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Purpose moisturizer). On the alternate days, I use Clean &amp; Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser.</li>
    <li> This Biore Blemish Fighting \\&quot;Ice: cleaner makes your face feel very clean, indeed. My teens have used Biore products with good results for years and this is decent addition to their skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using as directed will keep your skin clean, but twice a day might dry your skin out too much during the winter months. My kids have noticed an improvement in their completions since starting to use this in the morning and using other \\&quot;targeting\\&quot; products at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> My teens have been using this along with the [[ASIN:B00ATY942M Biore Acne Clearing Scrub (1% Sal Acid), 4.5 Ounce]] and the results are amazing. This has a slightly flowery smell and is clear.  The clearing scrub is orange and smells like the orange scrubbing hand cleaner. So after a few weeks the boys started exclusively using the Scrub and my daughter prefers the Ice Cleanser. The active ingredient in this 2% salicylic acid and is the same that is used in the Proactiv Gentle Formula . This is also a fraction of the price of Proactiv. I wish they have subscribe and save though because a monthly or bi-monthly subscription would be convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO MAGIC OR SECRET INGREDIENT TO OVER THE COUNTER ACNE MEDICINE. They all use benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as antibacterial ingredients. I was a little concerned about my kids putting medicine on their skin so I did a little research. Both of those ingredients cause an allergic reaction in a small fraction of the population so if you have an allergy to aspirin or notice any rash, hives, itching, redness, swelling or difficulty breathing then you should stop. Allergies that lead to difficulty breathing are life-threatening, and should be treated as medical emergencies.</li>
    <li> Biore Blem Fighting Ice Cleanser uses salicylic acid as its primary anti-acne ingredient. This means it will likely be effective. It is helpful for my wife when she develops some acne each month. Her primary complaint with this and other salicylic acid products is that it can dry your skin out. If this is a problem, we have found that hot water exacerbates the drying problem. A warm rather than hot facial wash seems to allow the product to clean your face but is not overly drying. So, in our experience, for intermittent problems with acne, this is an effective facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend for adolescents (and especially children), that you would discuss the risks and benefits with your dermatologist or other doctor. The primary ingredient salicyclic acid has been associated with Reye&#x27;s Syndrome. National Reye&#x27;s Syndrome Foundation warns that salicyclates in creams may be a cause of Reye&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
    <li> Although middle-aged, I&#x27;m still prone to the sporadic blemish and liked the idea of salicylic acid which leaves skin with a fresh look and healthy appearance. However, I totally disliked this product! First, it leaked and although it was wrapped in a bag so didn&#x27;t cause a mess, it was still sticky and icky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a lot like dish soap...kinda like a soapy liquid feel although it does provide a nice lather. The fragrance is nice...not overwhelming but pleasant and within an acceptable limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing this leaves my face feeling clean and non-oily although it didn&#x27;t seem to have that promised fresh and invigorating feeling. No big deal, my face still felt clean and non-oily. So, why the one star ranking?  Despite the fact that initially I was impressed by this product...soon after using it started to &#x27;warm up&#x27;. My face felt hotter and hotter. My checks got redder and redder. Soon it felt like a sunburn and then an outright allergic reaction. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t turn out to be serious but was itchy, red and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my knowledge, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with salicylic acid so what may cause a red irritated sunburnt feel is beyond me...I have to assume it is the salicylic acid but again, it&#x27;s not been a problem in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY uncomfortable and I do NOT recommend for those with sensitive skin or potential allergies.</li>
    <li> I was sent both the 4 in 1 Detoxifying Foam and the Blemish Fighting Ice cleanser at the same time.  While the Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser is decent, it leaves my skin feeling tight, and no matter how much I rinse my face it always feels as if there&#x27;s a thin layer of \\&quot;something\\&quot; left on my skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the Blemish Fighting Ice (in fact I gave it away to a friend, and she didn&#x27;t particularly care for it either), but I would recommend the Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Foam to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s winter now and my mom skin is fighting dryness rather than the bumps that come with summer oil, so it&#x27;s really not the best time to be testing an acne product with 2% salicylic acid.  It is VERY drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I liked the mild scent and the rich, oily texture.  I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin, but as I said I don&#x27;t tend to have any breakouts during winter.  They come with exercise, outdoors when the temperature rises.</li>
    <li> This is a nice face wash.  It has a pleasant smell and makes my skin feel clean.  I like the pump bottle and the fact that it foams slightly when you apply so you can see what areas of your face you have covered.</li>
    <li> If you want to see how well this works, take a clean face cloth, soak it and wring out - the water is clear.  Use this stuff as directed, remove with the face-cloth. Soak and wring out again - keep soaking and wringing out.  Sure, some is the product itself, but I was amazed at the amount of dirt that came off a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin. This stuff tingles - not to the point of being uncomfortable, but close. The \\&quot;fumes\\&quot; were a slight irritant to my eyes, but again, not bad - just noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient is 2% salicylic acid - the same active ingredient in Aspirin. It&#x27;s one of Nature&#x27;s remedies that really works, and is found in willow tree bark.</li>
    <li> You know that feeling you get when you bite into a York Peppermint Patty...well that is what you face is going to feel like when you apply Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser to your face...icy tingly feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feeling about this cleanser.  It does remove dirt, oil and makeup and left my face feeling \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean afterwards.  I like facial washers that are more substance and have some kind of exfoliating beads that dig into my pores. I just prefer using exfoliating scrubs like [[ASIN:B00ATY942M Biore Acne Clearing Scrub]].  This cleanser was too runny, so make sure to pump it into the palm of your hand and not on your fingertips or it will slide down in between your fingers.  Resembles unhardened clear gelatin.  I also did not care for the scent of the product.  Had a medicine like aroma. However, it did not overly dry my skin and my skin was left smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I gotta begin by saying what I loved most about this cleanser was its \\&quot;ice\\&quot; effect, that tingly, cooling sensation left on the skin afterwards that assured me I had in fact washed my face.  Indeed, I believe many people will love this about the product: it&#x27;s soothing, reassuring, and just leaves the skin feeling absolutely clean.  Beyond that, this is about as good a cleanser I&#x27;d expect from Biore.  Skin is well-cleansed and left just dry enough to impact acne--I did not find it overdrying as some products can be, so those suffering from combination skin might do well by this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This cleanser contains 2% salicylic acid, which is great for those who have acne. Since my skin still breaks out, I always use an acne cleanser. This one gives my skin a little tingling sensation while using it. This cleanser works well and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cleanser. It contains enough salicylic acid (2%) to help cut back on breakouts, but isn&#x27;t too drying even with daily use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once a day though at first. As always, your skin might get a little whacky when first starting a new product, especially one with salicylic acid, so don&#x27;t be too freaked out if you think you see more breakouts in the first week or so. Once you know your skin can tolerate it, or if you have severe breakouts or if you break out often, you can bump up to twice a day, but you may need a moisturizer to try and replenish some of the lost moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has somewhat of a cooling feeling when you use it. I assume that is why it is called \\&quot;Ice Cleanser.\\&quot; My skin feels really soft and smooth after I use it. I do notice that I don&#x27;t have breakouts as much. I usually only get a few tiny pimples here and there - nothing major, maybe just a few pimples a month - but they have definitely decreased in occurrence and I rarely see ant pimples anymore at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 15 year old daughter started using it and she saw a great improvement. She has typical teen acne and always had at least a few pimples. This cleanser has almost totally cleared up her skin, so far. We will keep buying it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate either of us and doesn&#x27;t dry out our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty big and you don&#x27;t need a lot at all, so for the price it is a great value. Something that actually works and doesn&#x27;t come in a tiny tube - it will last a while.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m also acne prone so I need to use something with salicylic acid in it... and hope it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and make it worse. I&#x27;ve been using this product on my skin for the past week and I&#x27;m really happy with it. My skin looks smooth and clean and it hasn&#x27;t dried me out at all. I&#x27;ve also been hitting the gym more often and was getting the dreaded back acne from where my sports bra was rubbing on my skin... so I&#x27;ve been using this with a shower puff to scrub my back and that is also clearing up nicely! I like products with menthol in them, this one is a bit different in that it&#x27;s almost a fruity menthol smell which I&#x27;m not used to and I&#x27;m not sure I like but the results are so good that I can easily look past the smell.</li>
    <li> This review is from: Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser, 6.77 Ounce (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program&lt;br /&gt;This product works, clearing up my blemishes fairly quickly, and it requires figuring out how often to use it. Even though the product has some potentially moisturizing ingredients like glycerin, it dries the skin deeply. It cleans and dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting aggressive with this very serious blemish cleanser and then through experience figuring out how often to use. That&#x27;s because when blemishes are present, it&#x27;s necessary to get a deep cleaning and to get the problem areas dried at least to some extent while the blemishes disappear.</li>
    <li> Squeezing the pus out of blackheads until they decoupage the bathroom mirror is not the best way to address ingrown hairs. The other one is okay with it but they are as juvenile as I am and their malpractice insurance rates are not impressive. When I feign being an adult, I use applications that include salicylic acid so I decided to try this Biore product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, the  prickly, tingling feeling I had for a few hours after rinsing and shaving will not work for me and unless the annoying sensation I felt is supposed to be the cool icy feeling, that didn&#x27;t work either. As it is, removal of what seemed like the first application of a plaster of Paris mask was more work than I am to prepared to take on, even once per week or as needed for blackhead removal especially as the area seemed to dry out but the ingrown hair follicle was still an irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my grand experiment was a bust...no pun intended...so I will return to straight pin and tweezer artwork when so required.</li>
    <li> I always keep a pump bottle of face wash with 2% salicylic acid at my sink for morning and evening uses. I&#x27;ve tried several brands, and I like this Biore version as well as any others. The salicylic acid helps control any tendency towards acne without being too harsh for me. Biore foams and rinses, leaving my combination skin nice and clean. I haven&#x27;t noticed any drying or irritation. Although this has \\&quot;ice\\&quot; in the name, there&#x27;s just a very mild cooling sensation from the menthol, perhaps even less than I notice from [[ASIN:B00ATY942M Biore Acne Clearing Scrub (1% Sal Acid), 4.5 Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor note of comparison: some pump bottles (like [[ASIN:B008IEUERE Clean &amp; Clear Essentials Foaming Facial Cleanser, 8 fl oz]]) will lock in place if twisted, so that the bottle can be packed without making a mess. Biore&#x27;s pump doesn&#x27;t lock into place - a small detail that will only matter to you if you want to travel with this bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite product for face.  I&#x27;m sad to find that it is widely unavailable at stores recently due to the new charcoal line.  I&#x27;m afraid this will be discontinued so I&#x27;m stocking up as much as I can.  I&#x27;ve honestly been using this since I was in my teens and never found another product that does the job like this does.  It is invigorating and helps keep my skin clear without drying it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years to keep my aging skin clear with the gentle exfoliation of the salicylic acid</li>
    <li> We have used this for a long time.  It leaves the face clean, without being harsh or drying.&lt;br /&gt;There is no residue or build-up afterward.  It clears up blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;It applies as a nice foam that feels and smells good.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how I&#x27;ve not used Biore in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have, since my teenage years, 30 years ago, the worse acne/ oily skin and blemish condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that helps to control break out, for me, has always been rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena never worked.&lt;br /&gt;ProActive never worked. And, certainly generic soap and water never worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these products for a few days, it is clear-- just by touch-- that the ingredients by itself removed huge areas of stubborn oily patches on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;The diffence, I should say, the only difference between this formula which Biore calls its \\&quot;Blemish Fighting Ice Cleaner\\&quot; and its \\&quot;Steam Activated Cleanser\\&quot; is that one works with cold water and the other works in a hot shower.  The end result is the same: VERY clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a marvelous product.  5+ stars.</li>
    <li> This Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser lathers pretty nicely and feels good being applied to my face. The smell is nice--not too flowery and very pleasant. It leaves my face feeling clean and smooth after being washed off. My only real gripe is it hasn&#x27;t worked quite as well as I thought it would, but from my experience it does work better than plain soap and water alone. Overall, a solid cleanser that I would consider using again.</li>
    <li> I only need a very small dot of this cleanser to clean my face and it feels great on my skin. It has a nice, fresh scent that I quite like. Seems to be effective too. It really helps with oily skin, and calms irritated spots as well. It has become my favorite face cleanser in just a few short weeks!</li>
    <li> A few minutes after I wash my face, I can feel it drying up my skin.  I actually have to use a moisturizer afterwards, except I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer on my t-zones where it&#x27;s most oily.  This wash has a light, fragrant scent which I like.  I only use a small amount on my fingers and then apply it to my wet face and then I rinse it off with a cloth, which also gives my skin cells a bit of scrubbing action.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey though... but this may last me a long while as I just use a small amount each time and it seems quite cost effective since I don&#x27;t need to use it every day.  I feel it has reduced my blackheads too.</li>
    <li> This is a fair cleanser, and needs to only be used once a day.  I have normal/oily skin and since it dried my skin; it made it oilier during the day.  I had to use a stronger moisturizer after using this to wash my skin at night.  It is not a stand-out cleanser and does not have any cooling effect as the name implies but is good enough to clear our minor blemishes and minor breakouts; major acne breakout will need a better cleanser.  Other topical acne medication and creams combined with the use of ice cleanser definitely caused itchy skin for me so if you have severe or major acne this is not a cleanser you can use.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I used to be a big fan of Biore&#x27; products in the past.  I think they have been an innovative addition to the world of skincare products.  That said, I have had issues with a few of their more recent products and have revealed such problems in a couple of past reviews.  I am one for always trying to give a company another chance so I happily agreed to review the Blemish Fighting Ice Cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser pumps out easily as a medium thick, clear liquid.  It did a good job of cleaning off all of my makeup.  The only potentially negative aspect of the makeup removal I had was regarding the mascara.  I was a little afraid to use it directly on the lashes because I felt it might sting in that area.  While I did get a bit in my eye it flushed out easily and didn&#x27;t linger.  Still, in the future I will remove the mascara with an eye makeup remover prior to using the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing, rinsing and pat drying I did not find a great degree of tightness.  This surprised me for it being a blemish fighting cleanser.  I guess one of the reasons for that was that the product contains only 2% Salicylic Acid.  So, that got me to thinking..\\&quot;what other ingredient is actually fights the blemishes\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the Sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate.  It is reported to be a common cleansing agent but also is very drying.  It seems to be more of a surfactant (foaming agent) than a blemish fighting agent.  So, on to the next possible blemish fighting ingredient.  Decyl Glucoside:  Another surfactant but a non-drying one.  Next, let&#x27;s move on to Cocomidopropyl betraine:  Another surfactant!  So, looking at the remaining ingredients I research Sodium Hydroxide.  It is a known drying agent.  Aha!  So that is what is probably fighting the blemishes but at what cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild Rosacea so I am always on the lookout for suspect ingredients.  The Sodium Hydroxide is #13 on the list of ingredients.  The ingredient that give the \\&quot;ICE\\&quot; feeling is Menthol and that is listed at #15 of 20 ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually did perform better than many cleansers I have reviewed in the past (including the horrid \\&quot;Simply Clear\\&quot; brand).  I have mild Rosacea so many cleansers with a litany of ingredients tend to irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad skin cleanser by Biore&#x27;.  I am just thinking that with MY type of skin I am better off using a really mild cleanser and then just spot applying a blemish cream where needed instead of all over the surface of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this cleanser 3 stars because of the cleansing ability and the fact that it didn&#x27;t really dry out my skin after use.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I really think some of the many surfactants are under fire and unnecessary.\\&quot;ICE\\&quot; feeling is Menthol and that is listed at #15 of 20 ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually did perform better than many cleansers I have reviewed in the past (including the horrid \\&quot;Simply Clear\\&quot; brand).

I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I really think some of the many surfactants are under fire and unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for a month now and here are the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My skin does feel cleaner and looks better.  I did break out a couple of times due to hormonal changes; however, it was not as much as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Do not use this product more than once a day - it will DRY your skin out!  It is not a gentle cleanser.  The right balance for me was using it before going to bed and then applying a moisturizer after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You are not supposed to use other topical acne medications with this, per the instructions on the back, or your skin will become irritated.  It contains 2% salycic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not displeased with the results, I don&#x27;t know if I will use this in the long term.  It seems harsher than what I should be applying to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is similar to the Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid face wash I&#x27;ve been using for quite some time. But, after using both, I prefer the Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both have the same concentration of salicylic acid (2%) which is the active acne fighting ingredient. Both are very thick - just a small amount is needed to get a good lather. And both require caution against overuse since the salicylic acid can be rough on your skin if you use it too often. I find that once a day - with the occasional skipped day - works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the Biore pulls ahead is in the scent and how it makes my face feel after using it. The Neutrogena does not smell bad - it basically smells like soap. The Biore has a fresher scent that is more botanical in nature, and my face feels cool after using it. I expect the latter is due to the inclusion of menthol in the Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t fault either in terms of results and performance, but the Biore is more enjoyable to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you skin is really sensitive, this is not the Biore product for you.  It contains Menthol, which gives that cooling sensation when you wash and can irritate your skin.  If peppermint bothers you, this will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really oily skin (that is not sensitive)  this cleanser feels great,  squeaky clean feeling and the salicylic acid  (which is actually the main ingredient in aspirin, which is why a crushed up aspirin can help clear up a blemish) does help with breakouts.  Pretty much any product with 2% salicylic acid  has had similar positive results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, and don&#x27;t apply other salicylic cr&amp;egrave;mes to your face afterward or you will really dry up your skin.</li>
    <li> Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser, 6.77 Ounce is an effective face cleanser, removing dirt and makeup and leaving little or no residue behind.  The pump bottle is convenient, but a full stroke of the pump is not needed as a little of the product is very effective.  The active ingredient, 2% salicylic acid, is a common acting fighting ingredient.  I have no issues with 2% salicylic acid, but my daughter finds that salicylic acid at this concentration actually makes her acne worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not really feel any cooling or iciness from the cleanser, but that is rather low on my list of priorities in a face wash.  The cleanser removes the dirt and makeup from my skin and left it feeling clean and not sticky.  I would buy this product for myself, but not for my daughter whose skin is slightly more sensitive to the active ingredient.</li>
    <li> This is the second Biore product that I&#x27;ve used and I have to say that overall I&#x27;m really impressed with it and the company itself. The cleanser is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It has a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or my skin at all. I have sensitive skin so this is huge for me. It feels \\&quot;minty\\&quot; on your face but not to the point where it is burning or anything. It washes off easily. I noticed after the 2nd day that I had broken out a little more than usual but by day 4 all my blemishes were gone. They say when a product works your skin will break out a bit but then will clear up and that&#x27;s just what happened here. Love it and will keep using it for sure!</li>
