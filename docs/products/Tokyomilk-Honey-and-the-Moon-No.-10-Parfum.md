### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and have found out that Tokyomilk makes this product a 5 star for me.</li>
      <li>Once I heard a couple say that they could smell a wonderful pipe tobacco, but it smelled wonderful!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s always best to put your nose to work before you buy!</li>
      <li>smells so good!</li>
      <li>and I find it is pleasant when she uses</li>
      <li>Both my daughter and I love this fragrance (ages 46 &amp; 69)!</li>
      <li>In fact, of all the TokyoMilk scents, this one is the best spring/summer scent and the most unique over all.  </li>
      <li>The honey notes are so amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>The smell is one of a kind</li>
      <li>However, it seems to be nice?</li>
      <li>Unusual, wonderful scent!  </li>
      <li>It is a very fresh frangrance and people comment that it makes them feel happy when they smell it.</li>
      <li>The bottle is very cute and looks fantastic sitting on my perfume shelf.</li>
      <li>If you know someone who loves pure perfumes or perfume oils, this will make a great gift.</li>
      <li>Love this honey elixir.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite scent from Tokyomilk.  </li>
      <li>This parfum literally smells like cookies :)  </li>
      <li>Love all the fragrances~</li>
      <li>I had purchase Honey and the Moon at anthropogy and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>This particular fragrance from Tokyo Milk is a lovely sugary, honey scent with some bright top notes.</li>
      <li>This whisper light, honeyed jasmine, violet with hint of sandlewood parfum is perfect for daily wear..  </li>
      <li>Anyway, scent is warm and nice - not terribly complex, but the easy to wear antidote for floral/fruity bombs.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love the smell of honey, but the honey + floral combination in this one really makes it kind of sickly sweet.</li>
      <li>It is organic and sexy and spicy and unique.  </li>
      <li>but on me it was strong and way to musky perfumy (not a word but applies).  </li>
      <li>I love this scent, it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
      <li>The descriptions of the floral and spice notes are always accurate for the products and the container is itself a work of art.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this fabulous parfum for 3 years now.  </li>
      <li>but I feel like more than one spray is really overwhelmingly sweet and powerful.</li>
      <li>I first heard and smelled TokyoMilk&#x27;s products from getting a sample of La Vie La Mort, which I ended up purchasing after falling in love.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first Honey and the Moon in Charleston and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Since one of her favorite types was discontinued years ago, she is very particular about what she chooses.  </li>
      <li>We both receive many compliments on it, but it is a bit unusual.  </li>
      <li>Spicy and warmly sweet.</li>
      <li>Smells good enough to eat and the fragrance lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume because I like the sweet scent of honey.</li>
      <li>Yummy true honey scent.</li>
      <li>Love this scent so much.</li>
      <li>The body cream and candle fragrances are very close to the perfume, and equally enjoyed by both  of us.  </li>
      <li>I will keep it no matter, too cute and who knows, maybe I will love it next week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used it every day and ran out rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is the third &#x27;tokyomilk&#x27; fragrance I&#x27;ve ordered---and I love it!</li>
      <li>Discovered it at a little shop in NC and was happy to find it on amazon when I ran out.</li>
      <li>love the Tokyomilk line in general, especially food scented but on me... which is unique, all scents have their own nuances when interacting with a person&#x27;s skin...</li>
      <li>It is a great everyday perfume.</li>
      <li>Love the poetic titles, the  romantic art, and the sensual fragrances of all the products.</li>
      <li>This was a good value for what I received, but it was not exactly the fragrance I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The combination of scents is just right--</li>
      <li>The floral scents are perfectly picked: the Jasmine notes are not too overwhelming for it being a secondary note (a lot of Jasmine perfumes tend to be dominant) and the sugared violet, the other very unique scent next to honey, brings the perfume to border on the edge of floral and edible.  </li>
      <li>High quality perfume, and very sweet smelling - honey is DEFINITELY the primary note with everything else almost lost underneath, but I like it.</li>
      <li>This is one of only three I&#x27;ve ever found that is consistently satisfying.</li>
      <li>I am in love with the scent...cannot get enough of it...</li>
      <li>The bottles are so pretty and unusual.</li>
      <li>Honey and the Moon is apart of the company&#x27;s other line, but it is no less interesting and unique than any of their scents.  </li>
      <li>A little hipster and a bit hippie give it a nice vibe.</li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky in the scent dept.  </li>
      <li>My wife really likes this scent.  </li>
      <li>Other times I&#x27;ve heard passer-bys remark about the lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>In fact, because of this, I&#x27;m most likely to buy my newer scents from independent perfumeries, but I stumbled upon TokyoMilk.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it highly to those with discriminating olfactory tastes.  </li>
      <li>I normally would rate this product a 4, but the bottle was leaking all over the packaging when it came.  </li>
      <li>order and shipment process was fast and trouble free from this merchant.</li>
      <li>These scents are very pure, not overwhelming and full of carriers and alcohol to make you sneeze.</li>
      <li>but this one, with the soft honey and floral blend, is divine!  </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a little strange, but I love it.  </li>
      <li>and it really lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>On me, this has a strong throw (the \\&quot;power\\&quot; of the scent) and a lengthy wear time (it usually lasts through a workout and for hours later).</li>
      <li>That said, this is the only company that I would order fragrance from again without the benefit of trying it first; that&#x27;s how much I trust the company!I am anxious to try different fragrance products from &#x27;tokyomilk&#x27;, and will do so soon.</li>

<li> the sandalwood offsets the other, sweeter scents</li>

<li> The strongest note in the perfume is the Honey, which oddly goes well with the sandalwood.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wearing that scent for about a month and a half, and was suggested this one.  </li>
<li> I do not enjoy flowery, or overpowering, or froo froo, or dirt smelling things.  </li>
<li> down side is the size and the staying factor is poor.</li>
<li> The candle is very small though.</li>
<li> I have tough chemistry to match perfumes with.  </li>

    <li> I bought this perfume because I like the sweet scent of honey. The perfume itself doesn&#x27;t disappoint- especially for the price. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent from Tokyomilk.  The honey notes are so amazing and it really lasts a long time. I especially like to mist it on my hair so I can smell it for hours.  I get a lot of compliments on this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the third &#x27;tokyomilk&#x27; fragrance I&#x27;ve ordered---and I love it! The descriptions of the floral and spice notes are always accurate for the products and the container is itself a work of art.

    <li> I bought my first Honey and the Moon in Charleston and fell in love with it. It is a very fresh frangrance and people comment that it makes them feel happy when they smell it. I&#x27;ll always be a fan.</li>
    <li> Unusual, wonderful scent!  I have been wearing this fabulous parfum for 3 years now.  People often ask what it is.</li>
    <li> The bottle is very cute and looks fantastic sitting on my perfume shelf. The smell is one of a kind and I constantly receive complements on it, definitely a summer scent, but acceptable for both day and night wear.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for the bee or perfume enthusiast in your life</li>
    <li> This perfume is to die for! smells so good! A bit like chocolate, but everyone will notice! This is one of my favorites!!!</li>
    <li> I admit it.  I&#x27;m very picky in the scent dept.  I do not enjoy flowery, or overpowering, or froo froo, or dirt smelling things.  This is the only perfume I wear.  It is organic and sexy and spicy and unique.  I recommend it highly to those with discriminating olfactory tastes.  Attracts bees, tho!</li>
    <li> I am in love with the scent...cannot get enough of it...but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would have hoped. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Yummy true honey scent. Only complaint: Scent doesn&#x27;t have much staying power.</li>

    <li> This was a good value for what I received, but it was not exactly the fragrance I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Honey and the Moon!  This is my fav scent from Tokyo Milk~ I have tried several others, including Let Them Eat Cake and  Kabuki.  Love all the fragrances~ but this one, with the soft honey and floral blend, is divine!  Love the poetic titles, the  romantic art, and the sensual fragrances of all the products.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the smell of honey, but the honey + floral combination in this one really makes it kind of sickly sweet. It&#x27;s nice but I feel like more than one spray is really overwhelmingly sweet and powerful.</li>
    <li> This parfum literally smells like cookies :)  I know it&#x27;s a little strange, but I love it.  It lasts for a long time too.</li>

    <li> High quality perfume, and very sweet smelling - honey is DEFINITELY the primary note with everything else almost lost underneath, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Scents are just tricky and I ordered this without seeing/smelling it so it was a calculated risk... love the Tokyomilk line in general, especially food scented but on me... which is unique, all scents have their own nuances when interacting with a person&#x27;s skin... but on me it was strong and way to musky perfumy (not a word but applies).  I will keep it no matter, too cute and who knows, maybe I will love it next week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, it&#x27;s always best to put your nose to work before you buy!</li>
    <li> I had purchase Honey and the Moon at anthropogy and fell in love with it.  I used it every day and ran out rather quickly.  I saw it on Amazon and decided to purchase it from them.  I am very happy with this product and have found out that Tokyomilk makes this product a 5 star for me.</li>

    <li> Sandalwood, honey, jasmine, violet. Spicy and warmly sweet. Love this scent so much. Discovered it at a little shop in NC and was happy to find it on amazon when I ran out.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t come with the box it&#x27;s supposed to. However, it seems to be nice?</li>
    <li> This whisper light, honeyed jasmine, violet with hint of sandlewood parfum is perfect for daily wear..  It smells so uplifting that I can&#x27;t help telling friends they must try it.  I have tough chemistry to match perfumes with.  This is one of only three I&#x27;ve ever found that is consistently satisfying.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s my new favorite! The combination of scents is just right-- the sandalwood offsets the other, sweeter scents</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this scent.  Since one of her favorite types was discontinued years ago, she is very particular about what she chooses.  This scent is not over powering and I find it is pleasant when she uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order and shipment process was fast and trouble free from this merchant.</li>
    <li> I normally would rate this product a 4, but the bottle was leaking all over the packaging when it came.  The atomizer had come unscrewed.  Anyway, scent is warm and nice - not terribly complex, but the easy to wear antidote for floral/fruity bombs.</li>
    <li> Love this honey elixir. It also layers well with vanilla, and white florals.&lt;br /&gt;The down side is the size and the staying factor is poor.</li>
