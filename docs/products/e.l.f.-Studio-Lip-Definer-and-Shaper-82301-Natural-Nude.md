      <li>I love this highlighter!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing lip liner, goes on kind of creamy.</li>
      <li>Nice color</li>
      <li>Another great pencil!&lt;br /&gt;I lost what I thought was a great lip pencil (English Rose)</li>
      <li>It also is great u dear lib stick &amp; helps me keep it in place &amp; looking fresh longer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already purchased two more.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip companion.</li>
      <li>Looks much better in the photo.</li>
      <li>( it should be pinkish where it&#x27;s more brown)</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I like that you are able to accentuate your lips with the highlighting end and then line the lips with the shaping end.  </li>
      <li>Works great with a variety of different lip colors.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I think I just got a shade too light.  </li>
      <li>The darker end is a little chalky but good for the price :)</li>
      <li>no pull glides right on.</li>
      <li>The colors glide right onto your lips with no dragging.</li>
      <li>The colors are nice but the design of the cap with the sharpener fits loosely so it&#x27;s always coming off.</li>
      <li>But I have owned it before and this one I recieved is very much a shade off what is shown as also a darker shade than what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I have had troubles in the past with a nude lipliner being too brown and being way too obvious, but this is the perfect shade.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin with a pink undertone,  so finding something that looks so perfect &amp; natural looking is impossible.</li>
      <li>The nude liner is on the orangy side and the natural side is really too pearly and light.  </li>
      <li>Easy to draw my faux bigger lip lines &amp; doesn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
      <li>It makes my lips look so large.</li>
      <li>The liner shade goes well with a variety of lipsticks which makes it very practical for use on the go.</li>
      <li>Well packaged &amp; ca e within a reasonable time frame.</li>
      <li>I really liked this pencil for a nude look when I am wearing heavy eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>Really pretty natural color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good consistency not too hard not too soft.</li>
      <li>Not sure the highlighter part makes too much of a difference but the lip pencil part is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to using lip liner.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s wanting a more subtle liner that looks natural.</li>
      <li>So light it&#x27;s sort of pointless.</li>
      <li>I normally would have bought this at my local drugstore</li>
      <li>It stays in place &amp; doesn&#x27;t smear lasts for a good long while unless you eat in which case a slight touch up has been needed if I eat something messy &amp; have to wipe my mouth a lot.</li>
      <li>The color is spot on the same color as my natural lips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product! The colors glide right onto your lips with no dragging. Great for highlighting my lips and defining them. Works great with a variety of different lip colors. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have noticed my lips are losing volume as I age &amp; I needed something to give me the appearance of a larger pout until I could scrape together the $$ for injections. The color is spot on the same color as my natural lips. It stays in place &amp; doesn&#x27;t smear lasts for a good long while unless you eat in which case a slight touch up has been needed if I eat something messy &amp; have to wipe my mouth a lot. It&#x27;s a good consistency not too hard not too soft. Easy to draw my faux bigger lip lines &amp; doesn&#x27;t bleed. It also is great u dear lib stick &amp; helps me keep it in place &amp; looking fresh longer. Well packaged &amp; ca e within a reasonable time frame. I normally would have bought this at my local drugstore but I couldn&#x27;t find it in stock anywhere at the time. I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s wanting a more subtle liner that looks natural.</li>
    <li> The color on one side is a glossy nude/light pink and other side is a slightly darker then a natural lip color. Both are creamy no pull glides right on. Cap also has built in sharper!</li>
    <li> Like the feel and the 2 colors are great</li>
    <li> soft, slightly waxy. Great for the nude lip. It&#x27;s hardly expensive so just go ahead and purchase it. You&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice but the design of the cap with the sharpener fits loosely so it&#x27;s always coming off. I end up with marks all over the inside of makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. Nice color but the caps do not stay on. It wears well its not too shimmery</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lip liner, goes on kind of creamy. It makes my lips look so large. And the coloring is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I use the shaper side a lot to highlight my upper lip. I like how it allows for targeted application. The liner shade goes well with a variety of lipsticks which makes it very practical for use on the go. For $3 on the ELF website I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
    <li> Another great pencil!&lt;br /&gt;I lost what I thought was a great lip pencil (English Rose) - it was discontinued I guess.  I despaired until I found these two ...</li>
    <li> I really liked this pencil for a nude look when I am wearing heavy eye makeup.  The only complaint is that it is a little on the dry side.  This is remedied with a great lip gloss.  I like that you are able to accentuate your lips with the highlighting end and then line the lips with the shaping end.  I also like the color of this nude.  I have had troubles in the past with a nude lipliner being too brown and being way too obvious, but this is the perfect shade.</li>
    <li> The darker end is a little chalky but good for the price :)</li>
    <li> Really pretty natural color. Not sure the highlighter part makes too much of a difference but the lip pencil part is fantastic!</li>
    <li> The lip definer is awesome. I&#x27;ve already purchased two more.</li>
    <li> Too frosty. Looks much better in the photo.</li>
    <li> The nude liner is on the orangy side and the natural side is really too pearly and light.  Not a good buy for me.</li>
    <li> I know I soooo could have gotten this lip definer from the website itself for much less but I needed it in a flash. But I have owned it before and this one I recieved is very much a shade off what is shown as also a darker shade than what I ordered.  ( it should be pinkish where it&#x27;s more brown) The cap does not stay on.. ( the sharpener side)  So I leave it at home ...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using lip liner.  I think I just got a shade too light.  I can hardly notice it but I selected &amp;#34;Nude &amp; Natural&amp;#34; after all.  So light it&#x27;s sort of pointless.</li>
    <li> Love this. Last for hours . Doesn&#x27;t bleed. Works with brand of lipstick/lipgloss</li>
    <li> My favorite lip companion. I use my brow liner  as a lipliner as well. Then I go over that with the highlighter side. Finally, I use maybelline babylips balm in the peachy color all over to blend. I have very fair skin with a pink undertone,  so finding something that looks so perfect &amp; natural looking is impossible. I love this highlighter! I actually never use the liner side at all.</li>
