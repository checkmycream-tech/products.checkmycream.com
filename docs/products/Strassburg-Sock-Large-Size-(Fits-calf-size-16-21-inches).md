      <li>That being said it is the best of what I&#x27;ve found to stretch the tendons while I am sleeping.  </li>
      <li>Great device.</li>
      <li>For travel it works great because it&#x27;s easier to transport</li>
      <li>I bought one to test and now own 2.</li>
      <li>A very cheap product.</li>
      <li>The pain was most prominent when I did any time of running or hiking.  </li>
      <li>Husband has only worn it four times but it looks like it&#x27;s the best item he has tried for plantar fasciitis that he just might stick with!</li>
      <li>The top of the sock can be itchy &amp; irritates my calf, so sleeping in it isn&#x27;t an</li>
      <li>My plantar boot provides a better stretch.</li>
      <li>Hopefully this will help cure it :)</li>
      <li>The strap that goes around the top of the sock does not hold the sock up all through the night.</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>The sock strap connects to the tip Of the toes and it would be more comfortable and practical if a strap ram the length of the sock from the heel and led from the toe.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything and this seems to be the most comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Not the most comfortable thing in the world but better than than the boot thingy I tried first.</li>
      <li>and i just cant it to be comfortable.</li>
      <li>This sock has alleviated my plantar fasciitis condition in my right foot.</li>
      <li>It seems to be helping significantly to ease the inflammation and pain.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the sock which was recommended by my physical therapist.  </li>
      <li>He says fits &amp; works very well, easy to get on &amp; off.  </li>
      <li>The large would fit a 21 inch calf at a minimum</li>
      <li>This may be a personal fit issue as I have heard many others say that this thing is the king.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to order a soft splint and see if that works better for me.</li>
      <li>Takes some getting used to, but worth it.</li>
      <li>After seeing good reviews I bought this product to ease some pain due to plantar fasciitis.</li>
      <li>I think they should also put the lenght of the sock on the package , but I will not be returning it, because the pain in my right foot is excruciating, and I have been waiting 3 weeks for the sock to arrive, so I have been wearing it for 2 nights.</li>
      <li>This morning I ran pain-free for the first time in years.  </li>
      <li>First, the sizing.</li>
      <li>Maybe they need to have a small, medium and large size in order to fit women better.</li>
      <li>Another problem is the fact I have two large Morton&#x27;s neuromas in the ball of my foot</li>
      <li>so I ordered the large.</li>
      <li>I cannot over tighten it around my calf without a large amount of pain.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t comfortable enough to wear at night</li>
      <li>Purchased for my son who is experiencing some foot problems and wants to continue to run.</li>
      <li>I was hoping this was going to really help my feet</li>
      <li>This sock really bothers me.  </li>
      <li>They really do work.</li>
      <li>Worked very well.</li>
      <li>These work reasonably well for my wife, who has aggravated plantar fascititis (sp?)</li>
      <li>I soon found out that the excess at the top is actually a good thing because the Velcro is very irritating against the back of my knee</li>
      <li>No real discomfort as far as the wear and easy to use.</li>
      <li>As a result we&#x27;ve had to look for other more &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; options and only use these in moderation.</li>
      <li>and I have large calfs and wear a size ten shoe</li>
      <li>So far the sock seems to be working .</li>
      <li>so far and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
      <li>Probably a soft boot.</li>
      <li>Not beautiful, but effective treatment for my pain.</li>
      <li>If you make is super tight, it cuts off the circulation in the leg.</li>
      <li>I did wear it every night for about 3 weeks and stretched really well every morning.  </li>
      <li>The socks is not all comfortable and after few wearing the velcro and elasticity has totally gone.</li>
      <li>but they have two major issues -</li>
      <li>First off, it slides down during the night.  </li>

<li> I did wear it every night for about 3 weeks and stretched really well every morning.  </li>
<li> The socks is not all comfortable and after few wearing the velcro and elasticity has totally gone.</li>
<li> but they have two major issues -</li>
<li> First off, it slides down during the night.  </li>
<li> It really needs a stiff insole for the length of the foot to prevent this.  </li>
<li> Expensive, but this product actually does help a lot if you are feeling heel pain, so long as you wear it regularly of course :)</li>
<li> one is that they tend to want to sag down the calf unless they are on very tight at the top (which makes them uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time), and if they are worn in bed and you drift off to sleep, the velcro adjustable strap area (the spiky side) has damaged our high thread-count sheets.</li>
<li> My Achilles&#x27; tendon is stretched throughout the night</li>
<li> The design of the Stassburg sock is flawed in that it fails to bring all the toes forward towards the leg -- the strap that you adjust would really work better if it was a &#x27;Y&amp;#34; with straps coming off each side next to the toes.</li>
<li> Too loose and</li>
<li> The sock is too long for me and the foot is very wide.</li>
<li> Also, the foot of the sock is so wide that while I&#x27;m asleep my foot slides away from the strap that is supposed to hold my foot up</li>
<li> I am petite and have small feet so the sock comes up about 3 inches above my knee.</li>
<li> I got the merchandise really fast and thank you for that, but unfortunately the item does not work as it should.</li>
<li> and I fold the excess sock down to cover the Velcro.</li>
<li> It would slide down my leg.</li>
<li> I ordered the Large size because I wear a size 40 shoe, and even a stocking too small can be painful, I did not want to risk the regular size to be too small as I also have rather long legs.</li>
<li> DOES NOT STAY TIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT</li>
<li> I bought this because I have really tight calves</li>
<li> Too tight and your toes will fall asleep and cause a tingling sensation.</li>
<li> I read this condition can be caused by tight calf muscles.  </li>
<li> he wore it during the day for a while which helped a little</li>
<li> Plantar Fasciitis is the most brutal problem ever.  </li>
<li> I am back to wearing the hard boot which always worked well, but is HARD.</li>
<li> I have a few of problems with this product.</li>
<li> I tried this a few days</li>
<li> This thing slips off on the few times I have tried to use it.</li>
<li> Not sure how to fix the sliding down issue.  </li>
<li> But if I tighten the upper strap to stop that, it cuts off my circulation, pulls hair, and is just uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> No more pain when getting out of bed in the AM.</li>
<li> I will say that I have gotten a small amount of relief when wearing it while watching tv...</li>
<li> If you are looking to get past the pain of plantar fasciitis, go to Walmart and get fitted for some Dr. Scholl&#x27;s inserts .</li>
<li> Not sure if I&#x27;m not using it correctly.</li>
<li> THE LONG SOCK IS UNCOMFORTABLE AS WELL.</li>
<li> it worked but was hard to keep on at night.</li>
<li> There are no easy solutions only ways to inflict pain on yourself :(  </li>
<li> Unless you weigh over 150 1bs, this thing slides down your leg,making it useless.</li>
<li> I wear this and my foot isn&#x27;t as stiff and painful in the morning.  </li>
<li> so I have been unable to continue using it.</li>
<li> I think the sock is expensive for just getting one.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;boot\\&quot; I tried was bulky, uncomfortable and gave me other/new foot pain.  </li>
<li> With a really nasty, painful case of plantar fasciitis, I was in physical therapy and the therapist recommended this.  </li>
<li> Also, the toes get pulled up at an awkward angle.  </li>
<li> When wearing it would make my toes numb instead of giving that stretch</li>
<li> I had painful Achilles tendinitis.  </li>
<li> AND  THEREFORE I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH PRODUCT.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have plantar Fasciitis in both feet. Nothing relieves the pain like this sock! I bought one to test and now own 2. Such relief for my aching feet.</li>
    <li> Husband has only worn it four times but it looks like it&#x27;s the best item he has tried for plantar fasciitis that he just might stick with! From a Doctors office he bought a $200 dollar boot and tried to sleep in it and couldn&#x27;t , but he likes this sock!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the sock which was recommended by my physical therapist.  Item is as described and was received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> A very cheap product. If you are looking to get past the pain of plantar fasciitis, go to Walmart and get fitted for some Dr. Scholl&#x27;s inserts . They worked wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have really tight calves and this was recommended by my trainer.  I tried this a few days and I did not feel a stretch or any improvement in my calves.  My plantar boot provides a better stretch.</li>
    <li> it worked but was hard to keep on at night. It would slide down my leg.It was just enough to fix my problem</li>
    <li> I wore this sock at night for several weeks and found no improvement of my plantar fasciitis. By the time the morning came, it seemed like the sock moved and was not holding my foot in the proper position like it was when I went to bed</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all. I am back to wearing the hard boot which always worked well, but is HARD. This thing slips off on the few times I have tried to use it. I cannot over tighten it around my calf without a large amount of pain. This may be a personal fit issue as I have heard many others say that this thing is the king. Just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I had painful Achilles tendinitis.  I read this condition can be caused by tight calf muscles.  The pain was most prominent when I did any time of running or hiking.  Two nights of wearing the Strassburg and the pain is gone!  This morning I ran pain-free for the first time in years.  What a relief!</li>
    <li> First off, it slides down during the night.  But if I tighten the upper strap to stop that, it cuts off my circulation, pulls hair, and is just uncomfortable.  Also, the toes get pulled up at an awkward angle.  It really needs a stiff insole for the length of the foot to prevent this.  Not sure how to fix the sliding down issue.  Going to look at something different.  Probably a soft boot.</li>
    <li> I got the merchandise really fast and thank you for that, but unfortunately the item does not work as it should. The strap that goes around the top of the sock does not hold the sock up all through the night. If you make is super tight, it cuts off the circulation in the leg. So, the tension that is supposed to be there for the heel of the foot, does not work through the night. I continue to try and use it, but after a couple of weeks, it just isn&#x27;t working.  Maybe somebody can let me know if they have the same problems........</li>
    <li> I have a few of problems with this product. First, the sizing. My calf measured 17 inches so I ordered the large. It is way too big. I am petite and have small feet so the sock comes up about 3 inches above my knee. I soon found out that the excess at the top is actually a good thing because the Velcro is very irritating against the back of my knee and I fold the excess sock down to cover the Velcro. Also, the foot of the sock is so wide that while I&#x27;m asleep my foot slides away from the strap that is supposed to hold my foot up and I end up with my toes pointed. Another problem is the fact I have two large Morton&#x27;s neuromas in the ball of my foot and they are now irritated from having my toes pulled up (I watched the video on thesock.com and adjusted the sock according to their instructions) so I now have additional foot pain from the neuromas. I will say that I have gotten a small amount of relief when wearing it while watching tv...if nothing else, it reminds me to keep my toes pointed up instead of down.&lt;br /&gt;I think they need to change their sizing. The large would fit a 21 inch calf at a minimum but it is way too big for a 17 inch calf. Maybe they need to have a small, medium and large size in order to fit women better. I&#x27;ve decided to order a soft splint and see if that works better for me.</li>
    <li> With a really nasty, painful case of plantar fasciitis, I was in physical therapy and the therapist recommended this.  I have worn it 3 nights and it, as well as stretches she suggested and changing shoes, seems to be helping.  Bottom line:  I wear this and my foot isn&#x27;t as stiff and painful in the morning.  The \\&quot;boot\\&quot; I tried was bulky, uncomfortable and gave me other/new foot pain.  Like this product!</li>
    <li> Truly has helped with my plantar fasciitis.  I would recommend to anyone having pain! They really do work. I felt relief within days</li>
    <li> The sock did just what I needed! My Achilles&#x27; tendon is stretched throughout the night and I have no stiffness in the am.</li>
    <li> Plenty of room and I have large calfs and wear a size ten shoe</li>
    <li> Not beautiful, but effective treatment for my pain. Bought on the advice of my PT and it does help with my pain.</li>
    <li> The sock is too long for me and the foot is very wide. I ordered the Large size because I wear a size 40 shoe, and even a stocking too small can be painful, I did not want to risk the regular size to be too small as I also have rather long legs. I think they should also put the lenght of the sock on the package , but I will not be returning it, because the pain in my right foot is excruciating, and I have been waiting 3 weeks for the sock to arrive, so I have been wearing it for 2 nights. Have not felt any relief yet.</li>
    <li> After seeing good reviews I bought this product to ease some pain due to plantar fasciitis. The socks is not all comfortable and after few wearing the velcro and elasticity has totally gone. I will recommend folks look at a different alternative</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was going to really help my feet but it wasn&#x27;t the case. Couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. When wearing it would make my toes numb instead of giving that stretch I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;2. The top of the sock can be itchy &amp; irritates my calf, so sleeping in it isn&#x27;t an option.&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike the boot ( which I use all of the time) I never felt like it was doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m suffering from plantar facaitis in both feet from running &amp; this product didn&#x27;t offer the relief I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> These work reasonably well for my wife, who has aggravated plantar fascititis (sp?) but they have two major issues - one is that they tend to want to sag down the calf unless they are on very tight at the top (which makes them uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time), and if they are worn in bed and you drift off to sleep, the velcro adjustable strap area (the spiky side) has damaged our high thread-count sheets. As a result we&#x27;ve had to look for other more &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; options and only use these in moderation.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping in combination with everything else,  but it does make my big toe fall asleep. Wear it every night.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son who is experiencing some foot problems and wants to continue to run. Easy to put on and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This sock really bothers me.  That being said it is the best of what I&#x27;ve found to stretch the tendons while I am sleeping.  I have tried everything and this seems to be the most comfortable.  Plantar Fasciitis is the most brutal problem ever.  There are no easy solutions only ways to inflict pain on yourself :(  Hopefully this will help cure it :)</li>
    <li> Purchased the Strassburg on the recommendation of a friend that also was suffering from plantar fasciitis and have worn it overnight for about 3 weeks. It seems to be helping significantly to ease the inflammation and pain. No real discomfort as far as the wear and easy to use. I recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This sock has alleviated my plantar fasciitis condition in my right foot. No more pain when getting out of bed in the AM. It takes practice to learn how to use. Too tight and your toes will fall asleep and cause a tingling sensation. Too loose and the Velcro strap will end up around your ankle in the morning, thus defeating the stretching process. Be patient and try different tensions on the Velcro support strap  and you will eventually find relief of Plantar fasciitis. I am so grateful that this device has helped alleviate my condition.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT STAY TIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT AND  THEREFORE I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH PRODUCT. THE LONG SOCK IS UNCOMFORTABLE AS WELL.</li>
    <li> So far the sock seems to be working . It fits well and stays in place all night.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it corrects my heel issues!!</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t comfortable enough to wear at night he wore it during the day for a while which helped a little</li>
    <li> This saved me.  I couldn&#x27;t sleep with the boot on--but I sleep well with this.  After several week&lt;br /&gt;the plantar fascitis was gone.  Worked very well.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but this product actually does help a lot if you are feeling heel pain, so long as you wear it regularly of course :)</li>
    <li> The design of the Stassburg sock is flawed in that it fails to bring all the toes forward towards the leg -- the strap that you adjust would really work better if it was a &#x27;Y&amp;#34; with straps coming off each side next to the toes. I had problems with the sock causing me to have leg cramps so I have been unable to continue using it.</li>
    <li> It works well, but takes a bit of getting used to. The sock strap connects to the tip Of the toes and it would be more comfortable and practical if a strap ram the length of the sock from the heel and led from the toe. Still, it does what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> For travel it works great because it&#x27;s easier to transport but it makes my toes hurt. Not sure if I&#x27;m not using it correctly. Ive adjusted it several times and i just cant it to be comfortable. If I&#x27;m not traveling I rather use the bulky boot.</li>
    <li> I was starting to get pain in my heel and this did the job and kept my heel from hurting.  I did wear it every night for about 3 weeks and stretched really well every morning.  Not the most comfortable thing in the world but better than than the boot thingy I tried first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn the sock for ove a week  (every night) so far and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, but I&#x27;m hopeful. I think the sock is expensive for just getting one. Let&#x27;s hope it works to relieve my plantar fasciitis.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband.  He says fits &amp; works very well, easy to get on &amp; off.  Has had a week &amp; has eased pain of plantar fasciitis.  Takes some getting used to, but worth it. They were correct on size according to calf measurement.</li>
    <li> Unless you weigh over 150 1bs, this thing slides down your leg,making it useless.</li>
    <li> I suffer from plantar fasciitis and this sock helped to alleviate the pain.  My doctor recommended that I try this and it worked.  Great device.</li>
