### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the best brush ive ever owned in all 19 years of my life.</li>
      <li>Best brush I have owned in over twenty years</li>
      <li>If the brush was wider, it would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>Just received my Denman today and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for wash n go&#x27;s, twist outs, braid outs, ANYTHING &amp; EVERYTHING!&lt;br</li>
      <li>As someone who loves Amazon, I was so happy to see the Denman brushes be Prime!</li>
      <li>Great brush!</li>
      <li>I use this brush to define my curls - it does a wonderful job!</li>
      <li>I really love how well this brush works!!!</li>
      <li>Still a very good quality brush.</li>
      <li>Great detangling brush.</li>
      <li>&quot; LOL.</li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>This is the best investment i&#x27;ve made towards my hair ever! :)</li>
      <li>Denman is a good brush.</li>
      <li>So just to be fair and do a hesitant review without hyperbole I want to put some specs out that no one seems to mention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love my Denman brush!</li>
      <li>I liked the fact the bristles were so spaced.</li>
      <li>I went to a really popular salon in NY and my hairdresser suggested I invest in a Denman.</li>
      <li>The wide brittles make it best to great for styling these hair types.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect brush to transition my daughters hair from relaxed to natural.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose to purchase this model, it works perfectly with my natural thick/kinky/curly/long hair.</li>
      <li>It is great for curly hair (4a) and it is easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>I believe it will work fine if you have a softer texture!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of shedding using this brush which always makes me feel better.</li>
      <li>I love that I had no issues from ordering to arrival.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this brush works better for looser curls.</li>
      <li>I dislike detangling my hair, it takes well into 30 minutes or more to do.</li>
      <li>how many times have you used it?</li>
      <li>I heard so many rave reviews from curly haired women on their Denmans.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*Tip, get either the d41 or d31 if you have afro or thicker hair because the bristles are more spaced out and won&#x27;t pull your hair out, personally I love the 9 row brush (d41) and my hair texture is around a 4b/4c</li>
      <li>but I sincerely I don&#x27;t know how to braid and twists</li>
      <li>It too submitted to this brush but it did so way more easily than the D3.</li>
      <li>but whatever, ive never really been able to feel the bristles on my scalp and its amazing!!!</li>
      <li>it is great for detangling my 4a natural hair!</li>
      <li>but it did easily.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s still the beautiful red color and has yet to turn adobe.</li>
      <li>The brush works fine</li>
      <li>I love that it came so quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and sanitize, too.</li>
      <li>This is a great styling brush for coarse, curly and kinky hair.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job smoothing and making my curl pattern more defined and, it is easy to clean as well because of its widely spaced bristles (which is always a plus!)</li>
      <li>Used it to detangle my very kinky 4b/c hair, I love it.</li>
      <li>First of the shipping was very fast :).</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the reviews I saw for naturals and it helping with detangling process tremendously.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love my new brush.</li>
      <li>I originally had the D3 I think it is, not bad, but rips out too much hair.</li>
      <li>After some research, I discovered that the D41 was designed for thick and or afro-textured hair and decided this would be a great fit for me!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what i had been searching for.</li>
      <li>Just to be sure, I&#x27;ll time myself next time.</li>
      <li>I believe this should be your first Denman brush</li>
      <li>I also use it to rake my leave-in conditioner because it makes my curls seem so much nicer!</li>
      <li>I decide to put my faith alone in the FreeFlow Denman and did not even pick up my D3 first.</li>
      <li>detangle my hair first and then use my Denman brush to do the rest...</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a fair impression but definitely was taken back by the fact my scalp was getting felt up by this brush.</li>
      <li>But not for me, I am 4C,d,and e lol natural black woman!</li>
      <li>Previous to that I had no idea it existed and was so popular.</li>
      <li>Perfect for de-tangling thick, long hair.</li>
      <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out as much.</li>
      <li>After using this brush, my expectations are extremely high of those as well!</li>
      <li>After much research, it arrived promptly and didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>It basically is like ripping my hair out when I tried to use, too much ripping and pulling, I would be bald</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well made, does not slip out of my hand, and makes my curls look very defined.</li>
      <li>Very durable but breaks my hair and rips.</li>
      <li>: 4C, my kitchen (area from my nape up) is a beast, hair by my forehead and ears is like 4B-4A. My hair barely meets at my shoulders in front but in the back the hair on my nape brushes the top of my back.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I like the fact that the teeth on this particular style are spaced out a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I use it mainly for detangling while in the shower.</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Its not hard on my hair at all</li>
      <li>and I am surprised that Sallys nor any other retailer with a hair section has not picked up their own stock of these specific brushes.</li>
      <li>I felt this brush pulled out a significant amount of hair as compared to my wide tooth comb.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this brush because it was highly recommend from sites that I watch on how to maintain your natural hair.</li>
      <li>So I did some twists after the first time I used the brush and wore the twists in a ponytail to stretch my hair, then 2 weeks later unravel them for my friend&#x27;s graduation party.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have much fallout like from other brushes and it does a good job of smoothing my thick frizzy hair with a blow dryer.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are more flexible on the denman which means it&#x27;s less likely to rip your hair out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times -- between this, a wide toothed comb and a paddle brush, I can&#x27;t imagine anything being any better to detangle with!</li>
      <li>Much to my dismay, I only received one brush.</li>
      <li>I just wear a wild Afro and sleep on a satin pillowcase</li>
      <li>: Yes, I have a really old D3 that doesn&#x27;t even look like they do today and the newer version.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve seen this brush all over the natural haircare blogs.</li>
      <li>However, for extremely thick and curly hair I would get one with more bristles.</li>
      <li>&gt; The first time I used this, I was of course doing a wet dangle.</li>
      <li>I have really thick &amp;#34;4c&amp;#34; hair, so that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
      <li>long have you been natural?</li>
      <li>I had half an hour to get ready and another to get to this interview.</li>
      <li>Well worth the wait as it is hard to find in stores.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love how well this brush works!!! It&#x27;s a must have as it helps to define curls as I comb my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews I saw for naturals and it helping with detangling process tremendously. But not for me, I am 4C,d,and e lol natural black woman! It basically is like ripping my hair out when I tried to use, too much ripping and pulling, I would be bald so no thanks, bristles are too hard. I don&#x27;t even want to try and see if they will soften after a while. Ill probably just pass it on to my friends that have a different texture than mine. I believe it will work fine if you have a softer texture!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose to purchase this model, it works perfectly with my natural thick/kinky/curly/long hair. It does a great job smoothing and making my curl pattern more defined and, it is easy to clean as well because of its widely spaced bristles (which is always a plus!) Great brush!</li>
    <li> This is a great styling brush for coarse, curly and kinky hair.  The wide brittles make it best to great for styling these hair types.</li>
    <li> Chose this brush over the Denman D3 for my thick curls since the bristle on this brush are spaced wider apart.  I use this brush to define my curls - it does a wonderful job!</li>
    <li> Love my Denman brush! I am a naturalista with 3c/4a hair and this does wonders to detangle my hair. I used to use just a wide tooth comb, but I have since thrown that to the side and I finger detangle my hair first and then use my Denman brush to do the rest...and ofcourse this is all on wet hair because detangling 3c/4a would just damage/pull out my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because it was highly recommend from sites that I watch on how to maintain your natural hair. I use it the same way I was taught on the sites. I never brush my hair when its dry, only when its wet with conditioner. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of shedding using this brush which always makes me feel better. Its not hard on my hair at all and I think it makes detangling my hair a lot easier</li>
    <li> If you have afro-natural hair and its thick, long and tightly curled like mine then you NEED this brush. This is the best investment i&#x27;ve made towards my hair ever! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new brush. I love that it came so quickly. I love that I had no issues from ordering to arrival.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for a couple of weeks now and I love it.  It is great for curly hair (4a) and it is easy to clean.  My kids have thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t complain when I have to detangle their hair anymore.  I recommend this product for it&#x27;s quality and effectiveness during what used to be stressful detangling sessions!</li>
    <li> I have medium length 4c hair and bought this brush because of the wider teeth. I also have one of the regular brushes just like this one with the teeth positioned closer together. This brush doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out as much. Could be a little less expensive though.</li>
    <li> Great detangling brush. However, for extremely thick and curly hair I would get one with more bristles. Still a very good quality brush.</li>
    <li> I went to a really popular salon in NY and my hairdresser suggested I invest in a Denman. It had been on my mind/shopping list for a while so I heard her out. I explained that I owned a feaux-denman and she insisted it was not the same. I can definitely tell the difference! The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are more flexible on the denman which means it&#x27;s less likely to rip your hair out. I have really thick &amp;#34;4c&amp;#34; hair, so that&#x27;s important to me. I modified the brush by taking out every other row, and this has proven to be beneficial to hair retention. I use it mainly for detangling while in the shower. Amazing product! I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I looked up the Denman brush for purchase, this one caught my eye. I looked up the description(which there wasn&#x27;t one)and assumed that since there wasn&#x27;t a description that all three brushes in the picture was what I was purchasing. Much to my dismay, I only received one brush. I guess the idiot who put up the picture didn&#x27;t realize that the print was way to small for me to see which brush I was actually buying. Why would they put up a picture of all 3 brushes. That&#x27;s like me putting up a Where&#x27;s Waldo poster and say \\&quot;The item on this page is for sale\\&quot;. They should at least circle the brush they&#x27;re trying to sell. The brush works fine but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase from this distributer again. :(</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve seen this brush all over the natural haircare blogs. it is great for detangling my 4a natural hair! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very durable but breaks my hair and rips. It out.</li>
    <li> the best brush ive ever owned in all 19 years of my life. ive really been missing out. its a bit slippery when wet but whatever, ive never really been able to feel the bristles on my scalp and its amazing!!! oh, i have curly 3C 4A hair</li>
    <li> Denman is a good brush.</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this brush 3 stars, but my 3C curls are just too much for the brush.  I even removed every other row per other naturalista&#x27;s recommendation.  I felt this brush pulled out a significant amount of hair as compared to my wide tooth comb.  If the brush was wider, it would be perfect.  I&#x27;m sure this brush works better for looser curls.</li>
    <li> The bristles a widely spread apart. Perfect for de-tangling thick, long hair. Easy to clean and sanitize, too. I will be buying these in the future.</li>
    <li> Removes the loose hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave my wavy curly hair frizzy and doesn&#x27;t get stuck.</li>
    <li> As someone who loves Amazon, I was so happy to see the Denman brushes be Prime! Not only that, but all of the Denmans were considerably cheaper here than via Sally&#x27;s, the Denman website, other beauty sites etc. I heard so many rave reviews from curly haired women on their Denmans. After some research, I discovered that the D41 was designed for thick and or afro-textured hair and decided this would be a great fit for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3B, high density, coarse, and thick hair that is a big hassle to detangle. It&#x27;s well made, does not slip out of my hand, and makes my curls look very defined. I don&#x27;t notice too much extra hair loss and it doesn&#x27;t tug my scalp incessantly which is something that I hate with brushes. I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times -- between this, a wide toothed comb and a paddle brush, I can&#x27;t imagine anything being any better to detangle with! I will continue to purchase Denman brushes from now on. I also use it to rake my leave-in conditioner because it makes my curls seem so much nicer! Not just that, but I can cut down on detangling time. I plan on purchasing the Denman vented, heavy-weight 9 row and paddle brushes in future. After using this brush, my expectations are extremely high of those as well! I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll disappoint.</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSH IS LIFE! If you have afro, kinky or curly hair and are struggling with keeping your curls in when brushing or detangling your hair, this is your ultimate solution! It actually curls up your hair when wet and when product is in your hair. Its perfect for wash n go&#x27;s, twist outs, braid outs, ANYTHING &amp; EVERYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;*Tip, get either the d41 or d31 if you have afro or thicker hair because the bristles are more spaced out and won&#x27;t pull your hair out, personally I love the 9 row brush (d41) and my hair texture is around a 4b/4c</li>
    <li> So just to be fair and do a hesitant review without hyperbole I want to put some specs out that no one seems to mention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When did I get this?: I purchased this brush recently during the month of July.&lt;br /&gt;And how many times have you used it?: I have used it twice so far.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type and length: 4C, my kitchen (area from my nape up) is a beast, hair by my forehead and ears is like 4B-4A. My hair barely meets at my shoulders in front but in the back the hair on my nape brushes the top of my back.&lt;br /&gt;Do I have other Denmans?: Yes, I have a really old D3 that doesn&#x27;t even look like they do today and the newer version.&lt;br /&gt;How long have you been natural?: 3-4 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have had this brush for a short while, it&#x27;s still the beautiful red color and has yet to turn adobe. It&#x27;s only been 1.5 months, why would it? I bought this from a beauty store I saw in another town. Previous to that I had no idea it existed and was so popular. What grabbed me was that the brush said it was made for Afro and thick hair  and I qualify in both those categories. I liked the fact the bristles were so spaced. This was a solution to modification on the D4 of Goody copy because since the rubber base was made to support the spaced bristles, the base was strong enough to rake through the hair thoroughly, give the user less work of working the handle, and the rubber base wouldn&#x27;t slip out because of stress against more hair than it was intended for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first time I used this, I was of course doing a wet dangle. I had a cheapy tangle teezer I just bought and my D3 to help out too. I was testing the tangle teezer that day too and just in case had my D3 to finish and give a thorough swipe with. Couldn&#x27;t get a fair impression but definitely was taken back by the fact my scalp was getting felt up by this brush. It can actually work it&#x27;s way to your scalp and massage it. That means follicle stimulation and potential hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second use came yesterday and this is what inspired me to write a review today:&lt;br /&gt;I was going to be late to an interview. I needed to shower but I needed to detangle my hair too. I had half an hour to get ready and another to get to this interview. I dislike detangling my hair, it takes well into 30 minutes or more to do. I could avoid this if I wore my hair is a style but I sincerely I don&#x27;t know how to braid and twists hurt my hands sometimes. I just wear a wild Afro and sleep on a satin pillowcase, that &#x27;s all I have time for. So I did some twists after the first time I used the brush and wore the twists in a ponytail to stretch my hair, then 2 weeks later unravel them for my friend&#x27;s graduation party. I&#x27;ve gotten in a pool twice within these 2 weeks and my Fro shrinks but also starts feeling dry. Next thing I know, I have this interview. I&#x27;m in the shower, piling on the Aussie moist con and hoping I can rake through my pseudo matted hair in less than 30 minutes. I decide to put my faith alone in the FreeFlow Denman and did not even pick up my D3 first. But I was doubting the FreeFlow and thought I was gonna need to use the D3 to finish the work and give a thorough detangling. I begin to get my ends doubting it would even detangle them but it did easily. I was hearing fewer pops of hairs too versus when I used my D3. My front and ear area are all detangled, now my kitchen needed working front to back and up. It too submitted to this brush but it did so way more easily than the D3. And all the while, my scalp is massaged by the spaced out bristles. The kicker is this all happened between 10-20 minutes of time. My detangling process became shorter, faster, and less stressful. Just to be sure, I&#x27;ll time myself next time. I had to dash for this interview so that was my only time indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasting Impression: I believe this should be your first Denman brush and I am surprised that Sallys nor any other retailer with a hair section has not picked up their own stock of these specific brushes. It&#x27;s not just hype and in my opinion is an essential tool for naturals.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i had been searching for.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have owned in over twenty years, I like the fact that the teeth on this particular style are spaced out a bit wider.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much fallout like from other brushes and it does a good job of smoothing my thick frizzy hair with a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Just received my Denman today and I am very happy with it. First of the shipping was very fast :). Used it to detangle my very kinky 4b/c hair, I love it. I originally had the D3 I think it is, not bad, but rips out too much hair. This one is definately for kinky,curly, thick African Amaerican hair. Almost want to order another for \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; LOL.</li>
    <li> Unuseable.  They sent the wrong brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used denman brushes since 1974.  This handle is different and has a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; quality.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush to transition my daughters hair from relaxed to natural. After much research, it arrived promptly and didn&#x27;t disappoint. It gets to her thick roots and untangles her hair without a lot of breakage. Well worth the wait as it is hard to find in stores.</li>
