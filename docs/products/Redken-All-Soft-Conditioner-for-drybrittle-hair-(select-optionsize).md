      <li>I love using this redken all soft.</li>
      <li>Love this product keeps my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
      <li>I know it a bit pricey but totally worth every penny.</li>
      <li>“Well, I happen to love All soft products from redken, but the reviews saying the formulation has changed made me change my mind about buying it...</li>
      <li>this product leaves my locks soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I love Redken all soft.</li>
      <li>My hair is WAY less knotty and WAY more healthy with WAY fewer split ends than when I do not use this product.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the large size bottle of the Redken All Soft Conditioner</li>
      <li>the first try</li>
      <li>It detangles, and keeps hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I recently had to purchase more and found the formula had changed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years, but the most recent bottle I got is</li>
      <li>Great for thick, course brittle hair.</li>
      <li>My hair really gets much soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good deep conditioner that actually softens without a rather daunting price tag</li>
      <li>I love Redken products to begin with but this conditioner has lasted me a long time and really conditions my hair.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner made my hair very frizzy after I used it, and also incredibly dry and more prone to breakage.</li>
      <li>This bottle softens my hair very well without making it oily.</li>
      <li>I am VERY dissapointed with Redkin and will not purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>I just really like the product.</li>
      <li>once rinsing my hair it felt brittle and was very tangled.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and would never use any other product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, my hair never feels greasy, just nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>my sister turned me on to this - really does leave hair so soft!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone that has a tangling problem.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>But I use it on the last 4 inches of my long hair and it keeps the length healthy.</li>
      <li>The new formula does not condition dry hair, left it frizzy and more prone to breakage.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll have to find a new product.</li>
      <li>Also they have changed the picture to the new one since I ordered.</li>
      <li>Love.....makes my frizzy hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I discovered that the new formula is argan oil and the old formula was avocado oil.</li>
      <li>Again WARNING if your hair tangles easily, is already dry or hard, and is not easy to manage do not use this product without following up with a good deep moisture rich conditioner.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is watered down, and does not work the way the original formula did.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner really make my hair soft, I use this as my daily conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have been using Redken all soft for about 10 years now.</li>
      <li>This conditioner saved my ends and gave them a baby soft feel.</li>
      <li>A better one I just finished is Keratin Blondeshell Complex Conditioner.</li>
      <li>it felt soft but</li>
      <li>The argon oil formula is unfortunately nowhere near as good as the avocado.</li>
      <li>I read the positive reviews, and unfortunately I believe they refer to an older, better formula.</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry hair</li>
      <li>After using it, I realized it is not the same as the normal Redken all soft conditioner.</li>
      <li>but when I first used it, I noticed it looked different-- white, not yellowish-gold--</li>
      <li>This conditioner isn&#x27;t just for dry, brittle hair, it&#x27;s for anyone who wants luxuriously soft hair.</li>
      <li>I am 53yrs old, have wavy natural blonde hair that I color and highlight.</li>
      <li>and it was much thicker,a different color, and actually conditioned my hair.</li>
      <li>I would recommended this All Soft Conditioner to those who has normal to dry hair.</li>
      <li>It is just a little better than average conditioners in the market, we returned it.</li>
      <li>I have used Redken All Soft for years and would buy several liter bottles at a time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product keeps my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
    <li> I love Redken products to begin with but this conditioner has lasted me a long time and really conditions my hair.  I have very thick hair and need a good/effective conditioner.  I do not like to buy the small bottles because they do not last me long enough because I how much I have to use.  This bottle softens my hair very well without making it oily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner, and after not using for a period of time.  This is NOT the same conditioner I remember using in the past.  This conditioner is watered down, and does not work the way the original formula did.  &amp;#34;New And Improved&amp;#34;?  More like Redkin tried to fix something that was not broken.</li>
    <li> Redken All Soft is some of the best conditioner on the market.  I have thick long hair that is always in dire need of moisture.  This stuff works wonders.  I totally changed the composition of my hair.  What an improvement.  I know it a bit pricey but totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the texture of it. This conditioner really make my hair soft, I use this as my daily conditioner. Once a while when I need extra nourishment, I would pack on hair mask on my hair in stead of this conditioner. I would recommended this All Soft Conditioner to those who has normal to dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, my hair never feels greasy, just nice and soft.  I love this conditioner and would never use any other product.  Delivery was as promised so I was happy!</li>
    <li> My hair is color treated and permed...this product leaves my locks soft and healthy. Never a problem with dry brittle hair since using this.</li>
    <li> I have always used this, my favorite shapoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I just really like the product. but it took FOREVER to get here. only complaint. I had packages I order after I ordered this that got here before this item did.</li>
    <li> I read the positive reviews, and unfortunately I believe they refer to an older, better formula. This conditioner made my hair very frizzy after I used it, and also incredibly dry and more prone to breakage. I only used it a handful of times before abandoning it because it was wrecking my hair, and $4 Garnier conditioner works better for my hair (very long, thick, wavy). It was a disappointing experience overall.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product! But don&#x27;t expect miracles! I have very curly, thick hair and it&#x27;s damaged even though I never use any kind of irons and I use the hair dryer just for one minute or two to dry it. It&#x27;s the only conditioner that makes my hair manageable. I tried other conditioners, but it seems it&#x27;s the only one that fits my hair.  I don&#x27;t like the bottle though. It&#x27;s very tough to squeeze. I tried the small container too and it&#x27;s the same.</li>
    <li> This brand is my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so great. Love how soft it makes my hair! I only use this product since it is so good...cheap on amazon too!</li>
    <li> I have used Redken All Soft for years and would buy several liter bottles at a time. I recently had to purchase more and found the formula had changed. The new formula does not condition dry hair, left it frizzy and more prone to breakage. I am VERY dissapointed with Redkin and will not purchase this product again. I have tried Aveeno brand conditioner and so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Not the avocado formula as the ingredient list states. Also they have changed the picture to the new one since I ordered. The argon oil formula is unfortunately nowhere near as good as the avocado. The bottle I ordered a few months ago is still sitting on my shelf barely used.</li>
    <li> This conditioner isn&#x27;t just for dry, brittle hair, it&#x27;s for anyone who wants luxuriously soft hair. You will find a big difference in the look and feel of your hair with this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for over half a decade now and absolutely swear by it.</li>
    <li> My wife used once and didn&#x27;t like as the result was not as advertised. It is just a little better than average conditioners in the market, we returned it.</li>
    <li> There is an immediate difference when using this product on your hair. It detangles, and keeps hair soft and smooth. I have really long, wavy hair that gets frizzy and this has helped a lot to keep that in control. I&#x27;m a religious user now.</li>
    <li> Love.....makes my frizzy hair very soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> “Well, I happen to love All soft products from redken, but the reviews saying the formulation has changed made me change my mind about buying it... I treat my hair chemically, so I really need a deep hydrating conditioner, and all soft was, in my opinion, the best conditioner I´ve ever used, even the aussie conditioner isn´t as good, but now that they´ve changed the formulation, I´m definitely gonna stick with the aussie conditioners..​. too bad for redken...”</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I have thin and color treated blonde hair, which tends to get oily along the scalp and dry on the ends. This conditioner saved my ends and gave them a baby soft feel.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the conditioner as it is a able to soften my chemically damaged hair. The combing has gotten easier.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is very softening, and works amazingly. It works even better when you leave it in for 5-10 minutes, ( With I do with every conditioner). If your hairs breaking and damaged I would recommend this. I have thick normal to dry hair, and this has turn it in to luscious waves. I cant safe enough good things about this product C: Would recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> my sister turned me on to this - really does leave hair so soft! moving to all organic products though, so this is my last bottle.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for thin, tangled hair (me) I heard great reviews so I purchased this got a great deal for both. I was excited to try it, felt great after putting in the conditioner it felt soft but once rinsing my hair it felt brittle and was very tangled. When it&#x27;s a good product you definitely feel the difference the first try I used it a second time and decided to take it back after that.</li>
    <li> A great softening/moisturizing conditioner that doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. I still have a lot of volume if I just wash and go, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  Works best when using with the matching shampoo.</li>
    <li> Honestly this post is not about this product being bad rather it is about misrepresentation. I ordered this recently after reading numerous reviews about how this product softens the hair. My hair is thick but not unmanageable by any means, however after using this product my hair was hard and tight as if using a strong protein enriched conditioner. This conditioner in my opinion is a good product but not for what it is advertised as based on these reviews.Despite my dissapointment with the advertising I will continue to use it to keep my hair balanced. If you are looking for a good deep conditioner that actually softens without a rather daunting price tag I suggest Elasta QP DPR11 also sold on Amazon. It is a great product and delivers exactly what you want for softness and manageability. Again WARNING if your hair tangles easily, is already dry or hard, and is not easy to manage do not use this product without following up with a good deep moisture rich conditioner.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, looks like Redken has changed the formulations on their All Soft line. I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years, but the most recent bottle I got is useless - hair feels stripped, frizzy, and dry. Looks like the formulation change happened towards the end of 2011. I&#x27;m actively looking for a replacement...</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner because it was less expensive to purchase here then in stores. After using it, I realized it is not the same as the normal Redken all soft conditioner. I still had some left over from the previous bottle I purchased in stores and it was much thicker,a different color, and actually conditioned my hair. This conditioner wasn&#x27;t as thick, lighter in color, and left my hair knotted. I have a feeling I was ripped off and didn&#x27;t receive the true conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of frizzy hair problems and couldn&#x27;t find a shampoo and conditioner that worked. This shampoo and the rinse did the trick. My hair is softer and tamer than it was.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great for thick, course brittle hair. Makes combing and straightening easier</li>
    <li> Makes my dry hair feel awesome.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only conditioners I continue to buy because it does what it advertises. My hair is WAY less knotty and WAY more healthy with WAY fewer split ends than when I do not use this product. Even if I don&#x27;t use this product everyday (I usually use it a few times a week) it does the trick. This bottle has lasted me MONTHS!</li>
    <li> I love this hair conditioner.  I have fine hair, this conditioner keeps my hair smooth. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find the large size bottle of the Redken All Soft Conditioner so I went online and thought I had found it. Ordered 4 bottles but when I first used it, I noticed it looked different-- white, not yellowish-gold-- and it had a different texture. It was not attractive. Furthermore, and most important, it didn&#x27;t do as good a job on my hair! I discovered that the new formula is argan oil and the old formula was avocado oil. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 4 bottles of this stuff and I&#x27;ll have to find a new product. Be forewarned!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I helps keeps her hair from being brittle and breaking as she has long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again when it is needed again</li>
    <li> I started using this conditioner last winter because my hair and scalp couldn&#x27;t keep up in the Wisconsin winter. I haven&#x27;t stopped using it all year and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, the best I&#x27;ve found, excellent to help with conditioning hair. With this conditioner, I have curls for the first time!</li>
    <li> I love Redken all soft. I was a stylist and after I used this I love it . I have been using Redken all soft for about 10 years now. I change occasionally but this is my favorite. Thank you for sending it in such a timely manner!!!!</li>
    <li> This is not so great as a one-and-only conditioner for me since my hair is pretty healthy. It&#x27;s also pretty fine so It really tends to weigh my hair down. But I use it on the last 4 inches of my long hair and it keeps the length healthy. I noticed my scalp was a little oily when I was using only All Soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thicker, drier hair, this is THE BEST. The avocado oil keeps your ends looking great. Might not be great for finer hair though.</li>
    <li> I love using this redken all soft. i have oily hair and it&#x27;s been the only thing that balances that out.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this to me.  I now use it with shampoo. My hair really gets much soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Bought this by mistake, wanted the shampoo; so I gave it to my niece.  I love the Redken All Soft Shampoo!</li>
    <li> This product was amazing when it contained avocado oil. Now with the replacement oil my hair no longer is as manageable .</li>
    <li> This is an Okay conditioner for me- not the best. I am 53yrs old, have wavy natural blonde hair that I color and highlight. This conditioner leaves my hair a little dry and frizzy. A better one I just finished is Keratin Blondeshell Complex Conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the greatest for detangling my daughters hair. I would highly recommend this product for anyone that has a tangling problem.</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry hair and I&#x27;ve found Redken All Soft to be the best shampoo on the market for me.</li>
