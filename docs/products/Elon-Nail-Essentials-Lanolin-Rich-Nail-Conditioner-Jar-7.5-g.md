      <li>I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
      <li>Since using Elon, and I have used it for over 12 years, my nails are very strong and I must cut them because they no longer flake off or break.  </li>

      <li>If you want strong, healthy nails...</li>
      <li>Nails are not breaking as easily, but they also don&#x27;t seem to be growing.  </li>
      <li>This cream keeps my nails looking great - even though I am an avid gardener, and also have my hands in hot soapy water a lot.  </li>
      <li>Using Elon just a couple of times a day had them growing and strong within weeks.  </li>
      <li>I tried so many products and remedies without success until I tried Elon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now my question is ... if I return to using nail polish (toluene and formaldehyde free), will the Elon continue to work on the nail and cuticles?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and highly recommend</li>
      <li>Apparently, this is a good product because it was recommended by my dermatologist; it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>But I originally bought it to see if it helps with stopping nail breakage, but that hasnt changed any so wouldnt recommend it if your trying to target that specifically.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Later, I also purchased Elon&#x27;s moisturizing cream, called Skin Repair System, which is very effective at repairing overly dry</li>
      <li>A MUCH PRETTIER COLOR.THEY DID NOT LOOK HEALTHY UNTIL NOW.</li>
      <li>My fingers had become tender because they were no longer protected by my nails which were tearing below the quick; and I could no longer grasp anything with my fingertips.  </li>
      <li>After many, many years of wearing nail polish, my nails finally insisted I give it up.  </li>
      <li>My hands looked great but the after effects were not worth it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for your nails and nail skin now in the dry time of winter.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
      <li>For the money, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>At this point it is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>I used Elon on my splitting nails for several months, it was surprising how fast my nails changed.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for one year and the results have been almost immediate in a very positive manner.</li>
      <li>I bought it right away.</li>
      <li>It was by far the best and most effective of the samples I received, and so I bought 3 of these small jars - one for next to my recliner chair, one for my purse and one next to the bed.</li>
      <li>(small container is great for keeping in pocket, in car, wherever.</li>
      <li>After a few months of daily use I now have perfect nails.  </li>
      <li>After 7 months of using it 3-4 times a day, every single day, my nails are still peeling, splitting, and breaking (each nail has its own issue).  </li>
      <li>So far it seems fine.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it pretty faithfully.  </li>
      <li>She told me to soak my nails for 5 minutes in hot water before applying the nail conditioner.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>NOW I HAVE PRETTY NAILS.</li>
      <li>works best if you use a thin oil such as jojoba or camellia first then seal it in with the elon cream.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to massage the cream also into the skin just above the nail - where the new part of the nail is growing.  </li>
      <li>Heals fast.</li>
      <li>My nails are now whole and my fingetips are protected.  </li>
      <li>This stuff REALLY works.</li>
      <li>I am very grateful.</li>
      <li>I have absolutely seen an improvement.</li>
      <li>Really helped strengthen my splitting nails</li>
      <li>My nails started healing within 2 weeks; and after a month, they started growing out normally and are much stronger.</li>
      <li>After 6 weeks of using Elon I can see a noticeable difference, so have high hopes of improving as time goes on.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>My nails have grown out with no more cracks and splits and are very strong.  </li>
      <li>I like the jar a little better than the tube</li>
      <li>My nails are still peeling, but I hope that once they grow out a little more, that will stop.</li>
      <li>My nail is now normal</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it does not have a pleasant smell</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s something you can live with.  </li>
      <li>Since it takes about 6 months for a completely new nail to grow in, what is there now has been treated since before they even appeared from out of my cuticles.  </li>
      <li>Within several weeks my nails had grown back out to their normal length (not long, just comfortable), and when I bump the nails they don&#x27;t immediately split and peel!</li>
      <li>As long as I keep using it daily, my nails are strong and never break or peel.</li>
      <li>I have used it several years and have found it better than any other product</li>
      <li>It is the first nail product I have used that actually works.  </li>
      <li>They are now stronger than ever and because I use clear polish,  </li>
      <li>I foresee a time when I won&#x27;t need it so frequently</li>
      <li>I feel it is too early to say whether it will produce the desired results.</li>
      <li>After several weeks of using the product as directed, I really do see a noticeable improvement.  </li>
      <li>Works very well and has already made a difference in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>A 60 YEAR OLD</li>
      <li>THE TUBE IS NOT VERY LARGE,BUT I THINK WELL WORTH</li>
      <li>ALL THE BAD PARTS BEFORE YOU CAN SEE HOW GREAT IT</li>
      <li>great for cracked fingers (so painful) in the winter months.</li>
      <li>and I spent years trying to get it to grow straight.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived as promised on time, and product was as expected.</li>
    <li> Product was recommended by my dermatologist. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. Seems to help.  Nails are not breaking as easily, but they also don&#x27;t seem to be growing.  Will keep using it as directed til my supply runs out and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Way too soon to tell - it may take several weeks or months.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this cream.  It has done a wonderful job of repairing and moisturizing my dry nails. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hands down (no pun intended) - this is the BEST treatment I have ever found for hopeless fingernails.  No matter what I do - my fingernails are so weak - they will bend.  If I try to chew them - they just bend.  They also flake, tear, and just won&#x27;t get long.  I even have one nail that splits all the way down because of damage to the nail bed.  This cream helps that nail to not split.  Since using Elon, and I have used it for over 12 years, my nails are very strong and I must cut them because they no longer flake off or break.  It works best if you remember to massage it into each nail in the morning and again at night (you can do it while you&#x27;re on hold on the phone).  If you use this cream faithfully (twice a day), you will be rewarded with the nails of your dreams.  Be sure to massage the cream also into the skin just above the nail - where the new part of the nail is growing.  This cream also prevents hangnails.  The cream does have a smell to it - but it&#x27;s something you can live with.  I have to admit that sometimes I only use the cream once a day and it works - but twice a day is best.  This cream keeps my nails looking great - even though I am an avid gardener, and also have my hands in hot soapy water a lot.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> My fingernails were in terrible shape, split and cracked. No pharmacy could suggest anything.  My doctor suggested Elon.  She told me to soak my nails for 5 minutes in hot water before applying the nail conditioner.  That is a crucial step.  I did that 2 to 4 times a day.  The results were miraculous!  My nails were beautiful.  Several years later - once again my nails became split.  I realized it was because  I had used nail polish and nail polish remover.  My hands looked great but the after effects were not worth it.  Again I used Elon to return them to terrific shape.  I heartily recommend Elon.  Elon is only sold online.  I have never found it in a store.</li>
    <li> I have never used false nails and have never had a professional manicure; but every nail was splitting and tearing, which also caused them to catch on everything and tear even deeper.  My fingers had become tender because they were no longer protected by my nails which were tearing below the quick; and I could no longer grasp anything with my fingertips.  In desperation, I went to the dermatologist.  The dermatologist believes medication and/or anesthetic relating to surgery 6 mos. earlier was probably the cause.  She suggested using Elon Nail Conditioner on my nails daily (which I could only find online)and taking Biotin.  My nails started healing within 2 weeks; and after a month, they started growing out normally and are much stronger. My nails are now whole and my fingetips are protected.  I am very grateful.</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old male and few years ago I started having problems with splitting and cracking fingernails.  I tried a number of products- nothing worked until ELON.  After a few months of daily use I now have perfect nails.  A miracle product for me.</li>
    <li> After many, many years of wearing nail polish, my nails finally insisted I give it up.  Even that didn&#x27;t repair the damage so I decided to try the Elon conditioner.  After several weeks of using the product as directed, I really do see a noticeable improvement.  Still miss the nail polish, but it&#x27;s lovely to have nails that are in much better shape.</li>
    <li> I bought the product after several coworkers recommended it for helping nails grow stronger. I have been using it daily for over 8 weeks now and have not noticed a difference in length, only maybe in the cuticle growth. For some reason, my cuticles seem thiner and that&#x27;s a good thing. But I originally bought it to see if it helps with stopping nail breakage, but that hasnt changed any so wouldnt recommend it if your trying to target that specifically.</li>
    <li> Tried many options for peeling cracked nails, but nothing worked.  After 6 weeks of using Elon I can see a noticeable difference, so have high hopes of improving as time goes on.</li>
    <li> If you want strong, healthy nails...you MUST use this product!  Due to a death in the family, I was run down and my nails were splitting, ridging, cracking.  Using Elon just a couple of times a day had them growing and strong within weeks.  They are now stronger than ever and because I use clear polish,  I apply the product around my cuticles and tips before going to sleep.  I am a happy customer who will order this again when the supply runs out. And on that note, it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Nails don&#x27;t break when I am using this product. But I tend to forget often. The tube is really tiny for the price - reason for the 4 stars. If you use it 3-4 times a day it gets over in no time, though the amount needed is really small.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest nail conditioner out there. I had a nail that was disfigured due to infection and I spent years trying to get it to grow straight. I tried so many products and remedies without success until I tried Elon. My nail is now normal and I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed and hide my hand. I&#x27;m never without this product. I like the jar a little better than the tube but I use both. If you have problem nails try this..several times a day and you will see results in a few weeks..give it time and stick with it.</li>
    <li> Whiles this product does moisten my nails, I was using it in an attempt to repair a thumb nail that has been splitting for at least three years.  It still is splitting.  Apparently, this is a good product because it was recommended by my dermatologist; it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Even though it comes in a very small container and is rather expensive, it lasts a long time.  For the money, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff is okay and seems to work well - it smells a bit unpleasant. I am going to keep using it to see if my nails grow.</li>
    <li> My nails would break and peel until I started using this cream!  Give it a few months and you will see results.  it&#x27;s dermatologist recommend.</li>
    <li> The Elon Nail conditioner jar was purchases on Sept 20 and was to be her on Sept 26 or Oct 1 this is Oct 3</li>
    <li> I have been using it pretty faithfully.  Trying to fix a nail that splits down the middle.  It says it takes about 4 months so I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I bought product based on reviews. I feel it is too early to say whether it will produce the desired results.</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews before buying this product. It seemed too good to be true. But it works!  As long as I keep using it daily, my nails are strong and never break or peel.</li>
    <li> I rated this product with 5 stars. I had dry, cracked, jagged nails and whatever I put on it helped. My dermatologist told me about Elon nail conditioner. I bought it right away. Although it is a bit pricey, it works. I bought a second jar (actually 2 at once) through Amazon. I highly recommend it. I foresee a time when I won&#x27;t need it so frequently but for now, I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> It seems to be doing what it is supposed to do, keep my cuticles from being too dry, hope it strengthens my nails  too</li>
    <li> Bring it back! It is the only lanolin cream that allowed my nails to grow without breaking. My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this treatment did not help my nails at all.  After 7 months of using it 3-4 times a day, every single day, my nails are still peeling, splitting, and breaking (each nail has its own issue).  Since it takes about 6 months for a completely new nail to grow in, what is there now has been treated since before they even appeared from out of my cuticles.  I&#x27;m continuing to use it, but I&#x27;ve just added another nail conditioner and now have to wait months again to see if that will work.</li>
    <li> My wife is diabetic. Her nails were brittle and cracking. Not good. After a few weeks of use her symptoms are gone. This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> The size of both the jar and the tube are too small for the price.  I never specified that I wanted a jar.  I do not know why two different packagings were sent</li>
    <li> I have thin brittle nails. I apply this twice a day and they grow out stronger. I have used it several years and have found it better than any other product</li>
    <li> Works very well and has already made a difference in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Works like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, if used according to the directions. I keep it on hand and use it as a preventative even af ter the condition has improved.</li>
    <li> Really helped strengthen my splitting nails</li>
    <li> works best if you use a thin oil such as jojoba or camellia first then seal it in with the elon cream.  it lasts, is portable (a must for at work) and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST product for cuticles.  I&#x27;ve used for years and am so glad I can purchase from Amazon because it is difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping my brittle nails.  It is taking too long for my taste though....  However, I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have poor finger nails that are constantly chipping, breaking, etc.  This product helps them stay firm and grow in all kinds of weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had weak nails that split, but a few months ago they became extremely dry and brittle and split vertically into the nail bed (the quick). It was painful and very unattractive. During a visit to the dermatologist I was given a few samples of nail creams, and Elon was among the samples. It was by far the best and most effective of the samples I received, and so I bought 3 of these small jars - one for next to my recliner chair, one for my purse and one next to the bed. Within several weeks my nails had grown back out to their normal length (not long, just comfortable), and when I bump the nails they don&#x27;t immediately split and peel! I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my question is ... if I return to using nail polish (toluene and formaldehyde free), will the Elon continue to work on the nail and cuticles? Hopefully someone has discovered this on their own ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I also purchased Elon&#x27;s moisturizing cream, called Skin Repair System, which is very effective at repairing overly dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust Elon products - they are excellent!</li>
    <li> So far it seems fine.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks.  My nails are still peeling, but I hope that once they grow out a little more, that will stop.</li>
    <li> for those of us that have split dry nails, this product does indeed help. i am going to continue using it. I have absolutely seen an improvement.</li>
    <li> Wonderful treatment for strengthening nails, first product that I found that makes my nails stronger and not splitting.  ALSO: great for cracked fingers (so painful) in the winter months. Just keep handy (small container is great for keeping in pocket, in car, wherever. Apply to cracked fingers often thru-out day and generous at night followed with finger bandaid. Heals fast.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good for your nails and nail skin now in the dry time of winter.&lt;br /&gt;it did help me against the socks hanging on my fingers when I&#x27;m folding them :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one year and the results have been almost immediate in a very positive manner.</li>
    <li> I used Elon on my splitting nails for several months, it was surprising how fast my nails changed.  I tried to use it twice a day.  Then I stopped for a few months, quickly my nails went back to being weak and splitting, I am again using Elon and I see my nails improving already.  I will continue to use this product.  My dermatologist recommended this cream.  I have used both the tube and jar, I prefer the jar, the cream tends to thicken in the tube from my experience.  The jar will last a long time.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY works. My dermatologist told me about this product and it is the only thing that finally helped my hands and nails. I definitly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I JUST HAPPENED TO FIND THIS PRODUCT ON THE BEST SELLERS LIST. IT IS TRULY AMAZING. WHAT NO ONE SEEMS TO SAY IS THAT IT WILL TAKE YOUR NAILS GROWING OFF ALL THE BAD PARTS BEFORE YOU CAN SEE HOW GREAT IT IS.IT TOOK MINE ABOUT 3 MONTHS. NOW THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL,STRONG AND A MUCH PRETTIER COLOR.THEY DID NOT LOOK HEALTHY UNTIL NOW. FOR ABOUT THIRTEEN DOLLARS,IT IS A LITTLE MIRACLE. THE TUBE IS NOT VERY LARGE,BUT I THINK WELL WORTH IT.I AM A 60 YEAR OLD,TRYING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MYSELF. NOW I HAVE PRETTY NAILS.</li>
    <li> Elon nail conditioner works for me.  It is the first nail product I have used that actually works.  At this point it is worth the price.  The amount seems too small for the price...but it works so it may be the answer to my nail problems.  I ordered it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist to help prevent my nails from splitting.  I have not used it long enough to say that did help, but I am still hoping.  My only complaint is that it does not have a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and feels very good on my dry cuticles.  I have only been using it a few weeks and can already see an improvement in the number of hangnails.  The directions say it takes 16 weeks for optimum results and I expect to keep using it, probably from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I have been using this product for 5 months now along with Derma Nail Conditioner as recommended by my dermatologist.  My nails have grown out with no more cracks and splits and are very strong.  I am thrilled with this product.  My nails have never looked so good.  Have reordered several times and given some to other people.  Intend to use it forever!</li>
