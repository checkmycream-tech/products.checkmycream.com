      <li>tub of conditioner is huge, so don&#x27;t let the price intimidate you.</li>
      <li>Item description is accurate.</li>
      <li>This conditioner is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Great for damaged dry hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever had such a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Very effective for moisturizing and softening dry, frizzy hair!</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>but they would ship right away.  </li>
      <li>Its best to use it on the bottom half of your hair, keeping it away from the roots unless you have extremely dry hair all the way to your scalp.</li>

      <li>Really like this product!</li>
      <li>Very irritated at the inconvenience!</li>
      <li>My stylist cannot believe that my hair is so healthy, since I use heat on it daily.</li>

      <li>And has a pleasant but not overwhelming scent.</li>
      <li>When I use it on my own hair, without the extensions, my hair is extremely silky and is noticeably healthier looking.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am older, but love it just the same.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper and lower quality product.</li>
      <li>It lasts forever, and I probably use more than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Would recommend it to anyone with normal to oily hair.</li>
      <li>and this is the only stuff that works to smooth the hair enough to be straightened.</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner--takes very little to do a WOW job!  </li>
      <li>The only time I apply it to my hair from root to end is the first shampoo after I get</li>
      <li>It does make it really soft and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
      <li>My hair type is fairly normal (naturally), however I highlight it blonde and also wear hair extensions.  </li>
      <li>recommend using it every other shampoo if your hair is pretty damaged.</li>
      <li>While it does not completely untangle very curly coarse colored hair like mine; it does help.  </li>

<li> While it does not completely untangle very curly coarse colored hair like mine; it does help.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist...and extremely impress with how it instantly de-tangles, moisturizes, and makes your hair soft and manageable.</li>
<li> I color and highlight my hair, plus I blow dry daily.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it as much as I would like because it is very pricey.</li>
<li> tried this product several years ago after experimenting with other deep conditioners...</li>
<li> I use it 3 times per week on my highlighted/colored hair that tends to be dry and flyaway.</li>
<li> Have been using it daily for the past several years, no buildup, just shiny, silky, healthy-looking hair every day.</li>
<li> However, I have noticed that even though I mix it up with other conditioners now and then, the effectiveness of this conditioner has seemed to lag a little over the last month.</li>
<li> It definitely helps weigh my hair down a little so that it&#x27;s easier to straighten and smoothe.</li>
<li> Very little is needed and the tub lasts for up to a year, even with daily use.  </li>
<li> In the past, I would have to occasionally switch out my conditioner as I&#x27;d end up with a buildup in my hair.  </li>
<li> Not worth the price though.</li>
<li> You do not need alot of this, a little goes along way with this stuff</li>
<li> I wasted $45.  </li>
<li> I live in Montana where it is very cold and very dry.</li>
<li> condition is very thick, but doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
<li> and it is so hard to keep moisturized.</li>
<li> I have thick course curly hair</li>
<li> It was not as thick as it should have been.</li>
<li> cause its so thick.</li>
<li> Not so with Serious Conditioner.  </li>
<li> I specifically ordered serious conditioner by s factor and there was a posted picture of the product I was inquiring</li>
<li> and I received a totally different brand and product worst experience in my entire life.</li>
<li> I use this condition every couple weeks as a serious pick me up for my hair.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t soften my hair like some less expensive products do.</li>
<li> Too thin.</li>
<li> Needless to say, my hair takes a beating.</li>
<li> I should of returned this crap and got the Serious conditioner by S Factor that was in the picture.</li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed with the consistency of it.</li>
<li> Worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>

    <li> I heard about this conditioner from my daughter who has a mass of curly hair. I am older, but love it just the same. I don&#x27;t think I have ever had such a good conditioner. I live in Montana where it is very cold and very dry. It works!</li>
    <li> Not the product pictured. Much cheaper and lower quality product. Very irritated at the inconvenience!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> My hair definitely feels and looks so much better when I use this. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it as much as I would like because it is very pricey. I love the smell of it and if you massage it into your scalp it will tingle and smell wonderful. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> Not the same product as pictured. It is a totally different brand. I DO NOT recommend buying from this seller what so ever! Worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> Ordered product and about 2 weeks after I received shipment confirmation I did not receive. Went to track package but it was obvious that the tracking number was made up (tracking number said 123). Contacted seller and they said that it was a mistake but they would ship right away.  Still did not receive.  They did refund my money.</li>
    <li> It was not as thick as it should have been. I was disappointed with the consistency of it. Too thin. I have used this product for years and know it should be thicker.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Not worth the price though. Didn&#x27;t soften my hair like some less expensive products do.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!! It is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is also sulfate free! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My hair type is fairly normal (naturally), however I highlight it blonde and also wear hair extensions.  This conditioner works wonders on my own damaged ends and keeps my extensions hydrated. This is the only conditioner I will use when I am wearing extensions, as it is the only condition that has ever restored the moisture in the ends of my hair extensions to make them look like the day I bought the hair! When I use it on my own hair, without the extensions, my hair is extremely silky and is noticeably healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product several years ago after experimenting with other deep conditioners...Kerastase, Redken, and Neutrogena. They each worked okay for me, but my hair was still quite dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The condition is very thick, but doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. Its best to use it on the bottom half of your hair, keeping it away from the roots unless you have extremely dry hair all the way to your scalp. The only time I apply it to my hair from root to end is the first shampoo after I get my hair colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it every other shampoo if your hair is pretty damaged. You won&#x27;t notice any buildup or weight if you use it every shampoo, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tub of conditioner is huge, so don&#x27;t let the price intimidate you.Worth every penny. It lasts forever, and I probably use more than the average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent? Unique, and not too strong. Almost like a minty strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to restore moisture in their hair.</li>
    <li> A very good conditioner with a peppermint aroma.  While it does not completely untangle very curly coarse colored hair like mine; it does help.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Everyone should utilize this amazing product it will tingle your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Best hair results in years….&lt;br /&gt;Great styling afterwards.....&lt;br /&gt;Wow...</li>
    <li> I like this a lot!  The smell is AMAZING!!  The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t stick with your hair.  It does make it really soft and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this condition every couple weeks as a serious pick me up for my hair.  Works wonders on my color treated hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> So happy i found this conditioner. I have thick course curly hair and it is so hard to keep moisturized. You do not need alot of this, a little goes along way with this stuff cause its so thick. It smells like peppermint and makes your scalp feel all tingly. I would reccommend this product for all hair types.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is worth every penny! I&#x27;m a hairstylist...and extremely impress with how it instantly de-tangles, moisturizes, and makes your hair soft and manageable. Great for damaged dry hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has extremely coarse curly hair and this is the only stuff that works to smooth the hair enough to be straightened. Wonderful product and a fantastic price. And has a pleasant but not overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it. However, when I recieved this product it was a compelety different color and smell. Instead of the soft pink it was an orange color. I do NOT recommend buying from this seller.</li>
    <li> Very effective for moisturizing and softening dry, frizzy hair! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and will continue to buy it every time I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner on and off for about three years. I use it 3 times per week on my highlighted/colored hair that tends to be dry and flyaway. It definitely helps weigh my hair down a little so that it&#x27;s easier to straighten and smoothe.However, I have noticed that even though I mix it up with other conditioners now and then, the effectiveness of this conditioner has seemed to lag a little over the last month. It&#x27;s still my favorite though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years as my daily conditioner. I color and highlight my hair, plus I blow dry daily. Needless to say, my hair takes a beating. Thankfully, this stuff keeps it looking great. Love it!</li>
    <li> Really like this product!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Picture and description didnt match. This product didnt help my hair at all. I wasted $45.  I should of returned this crap and got the Serious conditioner by S Factor that was in the picture. I feel ripped off. No star review</li>
    <li> In the past, I would have to occasionally switch out my conditioner as I&#x27;d end up with a buildup in my hair.  Not so with Serious Conditioner.  Have been using it daily for the past several years, no buildup, just shiny, silky, healthy-looking hair every day. Very little is needed and the tub lasts for up to a year, even with daily use.  Love this product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I specifically ordered serious conditioner by s factor and there was a posted picture of the product I was inquiring and I received a totally different brand and product worst experience in my entire life.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever! I have fine hair, not lots of it but the S Factor conditioner makes a visible difference. My color seems to last longer using this also.</li>
    <li> Item pictured is not the correct item. Item description is accurate.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner--takes very little to do a WOW job!  Would recommend it to anyone with normal to oily hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist cannot believe that my hair is so healthy, since I use heat on it daily. It is all thanks to TIGI&#x27;s S Factor Conditioner!</li>
