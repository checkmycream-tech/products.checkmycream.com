<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for over a month, twice a day, and I am disappointed to say I have seen no difference. After reading all the wonderful reviews, I had really hoped the cream would actually improve the dark circles under my eyes, if not eliminate them. Normally, I do not expect miracles, but I foolishly believed the people who gave it raving reviews. I gave it 3 stars in my review because the cream did not harm my skin; it just didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> this product actually burnt my under eye skin so bad,i have been in pain and suffering severly since .i would not reccomend this without first trying it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I love it. First very good price, 2nd very fast delivery</li>
    <li> beware! this gave me a horrible, red painful rash under my eyes.  My eyes swelled so bad, do not buy if you have sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> The product does not come with any list of ingredients or directions for use on the bottle or the packaging.</li>
    <li> Absolutely greatly working</li>
    <li> ...i were younger...good</li>
    <li> Works as promised, however, I also needed a bag reducer as well.  Did not reduce bags under my eyes.  But it only advertises reducing dark circles, which it did.</li>
    <li> Great product. So light. And I see a difference.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m going to try to return it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again.</li>
    <li> The 5 star ratings are all fake. They&#x27;ve flooded Amazon with their own reviews. The product does not work and comes with no list of ingredients or directions. Don&#x27;t be impressed by the fancy bottle. The product has the consistency of water.</li>
    <li> i love quality &amp; design &amp; price&lt;br /&gt;very good goods</li>
    <li> What can I say I love it</li>
    <li> It was great. Excellent item.</li>
    <li> Hopefully I&#x27;m gonna get younger.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time studying and doing essays and so my sleep ends up being crap. I wake up with dark circles under my eyes all the time so I got this cream and I&#x27;m happy to say that the circles aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable as before and are actually fading nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the first to admit that I thought I&#x27;d never be buying a product like this but after being asked if I had been punched in the face a few times from the dark circles under my eyes, I thought I should probably at least *try* to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived quickly and was definitely &amp;#34;fast acting&amp;#34; like the ad promises. I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;m using an organic, oil-free product and am super happy that people will stop questioning whether or not I was punched in the face!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the light-weight and ready-to-go eye serum; I do have extremely fair skin color and after just a few days of applying this new  product I started to see first brightening benefits. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results - Thanks!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with this product. Are these positive reviews even real?&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my under eye dark circles at all. They look exactly the same as when I started applying this product, twice a day, almost two weeks ago. My under eye makeup is far more efficient than this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Seller says they offer a 90 day guarantee. I&#x27;ll be getting my money back.</li>
    <li> Not convined that it is doing what was advertised</li>
    <li> I have used almost all the eye creams that are available and I was most satisfied with this. I have had skin problems with puffiness around the eyes for awhile and have been desperate to treat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I started to use this cream everything started to clear up. I can&#x27;t tell you how relieved I was and how much better my life has become thanks to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend  this for anyone suffering from skin problems or even anyone that just wants healthier skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a huge favor and buy it!</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and bags under the eyes for years. This product has really been helpful for my skin an my dark circles. This is a high quality product that I use daily. I have noticed it is working and I like the feel and the smell of the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many organic skincare products, but am often left disappointed--but not this time! This lightweight serum is non-greasy, goes on smoothly, and on top of that really works. Not only have my dark circles diminished, but my skin is tighter and firmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still a young 30-something year old at the time of writing this review, but I have noticed lately that the color of under my eyes wasn&#x27;t matching the rest of my facial skin anymore. So when I came across this product, it peaked my interest. I&#x27;m very much into natural health and organic products, too, so I decided to go ahead and test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My verdict: I look forward to doing this every day now, as it&#x27;s almost like giving my eyes a mini-massage. It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply and effective at reducing those dark circles. And it smells wonderful to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, if you&#x27;re looking for a dark circle remover that works, try this one!</li>
    <li> The best! Really is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a superb product, after a matter of weeks my skin is glowing! After the winter my skin became really dry and irritated, and I have quite a few wrinkles creeping in (the age, not the winter), but having used this my skin is hydrated and feels really smooth, no bags under eyes too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend recommended this and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the negative reviews to be really unhelpful, I&#x27;m pretty sure they are fake reviews probably by a competitor as they all have the same sort of scam scare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this serum. Was sceptical at first but after two weeks really saw the difference. Does a great job with crows feet.  A little goes a long way and use the excess left on finger tops to smooth on all the other lines!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I found a promo code that reduced the total price to shipping charge only.  After reading the reviews, I had serious questions about the company, but continued to test/ use  2 times a day for the last month.  Due to allergies,  I have dark, Dark circles that I have battled for most of my life.  I must admit that this cream has reduced both the dark circles and puffiness.  Comparing this product to Revita Labs eye serum (the only other brand I have used) this product works better on my eyes.  I am very pleased with the results and  impressed with this product.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  After applying thus product my eye area became red and puffy, not e effect I was looking for.  Something in this product did not agree with me, however, company refunded me post haste and I have to give kudos to the company for the way it handled my return.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for myself. I have tried many other products similar to this and none of them have ever worked. But, Punch did wonders for me. Within the first 2 weeks of use I saw an improvement with the dark circles under my eyes. A week or two after I started to notice a change, the dark circles under my eyes were completely gone. I will continue to use this product and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to remove dark circles from under their eyes.</li>
    <li> This was great!  Did exactly what I was hoping for.  Anyone that has dark circles and wrinkles will love this product.</li>
    <li> First the bottle came in this really nice packaged box. It reminded me of Ralph Lauren or Armani boxes and the figure shaped bottle was great. But the fact that the cream itself was light was a plus. That means I didn&#x27;t have to rub really hard or repeatedly into my skin. And it could dissolve more into my pores. Great job I am seeing an incredible difference.</li>
    <li> I was weary of this company from the start. A new product with glowing reviews all over the place. Every review was also too descriptive of the persons background like, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a college student studying late nights&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a nurse working the late shift&amp;#34;. The one word review headlines too, &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; equals &#x3D; FAKE. Also, it was very difficult to find their poorly built website using google on my phone. The packaging didn&#x27;t even include instructions!!?? Not on the box, the bottle itself, or even on the paper insert. I have used it for a few weeks but don&#x27;t see much difference. I researched the active ingredient &#x27;Blend of Arbutin&#x27; which is essentially a skin brightener which is supposedly safer than  hydroquinone. However, some studies show Arbutin turns into hydroquinone. Long story short, I should of listened to my granny who always said, &amp;#34;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is&amp;#34;. All the tons of positive &#x27;Amazon Verified&#x27; reviews on this are fake and obviously not closely monitored by Amazon. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Although this product doesn&#x27;t deliver everything it claims, I do see some slight improvement with my under eye dark circles especially in natural light.  I have been using it for a month.  Let&#x27;s see what the future brings.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product and I still love it. It has fixed the darkness under my eyes and I keep getting told that I look a lot younger. I talked my mother into trying it and this is going to be her first time. I just know she will love.</li>
    <li> The packaging is beautiful, it doesnt smell weird, is easy to use, and it works. What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Okay, so I was a little cautious about this product as it does have a few bad reviews, but I decided to go ahead and get it and I have to say I am really surprised and glad that I did. The cream is smooth, goes on evenly, started to make a difference within a couple days and is very affordable compared to some other eye creams. I love that it is organic as I&#x27;m conscientious about the beauty products I use on my body (especially my face), but I didn&#x27;t have any worries... it&#x27;s gentle and effective at the same time. Beyond the fact that it works, is affordable and is organic, is that a little goes a long way; I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 week now and I have hardly made a dent in the level of the anti-aging cream. I don&#x27;t know about anybody else&#x27;s experience with the product, but mine has been a great one! Thank you for making such a great product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m almost 30, I&#x27;m beginning to become more aware of my appearance. I know I&#x27;m still considered &#x27;young&#x27; by society&#x27;s standards, but the crows feet and smile lines that have started to appear on my face says otherwise! Anyway, I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for products that can help with my under eye dark circles, I&#x27;ve tried other products, and so far, nothing has really worked. I was close to giving up until I saw this under eye cream on amazon. The price was reasonable, and it has a lot of good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW. That&#x27;s all I can say! Within one week, I could start to see the under eye circles fade, and after 3 weeks of using the product daily, they are just about gone! I will definitely continue to purchase this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone else dealing with horrible under eye circles.</li>
    <li> This is a great organic dark circles under eye treatment!&lt;br /&gt;would recommend! BC&lt;br /&gt;Good product, try it yourself and see!</li>
    <li> Punch Skin Care is great, totally organic; I placed the bottle on my night stand and used it each evening.  Then I would use it again in the morning along with my normal moisturizing routine.  I have suffered with dark circles my whole life all the women in my family have them and this product made a difference.  I was very impressed with the results.  The product does not have a strong odor and absorbs easily into the skin.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the good reviews, I used it diligently for a week and saw nothing!  In fact, the skin beneath my eyes went back to the way they were before I had started using a different product (supposedly for face, but worked for eyes as well).</li>
    <li> A little definitely goes a long way.  I have been using this product for approximately a little over a month now.  I can see a significant change.  I recently met up with a former colleague for lunch who asked me what my &amp;#34;secret for the fountain of youth&amp;#34; was.  I let him know about this little number.  I have been using it religiously since I got it and absolutely love it.  My skin appearance is definitely smoother and tighter.  If you have been trying product after product as I used to in the past, make this your &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Since I read the comments here I was so excited to use this product.. But... I am using for 4 weeks and I can not see difference. My dark circles as too dark as before.. I am going to keep trying, but now no big expectation..</li>
    <li> I have notorious dark circles under my eyes.  I have dark circles to the point that my mother asks me why I don&#x27;t sleep more?  It&#x27;s really sad.  I ask her why she didn&#x27;t give me better genetics, but that&#x27;s because I am a smart aleck .  Eventually, all the parental pressure over the years made me cave in, I decided to look for a solution to my problem (which was not a sleep one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that this product had really amazing reviews. I had never seen so many 5 star reviews for an eye cream. Seriously, I looked on a lot of websites.  Most websites charge way more for products that have only 2 or 3 stars.  I started to wonder if this was a scam. I clicked on all the reviewers names to see what other products they reviewed.  The reviewers appeared to be legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients for a lot of the luxury brands may be fancy but I am pretty sure that the only active ingredient that they have that actually works is a concealer which really just hides the problem instead of dealing with its underlying cause.  I do not want to hide who I am.  I want to improve my skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first product I saw that was within a reasonable price range that actually had promise.  So far, I have used it on and off for a couple of weeks. I try to remember to wear it nightly but sometimes I forget.  It has visibly decreased the amount of darkness I have under my eyes ever so slightly. I have great hope that it will continue to work because it has improved my raccoon eyes where no other product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it appears to do:&lt;br /&gt;* wear it for a couple weeks&lt;br /&gt;* It appears to be absorbed by the skin and make it more hydrated&lt;br /&gt;* your skin may hold more water and be plumper&lt;br /&gt;* the capillaries and blood vessels don&#x27;t appear so dark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just my guess. I did not get to see what the formula of this product is, but that is how I am guessing it works based on what it did to my face.</li>
    <li> this product, punch under eye cream, did not work at all, i should have know better  i blame myself, save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband.  After 3 days of use he developed a rash under his eyes.  According to their product description on amazon, they have a 90 day guarantee.  I tried to contact Punch directly via their website and through email.  All correspondence came back as &amp;#34;undeliverable: address rejected&amp;#34;.  The marketing material that came with the product was poor English which was obviously translated from another language.  Combine this with the rejected emails, this got me wondering if it was a legitimate company.  So I did a little digging into the company phone number provided on their website.  Interestingly enough, that phone number was associated to not one, not two, but NINE different companies, not including Punch Skin Care!!! Each website has the exact same layout and feel but range in industries from investment to footwear to design! Some were in Czech, some were in English, and some were unfinished websites.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a phone number that is automatically propagated by a website development company, but either way it doesn&#x27;t look good.  Buy at your own risk!</li>
    <li> Over two years I have tried the top nine eye creams on Amazon and only three out of nine showed any results. This is one of the three, and this one is the most expensive. The money back guarantee is what made me give it a try. The cream feels nice as it goes on and it drys into the skin quickly without an oily feel. I&#x27;m not saying This is the best eye cream in the world! What I am saying is I saw results toward the end of my first bottle.</li>
    <li> Since I started using Punch I don&#x27;t look nearly as old and haggard as I did 3 weeks ago! My eyelids were getting wrinkly and crowlike.  I was beginning to feel 10 years older than I am. Thank God for this product. It goes on nice and light, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m adding tons of goop to my face. My skin feels smoother and fresher. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes for quite some time, and normally I would just try to cover it up with make up.  But I decided to try this eye cream and I was surprised by how effective it was and how quickly it worked.  There were visible results after about a week, which I never expected.  I would highly recommend this to anyone dealing with the same problem I was.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this punch skin care cream. But I received it in a timely fashion and was pleasantly surprised. I use the product as per direction and it worked for me. It has a pleasant smell and I was tired of looking tired all the time. I also love the fact that punch skin care goes on lightly and not too heavy on my face. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants the dark circles gone and is looking have youthful under eye skin again in a more healthy way.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really suffer from dark circles but bought this eye cream based on everyone raving about it for puffiness reduction too.  Well, it works!  Takes care of any puffiness within minutes but also lightens very well too, leaving my under eye area noticably lighter than the rest of my skin....not exactly a look I desire.  I don&#x27;t like to wear make up on a daily basis but now I need to in order to even out the color difference.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really like the eye cream but since I don&#x27;t have dark circles to lighten this cream is not for me.  I will be passing it to a friend that always complains about dark under her eyes, she will be thrilled!!!</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t purchased this product yet...you really need to. Many products don&#x27;t often work for me....but this did. I was surprised to see how the results looked in just a short period of time! I have been getting these wrinkles around my eyes (along with puffiness) but this cream has helped to diminish and lessen the look of them! I love it! I use it every day! I am planning on trying the other products in the punch skin care line (this product was my first introduction to the brand...but I like it so I will definitely come back for more!) Also when you put the cream under your eyes it just has this awesome cooling feeling...and it brightens up my whole look! Will order again!!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is fantastic! It does as stated. I have noticed a great improvement in how my eyes look every time I put this on before bed. I wake up looking refreshed and like I had a full nights rest! (Even if sometimes that isn&#x27;t the case) The cream is light, non greasy, and it glides on smooth. The scent is fresh and light as well. I especially love the bottle design. I feel luxurious every time I use this product and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Punch did lighten my dark circles by about 1 shade after using 1 bottle of cream. It dose not seem to lighten them any more after that. I think it could work better if combined with other products. However its very soothing and absorbs fast.</li>
    <li> I am trying to treat very resistant dark circles.  I have tried several other products but burning and irritation resulted.  This product actually feels good as you apply it and caused no irritation.  It has a smooth texture and no smell.  Unfortunately even after conscientious use for almost 3 months, I did not have good results. I am past 60 so I think age is an important factor. As there is a money-back guarantee, I asked for that and my purchase price was quickly refunded.  Bravo for excellent customer service.  I would certainly purchase a Punch product again.</li>
    <li> With age comes with sagging and bagging under the eyes. Moreover, now I my mother has to sleep with a C-Pap she often wake up with puffy eyes. I bought this product because she was so concerned about her eyes. Now she has much less swelling and her skin is tightening. I will continue to buy this for her.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out this eye cream, and it is actually quite amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it in combination with a cream for facial redness repair, due to an allergic reaction to a face wash. They don&#x27;t affect each other negatively, and in fact, may even help one another to produce even better results.&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply it morning and night, and might take a week or so to see the results. I&#x27;ve noticed that my bags are lessening, and my eyes are less red looking. It is wonderful to wake up and see my eyes without the bags and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-it smells really nice; I love the scent&lt;br /&gt;-it makes my skin feel nice and smooth after the application&lt;br /&gt;-actually works to take away the bags&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the spout can be difficult to control (I keep accidentally getting too much cream when I use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be updating this further down the month to let you know about the prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this eye cream and the moisturizer. I was surprised to see my dark circles getting lighter after 3 days of use. I also started taking vitamins for skin,hair and nails at the same time I started using this product. So, I can&#x27;t give all the credit to the eye cream. However, I do feel that it is working. Since I didn&#x27;t get instructions on how to use this product, I just went with customer reviews on how they used the product. That is why I gave 4 stars. Overall, I am pleased with this product. I will give another review after using the product some time later.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I didnt see a difference after 2 weeks use.</li>
    <li> For me, since I was just 18, I have had circles under my eyes and also puffy eyes in the morning. Both I inherited from my mother&#x27;s side of the family. And I tried just about everything including cold cucumber slices, tea bags, cold wash cloths, sleeping longer at night, and the list goes on and on. You get the picture...Then I discovered this cream and gave it a try. First I washed my face well before bed and then applied the cream under my eyes. It felt cool and wonderful under my eyes so I was hopeful. The next morning, I noticed that my under eye area did not have that puffiness. After the fourth day the dark circles started to lighten a little. Now it’s barely noticeable. I am so happy. Thank you, I now don’t have to apply that awful under eye cover up that gives me that raccoon look!</li>
    <li> Love the hydration. A lot of products I&#x27;ve tried dry me out and are uncomfortable, making me feel like I have to keep applying more. As a result, the product runs out fast! But this product is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it&#x27;s organic and healthy for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that I&#x27;m going to look amazing as I turn 43 this summer!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for two weeks, have not noticed a difference in my dark circles.  I apply it twice a day morning and night.  I feel like these reviews are not even real and that I was scammed.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has helped me out so much. It&#x27;s helped with the dark circles that I get under my eyes. And I really like that it&#x27;s made from organic products. Fewer chemicals is always better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, but I can already see a MARKED improvement in the skin around my eyes. I have always had very, VERY dark circles around my eyes - both upper lid and underneath. No amount of concealer would hide it completely. Even when I did hide it somewhat, a couple of hours later, I would need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yesterday, I noticed how diminished the shadows were. I still needed concealer, but at the end of the day when I went to remove my makeup, I noticed that the shadows were hardly noticeable at all. I had put concealer on hours before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the wrinkles around my eyes (though they weren&#x27;t too bad to begin with) were almost non-existent. I look at least five years younger, and at 44, that&#x27;s a good thing! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last point. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin, and a lot of products (especially for use in the eye area) irritate my skin quite a lot. I have had ZERO problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon seems to have run out of this product, but the manufacturing site still has it for sale. Go get some. Now. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over two weeks and have not seen any difference in the dark circles under my  eyes...  If you are like me - you read reviews - and buy &#x27;this one&#x27; because you think this one MIGHT work..  well, yet again, in my case - this one is another $ down the drain .  It does go on nicely - you can control how much comes out of the pkg .  I&#x27;ve just seen zero results.</li>
    <li> After reading every review I could find, I decided to go ahead and get it and I have to say I am really surprised and glad that I did. After a couple of weeks I thought I had made a big mistake but I carried on, and I&#x27;ve now been using the product for about 3 months and have noticed a big difference. My face and eyes look brighter and overall I appear much healthier and exuberant. I was very impressed with the results. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 2 weeks now and it is great. It&#x27;s not sticky or oily and it doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of residue around my eyes when I wake up in the morning like some other creams that I&#x27;ve used. It has a pleasant fragrance and its very light. I have noticed that the dark circles around my eyes have started to fade especially the areas under my eyes. Overall, great product, and I love the bottle that it comes in.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! Within a few weeks my dark circle and puffiness disappeared. Thank you punch cream!</li>
    <li> This cream did not work. The 5 star reviews are obviously fake. Luckily i was able to return it in time to get my full refund. Please dont buy this expecting it to work on your dark eye circles. Its not going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the company that makes this cream emailed me and was upset about my negative review of their product and claimed that this review I posted was a fake review and then they said that the negative reviews are not hurting them and theyre selling their product now more than ever. Instead of wasting their time emailing customers and braggig about how the negative reviews are not hurting their sales, they should be spending that  time working on making a product that actually works so that customers dont have to write those negative reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Cream For Wrinkles.I got a great result after using it.I recommended it for you .Try it .....&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I kind of been hesitating before I actually bought this product but I still gave it a shot because I really would want to lighten the dark circles under my eyes and so far, it has been working for me. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any irritation and I am just so excited for more improvement!</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for a few days now and I have been impressed by its light feel when applied and the fresh look under my eyes in the morning.  One pump goes a long way so it is a good value for how often you will be able to use one container.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only a few days and can already feel a difference. My skin feels soft and I love the smell, it makes me feel clean. I am always worried about trying new skin products because my skin breaks out easy but this stuff worked great with my combination skin. It&#x27;s not oily yet effective, which has been hard for me to find. I love organic products and this is has become on of my top eye care creams.</li>
    <li> I have some dark circles and occasionally get motivated enough to try something new.  Nothing really has been special or helped in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first application I noticed an improvement but thought maybe I was just having a good day.  But the improvement continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have inherited dark circles this isn&#x27;t going to reverse it, but it will substantially improve your look.  I am really impressed at the improvements so far.  I bought another bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I took before and after pictures to monitor any changes throughout the weeks. The lotion does nothing to my skin, it makes me break out instead. I still have dark spots, acne scars, spots on my hands and back, nothing has changed. This product definitely needs to be guaranteed your money back if it does not work or you do not get any results! Bad investment on my part.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just starting using this Organic eye cream a few days ago and I have already seen significant change around the skin of my eyes. The skin looks more supple &amp; rejuvenated, no dark circles at all. At the same time my eyes look brighter and younger. I definitely would recommend this marvelous eye cream to my family and friends. It is priced very affordable as well.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love that it&#x27;s organic.  This is the perfect if you have dark circles.</li>
    <li> This cream was bought as a gift for my girlfriend, who absolutely loved it. She keeps asking me to buy her some more, and it does seem to be of a reasonable price compared to others she has used, will definitely be buying more and would recommend to anyone, she has been showing all of her friends</li>
    <li> This is amazing eye cream. I love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it because of the high reviews. It burnt under my eyes and it felt itchy. Definitely a no no for me.</li>
    <li> LIght weight cream is easy to use and has great results.  I am in the movie industry and the nights are long on set.  Punch&#x27;s eye cream is a great pick me up when I have to go on camera or meet a VIP and I need to look refreshed!  It takes only a few weeks for this product to take effect and the results are amazing.  It&#x27;s great skin care at an affordable price.  The ingredients are also organic and non toxic so its safe for me and my family.</li>
    <li> I bought this because. After reading the reviews, I had serious questions about the company, but continued to test/ use 2 times a day for the last month. Due to allergies, I have dark, Dark circles that I have battled for most of my life after month of use i have seen no difference in my dark circles  . Comparing this product to Revita Labs eye serum (the only other brand I have used) witch seems to work better am very disappointed with the results of this product.waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good product and Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> I have to say wow because im beyond surprised that this eye cream actually works. Ive tried quite a few of under eye creams and they have never worked for me and have had great reviews;which is why i was sceptical about this one. But it really works. Beside it actually working to get rid of dark circles its also not really a cream which i like. Its more of like a liquidy gel. A very little ges a long way and it doesnt burn my eyes which is definetly a plus. Ive been using it for a little over a month now and i see a significant difference. If your having dark circle problems trust me give this a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now.  Not great.  Pretty average.  I didn&#x27;t see a lot of improvement with fine lines, circles and puffiness.  I&#x27;ve stuck with it mainly because I bought it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this skin cream for my wife in that she was always asking me to find her a natural product that cures dark circles and wrinkles. I got the package a few weeks ago and actually ended up ordering a few more because of the quality and changes I noticed in her face within a few days, I purchased another for both of us and one extra for my the sister of my wife Lauren. My wife had vague black circles under her eyes on nights days after long shifts and this bothered her but about 4 days after consistent usage of this product I literally saw the black circles go away. My wife is extremely happy with this outcome in that she tried so many over the last few years. This product is made from natural ingredients and actually works which is fantastic! I enjoy writing reviews about products that actually helped myself or family and or benefited me in some way. These days companies seem to not try enough in my opinion but this company clearly cares about the consumer. I love the ingredients in that they use pure quality which ultimately is optimum for longevity and health of the skin. I enjoyed the refreshing feeling of the cream about 5 minutes after it soaks in. Ultimately this product is amazing and I would like to thank Punch-Skin Care for making amazing products. God bless guys and gals and have a great day. :)</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference at all with  my dark circles. Going to call Amazon to try to return this.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a guy and promote Punch Skin Care. No shame at all. I work tons of hours and rarely get sleep and bags are all over my face. The fact that I can get that 8 hour sleep look from applying Punch to my face is great. Fast shipping, non expensive and fast acting. If you don&#x27;t try it your losing out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure does this really work or not. I have used this product for about 3 weeks.. 2-3 times a day. I have serious dark circles for years, and this didn&#x27;t do much for me. Sure it felt refreshing on my eye when I used it simply as an eye cream to moisturize them. However, sadly it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles or eye bags. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream every night before bed. I love how fast it soaks in so I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; like with other eye creams. The bottle looks really nice and is sturdy. The cream smells FANTASTIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a week and the puffiness around my eyes is gone and the dark circles are starting to lighten. This is going to be the only eye cream I use. No more thick goop getting all over my pillow.</li>
    <li> I have recently purchased this brightening eye cream. And even though I&#x27;ve been applying it for a couple of weeks, I can see a signficant difference. The skin under my eyes is clearly lighter and almost matches my skintone. I just apply it once a day before I go to bed. It&#x27;s an organic product and it also smells amazing! Will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> AFTER 4 MONTHS OF TWICE A DAY USE, NO CHANGE IN MY DARK CIRCLES.</li>
    <li> Love the cooling, soothing feel when I apply this eye moisturizer.  It is light weight and moisturizing.  Very soothing!  I will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to lighten up my dark under eyes. I did see a difference after a few days. Eyes where brighter. Only problem is I have to use it everyday now. Where as I was only using it a couple times a week.  Not sure if its me or the product.</li>
    <li> Feels great on the face not sticky or oily! Great for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Great product! Really smooths out the wrinkles fast. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a surprise that Punch is the #1 best selling organic anti-aging formula. When I used Punch, my skin just seemed to perk up and feel happier. It didn&#x27;t take long to notice the results. I highly recommend this product for your own use or as a gift!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I tried this product. I am constantly having problems with sleeping and I always have those dark circles under my eyes. It is very hard to find an eye cream that really works.  This one does! I am so thrilled that the dark circles under my eyes are remarkably becoming lighter. Facial lines and wrinkles are also becoming less noticeable. I especially love the fact that this product is made with organic ingredients that feel so great on my skin. Overall an excellent product that I will order again!</li>
    <li> Great product but I wish it was a little cheaper. But after seeing the results I would gladly pay it again.&lt;br /&gt;In this case you definitely get what you pay for. I am highly satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I can’t rant and rave enough about the astounding product:  “Under Eye Cream, Best Organic Dark Circles Under Eyes Treatment, Fast-Acting &amp; All-Natural Facial Lines and Wrinkle Remover Using A Lightweight Oil-Free Formulation.” By Punch Skin Care enough. As of late my wife and I have been looking for products that can help revive our skin and improve the way we look. We have tried a number of products, some good, some bad, some great and some not so great all have there own unique qualities that in some way hold the key to making you look good and feel better about yourself. Few products I have found stand out above the rest. The ones that do in my opinion deserve a positive review so that others looking for a product that stands out above the rest can take advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short this product is great. For me personally it has reduced the dark circles under my eyes about 90% during the first week of use. My spider webs slowly but surely creeping up around my eyes are drifting away with every treatment and my face feels refreshed and hydrated. Again I have only been applying for about a week now and can’t imagine how wonderful my skin will continue to feel after a month of use. I’m a father of two boys, I work very early during the day, act as a stay home dad in the afternoons and am an author at night writing till about 3am needless to say I don’t sleep much these days. I’m glad I found a product that can truly help reduce my dark circles and recommend to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve undergone heart surgery, lost a lot of weight, and suffer from sleep apnea, all of these things combined have caused really dark circles under my eyes that earned me the nickname Raccoon.  Obviously it&#x27;s not something I enjoy being called.  I read the reviews of this product and decided to try it out.  First off, it smells great.  It has a light, clean odor that and gender could enjoy.  It feels good on the skin,  It&#x27;s light, not sticky and disappears quickly.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product a short time and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference.  The best part is so have others,  I look younger. more healthy, and I feel better about myself too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little skeptical when it comes to products and their claims, but this product actually works. I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams and treatments in the past to help reduce my puffy eyes and dark circles under my eyes only to be disappointed. I am pleasantly surprised by Punch and its ability to do what it says it will do, but the real satisfaction came with how quickly I could see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a business professional and I spend way too much time in front of the computer, visiting with clients, and not getting enough rest. The resulting bags under my eyes have become more and more noticeable, especially with my age. When I applied Punch Skin Care it had a very nice texture...and a nice clean smell to it. Knowing that it was organic and natural, I didn&#x27;t worry about any negative effects, but only wondered if it would actually work. (On a side note, I accidentally got some in my eyes and it did not burn!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening I saw that the swelling had already reduced under my eyes. The next morning, the color began to fade under my eyes and the morning application of Punch tightened it up. In fact, I looked in the mirror just before a client visit and notices how much younger my eyes looked as a result. I could not be more pleased. It&#x27;s a great product and it really works.</li>
    <li> I have a cat that misses my boyfriend when he works...  and he works midnights.  So I don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep on nights when he works.  I am constantly walking around with dark puffy rings under my eyes.  I have tried a variety of products that help a little, but none that took them away....  until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference on the first day, but after two full days there was a noticeable difference.  At first I wondered if I was hoping so much that there was a difference that I was imagining there was...  but nope..  that morning my boyfriend looked at me from across the breakfast table and smiled while asking me if the cat is finally being quiet at night.  No, he wasn&#x27;t...  still howling all night.  He then told me that he wondered because I didn&#x27;t look dead tired for once.  YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more baggy dark circles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it is organic :)  I will be investing in a lot of this in the future and you should too if you are walking around with extra luggage under your eyes :)  This stuff works great and works fast!  It absorbs really quick and is very light so you don&#x27;t walk around feeling like you have thick cream on....  and my skin is glowing and I feel like after only like four days I have less lines, no puffiness and almost no dark circles.  I will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have come across and to have found this Organic Brightening Eye Cream/Dark Circle remover serum.  I, like some of the other reviewers of this product, have had thin skin under my eyes since I was a teenager and have always had a morning puffiness that includes dark circles I just hate!  It&#x27;s worse because the rest of my face is like porcelain so that problem really stood out until finding this serum.  After only a few days of use, I could see a reduction of morning puffiness, a smoothing of the very little fine lines I have around my eyes and the beginning of lightening started to occur of the dark circles. My face looks more even toned now and brighter! The fact that this product is organic only makes it even more perfect!  I could not be happier with this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Made my eyes itch very badly after one use, to a point where I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work to help my undereye bags at all.</li>
    <li> does absolutely  nothing for any of the advertised issues. complete waste of money and does nothing for dark circles after weeks of use</li>
    <li> For ten years, I watched my skin change, especially under my eyes. I was able to hide the dark circles with my glasses. However, now that I am fifty years old, those same circles have gotten darker. I cannot hide them anymore. I have tried so many different products, but none of them worked. Since I love to shop on Amazon; I came across this product. I bought the product tried it and watched my skin change. The dark circles under my eyes got lighter! I never thought I would find anything to help me with that; having even toned skin is very important to me. When this product is all gone, I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Whether I&#x27;m staying up late to do an assignment for school, playing a game with some friends, or just can&#x27;t sleep until the early hours of the morning, like 4 or 5 am, I get these dark rings under my eyes. But, with this, it helps get rid of those nasty rings! Plus, it&#x27;s got a subtle smell to it that is pleasant, but not overpowering. It even feels good on my skin, so that&#x27;s great for me and my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s done well for me, I can hardly notice the circles anymore!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this eye cream for about two weeks, and I think I’ve noticed a difference in my under eye appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from insomnia, and the past month has been particularly bad for me. My family started commenting that it looked like my eyes were bruised. The inner corners turned purple, while the outer edges and underneath were yellowish green. Not very pretty. Eye makeup covered up the discoloration for the most part, but I wanted something to actually help my correct my eye discoloration instead of hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is different from the picture, which seemed to concern other buyers. I probably wouldn’t have noticed if others hadn’t pointed it out. It’s not all that different, though. It’s still a pump, though a more normal looking bottle that is white with a slight sparkle to it. There were no instructions or ingredients listed on the box, bottle, or the piece of paper included. They all pretty much said the same thing, what the eye cream is supposed to do. A little unprofessional to not have directions, but it didn’t bother me much since it’s not hard to figure out how to use an eye cream, to rub in a tiny amount to the under eye area once or twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always start off using any new product once to make sure I don’t have a bad reaction to it. The eye cream is mostly translucent, and a light texture that easily rubs into the skin. It sits under my eyes, staying moist until it’s absorbed, making my skin feel extra soft. I never felt a tingling sensation like the product information suggested, but I honestly didn’t expect to. For the first few days, I applied the cream only at night before I slept for a couple hours. Then I always got back up and did work at my computer. By the end of the first week, I applied the cream at least twice a day. It didn’t affect my makeup when applied underneath, which was a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few days ago, I started noticing that the purplish color at the inner corner of my eyes had lessened, and the general discoloration faded to resemble the rest of the skin on my cheeks. My under eyes weren’t particularly swollen, so I didn’t notice anything there. And I don’t have many lines or wrinkles, only the usual laugh/smile lines that I actually like, so I didn’t expect those to really disappear. So if you’re expecting the under eye lines to diminish, I’m not sure this product is exactly what you’re looking for. Though who knows, maybe with more than two weeks time, there would be some affect on fine lines. But I can say that the dark circles and discoloration under my eyes have faded and lessened somewhat, in spite of my insomnia and lack of sleep, so I’m grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for a brightening eye cream, this would be a good one to try. I’ve used other similar products from Neutrogena and other drug store brands, and I believe the overall effect was just about the same. I think Neutrogena worked better for any deep lines or wrinkles, while the Punch Skin Care worked better for my general discoloration and dark circles. I’m happy with my purchase, and I’ll definitely be using it till the bottle is empty.at the inner corner of my eyes had lessened, and the general discoloration faded to resemble the rest of the skin on my cheeks.

    <li> I am not sure what the 1 star reviewers are talking about. I picked this up for my wife and she has had nothing but success with this cream. She had been saying that she wanted to try something new since she had developed circles under her eyes due to lack of rest and stress. After two days she noticed a difference and I have noticed that her eyes have started to look lighter and younger. I will definitely be ordering again. She had no breakouts or irritation and raves about the results.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the packaging, it came just as advertised 2 days after I ordered.</li>
    <li> ****IMPORTANT UPDATE: It appears that the helpful and unhelpful votes on Amazon are being manipulated on certain products to skew data and mislead consumers. This seems particularly true of some skincare/anti aging products. I have been watching this review and the unhelpful votes went from 1 of 2 to 2 of 230 in one day! Other negative reviews for this item were also receiving a high number of unhelpful votes, even though the content would have been helpful to most actual consumers. I noted this in my review, and a week later came back to find the unhelpful votes had now gone down to 6 of 8, but today it is creeping back up again to 6 of 16. Although the latter numbers are more realistic, I&#x27;m not sure what will happen with the numbers in the future. However, I am sure they are being \\&quot;toyed\\&quot; with in some way. Please be sure to read all the negative reviews yourself and then decide if other consumers generally would or would not find the content helpful, and make any purchasing decisions accordingly. As a long time Amazon review reader/writer, this revelation genuinely concerns me, and I hope that Amazon will find a way to effectively combat/eradicate this problem in the near future...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product irritated my eyes, I did not use it long enough to know if it works or not. I returned it under the regular Amazon return policy, after contacting them for advice on how to proceed with a return. Upon receiving/using this product, I noted a few concerns I think others might want to be aware of when considering purchasing: The box, bottle, and included paperwork lack the following vital information that should be (and typically IS) included on any professional product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Instructions For Use&lt;br /&gt;- Warnings&lt;br /&gt;- Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- Contact Information&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions: While this may seem obvious, as it is a \\&quot;dark circle\\&quot; treatment, even simple instructions should be included. For example: Shake before use? Use over entire eye area? How many times per day to apply? Etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings: These are usually a given, \\&quot;Discontinue use if redness or irritation occurs,\\&quot; or something to that affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Since I experienced irritation, it would have been nice to know what is in the product so I could research it further and/or know if is an ingredient I am already allergic to. The bottle states that the product is \\&quot;organic,\\&quot; but does not state what is in it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact Information: This Company \\&quot;claims\\&quot; to offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but does not include contact information anywhere on/in the packaging. Although you can easily find them with a Google search, logically, this information should be included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note: There weren&#x27;t any negative reviews on this product at the time I purchased, but if I had visited this company&#x27;s website prior to purchase, I would NOT have ordered. If you are considering this product, I highly recommend this step. Thoroughly evaluate the content and level of professionalism, consider the negative reviews on Amazon, and make your own call.many times per day to apply?

    <li> Works well my eyes don&#x27;t look as tired</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister who has been stressed out and hasn&#x27;t been sleeping well the past couple of months. I&#x27;m so glad I did! She has been using it for about a week and loves it! She was really applying a lot of concealer to hide her dark circles and after a  week only doesn&#x27;t have to apply any concealer! I decided to try some and loved how bright my eyes look, so we have to share until another order comes in. I&#x27;m really glad this product is organic too since I&#x27;m really particular about what I put on my skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been sleeping well and have developed some dark circles under my eye. After reading the positive reviews I decided to give this product a try. I have to say I love this product! Punch under eye cream helped diminish my dark circles and puffs eyes. It feels weightless and not at all greasy. I also love the fact that the cream is organic, and only contains the best and natural ingredients. If you&#x27;re looking for an eye cream that&#x27;s effective, Punch is a great product to try.</li>
    <li> I am 35, and I am happy I realized this product. Since I started applying fast-acting eye serum to my eye, the dark circles under my eye have disappeared completely and my skin now glows with radiant. My friend’s comments really lowered my esteem when they started calling me an ‘old granny’. I was at the verge of losing hope until the wife of my husband’s friend recommended this product. It is a great product made from natural ingredient that really work on your skin naturally leaving it refreshed, clean and smooth……and its cheap and it is a real value to your money.</li>
    <li> I received my eye cream earlier this week, and I was extremely impressed with the results that it gave me. I tend to have dark circles under my eyes, as I get very little sleep and work late hours. Both me and my spouse used this cream for a few days, and we both loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the cream is very light and has little or no fragrance. It is not meant to smell pretty, it is meant to tighten up the skin in the sensitive areas under your eyes and in doing that it works beautifully. It absorbs quickly, and does not leave any oily residue on your face, which is excellent. Moreover, it works extremely quickly. I definitely have more youthful-looking eyes and facial skin in just the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have very sensitive skin, and so there is little that I can use on my skin that does not make me break out or get hives. This stuff didn’t bother me at all, and I can use it every day without any issue, unlike other facial creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with dark circles or bags under their eyes, facial wrinkles, or crow’s feet. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I noticed about five years ago dark circles forming around my eyes. This happens to a lot of people due to sleep deprivation, but my circles are genetic in nature (I assume because I get enough sleep). Recently, I decided to do something about the dark circles. After browsing at least a dozen products online, I decided upon this one due to its price and ingredient list. It&#x27;s been less than a month since I started the product, but I have noticed a difference. I don&#x27;t know what to expect as a few months pass, but at this rate, I anticipate the circles will get fainter and fainter. Easy to apply and quick to absorb, this product is user-friendly. Recommended if you want a product for dark circles with good value.</li>
    <li> Sorry, did nothing for me and I used it for 4 weeks.  Sent it back!</li>
    <li> I would have given it a one star except that is described as &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34;.  Hate is such a strong word and should be reserved for things of the greatest importance. Eye cream is not life threatening.  LOL.  However, it is important.  Unfortunately, this has not done ONE single thing for my eye area. I had such high hopes after all the great comments.  I guess that&#x27;s why there are so many products on the market.  Because of the good refund policy, I will continue to try for another week or so.  To date, nothing has changed around my eyes. :(  Happy though for so many that have seen improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly but its not doing anything. Nice packaging and marketing but does nothing other than moisturize. If you are looking for an expensive moisturizer, this is the one.</li>
    <li> Skincare is important, especially as we get older. My biggest concern is fine lines and crow’s feet around my eyes, but I won’t use just any product on my skin since it’s a little sensitive. Punch Skin Care’s Brightening Eye Cream was great! The cream was more serum-like, but that’s OK with me. I was so glad that it didn’t have a weird smell. Did I mention that the eye cream is organic? Bonus! There was no irritation at all. It feels really good on my skin. I’m so glad I tried this beauty product. My skin feels happier already.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It feels so luxurious to the touch, very much akin to high-end branded skin care products I’ve tried in the past. I have only used it for about a week and can see noticeable results already.... so happy! I use it twice a day and love the fact that it’s non greasy and non-irritating to the skin. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the smooth feeling of this eye care. Also the fact that the scent is fairly neutral is a plus for a guy. I really enjoy seeing the dark circles going away in one night. Love it.</li>
    <li> Good quality product with fair price.</li>
    <li> This has worked  effectively for me.  The longer I use it the better the results. I have used Punch for about 4 weeks and see a reduction in the darkness and puffiness.  I have even gone without applying concealer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dissapointed to receive a different bottle and package. Is it really a scam like other reviews say? I mean, it&#x27;s really different!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t improve my dark circles at all.  I&#x27;m still searching for anything that does.  Viewed solely as a moisturizer, I&#x27;ve used many that are better.  The product is very thin (watery), so it doesn&#x27;t have much of an effect.</li>
    <li> I’m at an age where I’m starting to think about the lines that are appearing around my eyes. Add to this the fact that I’ve had dark circles for most of my life. A friend gave me a bottle of this cream to try, and the results I’ve seen thus far are promising. So promising that I just ordered my second bottle. The natural ingredients help me to feel more confident that I’m actually putting something healthy on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love that this product is organic, because I know that it is good for me and good for environment. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short time and I have already noticed a drastic improvement in my skin. My face and eyes look brighter and overall I appear much healthier and exuberant. I work long hours and never quite get enough sleep, who does? This product really helps.</li>
    <li> I’ve always did research on products I have purchased online especially products for my skin. As I was research eye cream punch came up. I always check out reviews to see if others have had results. When I saw that Punch had a lot of 1 star reviews I became a bit skeptical. I then looked at the 5 star review and they outweighed the 1 star reviews so I decided to give it a try.  Even though I was still a little skeptical to my surprise this product actually works. I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams and treatments in the past to help with dark circles under my eyes only to be disappointed. I am excited at the results I have gotten with  Punch and its ability to do what it says it will do. The packaging was great and it came with instructions in the inside. It is very light weight and organic which is the best part to me.They also have a website, check it out. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with the Brightening Eye Creme.  After applying the creme for approx 2 weeks, I noticed I was plagued with blackheads on the side of each eye.  I stopped using Punch and no more outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer seems to be OK.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I started using it. I havent seen much of a difference. I have noticed that the dark circles have diminished a bit. So far it seems to be working. Can&#x27;t wait to continue using it and see how much better it could get.</li>
    <li> Nice smooth consistency, feels nice and cool on skin.  Not sure of results for dark undereye circles, if so it is very subtle.</li>
    <li> Nice bottle but no visible results.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels going on  just got it will update later with results</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this eye cream and though I haven’t seen any dramatic results yet, I’m very excited about this product! I can already see that my eyes are definitely brighter, my dark circles have lightened and the puffiness is gone! I have suffered with dark circles for as long as I can remember and am thrilled to finally find a natural organic product that really works! I love the fact that if this product doesn&#x27;t work you can get a complete refund, and the shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> One of the most common concerns for those who shop for facial cream is how to find the best anti-aging cream that will effectively battle the signs of aging.  This one by far is the best one that&#x27;s on the market.</li>
    <li> This Product does not work. If anything it made under my eyes  look worse.</li>
</ol>
