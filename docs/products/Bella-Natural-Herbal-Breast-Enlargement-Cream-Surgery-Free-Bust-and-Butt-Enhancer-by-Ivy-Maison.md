      <li>Ok so this company shipment delivery times are amazing.  </li>
      <li>Love LOVE love this product!</li>
      <li>but I need to purchase more to be more sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to use this product</li>
      <li>Make sure you do it when you get out of the shower</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>Smells ok and has burning tingling.</li>
      <li>bought two more bottle</li>
      <li>I would even be topless in my room just to make sure it observed all the way.</li>
      <li>I was able to put on my blouse because it does&#x27;t stick to your clothes and nor does it stick to your skin.</li>
      <li>It does burn and tingle,like many have said.</li>
      <li>This product delayed too much and not delievered as per the date mentioned when I purchase it !!!!</li>
      <li>So far, so good.!</li>
      <li>this is my third order of this, super awesome</li>
      <li>It absorbs very smoothly and quickly into your skin.</li>
      <li>and I love how tingly it makes my breasts (lets me know that it&#x27;s working, haha).</li>
      <li>and that is true</li>
      <li>Ok so looking at other people review what I thought I should do one on my own.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day, and I use it after my shower at night and in the morning I put a hot cloth over my butt until the cloth is cool and then put the cream on.</li>
      <li>I will honestly say that this cream definitely works.</li>
      <li>and you have to use it the right way.</li>
      <li>So first off I got this a whole month earlier than expected which is awesome.</li>
      <li>But you do have to use it consistently</li>
      <li>First off this doesnt tell you the directions on how your supposed to put it if your supposed to put it twice a day or 1 time a day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep my hopes up,at this price I&#x27;ll likely order again one more time.</li>
      <li>Just brought my wife 2nd bottle.. Works like magic</li>
      <li>can feel the different in my  butt within one month , love it</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t feel that tingling like I did with the first bottle not shore if that the way the cream is</li>
      <li>Saw results in two weeks got firmer and bigger love the product and fast shipping too</li>
      <li>I feel as though it is really work been using it for a week</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, although item was expired.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference</li>
      <li>True it burns a little, a great moisturizer, tube all gone and nothing not even a little bit, im not going to buy another.</li>
      <li>I did read the reviews on how it does sting your boobs but thats the only thing that people have said thats true.</li>
      <li>but u see slight results after 2 weeks and my ol man loves the way it had made my breast 1/2 cup bigger and a better curved shaped !</li>
      <li>but if you do not have time for all that then just let your water get really hot when your rag and just place it where you want to apply the cream and let the steam from the Rack open up your pores.</li>
      <li>I tried on my boobs but really did not see much of a difference except they sit a little higher but on my butt then yes I have seen a major difference.</li>
      <li>Just received it, it came 5 days early which is a plus plus.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I feel as though it is really work been using it for a week</li>
    <li> The date was almost expired when I received it. I&#x27;ve been using it on the smaller side with a different product as well and  it is slowly catching up. Make sure you do it when you get out of the shower or you keep the area warm or you won&#x27;t get the desired effect.</li>
    <li> Just received it, it came 5 days early which is a plus plus. I&#x27;ll do a re-review next month. Must give it time 2 work plus a lite workout would help BIG TIME</li>
    <li> So,they sent me a expired case. I checked it said 11/5/14. But I decided to still use it,I use it every day after I hop out the shower. It does burn and tingle,like many have said. But its not unbearable I actuallly kind of like it. I&#x27;ve been putting it on everyday for maybe a week,I wanna say I notice a slight difference. I&#x27;ll keep my hopes up,at this price I&#x27;ll likely order again one more time.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this product is doing muchfor me</li>
    <li> So first off I got this a whole month earlier than expected which is awesome. I didn&#x27;t expect this to work. But it&#x27;s Been 3 days of me using it and it&#x27;s awesome. My butt isn&#x27;t neccassarily bigger but it looks fuller. I love the smell too! I use it twice a day, and I use it after my shower at night and in the morning I put a hot cloth over my butt until the cloth is cool and then put the cream on. So far, so good.!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, although item was expired. I believe that is the reason the product did not work because of this. Seller says they&#x27;re all that way. I don&#x27;t recommend. I showered two times a day and applied correctly. I would even be topless in my room just to make sure it observed all the way. This product did not work. Smells ok and has burning tingling. I personally didn&#x27;t like it because there was no results.</li>
    <li> I never get body acne and this product made my chest break out so bad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to use this product&lt;br /&gt;I can feel the different in my  butt within one month , love it</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference</li>
    <li> This creme works. Yes it takes time. I&#x27;ve seen results within  a week</li>
    <li> this is my third order of this, super awesome and I love how tingly it makes my breasts (lets me know that it&#x27;s working, haha).</li>
    <li> Just received, i was scared of getting expired product but the expiration date on mine was 5/10/15 ima still use it so hopefully all is well. Smells like a Chinese store lol but hopefully it works..update soon</li>
    <li> This product delayed too much and not delievered as per the date mentioned when I purchase it !!!!&lt;br /&gt;it is a big fail</li>
    <li> im very shocked ! u get out of the shower pat dry and apply this..it burns a lil bit but u see slight results after 2 weeks and my ol man loves the way it had made my breast 1/2 cup bigger and a better curved shaped ! definitely buying another bottle</li>
    <li> True it burns a little, a great moisturizer, tube all gone and nothing not even a little bit, im not going to buy another.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday i dont see any changes yet. I used it for a month and a half.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering mot soon</li>
    <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a month or two and i have no results</li>
    <li> My product was expired. 5/16/16</li>
    <li> Love LOVE love this product!</li>
    <li> Ok so this company shipment delivery times are amazing.  I recieved this product even before the delivery expected date. I have started to use this product today and you feel a tingling buying sensational that lasted 8minutes for me. The smell of the cream is delightful. I was able to put on my blouse because it does&#x27;t stick to your clothes and nor does it stick to your skin. It absorbs very smoothly and quickly into your skin. I will give an update in two weeks and let you know how the cream it self works. Stay tuned girls!!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with a case of flat butt. All my life I have been called various names because I have no butt. So I decided to do some reading, and research, and came across this product, I figured what the heck! What&#x27;s the worst that could happen, NO RESULTS!! But to my to my amazement. I was totally wrong! This is the best product I have ever came across. I have been using the bella cream and I have seen such a difference in the way my butt looks. It has boosted my self esteem times ten.. Im hooked. If there&#x27;s women out there with the same struggle I had, try this product. I promise you. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Ok so looking at other people review what I thought I should do one on my own. I will honestly say that this cream definitely works. But you do have to use it consistently and you have to use it the right way. I tried on my boobs but really did not see much of a difference except they sit a little higher but on my butt then yes I have seen a major difference. In order for the cream to work D in your pores have to be open which is why you should take after a shower or bath but if you do not have time for all that then just let your water get really hot when your rag and just place it where you want to apply the cream and let the steam from the Rack open up your pores. I have done that quite a few times. I am NOT going to say that this cream just gave me like a really big butt but my butt does sit higher up than it usually did. My issue with this cream though is it did lift up my butt but my hips look a little bit smaller now. Okay so before my butt look big from the back and flat from the sides now my butt is bigger from the sde and a little bit smaller from the back but it does give me cuffed booty. Basically it says it lists and firm and that is true it does what it says but you have to constantly use it. I literally used up two bottles, but I did not use the product everyday twice a day like it says. I was using it once a day which was at night after I get out of the tub. I didn&#x27;t find the time to do it during the day while getting dressed because I was always rushing a little bit. The reason why I did not give this product 5 stars was because it takes awhile for you to see progress. Although it feels like its working you have seen you for a while to notice the results</li>
    <li> Just brought my wife 2nd bottle.. Works like magic</li>
    <li> Expired product. Didn&#x27;t even use it because of that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product... But I still don&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> First off this doesnt tell you the directions on how your supposed to put it if your supposed to put it twice a day or 1 time a day. I did read the reviews on how it does sting your boobs but thats the only thing that people have said thats true. It didnt work for me my boobs are still the same size for 1 month now and didnt see results</li>
    <li> Still havent seened any changes and i already finished the entire bottle :/</li>
    <li> I think. my breast does look enhanced but I need to purchase more to be more sure.</li>
    <li> The bottle I receives was expired but I still used it. Didn&#x27;t see any results. I use it twice a day. Been using it for three weeks. Almost gone and still no results. It burns like he&#x27;ll. Feels like I&#x27;m applying relaxer to my ass and breast ... I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Saw results in two weeks got firmer and bigger love the product and fast shipping too</li>
    <li> so I been using the cream for a month  and I seen were my bust size increase bought two more bottle but I don&#x27;t feel that tingling like I did with the first bottle not shore if that the way the cream is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this is about 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I guess it only works for some people but you never know unless you try.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see ant results and I did what the instructions said to do.</li>
