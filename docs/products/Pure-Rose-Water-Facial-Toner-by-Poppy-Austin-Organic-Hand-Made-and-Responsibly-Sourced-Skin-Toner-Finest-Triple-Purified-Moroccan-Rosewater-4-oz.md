<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very refreshing.  No breakouts with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Received half a bottle of rose water instead of full.  Leaky, untightened lid...what a mess.  Ok smell.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft. Delicious light scent. Strong moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for me. It did smell like roses but that&#x27;s about it. As far as a toner goes, you can buy a rose scented witch hazel.</li>
    <li> INDEED, Finest rose water I have ever used. Will continue to purchase, and recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin feeling super soft and refreshed! I&#x27;ve tried other toners and they tend to leave my skin a little dry after cleansing, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Great toner, high quality product.</li>
    <li> Smells like roses. Makes face soft and feels clean. A lingering rose scent is on my face for a few hours, but it is VERY light. Nice product.</li>
    <li> It is lovely.  I am not even a roses fan but this is really a nice toner.  A total fan...will reorder!</li>
    <li> My new best find. I can&#x27;t seem to get enough of it and spritz my face every time I need a pick me up. Like the smell. I bought a small blue glass bottle sprayer to achieve a fine mist, instead of using cotton balls. I have dry,sensitive skin, and use the rose water as a toner and also as a last step after applying makeup.</li>
    <li> i wonderful addition to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while now and find that it makes my skin smooth, supple and my pores are shrinking.  Bye-bye expensive store bought products that do nothing but empty my wallet.  Mother nature gives us everything we need and yet we often forget.  This toner is perfect.</li>
    <li> Tried it, loved it. I use it daily and its very gentle on the skin. I take my skin care very seriously and totally recommend this product. There is no better available toner this product is defiantly number 1.</li>
    <li> I seriously love this toner! I won&#x27;t buy anything else after using this!</li>
    <li> This toner is one of my favorites. It smells like roses and not an imitation. It corrected my Ph balance after a couple of uses. Will definitely order again. Quality product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Smells like rose water should, fresh not musty. I bought this to make sachets and potpourri. I put it in a perfumer atomizer and sprayed silk roses in our bedroom to fill it with the gentle scent of roses. Lovely.</li>
    <li> I have only just started using but am very pleased. I purchased this product after finishing a bottle of a different brand rose water. The other brand had an awful smell and left my skin feeling sticky. I took a risk buying this more expensive brand but the smell is much better and it leaves my skin soft and refreshed, not sticky. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I am so pleased with its smell, and it really hydrates my skin.  My friend fried it and said it is very good, too.</li>
    <li> gREAT PRODUCT, CARING COMPANY ORGANIC WHICH IS TOPS THANK YOU, sYLVIE</li>
    <li> This is wonderful quality rose water! And for a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin, has a great natural fragrance, and the bottle seems like it should last me for several months. Customer service was also great, the item arrived fast, and they donate a portion of your purchase to women&#x27;s co-operatives in Morocco.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this company for future purchases/</li>
    <li> I love love this toner and it deff cleans my pores out!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Every morning, I feel so refreshed when I apply this on my bare face.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle, but even more beautiful contents.  Lovely rose water, the real deal, leaves my skin moist and hydrated and smells oh, so good!  Will definitely buy again.  Very, very high quality on this Rose Water.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!  It evened out my skin tone, smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling like silk.  I&#x27;m very picky about what products I will use on my skin, only organic for me.</li>
    <li> This is not your typical \\&quot;toner\\&quot;. When I think of toners, I think astringent and drying but this rosewater is actually good for your skin even if it is dry. It smells beautiful and leaves your skin looking and feeling soft, calm and more even toned. The texture is just the tiniest bit thicker than water and as it is being absorbed it feels like it might leave a residue but once it totally sinks in (very quickly) there is nothing left but gorgeous skin. The slight scent doesn&#x27;t linger either so if you are sensitive, not to worry. I have also found that when I use this product all of my serums and moisturizers go on smoother and I am able to use less - huge bonus. If you wear makeup, I highly suggest purchasing a spray bottle because this product makes an incredible setting spray and/or refresher throughout the day. I spritz this on after cleansing twice a day every day and although there is definitely a six month supply in this very generous bottle, it may not last quite that long for me because once I start, I just can&#x27;t stop - it smells and feels that good. Add to all of this the fact that it is organic and responsibly sourced and you have, in my opinion, a perfect product. Oh, and the price is incredible. I could go on but I&#x27;ll stop here - just buy it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long - I just recently bought this based on the recommendation of a personal friend who loves her skin now.  However, my teenagers and I do notice that our faces are very soft after using - and the fragrance of roses is lovely.  I have had headaches from artificial scents and it is a pleasure to smell something pure and beautiful.  I am convinced we will also quickly notice our skin becoming healthier.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product!  It feels fabulous on my face, using as a toner.  I will definitely be reordering soon!</li>
    <li> Quality product, Quick delivery, good price.  I love the fragrance and feel that it is benefitting my skin.  I&#x27;d like to have it in a larger bottle :-)</li>
    <li> Great eye makeup remover! The scent bothers me but FYI, I have a very sensitive sense of smell. I wash my face after removing my eye makeup so the scent is a non issue in this scenario. I am very sad that the scent bothers me as I wanted ton use this as a toner in the am after washing my face. Great product though!</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Simply lovely scent. Softens skin - a new &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me! Update: bought one for a friend, she&#x27;s in love with it too!!  This Poppy Austin line is organic, perfect for sensitive skin, fairly sourced - it&#x27;s not possible to come up with a negative remark!  UPDATE: just finished my first bottle and am ordering 2nd one today - this is truly lovely for your skin!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Feels amazing! But pricey. I&#x27;ll go with substitutes...</li>
    <li> My skin care regime is not complete without this product as a toner.&lt;br /&gt;I put it into a spray bottle and use it twice a day ( morning &amp; night) after my cleansing rituals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it does NOT last 6 months. I purchased this product in October, and now it&#x27;s November 22nd- 1 month later, and I need to reorder the product already. If you are truly cleansing your face correctly day and night, this would not last you more than 1-2 months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review..&lt;br /&gt;but this rose water made my skin smooth and smells good also!&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely try this!!</li>
    <li> So far I really like this toner, makes my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy. You should try PCA skin toner phase 3? instead. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift and already have glowing feedback from my niece, saying that it helps with puffiness and inflammation and smells wonderful. So glad I sent this as part of her birthday present. Now I will have to gift this to my daughter and to myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being organic is very important to me as I truly believe we should never put anything on our skin that we would not put into our mouths, especially along delicate skin like along the jawline where products penetrate easily. I have already won many battles in getting my family members to eat more healthfully so the thinking continues with personal care items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a friend of mine likes to say: We pay now or we pay later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying other products in this line. I have used the much pricier Josie Maran argan oil line for skincare and makeup for about four years now--very happy with it, but I am wondering if I can get similar or better results with some of the much more reasonably priced items here.</li>
    <li> Great toner before using serum, closes pores, freshens skin. Use it daily after cleaning skin and apply this toner, then serum and then your favorite moisturizer. This will leave your skin very youthful and fresh.</li>
    <li> As I am not familiar with Rose Water I cannot truly and  honestly provide the review you require.  My mother always used glycerine and Rose Water so my desire to purchased was based on my mother constant reliance on the product.  However,  I have noted a change in my face but am lost as to exactly WHAT I am supposed to measure.  Sorry about that</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff..... it smells so amazing and makes my skin feel so fresh, i love the packaging and amount you get I will be ordering this product for a long time...  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this rosewater. My skin is softer, breakouts have decreased and my face just feels and looks better. Great for difficult to deal with skin.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve only been using a week but it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve needed. After I wash my face I use this and I feel clean, toned and refreshed. I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tight. I will probably use this stuff forever!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use this product after I have washed my face. I use an atomizer to put it on. It has a wonderful rose smell and it gives the skin a nice glow. Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful facial toner for combination skin; it makes my skin very soft.  I also mix it with vegetable glycerin and argan oil to make a light facial and under eye moisturizer, which does not clog my pores as most moisturizers do.  For drier areas of my skin, I then apply a little extra argan oil.  I also like that the product is responsibly sourced, handmade, and that a donation is made back to the Moroccan women&#x27;s cooperatives for each bottle sold.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love how it makes skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in a nice glass bottle with a twist off top, compact but enough that it will stay fresh until you need a new bottle.  I use it twice a day after cleansing. When I first opened it I noticed the gentle scent of rose water- not too strong at all for me.  It&#x27;s refreshing on the skin, and again the scent is there, but light and not offensive.  When I first converted to rosewater from my regular toner, my skin went through a little revolt.  I am using this along with an all-natural cleanser and moisturizer and ditched my usual department store brand, so some skin outbreaks were totally expected.  I&#x27;m in the last half of my 30&#x27;s, and I suffer from bouts of rosacea that flares with my allergies, and the occasional battles with adult acne (combination skin). So along with the change in skin care regimen came a few spots of acne and redness here and there, but it has been a week and it has subsided and a co-worker actually complimented that my skin looked better today.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this and monitor progress.</li>
    <li> I use this as my daily toner. I am sensitive to fragrance, and have never had an issue with this product. I put it in my old Eminance Tonique Spray bottle (I like how it sprayed) and off I go. Works to set makeup, and after washing my face. Great great value!!!</li>
    <li> This is the fist Rose Water I have used it. It feels wonderful and the light scent is just perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this rose water. Very good quality and does the job. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have mature sensitive skin.  My grandmother had told me years ago about the benefits of Rose Water and I have used other brands in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Not one other brand was as delightful as this one.  The scent is light and there are no harmful ingredients added to the essential rose water.&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face, then put a small amount of rose water on a cotton ball and gently wipe my face.  It is refreshing and yet not drying.  During the day I use my serum, moisturizer, primer, foundation and ready to go.  In the evening, after cleansing, using the rose water, I hydrate with evening moisturizer and retin A.  My daily regiment has kept my skin youthful and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Bottle is pretty small, while the price is pretty high, so I might not repurchase. But the rose water inside is great quality and packaged very elegantly. The price is most likely because of this, but what can I say, I&#x27;m a poor college student, haha.&lt;br /&gt;You can make the rose water last longer by putting it in a spray bottle. Using the puff and pat method will make you run out VERY quickly, I went through about half of the bottle in a week trying to do that.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the freshness. My favorite part of my face routine</li>
    <li> Love this product.makes my skin glow</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I thought something as pure as this would be great. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t really work for me, so I&#x27;ve returned it. It smelled AMAZING on my skin though and I loved the subtle scent. I wish it worked. Such a great price for a toner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this experience, I still love Poppy Austin products. I use the Vitamin C Serum (http://www.amazon.com/Poppy-Best-Vitamin-Serum-Hyper-Pigmentation/dp/B00HHR0SYW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1421094531&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;poppy+austin+vitamin+c) everyday.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Received on time so was able to treat myself to a beauty day.</li>
    <li> Gentle but effective!!!</li>
    <li> Let me start with my first impression: Beautiful packaging. Well made waterproof label and they really hit it on the nail with the simplicity of the font. Styled so that it implies that the product will tell you itself how it works, and man does it! I&#x27;ve been using it in combination with the vitamin C serum which I combined with my order because free shipping and I&#x27;ve heard positive things about it. I was recommended this product by Bepeu on tumblr and the vial itself is glass with a tin cap. Im in love every time I use it. The smell is pure rose and every day I just spill a lil on my hands and run it over my face, moving from the center to the edges. This is the product which I have been looking for and I can say I am a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> This seriously has to be the best rose water that I have ever used. I have used rose water numerous times over the past 30 years and sometimes it is just not quite &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; in terms of essence. This rose water is pure, subtle yet strong and just perfect for all my needs!</li>
    <li> I love the rose toner!  Thanks</li>
    <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE the soft fragrant smell it has. I mix my clay with it and also use it as my toner. It leaves my skin feeling very refreshed and smooth as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Leaves my face really hydrated.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I&#x27;m only giving it a one b/c when I received it, it was LEAKING!! Opened package containing product leanny</li>
    <li> blah - didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 month.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works nicely for my roscea on my face, it is soothing and does not aggravate my skin at all delivery was excellent, not problems at all, was packages well also, very satisfied</li>
    <li> This feels great on the skin and smells nice but my sinuses immediately plugged up and my ears too. Then my ears started ringing. I had to stop using after 3 tries.</li>
    <li> I love it. Getting ready to order another bottle. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have very sensitive skin and this product is so gentle, absolutely no stinging after cleansing or facials. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Great quality :) Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great rosewater. I just discovered rosewater and i am seriously never going back to any other tonic.  This is a miracle in a jar and rose water is amazing for everything. Keeps my skin baby soft as well.</li>
    <li> Love Poppy Austin&#x27;s products and love rose water</li>
    <li> Very clean the skin!! love it~</li>
    <li> Great product!  Smells fantastic and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and makes my face feel so soft! Never tight feeling, Leaves no residue, and going to remain a part of my skin care routine! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> The rose water is decent enough (smell was mild, felt nice but it hardly produced astonishing results or anything like that, just refreshing). One noteworthy thing to me is that this is only a 4 oz. container and it is absurd that they suggest it might last 6 months -- maybe if you use a tiny amount once a week it might! Despite the turnoff (because of the misleading information about how long a bottle might last which felt at best like a cheesy marketing ploy and, at worst, outright lying), I was going to buy more bottles, but could not get the promo codes to work. At checkout, only when purchasing greater than 4 would -6.25 be subtracted as a kind of auto-promo - regardless of how many greater than 4. I wanted to use the 10% off code for the rose water, which because it was specifically for the rose water, one would think that it would work, but, no. NONE of the codes could be entered (though they&#x27;re all listed on the webpage), the only option was the -6.25 auto-promo. Really, really frustrating, and felt like another attempt at being shady. Now, I do not even trust the product itself or anything they say about it, feel kind of jerked around. Guess they aren&#x27;t interested in repeat customers...</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am one of those that need immediate results and after a week I do see and feel a difference!</li>
    <li> Love this toner! Makes skin feel so clean and radiant. You can tell it&#x27;s very natural. Came right on time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product, combined with a vitamin C serum, drastically improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I must say, the scent really throws me off.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend refuses to kiss me when I use this product.  She claims it smells like a grandmother, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.&lt;br /&gt;It almost smells like something expired and went bad.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the repulsive scent, I would strongly recommend this product, and I would purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m gonna search for a similar product without the stench.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toner- natural, with no alcohol. Calms your skin.</li>
    <li> I just happened to see this on Amazon and decided to order some for myself and my mother.  We both love it!  This is nothing like any toner I&#x27;ve used before, it is so pleasant and feels so fresh and nice.  My face feels very soft after using it and I love the rose scent which is relaxing and not overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I have sensitive skin and wondered if the product would work for me or not and it really does.  No irritation, and it actually seems to calm my skin.  Very nice product!!  I&#x27;ll try more of the Poppy Austin line in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best toner out there 100 percent natural! I use it together with Poppy Austin HA serum and Fig Seed Oil moisturizer.</li>
    <li> You product is amazing. My skin no longer breaks out using this toner. Love, love, love this product.I never thought an affordable organic would clear my skin. I also use the Argan oil as a moisturizer and it does not cause my skin to get oiler. I love this product too, it simply balances my skin!</li>
    <li> Very good astringent for the face. Use few drops in the face pack, Skin feels softer and clean after face pack.Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife loves your rose water</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this rose water. I use it on myself as well as my (esthetic/makeup)clients. There are just so many amazing uses for it. I use it as a toner before I moisturize, I mix it with kaolin to make masks, I use it to soak squares of cotton and then lay them on my eyes to reduce puffiness, I use it to foil eyeshadows, to prep skin before makeup and to set makeup once applied. I pour it into spray bottles with a drop or two of lavender essential oil and use it as a refreshing room spray and I also spray this directly onto my face throughout the day as a calming &amp; hydrating pick-me-up for my skin. The list goes on and on. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet you&#x27;re missing out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that THIS rose water comes in a dark glass bottle to protect it from UV light. The humanitarian efforts by the company are a lovely bonus as well :)</li>
    <li> The rose water is delightful and exactly as stated. The dark amber glass bottle is important to me as I don&#x27;t using anything that is stored in plastic.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I use it alone after washing or with the rhassoul clay as a mask!! Just wish bottle was bigger for cost. Will buy again though!</li>
    <li> lovely scent; gentle; so far so good</li>
    <li> The best. Leaves your skin very soft</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love it so much! It makes my face more soft than before. Besides, I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved rose water. For skin, as well as for cooking! This one, specifically for skin, has been very nice to use. Both my husband and I use. It does not dry out the skin like other toners with alcohol do, cleans well, and leaves a rose scent. Thank you Poppy Austin!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product but love it as a natural toner. Has a great smell and feel to it. Fast delivery would buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice product,  nice soft smell if rose water! Fast delivery,  great cause.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used different rose waters for a while and have tried the various brands that are naturally distiller and organic. Poppy Austin is pleasant and mild for sensitive skin. The rose scent is not as strong as others, which might be preferable for some. It&#x27;s a nice product of good quality and reasonably priced. My order was shipped quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> There are various qualities of rose water – some are thin and don’t seem to have much to them let alone do anything for the skin.  However, this Facial toner Rose Water is divine. The aroma is heavenly uplifting the spirit as it nourishes the skin.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is lovely. Makes your skin feel soft, fresh and clean. I use it after I remove my makeup in the evening and it helps removes the last residues. I am also thinking of using it in the morning to hydrate my skin prior to applying moisturizer but I would prefer it in a spray bottle for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and thought this would be a good hydrating toner to prep my skin for vitamin c serum. It stripped my skin of all its natural oils so instead I just got a dried out face. It smells good and if you have oily skin this might be perfect but NOT for dry skin. Mine is actually combo..... I&#x27;ve changed my mind a out this and decided to keep it. I like it for removing the last traces of makeup before bed after I&#x27;ve used a makeup wipe. It smells soooo good that my nightly beauty routine has changed from being a dreaded ritual to luxury. I bask in the smell of Roses and my husband loves the smell in bed next to me. I use olive oil on my face afterwards and in the morning my skin is like dewy silk.</li>
    <li> I love the settle smell. No alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin. I have ordered my second bottle already but I&#x27;m also looking for a more affordable natural toner.</li>
    <li> I really like this. It is refreshing and has a lovely scent. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great toner. Smells kinda weird while being mixed with other skin care.</li>
    <li> bought 4 bottles! obsessed!</li>
    <li> My first rose water, love the smell. Feels  great and I will  recommend  this product  to every one.</li>
    <li> This feels great on my face and neck. A small amount on a cotton pad goes a long way...the whole job in fact, which is fabulous. Since I&#x27;ve just started using this toner, I can&#x27;t say more, but I do like it and the lovely fragrance of roses.</li>
    <li> Smell is not that rosey. But it makes ur skin and hair soft and balanced</li>
    <li> 2nd order of this specific product.  I will not be without it in beauty routine.</li>
    <li> soothing ,cooling , and refreshing rose water for my face I even use it under my eyes thats beacuseI trust the brand</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and can already see a difference. My skin is smoother, and my completion is clearer.  The scent is light but very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Worked well for adult skin! Was not drying and kept it moist, will recommend to my friend and family, good stuff</li>
    <li> this is a pleasant product with a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t change on my skin, however doesn&#x27;t seem to really give much benefit with use. I don&#x27;t dislike it, but have found other more invigorating tonners since.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, all the rage and the newest &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; method of staving off the aging process.</li>
    <li> Best toner ever -&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not use a toner because I have never been impressed - my skin is so much softer!</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s smells heavenly and it hydrates the skin rather than strip it. Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, because it doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s so nice I&#x27;ll treat myself to it again.</li>
    <li> This totally met my high expectations.  Light fragrance and very revitalizing.</li>
    <li> This rose water is great. I find the amount and price fair. It smells absolutely amazing, strong but not heavy, very pleasant, luxurious. I only use it as a face mask mixed with rhassoul clay and can&#x27;t be happier. Makes my skin clear, refreshed, smooth and healthy looking without drying. The only downside is that my bottle came with a loose cap, not sealed. Thankfully it did not leak. But I do wonder whether these bottles are not sealed because every other product comes with a clear plastic seal. Either way, a good buy.</li>
    <li> Smell nice and even my skin tone.  Already used two bottles and bought three more!</li>
    <li> It was my second purchase of this rose water. Love the smell and how my skin feels after it.</li>
    <li> So sorry to say, but this is only okay. I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the smell is weird. And, I personally cannot tell the difference between this product and a cheaper brand that I also use, other than the facts that I save a lot of money per ounce with the other brand and the other brand smells better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, with either rose water brand that I use on my scalp (mixed 50/50 with George&#x27;s Distilled Aloe), I was able to get rid of a dandruff/cradle cap reaction that I had to one of my shampoos last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is a good product, but I do not recommend it over any other brand.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water. I dilute it and put in an atomizer, then use it to set my makeup.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, works beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is the best rose water toner I&#x27;ve tried several.  Soothing and imparts moisture to my face. Well packaged and arrived ahead of schedule. I recommend it for anyone, especially if sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth the extra cost.  You are getting what you pay for with Poppy Austin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It smells amazing AND it has really helped calm my rosacea.  Yeah!</li>
    <li> light rose scent, face feels and looks clean and refreshed. i even wipe down my cell phone with it. tried it on my 14 year old granddaughter and now i have to buy her one.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while now, didn&#x27;t notice anything significant.</li>
    <li> This toner is awesome ! Makes my face feel great &amp; tightens my pores.</li>
    <li> Love this! Smells beautiful and it feels heavenly on my face leaving it smooth and fresh</li>
    <li> This makes my skin glow. I only use natural products which are hard to find at a good price. This is much much more than what you pay for. Smells amazing and has helped my skin dramatically. I have acne so of course I was thrilled to find something that not only helped clear blemishes but also give it a healthy glow. My skin is mix oily/dry. I have to moisturize and exfoliate. I use this product twice a day.</li>
    <li> Lovely. A luxurious experience. Simple and sweet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only a few days and have already noticed a difference in my skin. I am very acne prone and can use almost nothing on my face, although i still have breakouts they are less red and the areas that do not have acne look and feel great.</li>
    <li> What a great product and I&#x27;m so glad to add this to my beauty routine! It is in a nice glass bottle and comes in the right amount. I was advised by my esthetician to use rose water as a ph balancing toner and to keep my skin moisturized whenever needed. I searched high and low and this one came highly reviewed! I wanted something pure with no additives or irritants due to this being used on my face. I just poured this product into a small travel size mister and take it with me wherever I go! I have been pleasantly surprised by this product and like the smell, too! Added bonus is the fact that this is a responsibly-sourced product and gives back to a woman&#x27;s cooperative in Morocco! I definitely will support those two initiatives and wish the greatest success for this company!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! I&#x27;ve never been one to like toner or astringent because with my oily skin then tend to make me feel too dry for admire and then I&#x27;m oily again in 10 mins. This toner is perfectly balanced and the smell is incredible. I am hooked and will be using this for life.</li>
    <li> excellent, all natural, heavenly smelling product!  Excellent rose water</li>
    <li> Rose water is so amazing for my skin. I like this brand because it is pure and ethical, they have good customer service that always follows up. I will keep buying from them. It is pretty expensive but worth it I think.</li>
    <li> Effective clean no irritation .  Great results</li>
    <li> very refreshing, and nice smell.</li>
    <li> I feel like my skin is much cleaner after using this product</li>
    <li> Have ordered this rose water several times but this batch smells awful and the odor lingers.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Great Quality, MUCH better than the cooking rosewater from the organic grocery stores, not only is it really, really soft and gentle on the face, but it also seems to last like forever! Very highly recommended, especially for those with sensitive skin like me!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful natural toner. It is a bit pricey, but a good way to treat yourself to pamper your face after using a cleanser!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months now, and it works wonderfully.  I ran out about 3 weeks ago, and went about 2 weeks without using the product - big mistake.  My face was flaky and itchy because I didn&#x27;t have the toner to freshen my skin every morning and evening.  It really does help to remove any excess dirt and oil left behind by your face wash, and also helps smooth your skin and remove redness.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I first purchased this product. I have read many great things about rose water and the benefits it can give your skin. I currently use this morning and night after I wash my face. This has done wonders for my acne and has helped a lot with the redness. I suffered from adult acne until recently, when my doctor put me on antibiotics and trial and error on creams. I switched to using almost all natural products for my face.  It is been about three months and I am on my second bottle of this rose water and have decided that I am never going to buy another toner again. I love that this product is all natural and there is no harmful chemicals going on to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Poppy Austin for making a Product that Works.</li>
    <li> As promised.... very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> you can simply smell the difference in this rose water toner, it&#x27;s pure, natural and very gentle on your skin. great stuff</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care to wash my face in the morning, mainly because I like the extra sleep, but also because I don&#x27;t like how makeup wears on top of fresh moisturizer. So I swipe this all over my face, including eyes, and it removes all excess oil without drying my skin out. Makeup wears wonderfully on top of it and with continued use, my skin tone has started to even out/calm down.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference with this product.  It smells good, though. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!  My skin is clearer already. I have many allergies and this is the first toner I have been able to use in years. It is gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural toner that isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin. It is gentle yet effective. It also allows for my other serums and creams to work even better. It is the toner I will be using from now on.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this product is outstanding.  I love everything about it.  It smells good and leaves my skin smooth.  After reading some reviews people were saying that using cotton balls wastes the product.  So I poured it into a spray bottle.  I’ve misted my face for about 3 days now I can really see a difference.  My pores are smaller.  There’s a reason this stuff has been around for centuries.  I will be buying this for life.</li>
    <li> I do love this product and so does my face.</li>
    <li> I strive to use only the cleanest and responsibly sourced products and foods and this hands down is one of my must haves. Simply wonderful, organic, clean chemical free goodness for fresh bright skin with the wonderful light scent of roses. Can&#x27;t go without and a small bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Look, I am happy with this product and it came packaged well and will get again!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and hydration that this toner provides. I spray this on my face after a shower and to set my make up. I find it very refreshing. I recommend this product. It&#x27;s kind of pricey for the size of the bottle but think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> feels nice when applied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing, moisturizing, and smells good! I think it has a good effect on your skin. It is a bit pricey, though, and I wonder if using normal rose water that you see in bottles in Middle Eastern stores would be equivalent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Normally I apply a bit on a cotton pad and wipe my face with it that way, but I recently put it into a spray bottle and it&#x27;s very refreshing for a hot day. However, with the spray bottle, it feels like a lot of it is just evaporating, and although the smell is good, it can be a little overpowering, haha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product! I think it lasts about 1 to 2 months, depending on how often you use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Not only was it shipped fast but it was just as they described it. Smells wonderful, hydrates, tones, and reduces pores! I will most definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a marked difference in my complexion and softness in my skin. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I also bought and applicator spray bottle will use it on vacation</li>
    <li> Wonderful and fresh, I use it daily. I have ruddy skin and the cold weather enhances it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Refreshing, makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Really nice, but too expensive for what it is</li>
    <li> It´s fine and soft toner.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever had the fortune to come across!  It leaves your skin feeling soft and its refreshing just knowing it is a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Love it</li>
    <li> it is a great product for a very reasonable price. I have been using it for over a week and it fells really nice on my face.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the refreshing feel after using this Rose Water.  I would definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I really have noticed a difference in my skin.  I will continue to use!!  ORGANIC is a huge plus..  Buy more organic products people!!</li>
    <li> Delivery was really quick and I love this product! My skin already seems to be feeling and looking better, only 2 days into using this Rose Water with Poppy Austin Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing, like there is a real rose in front of you. I am still to figure out how to use it economically, because using cotton balls seems wasting a lot of product. I am trying a small spray bottle right now.</li>
    <li> The face toner gotta be careful on how u use it me specially when I get a pimple I use a cotton ball an leave it on top of the pimple or acne for a few second  don&#x27;t really count but u will see the swollen go down instanly also one of my fav. But will dry skin if u don&#x27;t proparly use it</li>
    <li> I like this product alot.  It smells really nice and leaves my skin feeing refreshed.  Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Very excited and pleased about receiving The Rose Water. I love it. A great quality product. So glad you have it&lt;br /&gt;available for purchase.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out. I would  not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells fresh and leaves my skin renewed and ready for a new day. Thank you for such a great toner.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a wonderful product !</li>
    <li> This rose water is just wonderful - leaves your skin fresh, clean and hydrated with a pleasant mild scent.  It&#x27;s my favorite and I&#x27;ve given it as a gift and will order again.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I just love this wonderful product -- it makes your skin feel beautiful and very clean after you use it -- I hope to use this excellent product for many, many years -- Thank you for making such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Good scent. I have good experience with it. Very natural, no allergy.</li>
    <li> Poppy Austin &#x27;s ethic seems impeccable, which is why, when I found I&#x27;d acidentally duplicated my first order I didn&#x27;t send it back. After all, I have daughters &amp; friends to gift. The Rose Water Toner is lovely. I don&#x27;t detect much fragrance, but it&#x27;s effect is  to make my skin glow and that&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews about using rosewater as a facial toner, I thought I give it a try. I am using this for a little more than a week now, and I love it. It reduces any kind of irritation and redness, smells great, and it is all natural, no weird ingredients. I tried to use it on irritated skin after waxing, and it took the redness away in a very short time. Amazing. I will never be without this again.</li>
    <li> This product is really great and I think decently priced. I mix this with a little bit of glycerin to create my own daytime moisturizer and my skin feels so soft and hydrated. I will continue to buy this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve used several rose water toners and the quality of this is ok, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent. The smell is really weird.</li>
    <li> I chose Poppy Austin Rose Water because of the purity of this product, without additives. I live in a very dry and hot climate causing dry flaky skin. I&#x27;m very pleased with increased moisture and smooth application of makeup while using your rose water for just a couple of weeks. It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> awesome for people with rosacea</li>
    <li> For years I had not realized the benefit of a toner. After living in a dry climate for a number of years, I recognized that a toner helps prepare the skin for serums and moisturizers. However not all toners are equal nor do you need to spend a great deal of money on super expensive ones. You need to find the right one. I have not used this particular rose water toner very long but I really love how it does not evaporate off my skin. It has no alcohol in it which is one of the ingredients that causes toners to dry so quickly. I also did a bit of research on the benefits of rose water specifically. If you suffer from dry skin or live in a dry climate, give this a try. I am very pleased with so far. Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> This bottle arrived smashed and empty. Return.</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a couple of weeks but I can already tell that it is having a positive effect on my sensitive skin. The quality of the product is very high. No glycerin, and has a wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product. When you open the bottle, it smells like lovely roses. Put it on your skin, and then after a couple of minutes - the smell was awful. I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough. I bought this as a facial toner, but sadly I&#x27;ll be using it to freshen the toilet.</li>
    <li> This rose water is awesome! Ive been using it every morning since I got it and its such a refreshing way to start me day. The smell is heavenly and feels completely indulgent but the price is amazing! It makes my face feel toned and almost glowing. Love it and I already plan giving this as gifts for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, Thanks&#x27;</li>
    <li> Beautiful clean product. I attached a mist sprayer to the bottle and spray on my face after cleansing and throughout the day. Love :)</li>
    <li> This rose water is fantastic</li>
    <li> feel so natrual! smell just same as pure rose water, and absorted so fast by the skin</li>
    <li> Really love this rose water. I want to find a spray nozzle to fit this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I use it before moisturizer (so it spreads easier) and I use a mineral foundation so I use this to set my make-up and as a refreshing spritz throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This actually WORKS FOR ME! Besides the glorious smell, it does remove ANYTHING left behind! I have VERY dry and sensitive skin.This product leaves my face so soft and not dry or tight. AND it smells heavenly. I guess because it is the real thing! I&#x27;m a freckled face woman (on my 2nd&lt;br /&gt;bottle) I am seeing some fading in areas where freckles were a blob.</li>
    <li> I love my new skincare regime. Cleanse, tone with Poppy Austin Rose Water, apply Vitamin C in the morning and Rosehip Oil at night.  My face is definitely changing.  Pores seem to be getting smaller.  Small spots are peeling away. I&#x27;ve already purchased some of this for a Christmas present for my sister.</li>
    <li> I would have said 5 stars, because I love this Rose Water!  I only wish there was a spray inside the bottle.  I felt like I was wasting a lot by applying with a cotton ball.  I have used a lot of rose waters and really love this one.</li>
    <li> Amazing product from a great company!!!!</li>
    <li> I love using rose water as a facial toner. This rose water has a weird smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the other two brands I&#x27;ve tried. It works like the other rose waters I&#x27;ve used. I recommend using rose water. I just didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin tends to get dry in winter and oily in summer. This toner helps my skin retain just the right amount of moisture, whatever the season. A lot of the other toners work well for me, but they all contain alcohol, and it just seems ridiculous to apply stuff that contains alcohol when my skin is already dry. It is nonetheless, pricey.</li>
    <li> !f you are looking for a lightly scented rose toner then this is NOT it.  i have used a few others recently-all in glass bottles-and this just looks like water.  i am not sure how much rose oil is in here-seems that it is mostly distilled water.</li>
    <li> I honestly really like this toner. It makes my skin feel tighter and smooth. This is a beautiful thing.  It&#x27;s a shame I waited so long to start pampering my skin. Believe me it&#x27;s never to late and at such a reasonable cost...there is no excuse. Thank you so much Poppy Austin.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase! When I read the ingredients of the toner I was previously using, I couldn&#x27;t believe the long list. The rose water has 1 ingredient and seems to do exactly what the other toner did. It smells great and I love it!</li>
    <li> Great Product , Can definitely feel tightening upon applying and skin is looking more radiant</li>
    <li> I just received this today, and I already love this product. It smells terrific, and my skin feels like velvet.</li>
    <li> Love this rose water! Took a little bit to get over the smell it leaves (not particularly my favorite, as I tend to like more of a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent and the toner by Caudalie is much less.. Present after it dries) but it&#x27;s not overly powerful or pungent, just different. I went through my Poppy Austin rose water in about three months, which is a little less time I expect to get through a toner but these bottles are also maybe about a third of the size of most toners. I do appreciate that they run certain promotions on Amazon though, since if you enjoy a product of their line such as the Rose Water you can just stock up on a couple of the same product and receive a bulk discount. I also think it&#x27;s quite rare to find a toner that is 100% organic. I found this as a toner to be very calming for my skin, will definitely order again soon.</li>
    <li> So far I am really enjoying this product. It feels and smells very refreshing. I ordered this from Afghanistan and it arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
    <li> Contrary to what some have written,  this product is fabulous.  It has a bit of a stronger fragrance, but nothing that would repulse you. It works better than most toners on the market.  I would recommend this product in a second.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!! I use this everyday. I can&#x27;t get enough of how great it smells. It really makes my face feel and look clear. I&#x27;m actually running out, so I will most def be buying another one soon!!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients. The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available. Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price. Furthermore, the company donates a portion of the proceeds of EVERY bottle sold to a women&#x27;s charity in Morocco. (Read all about it on the Poppy Austin website.) You will love this product as well as their vitamin C Serum, barbary fig oil and argan oil. So glad I found these amazing products. I will never switch skin care products again. Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer. I recommend argan during the day and barbary fig before bed (as it tends to make skin a bit shiny).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  Having very sensitive skin along with contact dermatitis I can actually use this Rose&lt;br /&gt;Water Toner and it Helps!  I wash my face, spray it on, rinse it off and use jojoba to help with the dry and itchy patches.  Works wonders.  Does not burn or irritate in any way (for me).  It is very soothing and calms down the rash.  I love it!  This is my 2nd purchase of this item.  My first bottle lasted two and half months.  I put it in a blue glass bottle with a misting sprayer.  Makes it easy to apply.  Wish it came with in a spray bottle.  BTW  Love the Name...Poppy!  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Rose water is amazing. I have used Moroccan rose water for years and my skin is great. I only buy pure Moroccan Rose Watter.</li>
    <li> shipped fast, good packaging, like it so far...no complaints :)</li>
    <li> I have received my Rose Water last week, OMG...smells awesome, absolutely in love with this product, what a way to spoil yourself. My skin feels and smells wonderful. I will be purchasing this product again. I also just purchased Argan oil from Poppy Austin I know I will not be disappointed due to quality I feel is there.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does a nice job toning and hydrating my skin.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My skin is very dry, even in Florida. My skin feels moisturized and soft after using and I love the smell.  It is like putting your nose in the middle of a rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patti</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells great and hydrates my face. Even can take off makeup. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now. Both times came quickly. I would suggest this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to my regular toner again.  Not only is this product 100% organic but it is so gentle on my skin and its a lot cheaper than my regular toner, therefore I&#x27;ll be buying this product again and recommending to all my friend!  Thanks Poppy Austin!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> It smells like summer and romantic flowers from my husband! It cleans off so much dirt even though I washed my face!&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my hair too.</li>
    <li> Great product, it makes my skin feel a lot calmer and decreased the amount of bumps on my face after just one night! I really recommend using this along with a good sleep schedule and healthy diet to make your skin GLOW!</li>
    <li> I had heard about argan oil and wanted to try it out. Bought some but at the back of my mind I felt it wasn&#x27;t the real thing. Bought from Amazon and that&#x27;s where I realized the other one was a fake! It&#x27;s early days for the poppy austin one but I will keep you posted. As for the rose water cleanser, I bought by mistake but will use. Watch this space for un update. The Hanes bikinis are a perfect fit. Bio oil has been my thing for years. I got it from Amazon because of the good price. That&#x27;s where I will be buying now.</li>
    <li> 3 weeks if daily use and I see a dramatic change.  This product is excellent and I will buy again. Great shipping as well.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best thing I&#x27;ve bought for my face ever.  Ever ever ever.  If you have ever used rose water this is the best you could hope for. I don&#x27;t use commercial cleansers and toners I make my own w natural ingredients.  This however I will buy over and over again.</li>
    <li> Great quality.I use it every morning and I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a 60 day supply. It lasted about 30 days at the most.</li>
    <li> Completely different than your average rose water -words cannot describe .&lt;br /&gt;Exceptional quality - fantastic fragrance (very light)&lt;br /&gt;Super refreshing</li>
    <li> Second time buying this for me. I absolutely love the natural rose scent. Best toner I&#x27;ve ever used! Organic is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> Pure smell of rose, love it. Not sticky at all, just the one I want.</li>
    <li> This smells really nice, I like witch hazel better as an overall toner, but I like to spray this over my makeup if I feel kinda greasy or sweaty. Overall pretty good. I bought a spray bottle to use with it.</li>
    <li> Love the rose water, very gentle</li>
    <li> This is a really nice Rose Water and I love putting it on in the morning before my Vit C serum and Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about it is that it really needs to come in a spray bottle.  There is no reason to put it on a cotton ball where most of it gets thrown away when you could mist your face with a sprayer.  I did buy a brown glass bottle 2 oz sprayer from Amazon and am using it but how much nicer if it came in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Fast service. Great price!</li>
    <li> Ordered this to co-exist underneath with an all natural &amp; organic retinol serum after viewing excellent reviews on this toner. It is absolutely amazing. Within just DAYS I noticed a difference in my face. Formerly I was on an anti-biotic from my dermatologist  trying  to clear my face up due to constant consistent break outs within a specified area. The medicine were giving my stomach pains and doing a number on my body, and I love natural and organic products and this toner definitely is helping keep the consistency and a natural glow within my skin. Also my makeup even looks more smooth, fresh, and I even have noticed a lesser consistency throughout the day with the oil being produced as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very oily skin, and my body produces oil throughout the day heavily, still no issues . This toner is refreshing, clean, &amp; really does contribute to a natural healthy skin tone and features. I am no longer taking the medicine prescribed to me by my dermatologist. Will definitely be ordering again, came on time, packaged well, and the glass bottle allows you to use every last drop without wasting anything. Really overall an excellent product and recommend to anyone for any skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy and will be ordering this again when I am running low. Also pairs well the natural &amp; organic retinol serum with Green Tea, Vitiman E, and 2.5% retinol. Both pairs together well.</li>
    <li> Like this alot but the bottle goes very quickly. Expensive for the amount you get. lovely but pricey</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product and I&#x27;m so glad I finally found it. I see visible results from using this product, my face responds to it positively whenever I put it on its refreshing and  pure.  The rose fragrance is also uplifting to my senses, a good way to begin or even end my day.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of it but my skin has now broken out from it which never happens. This is the only new product that I have introduced into my skin care regimen so I can narrow it down to the toner for the breakouts. I do love the feel of it and the smell when I apply it. I have sensitive skin so this may not be the product for me.</li>
    <li> The toner smell great but it makes my skin super dry and very tight though. Other than that I don&#x27;t see any positive change on my skin. I stop using it and it took about a month for my skin to go back to normal.</li>
    <li> Only gave it 4 because I just barely started using it.  So far I like the glow it gives my skin, and it so far is helping prevent breakouts, which is remarkable since I have stubborn cystic acne. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This water has reduced my pore size dramatically. It is extremely hydrating, and smells to die for. I love that these products are 100% natural, my skin loves them! Thank you Poppy Austin!!</li>
    <li> this is my fourth time ordering this in the past 3 months lol i really use it alot .</li>
    <li> I am on my fourth bottle, use it morning and night, really hydrates my skin and great at removing  excess makeup, have a skin condition on my neck, red neck, no longer use makeup on my neck, has alleviated a lot of the redness!</li>
    <li> it smell&#x27;s good and absorb quickly,no allergic,but the only insufficient is the button is too small ,but it&#x27;s ok ,i will still buy it .</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  This product is refreshing and gives me a clean feeling.  As it dries on my face, I can feel the pores tightening, so it does what it should.  I apply it with a water saturated, then squeezed, cotton ball so it won&#x27;t soak into the cotton.  Certainly the fragrance is a tried and true rose and very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. If you enjoy the smell of roses you will surly like this product. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of roses, the smell may be much at first but you&#x27;ll get used to it, it&#x27;s not that bad. I use this product as a toner and I love the way it makes my skin look so bright! I am a customer for life. Give this Finest Rose Water Facial Toner a try. You won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> Great product...... quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Amazing company. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This produce is so comforting and hydrating. I use it morning and evening after cleansing. I will purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
    <li> a very nice product. Arrived packaged very safely.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice. It has a lovely smell and left my skin soft and feeling refreshed. I use it after I cleanse my face and before my serums and moisturizer. I wish it was a larger size for the price though. I have used it mixed in with the volcanic Moroccan clay and it was refreshing but it uses a lot of the rose water so just use a little, add a few drops of rose oil and water and that works great.</li>
    <li> Just start to use today. Smells good, not sticky and grease at all. Skin absorbs the rose water very quickly after applying to face. Look forward to see the long-term effect.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Lovely! Gentle, but effective.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this 100% pure rose water to anyone who wants her/his skin rejuvenated. It has no alcohol but pure rose water, which quenches the skin immediately. I love the very pleasant rose scent and the fact that, immediately after application, it makes my skin look more translucent. I follow it up with Vitamin C serum and moisturizer. Since the bottle is made of glass and has no pump nor spray, I transfer some to a small pump bottle for daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to stop loading my body with toxins. I was so happy to find Poppy Austin products. I love the Rose Water Toner. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product! Light , non drying toner. Excellent! This is my third bottle&lt;br /&gt;Wish I found this yrs ago</li>
    <li> I definitely will purchase another bottle of Rose Water Facial Toner. It was inexpensive and delivered on time. I love the fact that it&#x27;s a 100% pure and organic product; it feels light-weight and fresh when I apply it to my skin. I love the fresh rose scent.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product; my facial skin feels clean, soft, and fresh after using.  has healing properties, too.  And, I especially appreciate the fact that the product is made by women&#x27;s cooperatives in poor countries giving them a chance to provide for their families.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem as helpful with reducing my redness and the tone of my skin as other brands I have tried but it also hasn&#x27;t gone bad (got that rancid smell) that often happens with rose waters.</li>
    <li> Small quantity but amazing quality.</li>
    <li> Best every for my aging skin! No cracking on my lovely face and it repairs damage... save some money and give this a shot. Started w/Vitamin C oil, then this Rose Hips oil, finished w/ Fig oil.  You would think I would be all greased up but really not as it is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; like oil.  used my Clarisonic w/ Vit C oil. Layering these after a few minutes each. Aging and had perfection in skin 6 mo ago, until they discontinued products of importance in their line. Tried every thing, skin was terrific in the morning!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for all that long so I can&#x27;t comment on the reaction on my skin but I imagine it does feel softer. But I look forward every day to using it just because of the scent and gentle feel.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, lovely rose scent</li>
    <li> This is an awesome facial toner. Very light and great for sensitive skin. I personally am not too fond of the scent even though it is not bad but it smells like roses that are dying a bit. Nonetheless I do enjoy it and it feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Use this twice daily to clean my face of impurities.  Have purchased this twice and will continue to use it.  The smell is Yummy</li>
    <li> I received it  fine and tried it on after I washed my face.  While it smelled very nice and rosy in the bottle, for whatever reason it smelled like a wet rag on my face.  I had to wash it off with water because it was so unpleasant for me.  My skin felt smooth from it, but there was no way I could stand the smell.  I wonder if something changed during transport because the bottle was hot when I opened the box, in our 90 degree weather.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used toner before because it seems harsh. This Rose Water is perfect... It has not dried my skin. It smells good too, and comes in a glass bottle. No plastic.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described.  The product smells delightful and has wonderful pore tightening properties!  This will become a staple in my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> I have been using the rose water for about 2 weeks. Love, love, love. I am 50 and getting horrible peri menapause acne. I have oily skin and open pores also. I have been using acne creams for the acne and my skin was dry flakey and i began to see wrinkles. Noooooooo! Now my skin is hydrated the wrinkles are gone and my skin is not as oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know if i can use your vitamin c serum on my face without causing any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if vitamin c product will work with my current issues.  Please help.</li>
    <li> Good skin care product.  Seems to help with calming eczema skin flare-ups.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. I put my Rose Water in a spray bottle for that refreshing sensation. Works miracles on skin over 35 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great anti-inflammatory, soothing irritated skin, a rich source of antioxidants which can help strengthen skin cells and regenerate skin tissue. A must have for any beauty regiment.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a toner, this was recommended on a blog that I follow, so decided to try it out. Works great, love the rose water smell, light, refreshing and cooling. I have ordered it twice, and very happy with it. Does not sting or have an alcohol smell like some toners do. As a mom who is more cautious about what I put on my body now, I highly recommend this toner.</li>
    <li> I love the natural rose scent of this rosewater. It helps to sooth the mild sunburn on my kids&#x27; skin. They love the smell and would ask for more. I will buy more of the rose water to keep the family&#x27;s skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it feels. Not sure what kind of result it gives me</li>
    <li> As you open the product, you will feel like if you are smelling a real rose, or the purest essence of it. I really write this review because I want to let people know that whoever appreciates natural and pure products would be fully satisfied with this rose water. It leaves a natural scent of rose on the skin and it hydrates it. You just need a small quantity of it, so it lasts a lot (I hope... I have been using it only for a week :). Thank you for this beautiful product!</li>
    <li> This Rose Water smells amazing and is a great, light toner that leaves my skin feeling soft, and not dry or tight.</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a natural, good-smelling toner by a company that doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  Came upon this by chance and the reviews were great --- I can see why. I received mine and put it in a spray bottle. Smells fantastic and is a great toner -- non-drying.  It&#x27;s easier to use and you&#x27;ll waste less by putting it in a spray bottle vs. using it with a cotton ball.  I love this and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the Rose Water! Put it on right after shower, let it soak a minute, then apply the Argon Oil, a Great combination, will definitely purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> The rose water is excellent. But when I received the package, the cap was loosed and it leaked out about 1/3 of the bottle. The bubble bags were all wet. I am not happy about it because it was wasted quite a lot.</li>
    <li> Love it!  After using it for the first time, my face felt very soft and also evened out my skin tone.  Smells great too.  Product was delivered on time  (very quick).  Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I started using the Rose Water after using the Argan Oil for my nails and being very happy with that.  I use the 100 % Rose Water Facial Toner both in the AM and PM, after washing often with the Rassoul Clay. It is very soothing and the cost is much less than another brand of Rose Water I was using.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really too early to tell if this is making much of a difference on my skin, but I really like the smell of it.  It does smell a lot like witch hazel, but it&#x27;s more subtle.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell of roses, so I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming rose smell to it.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly, and the product is great! I used it in a homemade makeup remover and it is a lovely addition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (recommended by an esthetician friend of mine) for about two weeks now, and I love it! I My skin feels smoother and softer, and is already more clear. Every morning, I wash my face, apply the toner, and apply a serum (and sometimes a moisturizer, because the air is very dry this time of year). This toner was a great addition to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> This has a slight pleasant  rose smell to it.  I have noticed a reduction in the redness on my face.  I have very sensitive skin and I also have Lupus.  I have only used this product for about two week but I am very happy so far with what i see.  I have recently tried several of the Poppy Austin products and I am very happy with them all.  I like the fact that the ingredients are natural and the price is reasonable for the quality.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received doesn&#x27;t smell like anything really. I was expecting it to smell like roses according to other reviews talking about how good it smells and how some people even had to dilute it with water but not mine. Mine did not smell like anything really so I&#x27;m kinda disappointed in that aspect as I was looking forward to it smelling like roses.</li>
    <li> This company is meticulous in their selection of ingredients and their manufacturing.  They seem to sincerely be interested in offering the best product possible, as close to nature as possible.  Also, a portion of every purchase goes to support women&#x27;s cooperatives in Morocco.  The Rose Water Facial Toner has a wonderful scent, just the natural aroma of rose water.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and smells beautifully.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this rosewater! It is the best one I have used so far. It smells amazing, and I have noticed my complexion is getting better while using it.</li>
    <li> A complete waste of money. I&#x27;d recommend going to your local health cosmetic/food store. I gave it two because I am too frugal to waste 15 dollars, so I still used it as a toner.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  Expected a little more from this product.  It has a super pleasant and very mild rose scent.  Not sure exactly what was expected but it feels like I am using water NOT toner.</li>
    <li> Smells great but inconvenient packaging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks with a new skin care routine. I love this stuff! It smells wonderful, and my skin is now a completely even tone for the first time since I can remember. I will keep using this and can&#x27;t imagine my skin without it now!</li>
    <li> Thx to poppy austin. My face feels so refreshed after applying. I plan on buying more as soon as i run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and a half, but so far I&#x27;m pleased with it. Very refreshing, nice scent, will order again....</li>
    <li> Great product! Flawless customer service.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the way this toner makes her face feel. I love the way she smells faintly of roses afterwards. Her friend, who studies the production of cosmetics, loves the  natural products and methods used in this toner. I have already bought 2 bottles and plan to buy more when these run out. Well Done!</li>
    <li> Use it for after shave....Soothing, cooling and healing.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing how it works as an after shave I started&lt;br /&gt;using it over my entire face....THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Try it once, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Really?! $20 for Rose water? LOL. Its okay. Way too expensive for the size. When I&#x27;m done with it I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. I&#x27;ll be going back to my Obagi toner. I even like the Heritage brand Rose water spray better. Larger size and it has a spray pump.</li>
    <li> fresh, clean, environmentally-friendly.  A great product from a terrific, socially responsible company</li>
    <li> I have tried many rose waters over the years. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how awesome the feel and smell are in this bottle of wonder!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is non-irritating and seems to help remove the final traces of makeup. Plus it smells great, I love anything rose. For a long time I wasn&#x27;t using toner because I didn&#x27;t want to introduce anything else to my already lengthy routine. I have super sensitive, combo acne-prone and hormonal skin with uneven tone and texture, dark spots from past acne, and some redness. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this product doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reaction for me after a couple weeks of use. It helps get my face as clean as possible after washing and before moving onto my various treatments and moisturizer. I want to be sure my other products penetrate properly. Haven&#x27;t noticed a marked improvement since using this, will likely take more time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! The smell is amazing! Thank you Poppy Austin for the great product and service!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I can&#x27;t really tell if the toner is having much of an effect/impact on my skin.  However, it is very gentle, natural and I absolutely LOVE it&#x27;s light, realistic rose smell.  I can smell it on myself all day and love it (yet the smell is very light).</li>
    <li> The scent alone is fantastic. Using it over the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed red spots on my face fading, and overall my skin feels much softer.  There are no harmful chemicals in this product, it is actually just 100% rose water, so you can use it for more than just toner.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for my facial toner DIY</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time today and my skin felt so silky smooth and refreshed!! definite buy again! i see this wasting pretty soon! wish it had a squeezer of some sort but the product is amazing!</li>
    <li> It seems like a great product.It gives my face a smoothing glow effect.And removes the last remnants of makeup after cleansing.Thank You.</li>
    <li> Just wonderful, pure and exactly as described</li>
    <li> Great products and company.  Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I like the way this makes my face and neck feel.  It has a slight rose smell and is soothing.  I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I started out using an old bottle of rosewater my fiancé had from a yoga ashram when we met, and was heartbroken when it ran out. It is the perfect face toner and refresher, and I even spray it to set my makeup. After doing some research, I learned how difficult it is to find real rose water, and even harder to find one with consistent reviews. When I found Poppy Austin&#x27;s Rose Water Face Toner I was very excited, because it is not only produced the right way, but is also organic, and ha AWESOME reviews. After receiving it, I could not have been more pleased. It smells fantastic, and is concentrated enough that I diluted it bit before putting in my atomizer, so this beautiful little bottle should last. LONG time. Have been using as the final step of the three part skin regime I started about a week ago and am getting great results so far. I clean my face with a gentle cleanse, followed by toning my face with witch-hazel, followed by an application of jojoba oil as lotion, and I mist rosewater as the final step. My skin is soft and dewy, my acne is clearing up, and my scars are healing. Will definitely be a return customer with Poppy Austin.</li>
    <li> Since I have added this to my daily regimen I have to say I have seen a big difference in my skin. I have oily and sometimes acne and scars this has given my skin a glow. I even am feeling more confident without makeup. Really recommend trying plus the smell is delightful.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin with lots of redness but this is so gentle on my skin!</li>
    <li> It smells wondrous &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a facial toner. I&#x27;ve yet to finish the bottle, of course, so it&#x27;s too soon to say, but I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be making another purchase once I run out. Note, though, that there&#x27;s possibly an odd pulpish thing at the bottom of the rosewater, which I admittedly found a bit unsettling while transferring the contents into bottles w/ droppers.</li>
    <li> A million miles away from anything you get at stores; by far the best Rose water facial toner I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I use it as my toner after cleansing and it feels, smells, works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal. I highly recommend trying this brand BEFORE a cheaper brand, so you know what a \\&quot;best case scenario\\&quot; can be for your skin. My skin did soooo well on this rose water, fell into instant love using it as a facial toner. Skin became so soft, break-outs started to heal and go away completely, and I found out that apparently years of using witch hazel was a bad, bad, BAD idea. I tried rose water because the person who performed a facial for me at a spa suggested switching to rose water, of any brand. Well, turns out the \\&quot;any brand\\&quot; part may not be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROBLEM for me, is just the price. I went through my bottle in a month, using it several times a day on cotton rounds. I might try getting a spray bottle, as some others have recommended. I tried a cheaper brand, and had horrible results, writing that company to find out if it is distilled or contains any oil or any unlisted preservatives. As a result, I am still looking for a cheaper alternative to use at least some of the time, so I don&#x27;t feel like I have to limit myself to how often I can use this, but this IS a high quality product. Also, this company&#x27;s argon oil is also completely amazing, though I mostly use that for arms at night after a shower. Did find another brand argon oil that is good, too, but have not reviewed it quite yet. Highly recommend this item, and it was shipped nicely, no leaks or spills! :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bottle but works great. I always enjoy flower water especially rose water, but among those rose water that I&#x27;ve bought through these years, no one can beat this one. It refreshes my skin every time I apply it on my face and neck. No special smell which means it&#x27;s pure natural without fragrant. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love the Rose Water from Poppy Austin.  I use this toner morning and night and it is gentle on my skin.  Does not dry my skin out and has a lovely smell.  I have been using it for about 2 years now and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is true and not overpowering. Everything about this product and the accompanying service is high quality. I will continue to be a customer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I get clean results with this product. Also, it&#x27;s completely a personal preference, but I hate the smell. I have to rinse off immediately after using it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product along with the Poppy Austin Argan Oil and Vitamin C oil. My main purpose in ordering these products was to have a natural organic moisturizer. I recently had a miscarriage and after that my hormones have been crazy therefore causing a major acne breakout. My hope was that these products would help clear my skin. I can&#x27;t say that they have cleared my acne completely(that is why I gave the product 4 stars), but I can say that I have noticed a big change. My breakouts are dramatically less, but the thing that I have loved is that my face looks much smoother. I have been using these products for almost a month. I have noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily, it feels very balanced. I will continue to use these products. I love them. I am still hoping to find something to help with the breakouts a little bit more. I think I need to try a different cleanser as I didn&#x27;t notice that Poppy Austin had one. The rose water is very refreshing and works wonders to minimize the redness that I have after cleansing.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick and efficient and the product itself arrived in tact. The rose water is an excellent product and the rose smell is not overbearing. I am extremely acne prone and cannot use moisturizers on my face no matter how &amp;#34;non-comedogenic&amp;#34; the label claims it to be. I use this rose water as my actual moisturizer. It softens and tones my skin without causing breakouts. I use a very small amount on a cotton ball after cleansing my skin at night. That&#x27;s it. no heavy moisturizers or night creams and my skin is very soft and clean without the tight feeling most toners will give. This is a great product especially for individuals who may have an issue with breakouts.</li>
    <li> No rose smell at all and it went bad really quickly.  Will not order anything from this brand again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my skin feeling baby butt soft and smelling good! I have also noticed benefits of clearer skin and healthier looking! Love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I liked this product, except that it came in a glass bottle, which is not too safe fdor bathroom use, so I transferred it into a plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> First time tying this but I do like it. Doesn&#x27;t make skin shinny and dried out. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> My bottle has a very poor aroma. I am very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> What an awful smell!! I have used rose water many times but this was awful! Just awful! Buying that item was just pouring money down the drain.</li>
    <li> Lovely, mild, refreshing toner. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is very fresh, in glass container - you can smell the essential essence of the rose.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say though, that it is very moisturizing, this was not my experience for my more mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is light, refreshing and you feel that it&#x27;s doing you some good. Just wished it were indeed more moisturized in the feeling it leaves on my skin.</li>
    <li> My skin reacted badly so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Size is too small for the price</li>
    <li> Love this product smells so good.and does wonders to my face.</li>
    <li> Great toner.  Smells wonderful and my skin is really soft after use.  Nice product.  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Great toner and/or face mist! The rose scent is subtle and relaxing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
    <li> This is the first facial toner I have used that works and doesn&#x27;t smell like alcohol. It feels refreshing and hydrating and smells amazing. My skin has never looked as even or clear before using this product.</li>
    <li> Love the results, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love rose water and the effect it has on me! I&#x27;ve tried many rosewaters and I would have to agree that Poppy Austin&#x27;s may indeed be the FINEST one! It has a much stronger healing and soothing effect on me than other rose waters. Sometimes it will even stop an allergic skin reaction right in its tracks! I love that it comes in glass but which it came with a sprayer. I usually pour this rose water into a blue or brown glass sprayer bottle to use.</li>
    <li> Simply said, I just LOVE this product.  Will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of rose water! I was doing some research on amazon looking for a good brand when I stumbled across Poppy Austin. I read up on Poppy Austin and decided to try it out. Can I just say I am so thankful I stumbled across them. This is by far the best rose water I have ever used! After only using it for a couple of days I could see a significant improvement in my skins tone and texture. This product delivers results aan it smells wonderful! A little bit definitely goes a long way with this stuff. I ordered a bottle for my mom and well as the anti aging Barbary fig oil. I can&#x27;t wait for her to try it. So glad I found this product and am lookin forward to trying the rest of their products!</li>
    <li> THIS DOES SOMETHING MIRACULOUS to your face! Hydration, minimizes pores and MORE! Just watch your face glow and become more radiant. Outstanding Product!</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEEEEE this stuff!!! I will most definitely be a return customer!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I is just water any thing else.I bought for to use with my quimical peel, for refresh my skin, but doesnot work very well i dinnot like it , I wont buy anymore ..</li>
    <li> The finest quality toner I have ever had...just love it</li>
    <li> It smells really good. I haven&#x27;t start use it but I think it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Lovely rose water that smells beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of rose scented things but this wasn&#x27;t bad. I love that it&#x27;s all natural, literally the easiest ingredient label ever to read. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough but what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;ve loved.</li>
    <li> smells really good but besides that i did not see anything else good about this product.</li>
    <li> Great product - smells amazing.  Can&#x27;t wait to try out others in the Poppy Austin line!</li>
    <li> Perfect! this product leaves your skin soft and fresh. I used to suffer from acne and this product helped to clean my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought the Poppy Austin Eye Cream, Rose Hips Oil and Rose Water Toner.  Wow!!  Finally products that deliver what they promise.  The Rose Water Toner and Rose Hips Oil have diminished my acne scars dramatically.  I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on professional treatments that have not worked as well.  I am over 70 years old and wish I  had access to these products before now.</li>
    <li> I really like this rose water. My skin seems softer. However it is a bit expensive to be using cotton balls to apply it. I ended up using my bottle up really fast. I ordered a second bottle and poured it in a spray bottle so I can mist my face. This way I don&#x27;t waste some of it on the cotton balls.</li>
    <li> My favorite rose water. I&#x27;ve tried 3 different and more expensive brands and this is the best out of all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it day and night after cleansing my face, and I also put some on the areas where I have eczema to help heal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a spray bottle option so I can just spritz my face instead of using a cotton ball, but I&#x27;ll just buy one.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rose water facial toner for 2 weeks now, and love it! it leaves my skin sealed and moisturized. Its good for healing and skin healthy glow. Afterwords I follow up with rose hip oil.</li>
    <li> Really like this natural toner, the lovely smell, how it makes my skin feel and lastly the philosphy behind what your company stands for. Very pleased. This is a keeper for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent facial rose water!!!</li>
    <li> I believe this is helping keep my skin clear. I don&#x27;t wear foundation just a little blush and bronzer. This seems to really brighten up my complexion though. I would highly reccomend this product. I have used almost the entire bottle and might have had 3 pimples during the entire time which is really good for me!</li>
    <li> This toner makes my face feel calm, smooth, and soft.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product.  I have sensitive, mature skin.  The rose water toner is soothing and cleansing at the same time.</li>
    <li> Does very good on skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> i absolutely LOVE this rose water. i especially love the integrity and philosophy of poppy austin; i tend to favor really clean/pure and simple ingredients, this delivers. it has nothing but rosewater, no alcohol. i also like that they support women and that the products are made by hand - a caring personal touch makes a difference in products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is right and the quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used this toner exclusively for a month now and have experienced remarkable changes in my skin. i cannot say enough about this rose water, it soothes my skin, hydrates (a LOT! love this), and removes traces of makeup that may remain after washing my face. i like to mix it w/the vit c serum for a one step spritz before applying my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am looking forward to many years of continued loyalty and will absolutely tell ALL my friends about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;thank you, poppy austin, for a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wow, the first try and I could see the difference on my skin, I could see my skin was absorbing every bit of this rose water and my skin looked so refreshing and clear. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. It also smells so heavenly, whenever I spray, I feel like I&#x27;m in rose garden. Natural and organic, so much better than synthetic perfumes. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the Toner and the feeling on my skin, but I wish the bottle has a spray open or something like that, so I won&#x27;t pour too much on my hand each time I use it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this Rose Water! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great quality, I use it as a spray wherever I go. I spray it on my face and hair. Smells so good and strong, very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love the product...smells amazing</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it smells wonderful and refreshing and the shipping was pleasant and on time. Great product. Would totally recommend to anyone and buy again.</li>
    <li> Of course I&#x27;ve known for YEARS that I should use a toner..... But the problem was always adding that one more step..... that one more product that was just too much trouble!!!  I tried a few times and they always sat unused and were then tossed out.  Then I stumbled on this toner while researching and reading reviews for Poppy&#x27;s Vitamin C serum and decided to try it.  Well guess what??  NOW I practically never NOT use a toner.  Its totally the SCENT!!!...  I am in love with it!!!  .....  I feel hydrated and refreshed when I use this , and somehow it just makes me smile!!  If you are like me, and have trouble adding a toner to your regime.... this really is the answer~~</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but had to write one on this product. Fantastic and will definitely order this rose water again!!</li>
    <li> This rosewater has a foul odor. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long, but so far it seems to be doing what it is supposed to do. The scent is very nice and I&#x27;m sure I wil be reordering. I am also looking at other products that I want to try.</li>
    <li> Very nicely scented and it tones my skin well.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is I don&#x27;t see how a bottle will last 6 month tho.</li>
    <li> This is the best rose water ever because of the heavenly fragrance that other rose waters I have ordered in the past did not have. Your product is one that I shall order again and recommend to my family and friends. Thank you so much. I love how my skin feels and glows.</li>
    <li> this rose water is fabulous! Leaves skin very very soft. It shows that it is very good product. I recommend this. other probe had not been satisfied.</li>
    <li> I read stellar reviews on the Internet of all the product line and was especially interested in the pose water toner.  I believe reviews said it had anti-inflamatory properties.  The price was right and although the bottle was smaller than I thought it would be, I realized a little goes a long way.  I use it twice daily on a slightly dampened cotton round.  I do not experience any tingling or dryness to my normal to dry aging skin.  I do love the very light fragrance. I take very good care of skin and can recommend this product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this water! It smells great and leaves my face feeling so refreshed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a while now and I&#x27;m still thrilled with the feel it leaves me with, clean and ready to start my day! Great product to take away some of the oiliness in the afternoon as well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, very glad I did some research and found this toner.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Quite pricey for the small bottle, but I guess you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve bought other brands that didn&#x27;t smell as pure as this.</li>
    <li> Very nice fresh scent and refreshing tonic for face and hair.  I use before putting on moisturizer day and night and have seen smoother skin and smaller pores.</li>
    <li> This toner is amazing! It smells like roses &amp; is very delicate! I skin looks &amp; feels amazing!</li>
    <li> work really well.&lt;br /&gt;Better than &amp;#34;Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My skin  feel soft and  comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Even if more money than that.&lt;br /&gt;But value for money. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite like the smell..unpleasant. .</li>
    <li> Smells great, and is a gentle toner. I have oily skin, and I use this in combination with oil cleansing method to clean my face, and it has helped my skin a lot. It feels very soothing to put on. Would definitely recommend, if you are wanting to add Rose Water to your beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> So refreshing, smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, wonderful wake me up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing on skin; I feel it has helped even out my skin tone.  Since starting this product, my face is looking great!</li>
    <li> I have been using the rose water after I cleanse my face.  The application takes away that tight feeling caused by cleansing.  I really love it and would recommend it to all.  The scent is very light.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a product junkie,  I will and have tried anything. But now I&#x27;m transitioning to cruelty free products that don&#x27;t test on animals. (If you&#x27;ve ever seen what goes into that and you have a soul,  you too will never want to use anything that tests on animals.) Anyway,  I&#x27;ve used every toner under the sun from expensive department store and cosmesuetical lines to drug store stuff. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m also doing an experiment where I try to let my skin breath at night (no heavy night creams or serums) after I wash my face. Now I just swipe on some of this fabulous rose water post cleanse and that&#x27;s it.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry or tight at all and my skin has never looked better. I will definitely order more from this company.</li>
    <li> Love it. I see a difference in my skin the following day. Now it has been two weeks and its looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Best rose water toner on web so far,  I&#x27;m Moroccan and know it doesn&#x27;t get purer than this, thanks ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samir</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s amazing!! It makes my skin feel great, brightens my complexion and it smells great!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it feels so good and I add it to my serums and lotions for a great feeling</li>
    <li> This product is of the best quality. In one week my face feels great. Skin is tighter and pores are smaller. It&#x27;s 100% natural and feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> Nice product! Has a soft pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry.  Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> This rose water is really good and it helps with my oily skin and blemish.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a Poppy Austin product.  I have looked far and wide to find rose water, with no luck.  I take that back,  the few I found smelled awful.  When the product smells bad it&#x27;s not something I want to put on my face.  Poppy Austin rose water toner smells wonderful and it feels wonderful on my face.  If you are reading this, please give this rose water a try, you will be delightfully surprised.</li>
    <li> I ordered few different rose water at the same time to see which one works best. This one was by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Just little pricey. So I can not use it often. Wish it was little cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about week now and I enjoy the clean feeling after using it.  I use it twice a day and I appreciate that the money spent is paid forward to help others.  Solid buy!</li>
    <li> It has what it says. I got it because I have acne prone skin and my skin loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was good. No complains. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for !</li>
    <li> This toner leaves my skin feeling very smooth &amp; clean with no irritation and a light scent.</li>
    <li> So far I really enjoy this product, the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is just that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if I will see any changes in my skin. I was having difficulty with combination skin, am in my early forties so seeing fine lines and some blemishes popping up. I am hoping this product will be a nice, clean organic alternative to calm my skin down a bit. So far it has a very nice scent, feels clean and hydrating on the skin and has not caused any breakouts or problems.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product! Makes my face feel like a rose petal:)</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, non irritating, skin looks fresh!  Poppy Austin is the best company around!</li>
    <li> Simply love this product, smells beautiful, will be reordering when the item runs out. Very please with the service also.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it.  Wonderful natural fragrance!</li>
    <li> I like the product, and use it every night before bed. It does have a weird scent that is taking some time to get used to. I am using a different toner during the day, because the smell bothers me enough that it&#x27;s distracting when I&#x27;m awake. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at night.</li>
    <li> This product is Legit and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful, not too heavy, natural scent. I decanted it into a spray bottle and use it to mist my face after applying makeup, or any time I want to lift my spirits. It&#x27;s especially nice on long flights to combat dry cabin air.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! But it did nothing for my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toner, highly recommended.  Light rose scent is pleasant.</li>
    <li> Love it, will get it again.</li>
    <li> This smells like fresh roses everytime I use it...very clean and does wonders for my skin</li>
    <li> lovely fragrance...wonderful for your face</li>
    <li> BUT...you really have to saturate your cotton pad to cover your face so you go through it really quickly. It does help tone your face and leaves it really soft. I would buy it again, unless I find something just as good but cheaper.</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve given this product 5 stars but the packaging is not good. The bottle was only about half way full due to leakage during transport. POPPY AUSTIN you need to do better with your packaging, especially since this has been mentioned over and over in the reviews. The product itself does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This toner is superior to others I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my skin feeling dewey and soft like rose petals. This was a great buy. I would expect to pay more for this kind of quality.</li>
    <li> Oh I really love this stuff. I swear the very first day I used it I could feel a difference. Like all the pores in my face going aaaaah. Since then I can see a difference as well. My pores are smaller and clearer, and it makes my skin feel relaxed and soft. This toner was the only thing my regimen really needed to be truly effective. Plus I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this rose water. I use it after ever time I wash my face. It adds moisture, makes my skin feel soft, and I love the light smell. Will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> I chose a five star because this is the real thing. My skin feels and looks great after using this product for a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed because it is a lot less expensive than other products being sold which have unsafe chemicals and additives which disrupt women&#x27;s hormones.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that part of the profit goes to the Moroccan women&#x27;s collective who make the product.&lt;br /&gt;Let us see their faces.</li>
    <li> i love this toner. feels great going on, and leaves your face fresh, and non-greasy moisturized. i put it in a spray bottle to set my makeup. works great!</li>
    <li> The most soothing rose water, I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff my face feels amazing and refreshed after I use it the smell is amazing I have used a lot of different products and this is by far the best</li>
    <li> I use this religious now. I use this along with glycerin at night. Wow! It leaves my face feeling refreshed at night. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and it is soon refreshing  in a hot day .  Keeps my skin clear and the oil down. I&#x27;m on my second bottle so that should tell you something... Im so ready to order a couple more bottles for my supply!</li>
    <li> I have just purchased my second bottle of this Rose Water.  My hairstylist told me that rose water helps your hair grow faster, so I searched for one on Amazon.  I found this one from Poppy Austin and liked that is was organic.  So I ordered it.  I LOVE to use it on my face after I wash it and I spray it in my hair after I wash it, or even when I wet it down.  I don&#x27;t know if it really helps my hair grow faster, but I know it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I truly love it.  The smell is gorgeous, like a real rose.  It doesn&#x27;t have that sickly sweet smell like synthetic rose-scented products have.  It smells beautiful and real!&lt;br /&gt;I put it in a mini-spray bottle so I can spritz it on, it feels very glamorous!  I also like that it comes in a glass bottle with a pretty pink label, very lovely!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, a must try. 100% pure of awesomeness.</li>
    <li> Thank you. This rose water is glorious.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very softening for skin and has a beautiful smell. I use it after my moisturizer and also after my makeup is on.</li>
    <li> I have extremely strange skin. I have an oily T zone but just after washing and scrubbing my face, it will continue to peel off dry patches. It&#x27;s just so strange. The texture changed in my skin and it was driving me up the wall. No matter how much I scrubbed it just kept peeling. I read reviews of people having used rose water to help with dry skin and I wanted to try it. I received it on the date specified in my order and put it into a spritzer bottle so that I would not be wasting any of it on a cotton ball. I spray it on immediately after showering, before my beauty routine and after it&#x27;s soaked in I spray again and as its drying I put on the rest of my moisturizers. This for some reason has helped my skin to hold in more moisture it seems. My skin looks more radiant, instead of looking blah and like I could possibly be sick or something, it brings out a light or something. I just look healthy without even trying. My skin loves this stuff. My skin has slowed down on the peeling and as long as I scrub it daily as usual, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue. This stuff also smells just like roses, like real roses. It&#x27;s like shoving a real plant under your nostrils. My grandmother used to grow roses and this smells just like them. I can&#x27;t find roses with the smell of roses anymore as it&#x27;s been bred out of all of them. I love this stuff and will continue to purchase more as I get closer to running out. I hope the prices don&#x27;t get raised, it&#x27;s already at a decent price but more than most rose waters. I don&#x27;t like having to look for new products once I&#x27;ve found one I love.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, you don&#x27;t have to use a lot(will last for a while). pure, no other stuff added, I like that. I use after cleansing and before vit C serum.&lt;br /&gt;Have never used any rosewater before, so am hoping that it tones, freshens, calms, cleans and does all that good stuff to my skin!</li>
    <li> I mixed this with vegetable glycerin as a toner I use daily.  It works great.  I have been using this combination with the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum and went all winter without dry patches around my nose, this is the first time in 20 years I haven&#x27;t had this problem in the winter! (I&#x27;m 36)</li>
    <li> Love this toner. Smells like rose water and leaves your skin feeling supple.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells amazing</li>
    <li> I love this all natural rose water toner. I use it after shower, then VC serum, then organic moisturizer. It feels so good. I will buy it for my mom and my sister in law and believe they will like it.</li>
    <li> Very soothing toner, especially around the eyes, dry areas and does not aggravate my acne.  It does leave a deep scent that lingers on throughout the day, but you know that it is working and is made from the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...i&#x27;m a little embarrassed, but after using this product for about three weeks, my acne has started up.  For the first week or two, my skin seemed to improve, but after longer use I think the anti-inflammatory aspects of the water may have been too strong for my type of skin, asian, sensitive, acne prone.  I would use it on areas where I don&#x27;t have breakouts and it works just fine but beware for those who may have similar skin type on using this for their acne.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  I love the smell of this product!  It is very refreshing splash on your face on a hot summer Day!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  So pure and in my price range!  I also appreciate how much attention is given to sustainably sourced high level products.  I&#x27;ve been back several times and am very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I had this Witch Hazel routine for over 2 years. However, it made my skins dry. Long story short, I searched for a hydrating facial toner. Came across Rose Water and I absolutely LOVE IT! I cannot see my self using any other toner. Only downside is that this bottle is small and I use a lot of it. Pretty pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Feels so good on my face. Lovely smell!!</li>
    <li> This product is just awesome! I have used many different type toner but my face always feel dry even after apply them. BUT that feeling gone once I switch to this AMAZING Rose Water Facial Toner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about what I put on my face. My skin is dry and flaky around the nose and chin but really oily on my forehead. I have wrinkles and acne, so I was looking for a product to help with both. This stuff is amazing! My skin feels refreshed, and I feel good about the ingredients. I&#x27;m hoping to see more results in the future as I have only used it for a short time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff !!! My fave is so clear . Wish I had found this gem earlier</li>
    <li> I started using Poppy Austin products on a whim. I thought the price was too good to be true but the reviews were so positive that I decided to give their products a shot. SUCH a great move. I really like everything I&#x27;ve used so far, but this toner might be my favorite. It&#x27;s not too harsh, smells great, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I recommend putting it in a spray bottle and spritzing your face after cleansing. It helps balance and calm down my often irritable skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This makes a great toner.  I fill a small spray bottle and take it to the beach to refresh my face. The smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> This toner not only smells amazing (like fresh rose petals) but it works beautifully on my face leaving it well hydrated with reduced redness. The delicate rose scent lingers gently on my skin which I just love. Not harshly fragranced just a nice soft natural rose scent that is heavenly. I had been wanting to purchase and try this product for a while and I&#x27;m so glad I finally did! Easily my most favorite toner that I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;ll be continuing to order more for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> Definitely calms my skin. I am not sure if I have combination skin or normal skin. I still get break outs and I&#x27;m 26, but usually they are small and easy to deal with. When using this product I&#x27;ve noticed an overall cleaner appearance in my face. The dark spots I used to have from recently resolved acne seem to clear up much faster than before the use of this product.</li>
    <li> Ummm wow! This stuff is amazing. It hydrates wonderfully and it calmed my skin down significantly. I am doing a home glycolic peel every week for 6 weeks and coupled with this--my skin has turned around. It may seem expensive but you have only one face! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Highly reccommend this company.  All of the items have been of superior quality.  I particularly appreciate the simple label, it looks clean and professional.</li>
    <li> i love the rose water! my skin condition got worse after i went to college. i guess it has something to do with my sleep patterns. i did not go to sleep at 11 since then. and my skin is not as smooth and soft as it used to be. i&#x27;ve tried lancome&#x27;s genifique and perricone&#x27;s blue and cold plasma, but i think i don&#x27;t really need those at such a young age so i did not see the significant effects. anyway, this summer, i changed to the rose water(i&#x27;m a fan of all kinds of rose products) together with elizabeth arden visual difference cream and they worked so well together! i have very sensitive and dry skin. right now my face is soft again, just like in middle school. i&#x27;m so happy with this rose water. also, i apply rosehip oil before i go to sleep and that helps a lot too!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product &amp; will forever use this brand. I use as my daily toner along with their 100% Organic Argan Oil. I have to say that I saw results within a week of using the product twice daily as my regimen. My pores are smaller around my nose, my skin is softer &amp; luminous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 44 y/o African American woman &amp; I&#x27;ve never had a bad complexion before, just the occasional hormonal breakout in the T-zone area.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks &amp; feels wonderful &amp; my breakouts have almost disappeared entirely.</li>
    <li> the aroma is rich, soothing. using this has become one of my favorite habits.</li>
    <li> I have never used a toner before. I felt it was unnecessary and a waste of money. I decided to try this one since the Poppy Austin brand is the best I have found. I won&#x27;t ever be without it. Feels wonderful, and once again, &#x27;right.&#x27;</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this toner to me to help with my rosacea, and I could not be happier with it!  The first thing I noticed was the delicate rose scent.  It smelled like I had my nose stuck in a beautiful rose, ahhh!  Due to my rosacea, my skin is very sensitive and most products tend to irritate it.  This rose water toner is so gentle on my skin that it has never irritated it, and immediately after using it my skin was noticeably softer.  After several weeks of using the toner both morning &amp; evening my skin is looking &amp; feeling the best it has ever been.  I&#x27;ll be using this product for a LONG time to come!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, very refreshing, leaves skin soft and smooth. A fabulous treat to yourself. ☺️</li>
    <li> I ordered this after looking everywhere to find a rose water toner that used real rose water instead of water mixed with rosehip oil. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now, and just have a few thoughts I wanted to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;ve been using this at least once a day, if not twice, since I received it in mid-October, and I&#x27;m only 1/3rd of the way into the bottle, so while it&#x27;s pricey, it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I use it after washing my face in the morning, and it&#x27;s a light and gentle toner that doesn&#x27;t leave any weird feelings on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The product description and other online resources mentioned how rose water toner can be good for the skin by soothing inflammation, removing blackheads, and unblocking/tightening stubborn pores. These were exactly the reasons why I decided to switch to this toner, but after 2 months of daily use, I have yet to see any such results. This toner doesn&#x27;t reduce the redness of my skin or unblock my pores any better than my $3 bottle of witch hazel toner I used to use. (If it helps, I have combination skin with large pores and acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Like a few other reviewers have mentioned, the toner smells delicious in the bottle, but once I put it on my skin, the scent changes to something weird. And unlike my witch hazel, this scent lingers for a few hours. It&#x27;s not due to being mixed with other fragrances/products b/c I&#x27;ve used it on completely clean skin with no other products on, and the smell happens as soon as it&#x27;s poured out. It smells fine in the bottle, but not outside of it. The smell hasn&#x27;t changed in my 2 months of using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these two reasons, I&#x27;ve deducted 2 stars from my review. My experience with the seller was excellent. Hope this helps anyone considering this item!</li>
    <li> I love my rose water toner. It&#x27;s a perfect way to clean my face or apply before my Retinol and Aragon Oil. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> love this product and it feels so great after I use it  love it and will reorder will I run out  thanks</li>
    <li> Finest product for taking care of the skin and with Amazon excellent service.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Very gentle and effective on my sensitive skin. I will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Bigger bottle needed. Great toner!</li>
    <li> 2/16 - This is an update to my old reviews for this rosewater.  I&#x27;m on my 6th bottle of it.  Used from a fine misting sprayer, I&#x27;ve gone through 6 bottles in 15 months.  Each bottle is lasting a little over 2 months?  Nice stuff.  Continue to be happy with the results.  Continue to be delighted with how it calms itchy allergic eyes.  Lovely smell, tightens the pores, and improves the texture of the skin.  I&#x27;m 60 years old and have been working outdoors most of my life.  There is no product that will erase the life I&#x27;ve lived from my face.  This is a very nice product and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.  Thanks !    12/14 - This is my first use of any kind of rose water for a facial toner.  I put it in a fine misting bottle.  I like it.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is notably better than the Aveda product that I&#x27;ve been using for years, but it is just as good, and somewhat different.  Cleaner, no residue after it dries, does tighten the pores a teeny bit, smells nice, not too strong....a little bit vinegary, but only slightly....the rose scent outdoes the &amp;#34;steeped&amp;#34; odor, and the odor does not linger after it dries on the skin.  My plan is to keep track if my skin improves over time using this over a traditional toner.  Remains to be seen.  But a nice product, nicely packaged, the glass bottle is good, and I like to purchase from producers who have a conscience.  I will buy it again, as it will likely take some time to decipher if it improves the condition of my skin with regular use over time. 5/26/15 - Update - I&#x27;m now on my third bottle of this rosewater, using it as a facial toner from a misting bottle.  I like it very much.  I&#x27;m not sure that it has made any remarkable difference in my skin, but then again, I am 60 yrs old and no product can reverse time.  It does leave my skin feeling nice with every use, and I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to the smell and really like it a lot.  It is not as expensive as the Aveda toner I had been using for years, and it feels much nicer on my skin.  ALSO, since the beginning of the summer allergy season, I&#x27;ve noticed A BIG PLUS  with this product!!  - I have problems with allergy eyes, and misting my closed eyes with this rosewater mist relieves the itch and burning of allergy eyes !!!  What an unexpected gift!!  I do recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as they keep making it.  Thank you !!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with product and seller</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a week and my skin is smoothing out, I&#x27;m also on antibiotics so it&#x27;s difficult to gauge if it&#x27;s the rose water or not, but my skin has never been this good even with antibiotics before. So there you go...</li>
    <li> Smells just like roses.  I put four fingers tightly together and pour a little on fingers then pat it all over my face.  I then apply the Rosehip Oil.  They are working very nicely to hydrate my mature skin.</li>
    <li> Item arrived before arrival date. The Rose Water scent is lovely and it does absorb in my facial skin quickly. It is an expensive item, but on Amazon it is reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love it, so refreshing and delicate on the skin</li>
    <li> It cools soothes,cleans and moisturizes. Love this toner!</li>
    <li> This rose water is lovely. It smells wonderful. I have sensitive skin and this is a wonderful toner. I put it in a spray bottle and mist my freshly washed face. It makes my pores tighten and my skin look smoother. It has made me curious about her other products. I wish she made a cleanser.</li>
