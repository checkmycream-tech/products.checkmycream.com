      <li>Does a great job protecting against humidity.</li>

      <li>I bought some Frizz Ease and that works great.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing hairspray at all to be honest!</li>
      <li>I gotta say that I understand the not so good reviews.</li>
      <li>Does a good job in damp weather</li>
      <li>When a product is this good</li>
      <li>I would imagine this would be a good product for those \\&quot;Curly</li>
      <li>I have been very satisfied with this hair product and would recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>So glad to see this in stores now!</li>
      <li>I ordered two cans because I was sure it would work!</li>
      <li>this product will prevent the frizzies caused by the weather - love it!</li>
      <li>Well, the day started out fairly warm.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful, my hair will remain bone straight for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It could be that this does become tacky if you use another kind of hair product.</li>

      <li>I can style my hair and my hair has stayed nice looking.  </li>

      <li>Great product, does exactly as stated!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so many hairsprays that promised anti-frizz/anti-humidity etc etc</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started using this when I wear my hair curly, and it keeps curl better without frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I believe there is something better.</li>
      <li>Like many women I suffer from out of control hair that is effected by humidity, rain, lake air, ocean air,etc.</li>
      <li>I bought this stuff before going to the Grand Prix on Belle Isle in Detroit a couple weeks ago.</li>
      <li>If you need hold, you need to give a spritz of your favorite holding hair spray, in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love all of their products</li>
      <li>I REALLY LOVE this hair spray.</li>
      <li>Weather Proof Spray is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t judge, lol I let my hair rest on weekends to prevent over drying and to allow natural oils to be replenished.</li>
      <li>Good product just don&#x27;t like to have to saturate my hair so much</li>
      <li>(I have baby fine hair).  </li>
      <li>and it was fine.</li>
      <li>It would have been easier to take my $13.00 and light a match to it.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so nice to have the option to not always have stick straight hair in the summer</li>
      <li>My hair never frizzes and looks great even the next day - or two.</li>
      <li>I have used this now a few times and find it works best when I wash my hair in the evening.  </li>
      <li>I spray it lightly all over my hair and then use my fingers to pull it through.</li>
      <li>it really is fabulous, but you have to understand what it is.</li>
      <li>The hairspray, without drying too quickly and becoming tacky, somehow made the missed waves and flyaways (after heat styling) simply smooth and disappear.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this product as a number of people recommended to me.</li>
      <li>My scalp get real hot and sweats so there is no hope for that</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and will continue to try more Sexy Hair products in the future.</li>
      <li>I was able smooth and pull straight the missed waves in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have a closet full of hair products for &amp;#34;anti frizz&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff so much</li>
      <li>Pretty cool!</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re a hair type like mine, susceptible to humidity and extremely wavy, this is a great spray.</li>
      <li>This product is great, will use when I travel to southern states with high humidity.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited by the promises it made and by some of the positive reviews I read.</li>
      <li>There are good days and bad days for my hair but definitely more good using this product.</li>
      <li>and it sets the curl most of day and completely feels &amp; acts like no spray in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It is not a typical spray, but more of a treatment.</li>
      <li>Smells good and left my hair feeling soft!</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair in a sub-tropical climate  - and most of the time I wear it straight.</li>
      <li>Thanks for this product!</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing!  </li>
      <li>The next time I used it I used A LOT more</li>
      <li>and I have a lot of hair, so the underneath was pretty damp, but my hair never grew.</li>
      <li>The reviews were all good, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the odor to continue using it.</li>
      <li>If I could get past being ocd about being clean, I&#x27;m sure I could go longer; It does NOT make your hair look greasy.</li>
      <li>Really does protect from humidity and frizz, to my surprise.</li>
      <li>Stays through humidity, sweat, anything really.</li>
      <li>but it does really work.  </li>
      <li>and my hair stayed bone straight.</li>
      <li>I have straight hair and by the time I get to work</li>
      <li>It is naturally straight, but in a sort of frizzy way.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended this product and it really works well for me.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and tends to get greasy and flat super fast, especially in humid Louisiana weather.</li>
      <li>, this has got a light yet quickly absorbing oil, so this doesn&#x27;t dry or feel tacky.</li>
      <li>, I live in the south in a very humid state.</li>
      <li>I live in South Florida and it is very humid here.  </li>
      <li>My hair has NEVER stayed curled or wavy in the humidity where I live and now it does thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my hair light and my roots dry.</li>
      <li>I use Big Sexy Hair spray on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>I use a protecting spray when I iron it, then finish my head off with a decent amount of this stuff.</li>
      <li>it was ok pricey pricey for such a tiny bottle and did not work at all</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly/wavy, but I prefer it styled straight.</li>
      <li>I love this for when i curl my hair, because it always go limp by lunch time</li>
      <li>Normally, the moisture makes my hair start to revert, but it didn&#x27;t with this product.</li>
      <li>I normally straighten my hair but after a workout, my hair looks like a battlefield had just occurred.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. Florida has surprise summer storms almost every afternoon. With naturally wavy hair, my tresses start to curl in the slightest bit of moisture. I actually went outside when it was all misty and my hair stayed bone straight. I use this with OGX flat iron spray and the combo it 100% humidity proof.</li>
    <li> If you live in a foggy, misty, drizzly part of the world like I do (San Francisco) this product will prevent the frizzies caused by the weather - love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Literally went outside in the pouring rain and no frizz! Smells good and left my hair feeling soft! First product in a long time I&#x27;m obsessed with</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff before going to the Grand Prix on Belle Isle in Detroit a couple weeks ago. I knew it was going to be humid and I knew that my hair wouldn&#x27;t stand a chance. Well, the day started out fairly warm. I was sweating.. and I have a lot of hair, so the underneath was pretty damp, but my hair never grew. Then, out of nowhere, clouds rolled in and it started to rain. I thought I was done for. It rained off an on for a few hours and even soaking wet, my hair did not get out of control until it started to dry on its own-- and that&#x27;s only because my hair has a natural curl that I straighten when styling and that curl started coming back! If it wasn&#x27;t for the rain, my hair would have been perfect all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff so much, I&#x27;m buying my second bottle right now.</li>
    <li> I have a closet full of hair products for &amp;#34;anti frizz&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m throwing them all out.&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found one that actually works. And works well.  I have fine thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even the slightest humidity turns my head into a puff ball. Not anymore. So happy!!</li>
    <li> If you live in a humid area, this is the best hair spray around.  Curls keep, hair doesn&#x27;t frizz.  Thank you</li>
    <li> This really helps on those SoCal nights when the beach fog gets a little too much and turns my hair into cotton candy. So glad to see this in stores now!</li>
    <li> My scalp get real hot and sweats so there is no hope for that HOWEVER, for the rest of my hair this held beautifully and I didn&#x27;t even need hairspray (which I try to avoid like the plague). It held for the day of and TWO DAYS after! Don&#x27;t judge, lol I let my hair rest on weekends to prevent over drying and to allow natural oils to be replenished. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE this hair spray. It&#x27;s not as sticky as traditional hair sprays because it has water-resistant properties to help your hair fight the humidity and I do think it works well. Notice how I said &amp;#34;resistant&amp;#34; because the spray doesn&#x27;t completely block out the humidity. I normally straighten my hair but after a workout, my hair looks like a battlefield had just occurred. In other words, it starts curling like crazy but this spray helps to reduce those curls so it looks more like a wavy style. Again, very nice product!</li>
    <li> I gotta say that I understand the not so good reviews. It&#x27;s for that reason I often think they should label ideal hair targets on merchandise. I know that&#x27;s probably silly, though. However, this could be too heavy for some hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re a hair type like mine, susceptible to humidity and extremely wavy, this is a great spray. Not only does it smooth and define my naturally extremely wavy, poofy hair, but after I&#x27;d straightened my hair, this product smoothed it down without drying it out. I was able smooth and pull straight the missed waves in my hair. The hairspray, without drying too quickly and becoming tacky, somehow made the missed waves and flyaways (after heat styling) simply smooth and disappear. It did the same on my natural waves on days when I didn&#x27;t heat style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I live in the south in a very humid state. I went out and came back feeling as if I&#x27;d been drenched in water. Normally, the moisture makes my hair start to revert, but it didn&#x27;t with this product. Neither the moisture in the air, nor the sweat on my back made my hair reverse back to wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this has got a light yet quickly absorbing oil, so this doesn&#x27;t dry or feel tacky. This, however, is probably subjective and will depend on the type of hair products people use. This is probably why it didn&#x27;t work for everyone. It could be that this does become tacky if you use another kind of hair product. Me, I just used protein leave in conditioner, followed by hair serum; then the hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for as long as they make it! Just awesome!</li>
    <li> It worked very well for a few hours but towards the end of the night my hair started to flip and curl again. The next time I used it I used A LOT more and it was fine. Good product just don&#x27;t like to have to saturate my hair so much</li>
    <li> I do hair for bridal parties and this is a must have in my book! I love all of their products this one is really great for summer time weddings and humid days.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical . . . but it does really work.  I love this for when i curl my hair, because it always go limp by lunch time (I have baby fine hair).  I would imagine this would be a good product for those \\&quot;Curly Girls\\&quot; out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  know I won&#x27;t be going with out this in the summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a little test on this, I sprayed a index card with this product (front and back) and threw it in a bowl of water.  Even after 3 hours the card had no water soaked in.  Pretty cool!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stop my hair from frizzing.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I am still on the search for a product that truly stops my hair from falling when I walk outside on a Florida morning, The humidity here is terrible and finding the right product to combat it is an ongoing process. This works but I believe there is something better. I am on the fence about buying this again because the can is very small. I also have to use it in addition to hairspray. I am trying to find one product that will hold and combat humidity.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was introduced to this product by a stylist at a blow-bar. It preserved my blow-out until the next washing. I have super long, thick, coarse, wavy hair (read: BIG). I flat iron it all the time and live in Texas where we have 100% humidity. Since using this spray I can now go longer in between flat ironing sessions because the spray works. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It would have been easier to take my $13.00 and light a match to it.  Can&#x27;t return because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;flammable&amp;#34;?  It is &amp;#34;AIR in a can&amp;#34;, no stickiness whatsoever to this product.  I live in a rainy, moist climate and was &amp;#34;suckered&amp;#34; into this product.  Redken should be ashamed to have this product on shelves.  I will be extremely careful when ordering anything sketchy from Amazon in the future.  If I bought locally, I could have exchanged it for something else that is useful. I normally like Redken, but this spray...HUGE failure!</li>
    <li> I have used this now a few times and find it works best when I wash my hair in the evening.  Does not completely get rid of the fluffy hair but its more manageable then it was before.  I can style my hair and my hair has stayed nice looking.  There are good days and bad days for my hair but definitely more good using this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and tends to get greasy and flat super fast, especially in humid Louisiana weather. I love this stuff. It helps keep my hair light and my roots dry.</li>
    <li> I live in south Louisiana and was just introduced to this product last summer. I will NEVER go through a summer without it! Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still undecided, not because it doesn&#x27;t do what it says, but because I&#x27;m not a fan of&lt;br /&gt;stiff hair. I like, and I don&#x27;t. Really tough call.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as a naturally curly hair person but was amazed after the first humid day we had. Awesome stuff!!</li>
    <li> My hair has NEVER stayed curled or wavy in the humidity where I live and now it does thanks to this product. I love it and it&#x27;s so nice to have the option to not always have stick straight hair in the summer</li>
    <li> Does a great job protecting against humidity. Does not add shine to my hair, so I finish with another product to add the shine. That is the only reason I did not give it a 5. The product that adds the shine does not protect against humidity as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a holy grail product but it is not a holding hair spray! I think every negative review is from people who thought this was a humidty-resistant super hold hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product is, is a product you spray on hair to repel moisture and retain a style from moisture. If you need hold, you need to give a spritz of your favorite holding hair spray, in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is as a finishing touch on my flat-ironed hair. My hair is naturally curly/wavy, but I prefer it styled straight. I use a protecting spray when I iron it, then finish my head off with a decent amount of this stuff. It is wonderful, my hair will remain bone straight for 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it really is fabulous, but you have to understand what it is.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product as a number of people recommended to me. It didn&#x27;t stop my hair from frizzing when I would be in humid conditions at all. I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray that works on my hair no matter what the weather is.  Thanks for this product!</li>
    <li> Does not do anything for texas humidity</li>
    <li> Like many women I suffer from out of control hair that is effected by humidity, rain, lake air, ocean air,etc. I have tried everything there is and in my disappointing search I found this product. I was so excited by the promises it made and by some of the positive reviews I read. I ordered two cans because I was sure it would work! WRONG! It does nothing! Absolutely nothing!  The minute I stepped foot outside if my car by the late, my hair started proofing up, the eventually frizzing. It not only looked bad, but smelled bad as well. The fragrance they chose is horrible.. It&#x27;s indescribable. Why on earth they chose to use it is beyond me. I am by far disappointed in this profits and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and it does help with frizz for her hair.The price was what sold me as it was alot cheaper here.Product came ontime with no problems.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Not worth the $20.00 I paid for it. Just looked at my prior purchases ofvthis same item from other sellers and I only paid $10.00 for it. Beware and compare!</li>
    <li> Really does protect from humidity and frizz, to my surprise. I&#x27;ve used so many hairsprays that promised anti-frizz/anti-humidity etc etc but they&#x27;d either just not work, leave my hair hard as a brick, or make it even frizzier. It doesn&#x27;t leave my extremely thick hair hard to brush through after applying it either, which is a super plus. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing hairspray at all to be honest! Stays through humidity, sweat, anything really. I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and will continue to try more Sexy Hair products in the future.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair in a sub-tropical climate  - and most of the time I wear it straight. (Yes, I know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Weather Proof Spray is fantastic! My hair never frizzes and looks great even the next day - or two. If I could get past being ocd about being clean, I&#x27;m sure I could go longer; It does NOT make your hair look greasy. I even got misted the other day and my hair still looked terrific. I&#x27;ve started using this when I wear my hair curly, and it keeps curl better without frizzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the other review where he/she said this has an odor. I have not noticed that AT ALL. It just smells like any other hair spray type product to me. And no I don&#x27;t work for the company. When a product is this good I make time to review it so it stays around. I might just buy it by the case.</li>
    <li> It does actually work!!!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> it is expensive but I like some of the other versions much better.  The Spray and Play, Spray and Play Harder are my favorites.  This is a very small size for the money and I thought it was too heavy for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Sevice was great and product was as described but I just can&#x27;t get used to the smell of this spray.  The reviews were all good, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the odor to continue using it.</li>
    <li> We have had a lot of humid days this summer and fall, I was so disappointed in this product.  I have straight hair and by the time I get to work it is all frizzy....this product did not work on my hair.  It is no need for me to purchase these products again. I bought some Frizz Ease and that works great.</li>
    <li> it was ok pricey pricey for such a tiny bottle and did not work at all</li>
    <li> Great product, does exactly as stated!  My hair did not friz in the Florida breeze.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have thick, shoulder length hair that is very susceptible to humidity. It is naturally straight, but in a sort of frizzy way. I use hot rollers and usually wear it in loose curls. In the past, I have always had to use a lot of hair spray or my hair would go limp and get very bushy in anything but the driest conditions. My hairdresser recommended this product and it really works well for me. It is not a typical spray, but more of a treatment. I spray it lightly all over my hair and then use my fingers to pull it through. This will last for a couple of days for me without using additional hair spray. It leaves my hair soft, not stiff like some sprays. The bottle is small, but I use so much less of it than I thought I would, that it lasts a long time. Plus Amazon&#x27;s price is a lot less than my hairdresser&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product is great, will use when I travel to southern states with high humidity.  I use Big Sexy Hair spray on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I live in New Orleans, this stuff is a miracle. My hair looks totally different without it!</li>
    <li> Worst hair spray I have ever bought, does not hold hair at all, like air spraying out of can.  Very small can for such a high price.  I live in the South and know all about humidity and this spray is a JOKE!!</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with this hair product and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I live in South Florida and it is very humid here.  This spray keeps my hair in place and I use it when I sit outside at a restaurant.</li>
    <li> Does a good job in damp weather</li>
    <li> Live in CA, dry climate however this spray for &amp;#34;Me&amp;#34; is unbelievable. No buildup and I spray curls before comb out and it sets the curl most of day and completely feels &amp; acts like no spray in my hair.  I used on a trip to Florida, Very Humid, and again it performed unbelievably  even on a cruise to Caribbean.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this did nothing for my hair.  Sorry I wasted my money on it.  I bought it on a recommendation from a friend, maybe my hair is just too thin!</li>
    <li> Was smaller than expected but that was my fault as I didn&#x27;t read the bottle size otherwise from my error the product works great. Perfect for this humidity in Louisiana.</li>
