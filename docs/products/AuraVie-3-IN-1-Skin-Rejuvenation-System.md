      <li>I liked .i</li>
      <li>It hydrates the skin really well and the BEST thing about it, and I can&#x27;t often say this about creams, it is not oily at all.</li>
      <li>NOW I can honestly go two days if I wanted two without washing my face if I don&#x27;t wear make up or am out in the heat.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best for clearing acne-prone skin &amp; evening skin tone!  </li>

      <li>smells great, feels amazing and fresh.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the quick response time of this products arrival.  </li>
      <li>Today the cheapest is $16.00 👎 which is a sweet bargain compared to 120.00 something you pay through auravie website!!</li>
      <li>it &amp;#34;IS&amp;#34; too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>It IS like they say... &amp;#34;IF&amp;#34; it sounds too good to be true..</li>
      <li>I soooo wish I&#x27;d checked this out before the &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; offer got me.</li>
      <li>I wish it covered up my acne more than it does.</li>
      <li>so I was okay with the billing.</li>
      <li>so I was okay with the billing.</li>
      <li>product is nothing more that dish soap for the cleanser.  </li>

      <li>I was pleased with customers service..</li>

      <li>I am enjoying these products.</li>
      <li>You can get a better product cheaper at Wal-Mart</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
      <li>At the beginning of use it was 110% better of skin results and now about 80% but still better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>it was ok.</li>
      <li>Skin care product is ok, not miraculous, but their promotion was deceiving.</li>
      <li>I love the way the products feel on my face, neck and throat.  </li>
      <li>But I am actually glad that happened to</li>
      <li>Dish soap would give me more break outs and a rash.</li>
      <li>love this product thank you</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t not say enough about how amazing this product is!!!!</li>
      <li>I (like so many others) got a $97 charge after the free trial was over.</li>
      <li>My husband loves this product...makes his skin feel soft and great.  </li>
      <li>It really feels good when I put it on.</li>
      <li>People complain too much and don&#x27;t see good in things</li>
      <li>Amazon makes the ordering very easy and quick...</li>
      <li>I found the products to be pleasantly scented, non-greasy, and better than most things I&#x27;ve tried from the big box stores or finer department store cosmetics departments.</li>
      <li>but the results of reduced lines, circles around the eyes, etc is less than impressive.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything was perfect, thanks!</li>
    <li> This product had a bad smell and I ended up throwing it away.  It also made me break out badly.</li>
    <li> I received an Ad for skincare products from AuraVie Skincare for a trial sample. The offer implied a chance to try the products for the cost of shipping.  I was later billed for approx. $97 and sent a 2nd shipment also billed to my credit card for $97+.  I contacted customer service and told them I hadn&#x27;t had time to try the first sample as I&#x27;d been on vacation.  I was told it was too late and I was responsible.  They also claimed that I should have read the fine print that I&#x27;d signed up to receive monthly shipments at this rate.  After complaining and telling the person I&#x27;d return the shipment &amp; dispute the charges he agreed to waive the restocking cost but said I couldn&#x27;t dispute the fees for the sample shipment because I was beyond 30 days.  I found the customer person argumentative, insulting and demeaning.  I finally hung up rather than argue with him or hear further demeaning comments.  (I noticed that on my credit card billing, they use the name MYSKIN 8777437943 CA)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over a year.  We live in New England and this is wonderful for our cold, dry winters!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and it also tends to be a bit red due to having mild Rosacea. I have had to use only Clinique all my life. My sister gave me these AuraVie 3-IN-1 last Christmas and  I was hesitant. On the first time I used it I saw an immediate change. The red calmed down, my face became one tone, the skin was soft but not too much as of to cause pimples, it’s awesome!</li>
    <li> To cancel repeat delivery orders follow directions below and before you buy, check out the business review complaints online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call:  1-866-260-2133&lt;br /&gt;Your order can be canceled online BUT listen closely to the appropriate prompts!  You want to cancel your order entirely, NOT get the offer at a reduced rate.  You will need a pen and paper.  The address to return the product is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AuraVie Skincare Returns Department&lt;br /&gt;PO Box 10465&lt;br /&gt;Van Nuys, Ca.  91410&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get an RMA# at the very end.  LISTEN CLOSELY and WRITE FAST!&lt;br /&gt;The RMA# is computerized and speaks VERY,VERY quickly!!!!  I replayed the message over and over until I was absolutely certain to get the RMA# correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the other part:  The consumer, YOU, pay the return delivery cost.&lt;br /&gt;It must be received by them one month from the phone call.&lt;br /&gt;(The computer will tell you what date that is)&lt;br /&gt;Also, when you return the product (because that&#x27;s the ONLY way you will not be charged), make certain you return it with a Delivery Confirmation Number to secure a way of tracking the return to these RIPOFFS so they don&#x27;t try to rip you off again.&lt;br /&gt;And, lastly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST PRINT THE RMA# CLEARLY ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PACKAGE!  Put this in a corner where postage and delivery strips do not cover it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.  I canceled mine today.&lt;br /&gt;The product is nothing more that dish soap for the cleanser.  The rest of it I wouldn&#x27;t even put on my skin.  I&#x27;ll refrain from what the consistency and the serum smells like.  The third product, I didn&#x27;t touch.&lt;br /&gt;I also knew as soon as I read the 1st 4 ingredients of the cleanser, that they are not who they say they are.  Water, alcohol, witch hazel...&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the product says FRAGRANCE FREE!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s FRANGRANCED alright!  It is FULL of fragrance which told me right away I could not trust the labeling, much less trust the actual product or company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> other products in the AuraVie line and I love them all..thank you for shipping so promptly</li>
    <li> I am not one to make a big deal about face products, but I really love how this makes my skin feel.  I will reorder this because it really is a good product.  Amazon makes the ordering very easy and quick...</li>
    <li> AuraVie was a product i stumbled upon...and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with results. At the beginning of use it was 110% better of skin results and now about 80% but still better than nothing.  ;)</li>
    <li> I got the AuraVie and a product called MiraVie.  The moisturizure from MiraVie is fantastic, but I can&#x27;t find it.  Love the Aura Vie as well Help</li>
    <li> About 2 weeks ago I started using AuraVie 3-in-1 Rejuvention system together with Levela All-in-one anti aging formula and my skin seems to like it. It does not itch or feel like it is caked up. It still feels light, like I&#x27;m wearing no lotion at all, breathable. As far as rejuvenating goes, I&#x27;m not sure yet. Maybe in a few more weeks I should be able to tell a difference or not. I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this company, along with its companion company, Dellure, practices deceptive advertising. I ordered the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; samples of skin products and noticed in the instructions that my card would be billed monthly!  In my mind, that&#x27;s not free. I called the customer service number and was told I should return everything in order not to be charged. I did so, except for two opened containers which are partially used.  I&#x27;ll be watching my bank account carefully to see that I&#x27;m not charged.  I think this is a terrible way to do business, regardless of the effectiveness of the products, or not.</li>
    <li> Interesting that Auravie charges $97 for this system. I was sucked into a &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; for Prime customers, which turned into a monthly subscription charge for the system that I did not authorize. Amazon informed me they had not run a promotion with this company. I am pursuing a refund for the charges, but am very annoyed. Skin care product is ok, not miraculous, but their promotion was deceiving. I use Artistry and like it much better. I certainly wonder why the company charges three times what this offer is.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t not say enough about how amazing this product is!!!! I have oily skin and during my pregnancy I was breaking out so that is when I started looking for something that not only cleansed but helped with my winkles, and stopped my breakouts. This stuff makes my face feel like satin/silk and controls the oil. I use to have to wash my face every night of course, and then right out of bed because my face was so so so oily. NOW I can honestly go two days if I wanted two without washing my face if I don&#x27;t wear make up or am out in the heat. Never in my life have I been able to go that long. I was lucky if I my make up even stayed on all day. Well now my face is clear, and my make up stays fresh all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally tried this product after seeing the infomercial about the free trial. I ended up paying over $100 for it. I canceled the next shipment as that price was not in my budget. Then I found it on here for a shockingly awesome price around 30-40 for all 3 items. The price changes so frequently that you have to check weekly if not more to get the best deal. Last month I paid $7.00!!!!!!!!!! I wasn&#x27;t thinking it would go up much so I didn&#x27;t bother to buy more than 1 but was I so wrong. Today the cheapest is $16.00 👎 which is a sweet bargain compared to 120.00 something you pay through auravie website!! Oh and the cleanser last me over three months. I buy the face cream, and toner gel aroubd every 6 months!!</li>
    <li> love this stuff - especially the serum!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever tried, and I have sensitive skin and prone to adult acne.  After using this product for a month, my acne problem was gone, and naturally, my skin is now smooth.  I have been using this product for almost two years now and still love it.</li>
    <li> I took advantage of an online offer...on a FREEBIES site........I soooo wish I&#x27;d checked this out before the &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; offer got me. It IS like they say... &amp;#34;IF&amp;#34; it sounds too good to be true.. it &amp;#34;IS&amp;#34; too good to be true.  I did receive my &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; products... excited that I also qualified for reduced shipping charges.... and then... next think I know.. I get an over-drawn notice that my card had been used and it had exceeded the amount in my account.&lt;br /&gt;  I have tried calling Aura Vie... I have tried emailing Aura Vie and I EVEN tried to set up an account at the Aura Vie site.. which it will NOT let me do.... so now I have to run into town and file a complaint.... and cancel my old card... so they can&#x27;t continue to send me or BILL ME illegally for shipments I didn&#x27;t agree too.  I have LEARNED my lesson... will no longer look for FREE things... :(  Too bad people like THESE people tear down ones&#x27; faith in people...  THE ONLY REASON IT GETS A ONE STAR IS BECAUSE THEY WOULDN&#x27;T LET ME SUBMIT IT WITHOUT ANY!!!! BOOOOOO! :(</li>
    <li> O&#x27; yes love the set of Skin Rejuvenation System this is my second order. I love, .love the results it gives me. I was not born with a beautiful complexion, and now that I&#x27;m  retired with lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;m fighting aging all the way, and this gives me results of course you do have to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product simply just doesn&#x27;t work. If you do purchase this you are stuck with it. I tried returning and was told it was non refundable</li>
    <li> My sister in law bought me this for Christmas a year ago. I absolutely LOVE this stuff. smells great, feels amazing and fresh. My skin is literally glowing and people ask me all the time what I use. I had to review this because of all the terrible reviews. People complain too much and don&#x27;t see good in things and if they do see the good they won&#x27;t comment. So here is mine I LOVE IT and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your product.&lt;br /&gt;My mother look&#x27;s beautiful, and much look younger then any other women as same age her.</li>
    <li> ... they are upset because they did not read the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot;. It astounds me that people are unaware what a \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; is. It means \\&quot;try it for this long and if you do not send it back you get charged for keeping it\\&quot;. Nothing is ever free in life. Has no one learned this yet?&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Auravie is GREAT for acne-prone and oily skin which is what I have. I cannot speak for anyone but myself, obviously. The cleanser that one woman on here claims is dishwashing liquid is not. In fact, it clears up my break-outs and upon continuous use, stops them all together. Dish soap would give me more break outs and a rash. Hah! Now, the woman who claimed it was dish soap probably found it drying and that is because it it a deep cleanser that exfoliates dead skin and it is imperative that you follow up with the next two steps.... which she did not because she was dramatic about the smell of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The serum smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot;. There is no fragrance ADDED so indeed it is \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;. The serum balances the skin&#x27;s PH back out after the cleanser so you can see why it might be an important step. It also has the Omegas, Vitamins and antioxidants. The cream is the next step which re-moisturizes. It hydrates the skin really well and the BEST thing about it, and I can&#x27;t often say this about creams, it is not oily at all. YOU HAVE TO USE ALL THREE PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. It just is not effective if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Normally if I even look at skin care products I break out with pimples or my skin feels instantly more oily at the very least. AuraVie is, as I stated, GREAT for ACNE PRONE OR OILY skin. My best friend has normal skin and she loves the system.&lt;br /&gt;  Now that said... in my opinion, I can see how AuraVie has the potential to be a bit too much for DRY SKIN that needs a more gentle or hydrating cleansing product. I don&#x27;t know this but I am just assuming that if it is so amazing for oily and acne prone skin that perhaps for dry skin it may be a bit too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  What I can -not- attest to was a difference in the skin around my eyes because I&#x27;ve always used LifeCell around my eye area. I was using LifeCell exclusively all over my face but it can have a tendency lately to break me out if my hormones are going crazy.... AuraVie does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I hope this helps some of you that read reviews to get actual knowledge on the product from someone that actually uses is instead of someone who did not make an Amazon purchase and is made over the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; thing. By the way, I did the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;, knew I&#x27;d be charged as I read the fine print, kept the product, received it for several shippings before I decided to cancel because I did not need it as often. I did not have an issue canceling my shipments at all. It was not a problem. Now I am buying it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Have a good one!be a bit too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  What I can -not- attest to was a difference in the skin around my eyes because I&#x27;ve always used LifeCell around my eye area.

    <li> I have read the reviews of this product.  I sent for the free trial only pay shipping and handling through a &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; website and now I noticed a recurring charge on my credit card of $97.88.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had sufficient time to really tell if the product does what it claims but I too have fallen victim of the &amp;#34;Fine Print&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I have canceled the membership.  If I want to continue this product I would order it on a month by month basis and not as a recurring charge from the company as the price is significantly higher than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> This  is a good  cleaning and facial beauty.  program!&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it has improved my skin and would recommend</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and the texture of the products, but after using it for over a month, I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews on this little set of a Rejuvenation System and for me, well I just have to go against the general opinion and say that I love this product. When I tried the trial version, I was impressed with how porcelain smooth and soft my skin look with no glaring pours on my face. I even had people comment on my skin and I&#x27;m 54 years old! I do agree that their product isn&#x27;t worth what the company is asking for, maybe someone got a bit too big-headed in the company and said &amp;#34;yes ladies &amp; gentlemen, we have a real winner on our hands here, let&#x27;s charge the customers some ungodly amount and we will get it, well because we say that this is what they need and they will go for it once they see the results&amp;#34;. Who knows why they overcharged, I can get it here for a reasonable price and it works just as well. I give the system a 2 thumbs up!  &amp;#62;&amp;#34;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviews that state this product is awful and not worth a penny spent on it.  I heard about it online in a Dr. Oz infomercial and fell for it.  Little to say, I had a hard time cancelling some subscription I did not agree to, and they won&#x27;t refund my money for the one I tried to return and for the so called &amp;#34;free sample.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I sooooo LOVE this product!!! Works Great, and makes your skin so soft, AND works on fine lines and wrinkles!!!</li>
    <li> If you want a real product from legitimate company, try Skin Rejuvenation System by Sutro Lab.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00H29672C B00H29672C]]&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really awesome product for people who seek natural and powerful solutions for various skin issues.</li>
    <li> My skin is the clearest it has ever been.</li>
    <li> I am acne prone since entering my 40&#x27;s, that&#x27;s been 7 years now.  Nothing has worked.  Combining the use of different products complicated things, it showed on my face.  I purchased two different products forgetting which could reduce acne.  This came in the mail first so I went with it.  It is highly recommended that the two creams be mixed then applied.  I did this by pumping and swiping a bit onto my palm.  It covers my face, ears, neck and some of my chest, basically it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne went away too.  It had been two months since seeing my aunt, (2500 miles between us). A funeral made this happen.  A few days into my visit, she asked if I had a face lift, like a lifestyle one.  I laughed and said no, but I will in 10 years if I need one!  Pretty extreme comment but enough for an 80yr. old to ask.  It works.  I am lucky to have olive colored skin so maybe the results in general were better than some critics.  Anyway I logged onto Amazon to order more but was drawn to give my results after reading the negative one.  I&#x27;m sorry for those for whom it didn&#x27;t work out for and I hope you get your monies returned.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and really liked it, but it is fairly expensive so I decided to see if I could find it for less money on Amazon.  I was extremely please that it was available on Amazon and was exactly what I had been using for less cost.</li>
    <li> love this product thank you</li>
    <li> Using it daily and very pleased.!!1</li>
    <li> I cancelled the order on time and tried products the last year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cleaner the best, it lasted almost one year!&lt;br /&gt;The Age-Defying Serum was wonderful, I ran out in three month!&lt;br /&gt;The Cream was clean and feel great on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 58 years old Asian woman, I think these products are great for aging, dry skin, I just ordered a complete set for $30, free shipping.  Don&#x27;t do the free trial that you have to remember cancel, just order the 3-In-1 System for $30, great value for your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference with my skin since I started using this product.  I really enjoy all three of the skin rejuvenation system from AuraView.  I have recommended it to friends.  My husband has noticed a big difference.  I am happy with the quick response time of this products arrival.  I was completely out.</li>
    <li> This team, I call it a team because these work together with vitiamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; creame if you have any questions about this product I suggest you contact the maker of AuraVie. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I like it. You may also AuraVie and speak with them. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works good, better than others. Would recommend to all my friends and family. Made my akin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> They did a great job very happy.</li>
    <li> This leaves your face soft and smooth.  It has helped with fine wrinkles.  I use it twice per day.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I like the results. My wife likes the results. This will be our third purchase of this system. It works for my wife. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I certainly would try it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get caught up in this SCAM!! You will have a monthly charge of $97.88. BEWARE OF THIS SCAM!! The products are not so good, they are ok. You can get a better product cheaper at Wal-Mart</li>
    <li> Recently saw this on my friends Facebook page. Thought I would give it a try. I have bought pricy face cleansers, firming agents, masks, etc &amp; I would have to agree that this is one of the best products I have purchased. My face has less noticible pores, is softer &amp; firmer than before. I have been using about a month so far.</li>
    <li> This is a creepy company that gets your credit card with a low price or small s/h fee for a trail offer.  I&#x27;ve just spent the entire morning fighting them and working with my credit card company to get my money back and block them as a &amp;#34;merchant&amp;#34;  My next call is to Amazon to tell them to stop setting their customers up for fraud.</li>
    <li> I LOVED ALL 3, UNTIL I ENDED UP WITH AN ALLERIC REACTION TO THE SERUM!!  I WILL TRY AGAIN AFTER THE POLLEN IS ALL GONE FROM TREES AND BUSHES.  I HAD BOUGHT IT DURING THE WINTER AND THEY WORKED WELL BUT I THINK THE HEAVY POLLEN IN THE AIR MADE MY SKIN SUPER DRY, SO I WILL TRY AGAIN AFTER POLLEN STOPS. I REALLY LIKE THE SOFT FELL AFTER THE CREAM IN ON THE FACE.</li>
    <li> I like how smooth and clear my skin looks</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  I am enjoying these products.</li>
    <li> so far I like it a lot. I wish it covered up my acne more than it does. It really feels good when I put it on.So this is the second time around and I will see how I feel when this is gone. Thks. Nita Scales</li>
    <li> Makes my skin smooth and feels great</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous facial creams, some very expensive and some not. I immediately noticed a difference with AuraVie. Also love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy from this company. This company has been know as a scam network for the past many years. There are thousand of complaints online about them using your credit card information, WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION OR AUTHORIZATION, to steal money from accounts on a monthly basis, and the worst part about it, they are as silent as a corpse. BIGGEST FRAUDS IN HISTORY. Search on google at least once (about their frauds) before buying their products.</li>
    <li> Great way to start your day by invigorating your face, mood and looks.</li>
    <li> ONLY A FACE LIFT OR LASER CAN GET THE RESULTS THEY ADVERTISE THERE PICS ARE MADE TO LOOK LIKE THE PRODUCT IS WORKING.  DURING OUR SLOWED ECONOMY PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS$$$$$$$$$$$$</li>
    <li> have used in the past and the cost for this was about 1/4 what I had been paying!</li>
    <li> I love this although it is expensive with the company. Amazons prices are a lot better. I do see a big improvement in my face. I will continue to use this product for sure. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  My daughter introduced me to this last November and I was getting low on it&lt;br /&gt;and looked on amazon and found it at an affordable price.  So happy!  I am 78 yrs. young and get all kinds of compliments&lt;br /&gt;on my skin.People keep saying&amp;#34; Whatever you are doing keep it up, you look great!&amp;#34;  I would recommend this to everone,</li>
    <li> I (like so many others) got a $97 charge after the free trial was over. I received three packages with each charge.. Until I canceled any future shipments and charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I ended up with all that I got, I decided to use them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been maybe a year and a half, and I love these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have minor acne, blackheads and such.. But my skin feels lovely.. And my fine lines have slightly diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still quite young. Younger than most of you I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;I still have darkness around my eyes, but mainly due to sleep deprivation from being a mommy. And my neck is firmer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you all can look past the ripoff charge. That&#x27;s just businesses for ya. But I am actually glad that happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Aura Vie. It&#x27;s smells great, is light on your face, not oily, does work to some degree, and doesn&#x27;t make anything worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four out of five stars.</li>
    <li> Good product and delivered on time as scheduled.</li>
    <li> A survey popped up when I went into Amazon so I answered it.  It stated that since I completed the survey I could pick a gift at absolutely no cost not even shipping.  No further obligations.  I chose the AuraVie samples.  A couple weeks later I received a shipment of more products and my credit card had been charged almost $100.00.  As the previous reviewers have stated it is not pleasant going through the process of trying to return the product.  I am absolutely surprised that Amazon does business with the company at all.  They use Amazon&#x27;s name to suck you in and then you are left to clean up the mess.  I would highly suggest that you do not answer any surveys that pop up while you are shopping in Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year. I can see a big difference in my skin. But I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, because I don&#x27;t know how long I can afford this product.</li>
    <li> A survey popped up which I thought legit. This was a scam to get me to order the product. Besides that the products are not good!</li>
    <li> This was GREAT and FAST and the price was WONDERFUL.  AMAZON is my best company!!</li>
    <li> I fell for the phony trial offer. Read the fine print. Do not order this product! This is a scam taking advantage of people that they know will not read the pages of fine print. Do not give them your credit card number. On top of it, it&#x27;s not a special cream and did nothing to improve my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  After a month of usage, my skin has smaller pores, silky feel and moist looking.  It could use a little deeper cleaning effect but well worth the price I paid for these.  I think I look about at least ten years younger in the face.  I will continue to use the products (together) with Levela.</li>
    <li> Did not like product and before I even got a chance another package sent to me a charged. I can not return now two packages.  Very bad and I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon for attaching their name to it.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but well worth the investment, can feel the chemicals doing what they&#x27;re supposed to immediately. the smaller containers could be better if twice the size as even though using sparingly seem to run out of the cosmetic enhancing items faster leaving the skin cleaner with extra. Would be good if producer would package &amp; sell the individual cosmetic ingredients so they could be bought separately. Very pleased with this product, the best I&#x27;ve come across , it does what it says it will compared to the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This was my first antiaging creme I ever tried n  it was ok. I liked .i didnt notice so much difference.but I have got compliments from my family and  friends ,and I had no problem with canceling also I was pleased with customers service..</li>
    <li> I ordered the AuraVie online directly from AuraVie.  I like the product as far as using it but the results of reduced lines, circles around the eyes, etc is less than impressive.  I do not see a change in my skin appearance.  I ordered this as a trial period for $4.95 with a 10 day free trial.  It is impossible to see results in ten days.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying from AuraVie&#x27;s trial period that requires a monthly purchase with a charge to the credit card.  The product is sent automatically. This is explained in the fine print which I did not see until I hit the order button.  I plan to cancel.  This is my personal experience and I used it everyday. I have used AuraVie for over a month.</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T THINK THEIR PRODUCTS TRUSTY BY THE WAY THEY BAIT YOU TO THEIR PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY NEED A THUMB DOWN, BUT WE DON&#x27;T HAVE THAT OPTION. YOU NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM AURAVIE, OTHERWISE, YOUR WALLET WILL BE PICKED.</li>
    <li> No problem with snything. Have used products for several years - work great for me.</li>
    <li> returned, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The product gets 4 stars from me but the company gets negative 2 stars. 6 months ago I purchased this AuraVie system together with another product that was advertised with it called Vivexin eye gel and have been receiving shipments every month. Within about a week of starting to use these products together, I started getting compliments from people out of the blue. Until I got into my late 40&#x27;s I had always gotten a lot of compliments from people saying they thought I was in my 20&#x27;s. But the compliments became much fewer and far between after I turned 46. My skin does feel softer and has more of a youthful glow. The first thing I noticed within days was that my eyelids and brow area were dramatically firmer and the skin under my eyes had become more firm and felt plumper - in a good way. I don&#x27;t know how much of that was from the AuraVie moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using for the eye area or the Vivexin eye gel, but there&#x27;s a definite difference so I&#x27;ve stayed with this combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the Cleanser Toning gel burns my eyes when rinsing my face even when I don&#x27;t use it directly on my eyes. This worried me a little and I don&#x27;t use it on the eye area and is primarily why I only gave it 4 stars. I cleanse my face using this Cleanser Toning gel (wet clarisonic brush, lots of pumps of product on a wet face) but cleanse the eye area with Murad Cleansing cream. Then, after the skin is dry I apply the AuraVie Age-Defying Serum on my face and neck and the Vivexin eye gel on the eye area. Both firm the skin (you have to wait for it) and then I apply the Day/Night Moisturizer all over the face and neck. To be honest, I&#x27;m not 100% sold on this system yet and having a drawer full of products some which cost as much as $200 has tempted me at times to try to incorporate different products... but I don&#x27;t get the same result and keep going back to just using this system in my regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do want to mention that this system is much cheaper here on Amazon than the $97.88 I&#x27;ve been paying monthly by purchasing it direct from AuraVie Skincare. I&#x27;ve emailed them to cancel my auto-shipments and hopefully that will be smoother than some of the understandably disgruntled people who got the \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial offer and didn&#x27;t know they were going to be billed if they didn&#x27;t return it. I also didn&#x27;t notice the fine-print, but I was happy with the results of the product so I was okay with the billing. Unfortunately, the company doesn&#x27;t seem to believe in their product and instead feels the need to deceive people into purchasing it at a very high mark-up under the guise of a \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial - instead of just selling their product based on positive results and good word of mouth. My trust for this company, AuraVie is very low - but if you&#x27;re buying this at the Amazon price, to me it&#x27;s a reasonable price to give it a try. Check out their \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating at the BBB and revoked accreditation for AuraVie. Wow, that&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen that. And instead of addressing it, it looks like they&#x27;ve increased their prices on their website and it shows the system price is now $219.99. I would be very weary of ordering anything on \\&quot;auto-ship\\&quot; from this company.een paying monthly by purchasing it direct from AuraVie Skincare.

    <li> My husband loves this product...makes his skin feel soft and great.  He&#x27;s 76...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the top-of-the-line products to care for my skin, but nothing holds a candle to this AuraVie trio!  Absolutely the best for clearing acne-prone skin &amp; evening skin tone!  I bought my first set in November, and this was a double order!  Wouldn&#x27;t ever want to run out!</li>
    <li> Best product and affordable rice.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Get many compliments!</li>
    <li> After using the product it gave me an instant tight sensation</li>
    <li> Like no other product in the price range.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, my skin never looked or felt so good!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products I have purchased promising &amp;#34;younger looking skin&amp;#34; that has delivered.&lt;br /&gt;Has made a big difference in &amp;#34;plumping the skin&amp;#34; which softens &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;  greatly. I recommend the three&lt;br /&gt;items highly. Cleanser removes make-up in a flash, and leaves skin hydrated. Serum &amp;#34;tightens&amp;#34;. Cream has&lt;br /&gt;a good effect without causing any &amp;#34;break outs&amp;#34; (to which I am prone.) After 6 months use, I DO look a bit younger.</li>
    <li> It feals so good on my skin and its inexpensive and last a while.</li>
    <li> I bought these products directly from Aura Vie and only used them for one week or so before going to a conference.  I think it worked wonders as no person could believe I was over 60 years old.  I love the way the products feel on my face, neck and throat.  It gives me extra assurance.  I use it twice a day, morning and night.</li>
    <li> This works well wqith Kollagen added as the 4th step.; Thank you I can definitely see a difference in my skin after using it.</li>
    <li> I recieved my aura vie 3-in-1 and love it  the best skin care ever; I will tell all my friends about it; Rae ann gielau</li>
    <li> I love this product. I suffer from oil skin so it&#x27;s hard for me to find a product that won&#x27;t make my face even oilier. Even face wash makes my face oil.</li>
    <li> Product was as specified and delivery time was exact as guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th 3-in-1 system and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I first purchased AuraVie through a &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; offer. I did not opt for the automatic shipment provision, but did keep the products they sent me, although I did find the price a bit high (almost twice what Amazon is now charging) However, I really liked the product. The cleanser/toner did a nice job of cleaning my 60 year old skin without drying it out, the serum was refreshing, and the Replenish moisturizer was cool and soothing. I actually did notice improvements to my face after using the products regularly for about 3 weeks. However, the subscription price was way over my budget and outside my common sense. With it being available through Amazon at under $18 I&#x27;ll start using it again. The reviewer who said it smelled bad and was mainly dish soap should not be relied upon; it was obvious she was just angry that she hadn&#x27;t read the fine print about the offer of a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; trial. I found the products to be pleasantly scented, non-greasy, and better than most things I&#x27;ve tried from the big box stores or finer department store cosmetics departments.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 2 years ago. I was fully aware of the &amp;#34;TRIAL.&amp;#34; However, I forgot to cancel 3 months in a row. Best choice I ever made. My skin is sensitive to EVERYTHING except these products. I swear by this product, my skin improved drastically. I get compliments and questions all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I was attacked 6 years ago and the stress of it all aged me quick. This product reversed it. A 1 month supply lasted me 4 months because I use everything in moderation on my face. Oh by the way. I&#x27;m a close to middle age black woman with oily brown skin if that helps any.</li>
