      <li>Thank you for having it available.</li>

      <li>I TRIED MANY PRODUCTS THAT SAY THEY ARE SAFE FOR SENSITIVE SCALPS</li>
      <li>PLEASE CLAIROL MAKE LOVING CARE NATURAL INSTINCTS AGAIN.</li>
      <li>CLAIROL LOVING CARE NATURAL INSTINCTS</li>
      <li>This is a mild dye that washes out in  5 or 6 shampoos.  </li>
      <li>This hair colour is an excellent choice for those who do not want to use a harsh dye or are apprehensive about too much dye/chemical being absorbed through the scalp.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for several years before it was discontinued and was very satisfied with the way it colored my hair</li>
      <li>And when it does come out, and even though I let it sit several minutes, most of the product washed out immediately!</li>
      <li>B001FZMXOU Clairol Loving Care Hair Color Crème Lotion 78 Medium Golden Brown]]fades all over gradually over several weeks</li>
      <li>CLAIROL LOVING CARE PRODUCTS ARE THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT A PERSON WITH AN ALERGIC REACTION TO HAIR DYE CAN USE.  </li>
      <li>All of us Loving Care users should write to Clairol and demand that they bring back this product.</li>
      <li>Very natural and easy to use..</li>
      <li>and then you can recolour very easily the next time you shower.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I have been using.</li>
      <li>If you use this product, you may want to leave it on for the absolute maximum amount of time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and the color is so natural.</li>
      <li>look harsh and show the new growth very obviously while Loving Care does not.  </li>
      <li>Everything else breaks it off--even in professional salons--and everything else makes it brassy!</li>
      <li>Do not buy this hair color; it is a CHEAP imitation!</li>
      <li>Not manufactured any more, except maybe in United Kingdom, so hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement</li>
      <li>B000GCQZTC Clairol Natural Instincts</li>
      <li>NATURAL INSTINCTS  </li>
      <li>I am concerned that it is becoming harder and harder to find.  </li>
      <li>but because it brought back my natural color that had been faded by permanents and the sun.  </li>
      <li>Prefer it to using a similar product that actually bleaches out natural color in order to add their color.</li>

    <li> I love this product and am very sorry that Clairol has chosen to discontinue it.  No pyroxide and no ammonia...just easy to apply and goes on evenly; washes out so that the \\&quot;root\\&quot; thing doesn&#x27;t happen.  My hair always shines and glistens after using this hair color.    Seller was excellent, rapid delivery and product just as described!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. However Clairol has discontinued this item. I was so happy to find this online! It is exactly what I have been using.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed that Clairol is not manufacturing Loving Care any longer.  It is a wonderful product and they should bring it back on the market.  I have used Calirol Loving Care for over 20 years and have never had any allergic reactions. It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and the color is so natural. Thank you Amazon for still carrying it</li>
    <li> This hair colour is an excellent choice for those who do not want to use a harsh dye or are apprehensive about too much dye/chemical being absorbed through the scalp.  This is a mild dye that washes out in  5 or 6 shampoos.  It leaves the hair lustrous and in good condition.  Harsher more permanent dyes damage the hair, look harsh and show the new growth very obviously while Loving Care does not.  Your hair colour [[ASIN:B001FZMXOU Clairol Loving Care Hair Color Crème Lotion 78 Medium Golden Brown]]fades all over gradually over several weeks and then you can recolour very easily the next time you shower. I am very disappointed that Clairol has discontinued making this product.</li>
    <li> This did not do a good job of covering my gray hair.  I could see the gray within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with Clairol Natural Instincts Loving Care Color 075 Light Ash Brown. Those bozos at Clairol stopped making the stuff. I&#x27;m just happy these people had it, and at a fair price. And they got it here real quick.</li>
    <li> I have used this temporary hair color for years.  I can no longer find it in local stores.  Thank you for having it available.</li>
    <li> Good, but I don&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
    <li> still amazed at how fast I received these items and the great condition they&#x27;re in when I receive them!![[ASIN:B000GCQZTC Clairol Natural Instincts Loving Care Color 075 Light Ash Brown]]</li>
    <li> I have been using Loving Care in Light Ash Brown for over 50 years, not because I had gray in the early years but because it brought back my natural color that had been faded by permanents and the sun.  Even in my later years, it covered the little gray I have in my hair highlighting it.  Love it, love it, love it, but now, I find that Clairol has discontinued this product and I&#x27;m very unhappy.  I was happy to find this product here, though, but don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when it is all gone. All of us Loving Care users should write to Clairol and demand that they bring back this product.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY hair color, temporary or permanent I have ever been able to use successfully with my baby-fine hair. Everything else breaks it off--even in professional salons--and everything else makes it brassy! I&#x27;m devastated that they have stopped making this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it. Prefer it to using a similar product that actually bleaches out natural color in order to add their color. Really hate it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I received the product I needed, in due time. I am thankfull because all the drugstores and supermarkets I went to , in different USA cities, we&#x27;re always out of stock .</li>
    <li> I need more!!  Great product... I need more!! Very natural and easy to use.. I need more !!</li>
    <li> Excellent non ammonia, non peroxide hair color. Not manufactured any more, except maybe in United Kingdom, so hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement:Professional Product Beautiful Collections Light Ash Brown: B08D</li>

    <li> The product will not come out of the bottle no matter how hard it is squeezed! And when it does come out, and even though I let it sit several minutes, most of the product washed out immediately! Extremely bad product! Worse, I paid $29.00 for a product that used to cost only $5.97...Do not buy this hair color; it is a CHEAP imitation!</li>
    <li> I love this hair color product.  I am concerned that it is becoming harder and harder to find.  Hope they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot for ease of use and the resulting hair color.  I have had compliments on it but unfortunately it has been discontinued!</li>
    <li> CLAIROL LOVING CARE PRODUCTS ARE THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT A PERSON WITH AN ALERGIC REACTION TO HAIR DYE CAN USE.  I TRIED MANY PRODUCTS THAT SAY THEY ARE SAFE FOR SENSITIVE SCALPS BUT THEY CAUSED BURNS ON MY SCALP.  LOVING CARE NATURAL INSTINCTS  BY CLAIROL IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT DOES NOT DO THIS.  I TRIED THE OTHER LINE BEAUTY BY CLARIOL AND I DID GET AN ALERGIC REACTION.  PLEASE CLAIROL MAKE LOVING CARE NATURAL INSTINCTS AGAIN. IT WILL HELP ME TO STILL DYE MY HAIR WITHOUT GOING TO THE DOCTOR FOR MEDICATION.  I AM SURE THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WITH MY PROBLEM. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE MAKE CLAIROL LOVING CARE NATURAL INSTINCTS AGAIN. I PRAY TO GOD YOU DO THIS AGAIN.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> If you use this product, you may want to leave it on for the absolute maximum amount of time. I did 25-30 minutes and saw almost NO results. Make sure to also note the shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister,because she cannot find it in the stores any more . Its a little pricey compaired to what it use to be in the store but she likes it the best . I will probably try to order for her again, hope its still around</li>
