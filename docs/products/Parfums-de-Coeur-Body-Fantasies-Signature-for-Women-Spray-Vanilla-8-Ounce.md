      <li>I love this PERFUME!!  </li>
      <li>I heard many great reviews about how good the vanilla scent was</li>
      <li>It has a very delicious scent - a lot like fresh baked sugar cookies.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Exactly what was described, at a great price!</li>
      <li>This is the kind of vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t make you dizzy.</li>
      <li>It is nice to know that there is something that I can wear that I can confidently say has never received any complaints</li>
      <li>I just reply each time, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve always liked baked goods.&amp;#34; We are in an age where many are offended by or allergic to most perfumes and colognes.</li>
      <li>Now it is mostly alcohol.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when I wear it out.</li>
      <li>This is my all time favorite body spray.</li>
      <li>Seriously LOVE this stuff.....</li>
      <li>It definitely is the best and most affordable vanilla body spray I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
      <li>Have had many compiments.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, I AM MORE INTERSTED IN THE PRODUCT NOT THE PACKAGING.</li>
      <li>At that time it was a darker more potent formula.</li>
      <li>Now I know why this was so cheap!</li>
      <li>Great for keeping bugs away when playing golf and smells decent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sweet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it for many years and it still is just as satisfying as the first time I&#x27;ve use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall when I first discovered Parfums de Coeur Body Fantasies, but the vanilla spray has always been my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of scent that lasts so long with beautiful packaging that makes your day happier when you see it.</li>
      <li>This has been my staple for over 20 years and it is true what everyone is saying-</li>
      <li>its Okay... Very alcoholly smell to it plus the vanilla</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even say it smelled much like vanilla; I smelled root beer more than anything</li>
      <li>This was a nice big bottle</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and it lasts kinda long too.</li>
      <li>(I will say after the first couple of months, I could no longer smell it myself and to this day still can&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I think they diluted the spray as it&#x27;s not as potent as my last order.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice gourmand vanilla scent spend a just a few more bucks and buy Outremer (formerly L&#x27;aromarine) Vanille.</li>
      <li>I want something that smells like pure vanilla and this just wasn&#x27;t my type of body scent I wanted to wear.</li>
      <li>This has a really synthetic vanilla scent going on.</li>
      <li>Really like this USA made fragrance.  </li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t have much body to it.</li>
      <li>I usually buy this in the store but ordered this one from Amazon,  and of course, love it!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>have had so many people compliment me; been wearing it for years..... but seriously over priced here...  </li>
      <li>I think I received what I ordered as the label says the same as my old one</li>
      <li>They think that we forget what the original stuff was and how little you needed to spray for a long lasting fragrance.</li>

<li> I CAN GET A COMPARABLE PRODUCT FOR MUCH LESS.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m nuts about vanilla, but this killed it for me.</li>
<li> Fragrance was very stale and not at all what is normally smells like.  </li>
<li> No more vanilla for a while.</li>
<li> but It&#x27;s disappointing that the potency has changed that I can barely smell it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.</li>
<li> It is subtle, but yet gets you tons of compliments!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really sad about this.</li>

    <li> Really like this USA made fragrance.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST gnat repellent on the market!</li>
    <li> Seriously LOVE this stuff.....have had so many people compliment me; been wearing it for years..... but seriously over priced here...  you can get it online at walmart for 5 dollars and change.</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I CAN GET A COMPARABLE PRODUCT FOR MUCH LESS. I MUST SAY THE PACKAGING IS GREAT. HOWEVER, I AM MORE INTERSTED IN THE PRODUCT NOT THE PACKAGING.</li>
    <li> I love this PERFUME!!  I have been wearing it for 12 years and have never changed it.  It is subtle, but yet gets you tons of compliments!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described, at a great price!</li>
    <li> Fragrance was very stale and not at all what is normally smells like.  Now I know why this was so cheap!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite body spray. I&#x27;ve been buying it for many years and it still is just as satisfying as the first time I&#x27;ve use. It has a very delicious scent - a lot like fresh baked sugar cookies. It definitely is the best and most affordable vanilla body spray I&#x27;ve come across. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when I wear it out. It&#x27;s very sweet. but not overpowering at all. It seems that everyone finds the scent very attractive. I&#x27;m so happy I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the vanilla !!!  Wear it all the time.  Have had many compiments.  Would recommend it to anybody who loves the scent of vanilla.</li>
    <li> It makes me smell like cupcakes and cookies. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t make you dizzy. It smells really nice and it lasts kinda long too.</li>
    <li> This has been my staple for over 20 years and it is true what everyone is saying- THEY CHEAPENED THE FORMULA! I&#x27;m really sad about this. Of course, I&#x27;ll still keep buying it, because it&#x27;s like a layer of my skin I need to have...</li>
    <li> its Okay... Very alcoholly smell to it plus the vanilla but I wont be buying it again..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nuts about vanilla, but this killed it for me. No more vanilla for a while. Can&#x27;t put my finger on it but this stinks. This brand I believe had a toasted vanilla that I didn&#x27;t care for so thought I&#x27;d try this one</li>
    <li> I think they diluted the spray as it&#x27;s not as potent as my last order. The bottle has also changed. I think I received what I ordered as the label says the same as my old one but It&#x27;s disappointing that the potency has changed that I can barely smell it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  Just the right amount of scent that lasts so long with beautiful packaging that makes your day happier when you see it.</li>
    <li> This has a really synthetic vanilla scent going on. I wouldn&#x27;t even say it smelled much like vanilla; I smelled root beer more than anything and it didn&#x27;t have much body to it. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice gourmand vanilla scent spend a just a few more bucks and buy Outremer (formerly L&#x27;aromarine) Vanille.</li>
    <li> This was a nice big bottle</li>
    <li> Ehh, I&#x27;m on the fence with this...I heard many great reviews about how good the vanilla scent was but when I sprayed it on my arm, it smelled like vanilla mixed with alcohol. I want something that smells like pure vanilla and this just wasn&#x27;t my type of body scent I wanted to wear. I also heard they changed the product so I don&#x27;t know if that has something to do with it...but I&#x27;m going to look for another vanilla scented body spray/perfume.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for in regards to fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Has the perfect vanilla scent that lasts. I usually buy this in the store but ordered this one from Amazon,  and of course, love it!</li>
    <li> I started buying vanilla fantasy way back in the 1990s. At that time it was a darker more potent formula. Now it is mostly alcohol. They think that we forget what the original stuff was and how little you needed to spray for a long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this product for 8 years now and it has become my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent for all that know me. (I will say after the first couple of months, I could no longer smell it myself and to this day still can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve never experienced that before. Another friend that I turned this on to has said the same thing.) This being said, I receive compliments from people continually. I just reply each time, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve always liked baked goods.&amp;#34; We are in an age where many are offended by or allergic to most perfumes and colognes. It is nice to know that there is something that I can wear that I can confidently say has never received any complaints and instead I have received endless hugs just for wearing it. I was very sad when I recently became aware that I cannot buy this at any of my local stores. Thank goodness, I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall when I first discovered Parfums de Coeur Body Fantasies, but the vanilla spray has always been my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I looked all over town for this product--The only place I could find it. Well packaged and received it quickly--thanks!</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts all day. I get compliments almost daily and its only my body spray. The only body spray I will use.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping bugs away when playing golf and smells decent.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Boyfriend loves it on me!!</li>
