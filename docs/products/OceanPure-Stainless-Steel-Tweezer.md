### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great quality for the price!</li>
      <li>it very good.</li>
      <li>Beautiful packaging.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t very effective, broke the hairs off instead of pulling them out</li>
      <li>It comes with a cloth drawstring bag, which is nice (though not obligatory).</li>
      <li>These get the  job done right and at a great price.</li>
      <li>The metal is very sturdy, the tip is precise and it came in excellent packaging.</li>
      <li>Went with the angled tip because it seemed to be the most versatile option</li>
      <li>It seems to work better on thicker hairs.</li>
      <li>Works better than I thought it would.</li>
      <li>Comes in a cute pouch.</li>
      <li>Nothing more to be said.</li>
      <li>The tweezers&#x27; ends are unaligned making it quite unusable for even the most menial tasks.</li>
      <li>Never thought I would ever care about the quality of a set of tweezers, but my lovely SO has shown me the way.</li>
      <li>this item is really good.it works great for tweezing eye brows and getting those splinters out of feet and fingers of my 9 kids and</li>
      <li>Grabs hair with ease and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Anything from tweezing unibrows to rocket surgery is easily performed by these expertly crafted tweezers.</li>
      <li>and it does not have a strong grip to pull out hair.</li>
      <li>I got this product hoping that it would be a good replacement for the high end target one that I had lost before.</li>
      <li>average at best.</li>
      <li>This works fine.</li>
      <li>Perfect little tweezers.  </li>
      <li>These work great whether trimming facial hair or getting splinters out, they won&#x27;t rust too.</li>
      <li>The contact edges are ground, but not so precise as the $20 ones.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only happy when I&#x27;m on the run..</li>
      <li>This is a nice set of tweezers, very sturdy/heavy duty.</li>
      <li>But other than that it&#x27;s very good.  </li>
      <li>vs. one thanks to some hair excavating (fine, plucking).  </li>
      <li>This was a disappointment after purchasing so many excellent products through Amazon.com</li>
      <li>I broke a million hearts just for fun</li>
      <li>and so far I&#x27;ve been quite pleased.</li>
      <li>This high-tech piece of machinery can do no wrong.</li>
      <li>More like you&#x27;re going to sever the hair rather than pluck it, especially the finer hairs.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still, these are exactly what you would expect.  </li>
      <li>Nice sharp edges.</li>
      <li>They look identical to the ones that cost $20+, and the stainless steel seems to be of the same quality or better.</li>
      <li>Unlike other Tweezing Utensils I&#x27;ve operated, these are perfectly aligned on each side, and have perhaps an eighth of an inch clamping section to firmly grasp any hair, nail, splinter, wire or whatever else</li>
      <li>The tweezers themselves seem to be of good quality, and I expect that they will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t try imitations...get the real thing.</li>
      <li>so much as clip them at the roots, like a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The tweezers in between, like this stainless steel one, really don&#x27;t have a purpose.</li>
      <li>junk, wasted my money - glad they aren&#x27;t available - complete rip off.</li>
      <li>It even has it&#x27;s own little pouch/ with logo!</li>
      <li>The main problem with these tweezers, though, is that they aren&#x27;t tweezers.</li>
      <li>Im surprising picky when it comes to tweezers because I have some tough eyebrows.</li>
      <li>That should be enough, but they&#x27;re pretty sturdy I suppose, and more functional for grooming due to the flat tips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why the other colors are more/less expensive though, kind of interesting</li>
      <li>The $20 ones have precision ground edges, while the $1.50 ones are less precise if edges are not ground or covered by plating.  </li>
      <li>However, that&#x27;s the only positive aspect of this item.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are high quality though, decent pair of tweezers for the price, would definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>No complaints so far...</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are stainless steel, and they are hefty - -  the steel doesn&#x27;t seem pliable so sweeze control is more difficult.  </li>
      <li>Its a piece of high quality steel/metal that has been shaped, cut, and fabricated with another similar piece of metal to become a pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Its a piece of high quality steel/metal that has been shaped, cut, and fabricated with another similar piece of metal to become a pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> These tweezers feel solid and well-built, and should last us a long time.</li>
<li> Either breaks the hair in half, or is so bad at gripping that the hair slides right out.</li>
<li> A word of warning:  These do not flex quite as easily as a pair of fancy, expensive tweezers.&lt;br</li>

<li> Have to e very careful hen tying to tweeze.</li>
<li> Plus, they come in a little drawstring pouch which will make them much harder to lose.</li>
<li> It actually ships with a small, branded plastic box, a branded microfiber bag with draw strings, and a small rubber band keeping the tips closed.  </li>
<li> Beat the Walgreen&#x27;s tweezer price by almost $3 and saved me the odd glances from the pony tail sporting girl at the checkout counter too.</li>
<li> They feel as manly as tweezers can, once you throw away the little felt bag.  </li>
<li> They even came with a little pouch to protect them.</li>
<li> If anything the metal is a little thicker than the my old expensive ones.</li>
<li> Not a cheap made instrament.</li>
<li> This is a pretty bad tweezer.</li>
<li> ill let you know when i find a pair of tweezers that will last because this isnt it.</li>
<li> I was expecting this add-on item to come in a small plastic bag.  </li>
<li> I found the tweezer to be totally useless for removing unwanted facial hair.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t expect high-end precision at this price, but I thought they would at least be useable.  </li>
<li> The tip is to thick</li>
<li> They&#x27;re crazy sharp though.</li>
<li> Tweezer construction and alignment are so poor that the pair I received was useless.  </li>
<li> Nothing wrong here.</li>
<li> After losing another expensive set of tweezers, I decided to go for these.</li>

    <li> That should be enough, but they&#x27;re pretty sturdy I suppose, and more functional for grooming due to the flat tips. They also line up well and I don&#x27;t feel like they flex in ways they shouldn&#x27;t. Nothing wrong here.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of tweezers, very sturdy/heavy duty. It comes with a cloth drawstring bag, which is nice (though not obligatory). They&#x27;re crazy sharp though. Not that they&#x27;re pointy and that you&#x27;re going to poke or cut yourself. More like you&#x27;re going to sever the hair rather than pluck it, especially the finer hairs. It seems to work better on thicker hairs. Just keep in mind what use you had in mind and purchase accordingly.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t very effective, broke the hairs off instead of pulling them out but did get some hairs. Have to e very careful hen tying to tweeze. Does come with a helpful case to store the tweezers.</li>
    <li> Never thought I would ever care about the quality of a set of tweezers, but my lovely SO has shown me the way. Went with the angled tip because it seemed to be the most versatile option and so far I&#x27;ve been quite pleased. These tweezers feel solid and well-built, and should last us a long time.</li>
    <li> Nice sharp edges. Does everything you would expect from a pair of tweezers. No complaints so far... what else can I say?</li>
    <li> I got this product hoping that it would be a good replacement for the high end target one that I had lost before.The main problem with these tweezers, though, is that they aren&#x27;t tweezers. The tweezers&#x27; ends are unaligned making it quite unusable for even the most menial tasks. I do not recommend these whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty bad tweezer. You can&#x27;t see what you are tweezing with it! Plus it doesn&#x27;t grip well.</li>
    <li> The family has $20 Tweezerman&#x27;s and $1.50 drug store Revlon&#x27;s.  The $20 ones have precision ground edges, while the $1.50 ones are less precise if edges are not ground or covered by plating.  However, both are toast if you drop them on a hard surface like tile floors, so they last as long as no drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are stainless steel, and they are hefty - -  the steel doesn&#x27;t seem pliable so sweeze control is more difficult.  The contact edges are ground, but not so precise as the $20 ones.  Overall, and after collective experience, men should just use the $1.50 drug store ones, and women should try a $20 Tweezerman (recommended by the fashion mags) and when they drop it and blow $20, get a $1.50 replacement one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers in between, like this stainless steel one, really don&#x27;t have a purpose.</li>
    <li> Could be a bit springier.  But other than that it&#x27;s very good.  If I ever lose this one I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging.  However, that&#x27;s the only positive aspect of this item.  I found the tweezer to be totally useless for removing unwanted facial hair.  Tweezer construction and alignment are so poor that the pair I received was useless.  I didn&#x27;t expect high-end precision at this price, but I thought they would at least be useable.  This was a disappointment after purchasing so many excellent products through Amazon.com</li>
    <li> After losing another expensive set of tweezers, I decided to go for these. They look identical to the ones that cost $20+, and the stainless steel seems to be of the same quality or better. If anything the metal is a little thicker than the my old expensive ones. They even came with a little pouch to protect them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it for anything except picking out salmon bones.  The tip is to thick and it does not have a strong grip to pull out hair.</li>
    <li> These look just like a pair of Tweezerman tweezers I&#x27;ve had for years, so gave them a try.  They broke apart the 2nd use when the glue came apart.  Don&#x27;t try imitations...get the real thing.</li>
    <li> Tried to sterilize these things along with all the rest of my tweezers etc - they turned black in several areas.&lt;br /&gt;Total junk, wasted my money - glad they aren&#x27;t available - complete rip off.</li>
    <li> And I don&#x27;t belong to anyone.. They call me home wrecker, home wrecker! I&#x27;m only happy when I&#x27;m on the run.. I broke a million hearts just for fun</li>
    <li> A word of warning:  These do not flex quite as easily as a pair of fancy, expensive tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, these are exactly what you would expect.  Solid metal tweezers for a low price.</li>
    <li> Does not PLUCK hairs out (I used it for my eyebrows) so much as clip them at the roots, like a pair of scissors. NOT what tweezers are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This high-tech piece of machinery can do no wrong. Anything from tweezing unibrows to rocket surgery is easily performed by these expertly crafted tweezers. Unlike other Tweezing Utensils I&#x27;ve operated, these are perfectly aligned on each side, and have perhaps an eighth of an inch clamping section to firmly grasp any hair, nail, splinter, wire or whatever else you feel the need to tweez. They&#x27;re also shiny. Tweez on, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price! The metal is very sturdy, the tip is precise and it came in excellent packaging.</li>
    <li> Either breaks the hair in half, or is so bad at gripping that the hair slides right out. Basically a total loss of the small amount spent on them.</li>
    <li> They work. They feel as manly as tweezers can, once you throw away the little felt bag.  I haven&#x27;t lost any eyes or drawn any blood with them and I have two (ahem, shapely) brows vs. one thanks to some hair excavating (fine, plucking).  So, it&#x27;s a winner for this kid.  Beat the Walgreen&#x27;s tweezer price by almost $3 and saved me the odd glances from the pony tail sporting girl at the checkout counter too.</li>
    <li> Perfect little tweezers.  Looks like the quality it very good. Comes in a cute pouch. Nothing more to be said.</li>
    <li> This works fine. It&#x27;s a tweezer. I don&#x27;t know why the other colors are more/less expensive though, kind of interesting</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the workhorse you&#x27;ve been looking for. They are inexpensive, durable, and backed by a company that obviously takes pride in its work, evidenced by the packaging and workmanship of the product itself.</li>
    <li> ill let you know when i find a pair of tweezers that will last because this isnt it. average at best.</li>
    <li> this item is really good.it works great for tweezing eye brows and getting those splinters out of feet and fingers of my 9 kids and mt husband.get it everyone</li>
    <li> Its a piece of high quality steel/metal that has been shaped, cut, and fabricated with another similar piece of metal to become a pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are high quality though, decent pair of tweezers for the price, would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These work great whether trimming facial hair or getting splinters out, they won&#x27;t rust too. It even has it&#x27;s own little pouch/ with logo!</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought it would. Grabs hair with ease and is easy to use. Not a cheap made instrament.</li>
    <li> Im surprising picky when it comes to tweezers because I have some tough eyebrows. These get the  job done right and at a great price. Plus, they come in a little drawstring pouch which will make them much harder to lose. Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally blown away by the packaging.  I was expecting this add-on item to come in a small plastic bag.  It actually ships with a small, branded plastic box, a branded microfiber bag with draw strings, and a small rubber band keeping the tips closed.  The tweezers themselves seem to be of good quality, and I expect that they will last a long time.</li>
