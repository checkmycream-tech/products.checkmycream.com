      <li>I had ordered the product twice because the price was good.</li>
      <li>I love this hair color.</li>
      <li>best part is color last for weeks.</li>
      <li>Really gives a great boosts to my hair texture that also lasts for weeks.</li>
      <li>I did try just for men, i would say that&#x27;s the second best.</li>
      <li>The product seemed to arrive ok</li>
      <li>Easy to mix and apply.  </li>
      <li>The plastic bottles are too bridle and can break easily.</li>
      <li>Covered the gray just fine.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>have used the same product before and actually liked the product better than the competition</li>
      <li>Luckily the product did not stain anything this time.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>The first time , the first  two  packs worked fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than Just for Men or Natural Instincts.</li>
      <li>The combined total 40 ml mixture is great for short hair one head application.</li>
      <li>Coloring agent was pretty.</li>
      <li>I mixed the product and there was more product then</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will be sure to order the next one soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, also my head becomes very itchy for couple hours after shower.</li>
      <li>i dont need to use a whole lot.</li>
      <li>My hair is so much thicker, fuller after I use this hair color.</li>
      <li>And color really lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yeah, it colored the grey fine</li>
      <li>do agree the applicator bottle is little flimsy,however, i use the bown and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to apply lot of moisturizer around your neck, forehead and ears.</li>
      <li>I normally cut my hair 5 to 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>Hair seems fuller than JFM, but only after a few weeks can I comment on the most important thing, how long it lasts.  </li>
      <li>I have 12 more bottles of this shampoo from my Amazon order I&#x27;m no sure what to do with.</li>
      <li>package was old bottles cracked and dye went all over sink</li>
      <li>This happens with all the hair color I have used so far including just-for-men.</li>
      <li>Seem pretty brittle like when an item sits too long on the shelve.</li>
      <li>How old is this stuff?</li>
      <li>The color itself works fine, but my other dilemma is my eyes get really red and burning feels</li>
      <li>It works as well as Just For Men--at half the price, so definitely worth considering.</li>
      <li>but when I went to use the product I had major issues.</li>
      <li>Product is OLD will disintegrate applicator when components are mixed.</li>
      <li>I concur with one of the prior reviewers - the product appears to be old and as a result,  the integrity of the plastic mixing/squeeze bottle has deteriorated or been compromised.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They cracked open in my hand when I squeezed them- spilling the contents in to my hand and not letting me direct the shampoo out the tip of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Second time I ordered this OLD PRODUCT and the second time it arrived damaged.</li>
      <li>I agree with previous comments that bottle cracked even with gentle squeeze.</li>
      <li>Bought this due to the low price but the product must have been very old because the bottle you mix the stuff in cracked as soon as I squeezed it to apply to my hair.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> bottle cracked as soon as I pushed it...what a waste of time and paper towels cleaning up after!</li>
    <li> All the bottles inside the boxes were damaged.</li>
    <li> Product is OLD will disintegrate applicator when components are mixed.</li>
    <li> It works as well as Just For Men--at half the price, so definitely worth considering. I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in either the process or the result comparing those two.</li>
    <li> Compared to developer, the quantity (volume) of the color was not enough.</li>
    <li> package was old bottles cracked and dye went all over sink</li>
    <li> Bought this due to the low price but the product must have been very old because the bottle you mix the stuff in cracked as soon as I squeezed it to apply to my hair.  Yeah, it colored the grey fine but it was a complete mess.</li>
    <li> My title says it all.  I&#x27;m back to purchasing Just For Men, which targets the gray hairs.  Unlike this product which leaves all the grays no matter how long you keep it in the hair. All it does is dyes the already dark brown hair into jet back (Btw, we purchased the darkest brown color).</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00EIJ5UJA Clairol Men&#x27;s Choice Shampoo-in Hair Color, M66 Natural Darkest Brown (Pack of 3)]]Items came in defective, two solution bottles had leaked due to cracking. Seem pretty brittle like when an item sits too long on the shelve. Leakage led to the gloves having holes thus when I tried them on they stained my palm...Dont buy from this seller</li>
    <li> Coloring agent was pretty. Applied it and left it on to set as instructed in directions, but after rice, I was unimpressed with coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color. It&#x27;s better than Just for Men or Natural Instincts. The color last me over 4 weeks. The other hair colors my hair starts to go gray in about 2 weeks. My hair is so much thicker, fuller after I use this hair color. Really gives a great boosts to my hair texture that also lasts for weeks. Gary</li>
    <li> I agree with previous comments that bottle cracked even with gentle squeeze. I believe the material is too thin and or it is exposed to overheat (sitting in hot warehouse for long period of time) causing it to crack. The color itself works fine, but my other dilemma is my eyes get really red and burning feels, also my head becomes very itchy for couple hours after shower. This happens with all the hair color I have used so far including just-for-men. I am open for suggestion from other folks.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colors i have used. I have used Garnier, and it BURNS my skin. I did try just for men, i would say that&#x27;s the second best. This color stays for long time. I have dark black hair, however, i bought the darkest brown as per recommendations I saw online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First application i used the mixed both the bottles, however, there was lot of left over beause of my short hair. I then realized i could use it for two head application as opposed to their mention of one head application. I divide the bottle liquid into two equal parts and mix it in the bowl (20 ml from each bottle). The combined total 40 ml mixture is great for short hair one head application. I use the brush to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree the applicator bottle is little flimsy,however, i use the bown and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to apply lot of moisturizer around your neck, forehead and ears. I do this for all the colors. This color infact doesnt drip as much as other colors would. I would say almost no dripping if you apply with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best part is color last for weeks. I normally cut my hair 5 to 6 weeks. And color really lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to order the next one soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it for facial application. I think i dont need to use it just yet :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Color won&#x27;t wash out&lt;br /&gt;Easy-to-use&lt;br /&gt;No running, no dripping if you apply with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Mixing bottle is little flimsy, however, I just use the bowl and hair brush to apply the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My hair does get dry, however, that doesnt have to do with color I believe. It&#x27;s with any hair color product i see the same dryness. I just avoid washing my hair everyday now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good part about this color it i dont need to use a whole lot. I have short hair and hence i use it sparingly. There are</li>
    <li> Easy to mix and apply.  The colour is different than just for men, not better or worse just different.  Hair seems fuller than JFM, but only after a few weeks can I comment on the most important thing, how long it lasts.  So far so good.  Do use the Vaseline to protect undesired dye areas, or you will suffer from brown ears syndrome.</li>
    <li> Second time I ordered this OLD PRODUCT and the second time it arrived damaged. Hair treatment all leaked everywhere. Plastic bottles are either aged or damaged and arrive cracked. DO NOT ORDER THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> The plastic bottles the Clairol Men&#x27;s Choice Shampoo-in Hair Color came in were defective. They cracked open in my hand when I squeezed them- spilling the contents in to my hand and not letting me direct the shampoo out the tip of the bottle. It&#x27;s very messy to use this product with its defective bottle.&lt;br /&gt;All three of the bottles in the package had this problem. I have 12 more bottles of this shampoo from my Amazon order I&#x27;m no sure what to do with.</li>
    <li> Applicator bottle will crack and spill contents everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think it would happen to me either.</li>
    <li> I had seen the prior reviews regarding flimsy bottles that cracked, but didn&#x27;t quite know what to make of them. I had ordered the product twice because the price was good. It comes in a three pack.  The first time , the first  two  packs worked fine. However on the third pack, the bottle cracked with only slight pressure when I tried to apply the hair color - and spilled the color all over my sink.  I thought that this was an anomaly and therefor made  a second order.  However when the order arrived - three pack covered in cellophane wrap, it was apparent that one or so  of the bottles/containers in the packs had broken as the boxes appeared damp and discolored.  I concur with one of the prior reviewers - the product appears to be old and as a result,  the integrity of the plastic mixing/squeeze bottle has deteriorated or been compromised.&lt;br /&gt;I submitted for an immediate refund. I have learned my lesson and will not order this product again.</li>
    <li> This was the worst.  Each time I applied the product to my hair the bottle would Crack as it was being squeezed.  The color solution doss not color the hair well and what gray it did hide lasted only a couple of days.</li>
    <li> The minute I squeezed the mixing bottle it cracked. It was a complete mess, dye everywhere. I had to put the dye in a bowl and use a  brush to apply it to my hair. How old is this stuff? Covered the gray just fine.</li>
    <li> The product seemed to arrive ok but when I went to use the product I had major issues. I mixed the product and there was more product then their competitors but then it went down hill. When I squeezed the bottle to extract the product the bottle cracked and product went every where. Luckily the product did not stain anything this time.&lt;br /&gt;In about two weeks I tried the product again, I had bought several, and the same thing happened. The product cracked and again the product went every where. This time it did get on some a stainable surface.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the same product before and actually liked the product better than the competition but these bottles cracked each time I used them.</li>
    <li> The plastic bottles are too bridle and can break easily. Be extra careful!</li>
