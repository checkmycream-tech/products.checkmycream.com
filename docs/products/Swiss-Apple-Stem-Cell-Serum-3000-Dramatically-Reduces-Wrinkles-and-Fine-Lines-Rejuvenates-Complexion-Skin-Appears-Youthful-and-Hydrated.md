<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LIKE THIS SWISS APPLE STEM CELL SO MUCH .&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> Really good serum. I see my skin to be more healthy looking, vibrant. Thånkš.</li>
    <li> I used this for a little over 3 weeks, and did not see a change.</li>
    <li> It has made my face brighter over the last three weeks which I like.  But, nobody has commented about my skin yet.  My very fine and new lines have not changed.  My skin is not any firmer.  Perhaps with continuous use this will change, but it is not cheap either to entice me.  I will update later after longer use.</li>
    <li> light the way my face feels</li>
    <li> I like your product - Swiss Apple Stem Cell Serum and I&#x27;m using it daily. As an older woman I search out products that do their job well and this is one of them. I use it after an exfoliating cleanse on a daily basis. It seems to be keeping more lines from showing. I&#x27;ll let you know six months from now as I continue with the product.</li>
    <li> I have used 2/3 of the bottle and here is result.  I have sensitive normal-to-dry skin and use it 1 to 2 times daily.&lt;br /&gt;During the first week, it made my skin dry and peel a little. I used it once a day and put some lotion on top of it when my skin gets too dry. My skin got used to it after a week so I started applying the serum twice a day with lotion from time to time.  Now, after 2/3 of a bottle, my skin tone is more even and brighter.  Have not seen any reduce of wrinkles. Will report back if anything changes before I finished this bottle.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I can feel tighten on my face for the first used. I have a very sensitive skin easy to get rash but not with this product. It hard to be true to say that this product is amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t amazing to me at all. But I give it 5 stars cause I love the way it feels on my skin when I applied to it. Not gressy or any strong smell, it is has a nice smell what I liked and enjoying so much. I got it faster than I expect and its last me for 2 months if campare to the price.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve not used long enough to be sure it&#x27;s this product that is working for me as I am using it in conjunction with derma rolling.  My skin is definitely looking better.</li>
    <li> A nice serum that makes my skin feel soft and smooth. This is the second time I&#x27;ve reorder.</li>
    <li> There is a slight change in the lessening of wrinkles.  My skin is extremely soft from this product.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t see any visible difference. I will not rebuy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now and so far have not seen any changes on my face.</li>
    <li> This product is FANTASTIC. Does everything it says, and more. I felt a difference the minute I put it on my 54 year old face. I wish Swiss Botany would make more products with apple stem cells; eye cream, moisturizer with sun block. I use this in combo with Eclos/Freeman apple stem cell products--but I understand that they are discontinuing the products I like, so Swiss Botany, step in!</li>
    <li> This would probably be ok for someone a little younger than myself, but I am 81 and it is really asking a lot for it to take care of the wrinkles I have.  I will finish using it as it makes my skin very smooth and nice.  Nothing against the serum I was just asking too much from it.</li>
    <li> have not seen any difference on my face and I use it every day and night.</li>
    <li> feeling my skin tighter,smaller pores,and a feeling density on my face thank you swiss botany!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  I&#x27;ve even purchased a second bottle which I gave to my mother who is also enjoying it.  You only need a little and it absorbs so quickly into the skin and then makes it feel smooth - almost like a primer.  It has a very slight scent of apples which quickly dissipates.  I&#x27;ve started using this along with a derma roller which seems to make it perform even better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I had been reading about apple stem cell technology for awhile, and was happy to find this Swiss Botany product online.  This stuff is amazing!  I used it after I wash my face day or night, and need no other moisturizer or product.  It makes my skin feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s, honestly.  I notice my wrinkles are much less obviously noticeable, and after continued use, seem to fade away.  It&#x27;s just a nice, soft, skin feeling.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone!  I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin appear overly oily.  It&#x27;s very natural and wholesome feeling, not sting-y or reddening.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle but works in diminishing fine lines. It makes skin looks healthier. It can&#x27;t be used alone, though. You&#x27;ll need another moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Do not feel product for cost is all that great, smells good and does give skin a tightening feeling but bottom line tends to clob pores and doesn&#x27;t allow skin to breathe</li>
    <li> The product is easy to use and does not leave a residue on your face.  The skins feels wonderful after applying the serum.  I feel this product adds a glow that I have not experienced with other products.  Yes, I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Am seeing improvement on skin</li>
    <li> My favorite of the Swiss Botany line! It works and smells like apples! Will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Quickly delivered and quickly worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by stem cells and this product delivers.  I have mild rosacea and literally overnight I woke up with a calmer clearer complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing such s good product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it is working.</li>
    <li> Product works fast. Works very well. And smells nice, though fragrance may not be natural or organic. So far, the best product I have used for skin renewal and the cheapest considering result. Will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> the item is of high quality and shipped very fast</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and my skin feels softer and  smoother.  I have always had very oily skin, and lately have developed  very dry patches on my on the sides of my forehead, the skin almost felt calloused or leathery and I noticed wrinkles there.  Since I started using this my skin on my whole face feels smoother, and those leathery patches are soft.  I also have extremely sensitive skin and have had no sensitivity issues with this product.  I will definitely continue to use this product.  I also use the Certified Organic Honey Facial Cleanser by Swiss Botany, I love that product too!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Feels fresh on my skin, and makes my skin look great!</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars.  My skin is very fair and sensitive, but this does not irritate or turn me red!  My skin looks amazing.  And the smell is great too, smells like apples!  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I received it 2 days ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I got the item is not as good as before. The color of the serum is different, it is brown and it looks old. It seems metamorphosed.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and I get the following explanation:  You will get the same results even with a darker colored serum.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think so. I dont believe this product anymore and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is great item after this product I felt that my skin become smother and softer.I didn&#x27;t see my winkle is getting reduced yet but I want to keep use this product for more result.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as promised.  I&#x27;m  so pleased with the results that have ordered another bottle even before exhausting my current supply.</li>
    <li> very good product .thes best one...</li>
    <li> I have finally found the perfect combination of skin care for my aged skin. I wash my face with the Swiss Botany Honey cleanser &amp; follow up with the Swiss Apple Stem Cell Aging serum. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft &amp; supple my face now feels. The wrinkles are filling in around my eyes &amp; mouth. My skin is healthy looking now. Hasn&#x27;t been this nice in over 10 years. I am out in the sun most every day &amp; this is all I use . Though I do put on a moisturizer with sun screen if I will be outside for a prolonged period. I have been using this for over six weeks &amp; feel I can honestly say I&#x27;ve tried it long enough to prove to myself how well it works. Try it &amp; I&#x27;m sure you will agree with me.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Use it daily and makes my face feel so soft.</li>
    <li> The serum feels like silk on your skin.  The scent is not overpowering.  So far, so good!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I went out with a new friend and she thought I was around her age 52 when in fact I am 64. I have always tried to take good care of my skin but this has just made such a difference. Looks like I had a facelift</li>
    <li> I  received the serum as promised!  I have been using it for 10 days now , My face looks and feels less bumpy. I am so impressed with this product that I  will continue to purchase it. My skin has transformed and feels taught.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, love the reduced pores, my fine lines are definitely reduced and great smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really works and makes your skin so smooth. I have little fine lines around my eyes and over a few weeks they have melted away. I am hooked on this product and the price is excellent for the quality.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. Became part of my every day skincare regimen and order consistently.</li>
    <li> It really works! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Works--pores noticeably smaller, something I thought impossible. Any breakouts heal twice as fast. I was trying to trim  my cat&#x27;s claws without first wrapping her in a towel (silly me) and she wiggled out from my grasp and raked me across the chest--I put this product on the scrape and it healed in less than half the usual time, with no scarring. I will be buying more of this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have added several of the Swiss Botany beauty products to my routine and while it&#x27;s hard to choose a favorite since each one has benefits that I like, I&#x27;d say that this stem cell serum is at the top of my list. It&#x27;s very lightweight, not heavy or greasy, and absorbs so nicely. It really softens and feels like I&#x27;m pampering my complexion. it must help with cell turnover or something because it makes my face look fresher. Whatever it does, I plan to continue using it!</li>
    <li> I just began using, and can tell my skin is more supple and brighter.  This product smells great and has a very nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to the results of long term use.</li>
    <li> It smells nice.  Works okay</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I am in my 60&#x27;s and within 2 weeks of using Swiss Apple Stem Cell Anti Aging Serum my skin is much smoother and softer and with less appearance of wrinkles. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Noticed straight away after using my skin tone have improved and my skins feels smooth and soft like a baby.thank u !</li>
    <li> this product is amazing... results are visible fast. Smaller pores, evened skin tone, clearer skin. It is a winner.</li>
    <li> after apply for two weeks, my skin become so smooth and nice! i will re-order it</li>
    <li> I really like the Serum. I have used it for a months now. It makes my skin softer, and firmer. I will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day after thoroughly cleansing my skin for about a month now, but have witnessed no results with regard to either a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles or dark spots.  Although it claims results within 3 days, I decided to extend the time before reviewing -- even after using it for 3 weeks with no visible results, or a 30-day money back guarantee.  I purchased this item based on the mostly-5-star reviews hoping to see some difference, but that did not happen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month.  Just one weekly application, since I have very dry skin and I feel a slight burning sensation at first.  I have been contacted by this company trice, asking for my input on their product.  I refused to comply until I was certain of the results.  Now I can honestly state my skin seems clearer of age spots and my wrinkles are less obvious.  My skin color is light olive and I am 60 years old.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> This serum isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and have noticed a reduction in pore size. Doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your whole face so the bottle lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> After two weeks reduce the size of fine lines and pores appear smaller. Skin seems smoother and brighter. I am 76 so i did not expect miracles but I love this product and will continue to use it.[[ASIN:B00H8A2SYG Swiss Apple Stem Cell Anti-Aging serum 3000 Dramatically Reduces the Appearance of Wrinkles &amp; Fine Lines Within 3 Days - Rejuvenating &amp; Boosting the Activity of Your Skin&#x27;s Own Stem Cells. 100% Money Back Guarantee]]</li>
    <li> The great thing about this product for me is that it doesn&#x27;t disturb the effectiveness of other products; it rather enhances their effectiveness. I love it, love it, love it and I recommend its usage am and pm as a first base to other facial products.</li>
    <li> I have used the apple stem cell 3000 for about 1 week now, and I have seen some improvement in the puffiness under the eyes!  I was hoping for a miracle to get rid of everything in a short time!! Isn&#x27;t that what we all want?  Anyway, I will continue to use it hoping for more improvement!&lt;br /&gt;Donna Almburg</li>
    <li> Great product Im looking 10 yrs younger</li>
    <li> Amazing love it ,I have been using it for 12 days now.I have really scarred oily skin also dull, but this product has transformed my skin it is supple, and bright and not oily anymore . Kudos Keep up the good work..</li>
    <li> I love this product! I initially thought it was a gimmick, but what it has done to my 50+ year old skin is great. Reversing age, sun and wrinkles is hard but I can tell its working, even after just a month!</li>
    <li> Great product and worth the price. I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it when I came across this product on Amazon. I bought it for my girlfriend and we both can notice the changes now in her skin. Her skin looks healthier, younger and brighter. Dark lines under her eyes are fading away. Her skin feels much smoother and softer with the use of this product. She is happy and so am I.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells lovely, and I really like the consistency!</li>
    <li> After 1 week I&#x27;m noticing some reduction in &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; which are the deepest lines around my eyes.  Really liked swiss apple stem cell facial serum I used in the past but out of production? I think.  Anyway, this has been a good replacement</li>
    <li> Fast service. Love it. Great price - much less than other sellers.</li>
    <li> I love the apple flavor of it&lt;br /&gt;It permeats when I apply on face</li>
    <li> wife uses it everyday!!! love it!!</li>
    <li> It has been three weeks since I started using the Apple Stem serum, and I love it. I have a sensitive skin, which makes it difficult to find the right anti-aging products for me. This one is different. It goes on smoothly and dries evenly and quickly. The scent is amazing, too. I apply it twice a day and follow with my moisturizer.  That is all I have been using, and my skin already looks  radiant with glowing cheeks,  and my forehand where I have more visible lines looks smoother. I have never written a review for a cosmetic product, but the Swiss Apple Stem Cell Serum deserves it.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. The reason why I keep buying. I received my order on time.</li>
    <li> I think came on time can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I am seeing a marked difference in my face but especially the &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34; is smoothed out considerably. I bought 3 and will take one to my girlfriend who is my same age today.  I have researched other products and decided to try this on because the price was reasonable by comparison.  I am very satisfied with results and plan to keep using this. :)</li>
    <li> Great product - smells great and I love how my face feels and looks with this product - gives your face advanced lift and tights with stem cell technology ( renewing of the skin cells)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a weird sticky film all over the face, and it feels very refreshing and rejuvenating and it appears to be making progress on the tightness of my skin. I&#x27;m hoping it will have some more effects on fine lines and redness as I progress.</li>
    <li> Well, I thought long and hard before purchasing this product, as it was very expensive and I do not have a money to throw away ( having paid over $50 dollars, including shipping ). I am just a normal 47 year old ( I don&#x27;t drink, I don&#x27;t smoke ) and generally look after myself.&lt;br /&gt;I, like every other person out there, I am conscious of my lines around my mouth and eyes and after considerable research I came across this company.  I thought as the reviews claimed this to be an absolutely fabulous serum. It also claims on their own web site that  &amp;#34;Swiss Apple Stem Cell 3000 Fights Fine Lines On Face and Neck From Aging and helps Rejuvenate the Skin for a Younger &amp; More Elastic Look and Feel.&amp;#34; They also claim it &amp;#34; produces immediate results – Diminishes the appearance of fine lines and skin imperfections&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Well, having tried this product twice a day, morning and night for THREE weeks, it has made NO difference what so ever to my face. I tried various methods including dabbing the serum on my face one day, then in circular motions the next ( and I don&#x27;t use other products on my skin ).&lt;br /&gt;Not only am I totally disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t work, but I am more upset and annoyed with myself for being sucked in. I would hope that anyone reading this would perhaps think twice before spending this amount.</li>
    <li> Love it! Nice scent, seems to help my skin already</li>
    <li> Lleft my skin very soft didnt leave it dry.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, does not get hard, cannot yet tell if it helped wrinkles. Like product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am using it whenever I use my dermapen.  It adds glow to my skin, anti aging.  Will order from this seller again.</li>
