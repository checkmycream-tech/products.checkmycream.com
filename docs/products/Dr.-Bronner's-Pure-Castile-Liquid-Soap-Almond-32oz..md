      <li>This is a nice neutral scent that would appeal to either gender.  </li>
      <li>I gave a bottle to my two daughters and husband and am telling all of my cousins how nice this soap is.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a little watery, would like a thicker soap</li>
    <li> Always a good product!!</li>
    <li> I use this primarily as a shampoo and on bottle lasts months, let alone two. This stuff is amazing (and the scent is nice too)!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting to know this soap.  I wash everywhere with it.  It&#x27;s a little like smelling salts.  I wash my face and eyes with no tears baby body wash then take a sniff of the lovely,diluted almond castile soap and finish up with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got several 4 oz. bottles from Amazon.com for mini presents for several people for Christmas.  I don&#x27;t always dilute these but only use a few drops at a time. One lasted about five months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I ordered the two 32 oz. ones. I diluted it for a foaming pump hand wash and delicate wash soap.  When I hand wash delicates I use a little of the diluted soap and wash the counter with one of those nylon net scrubbies.  Smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wished you could buy just one 32 oz. bottle so it wouldn&#x27;t seem so expensive. But I&#x27;ve found so many uses for it that that&#x27;s about right. It&#x27;s a cheap effective anti depressant.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I love the smell and it is not strong smell as I thought it would be. You also do get the feeling that your body is really cleaned after using this soap. Little drop of oil creates huge foams when you use body scrubbers. I will buy this product again if the price doesn&#x27;t go up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One for thing I asked my mom how I smell after shower and she did not like the smell. So guys beware if you are going to attract sexy ladies into your shower ;D...</li>
    <li> I use this for my whole body, from head to toe.  The peppermint has a great cooling sensation that I love and the hemp almond smells great.  It is the only soap that will ever touch my skin from now on.</li>
    <li> This ended up being my favorite body wash- Didn&#x27;t have to use a lot, was great on my skin, and I love the almond smell! I also tried it on my hair and I do agree, it is a bit drying, but for everything else, it&#x27;s fantastic. It&#x27;s even up there on my list of great shaving products!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an \\&quot;everything\\&quot; soap, this is it.  I use it for dishwashing, body wash, laundry, just about everything.  It is highly concentrated, the smell is great and it is biodegradable with no added perfumes!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found any hand soap or body soap I like better.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans fine, important for a guy, and your buddies won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;think you smell like bruiser La&#x27;Rue either!  Yea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Castile soap keeps your hands from drying out and seems to have&lt;br /&gt;a healing action not found in other soaps.  I now use it as shampoo,&lt;br /&gt;pet shampoo, hand cleaners and some other cleaning uses.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it collects on fabrics yet, floor mats etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sick of and getting sick from all the artificial petrol-based fragrances used by virtually all other soap makers.  It is not overpowering at all, it doesn&#x27;t linger like the petrol-scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find anything better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t worry -- be happy : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I have been making strides towards a more ecofriendly lifestyle for a while and have really been wanting to try castile soap. I have heard that it can wash anything that needs a mild touch and, being made from oils, won&#x27;t dry your skin out. Well, I finally took the plunge and ordered some from Amazon. It arrived yesterday and I immediately took a shower with it. I was impressed beyond what I thought I&#x27;d be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me start by saying I have hard water. I began my shower by putting my usual squirt on a washcloth, thinking it would probably require even more than chemically-based soaps and I would come back for more. Well, that was my first mistake. The lather that built on my washcloth was so thick and creamy, I actually had to pull some off, every so often, and throw it at my feet. The lather was unbelieveable, even past the hard water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I took a deep breath and decided to try to shampoo with it. It&#x27;s a thin soap, so I was only able to put a quarter-sized puddle into my palm. Turns out, my palm is a good indicator. Three seconds after I started rubbing that small ration onto my head, I had a lather so thick that I could barely feel my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shower gel and shampoo it&#x27;s performs like a champ! A little goes a long way ... and I mean a very long way. My skin is soft and my hair is fluffy and every part of me smells like exotic almond oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, I decided to take a bath since I was cold. I squirted some of this into the tub and discovered that they mean it when they say it has no foaming agents. No matter. My hopeful bubble bath turned into an almond-water soak. As a bath soak, it was even better than any beads or salts I had ever used. It was a calming scent, the water was soft and silky instead of my hind end rubbing against the undisolved crystals of other products, and my bathroom has a lingering aroma that even made spraying after a visit to the toilet unneeded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as a bath and shower product, it will take you from scalp to toes and smell great. Next, I may try washing some of my clothing in it!p to toes and smell great. Next, I may try washing some of my clothing in it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read and heard good things about this soap, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It has the best and most beautiful scent! It was also a good value purchasing the two containers and, while I was a little worried about the integrity of the shipping (i.e. leaking), I needn&#x27;t have worried. Everything was tidy and intact!</li>
    <li> I use this soap along with distilled water and oil mixture. My hair is clean and not matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for those trying to find a non sulfate, ecofriendly shampoo.</li>
    <li> This soap ought to last me an entire year. I wanted a two pack because I sleep at my girlfriend&#x27;s apartment a good amount of the time, and often don&#x27;t want to use her SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate)-ridden personal hygiene products when I am bathing or showering. I dilute this with some water in old shampoo bottles, and after the past month of daily usage, I have yet to hit the one inch depth mark on either bottle (the bottle I leave at my apartment and the bottle I leave at hers). So yeah. Not a ripoff. It&#x27;s a lot of damn highly concentrated soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice as a facial cleanser, but if it continues to work so well, I LOVE IT. I massaged it on my face as directed with a hot washcloth, and after just two uses it has left my face feeling (and appearing) cleaner, softer, and more fresh than my national-best-seller products. I haven&#x27;t used moisturizer following, and am not dried out. It is even clearing out blackheads like no product I&#x27;ve used before- and I&#x27;ve tried many. It smells SO GOOD, and is SO SIMPLE, and so much healthier for my skin and environment. I plan to use it as a body wash, shaving cream, baby wash, bath soak, and maybe some home cleaning purposes; will try it as shampoo (have been just using baking soda for last few months). I&#x27;m really happy to find this one great product to simplify and save in so many ways! If things change, I&#x27;ll update my opinion, but so far I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I don&#x27;t care for peppermint, which is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s best-known soap. Their almond soap, however, is really impressive. It gets you clean, which is the most important part, rinses easily, all that basic soap stuff, and it has a wonderful, sophisticated fragrance that seems to go on and on, not a harsh or cheap smelling perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once used Bee &amp; Flower Ginseng soap, and this Dr. Bronner&#x27;s almond soap reminds me of it as far as sharing an exotic, sophisticated scent. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap will actually CLEAN you as well as smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended. Every single guy ought to know about this soap. I&#x27;d never wear cologne but the extremely subtle scent left by this soap could practically come with a must-get-laid guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful stuff. Wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it. Soap is basic and personal and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s almond soap is a suave choice. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Cleans great, smells great and rinses off easily.  We have been buying this soap for years and unless gets to expensive we will keep buying it.  A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time so am looking forward to many years of buying and using this soap</li>
    <li> This soap is simply fantastic. With its organic ingredients and great scent (unlike their other soaps), it is the perfect soap to use as a body soap. I personally use it both as a bath/shower soap and for ordinary hand soap. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work too well as a hand soap unless it is in a specialized dispenser. Even with that fact, I love it enough to attempt to use it as one anyway. I even know of people who use this as a shampoo. A great buy!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soaps.  The almond scent is great for the winter and the peppermint is great for the summer.  These soaps get me sqeaky clean without drying my skin and don&#x27;t leave as much soap scum in my shower.  This two pack is a great value.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the citrus scent next.</li>
    <li> My hair gets played with A LOT as I spend a lot of time with my seraget mom in a salon. Which means lots and lots of product. My hair seemed gritty and actually disgusting and at the same time I was looking for something natrual. I came across this and I LOVE IT! I use it all over. I do add conditionair and have come to the conclusion you cant wash your hair EVERYDAY with this but I wash mine every three days or so and thats fine. Cant stress enough how much I LOVE this soap! I use it everywhere!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years--all different fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the other day, I&#x27;m in a discount store, and see a product with the same list and syntax of ingredients, at a price far below Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. I buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistake.  The peppermint lacks the same strength of aroma. Furthermore, it takes 2x the volume to get the same lather.  So, in reality, it is no bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Emanuel Bronner, master scientist and rabbi, wherever you are, I pledge not to stray again.  There is only 1 castile soap, and it is yours.</li>
    <li> I use this for everything. Definitely buy a foaming pump for it for hand wash. Cuispro makes a nice one on amazon for $15, and it&#x27;s definitely worth it. You use 75-80% less soap that way and it makes for a much nicer foamy texture, which you do not otherwise get. I use it for hands, dishes, body wash, shampoo, face wash, to bathe the dogs and pigs, etc. I thought it might over dry my hair but I was amazed at the results. It came out better than any expensive shampoo and it made my hair very shiny and caught the light beautifully. My husband asked me if I highlighted my hair because it looked so different. I just used a bit of coconut oil as conditioner and voila!</li>
    <li> I love  Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soap.  I have been using it for the last 30 years and it is absolutely the best thing for sensitive skin.  It isn&#x27;t always easy to find it but it is worth the search.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used many different scents of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps. I love the smell of almond, but when I used it as a dish detergent, it did not cut grease at all, not even regular plates (left fingerprints). This has happened twice with 2 separate bottles (the first bottle was not almond), turning my water filmy, but with the first bottle, I thought it was my something in my sprayer bottle mixed with water. This time it was pure. I have bought several bottles, but 2 of them were not good, so I do not want to give it another try, thinking that I am helping the environment, but in the end, not getting to use the product. I would retract this if I thought it was a one-off, but it has happened 20% of the time. If I could possibly be doing something wrong, I would love to know so that I could go back to using it. I used it the same all times (as a dish detergent, laundry detergent, and all-purpose cleaner).</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;This almond and hemp soap from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is truly amazing! It has none of the harmful ingredients found in many commercial soaps, like sodium laryl sulfate, etc. It&#x27;s pure and smells absolutely fabulous. The scent is very natural and authentic too, not perfume-like. One thing you should be aware of is that it doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot because it has no chemical foaming agents; this, however, is fine by me. I just use a little bit more, or clean up without the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has natural oils in it as well so that it&#x27;s not drying. I use it solely as a bath soap, but apparently all of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps can be used for everything from body care to household cleaning. I love this soap and find it gentle enough to even use on my face, yet it does clean thoroughly. I love how it makes shaving my legs easy as well, because of the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves little to no residue. I have read that it can be used to brush your teeth, do the dishes, and bathe your pets! The only thing I have found that it doesn&#x27;t work too well for is as a shampoo, but I have color-treated hair, and it seems to leave it dry. If you have natural healthy hair, you can probably use it for shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked, and plan to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s exclusively from now on as a mainstay in my home. I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural and versatile product like this for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> Best product EVER !!!</li>
    <li> This soap smells great and is very effective. It only takes a tiny bit to create a heavy lather. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to the perfumes in regular soap, but this soap gives me no negative reaction whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Saponified Organic Coconut &amp; Organic Olive Oils (w/ Retained Glycerin), Organic Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Natural Bitter Almond Fragrance, Citric Acid, Vitamin E</li>
    <li> Have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar and liquid soaps for years!  Dilute the liquid soad though!</li>
    <li> I ove this soap, you can do anything with it, bathe, make your own tooth gel, laundry detergent anything.  The Peppermint is better for making tooth gel.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so good.  When purchased through Amazon, it is a lot cheaper than in stores.  I payed $14 for a 16oz bottle at Whole Foods, and from Amazon, you get 2-32oz bottles for $21.  Sounds like a better deal to me. This is also a great product if you are sensitive to some of the stuff they put in some other more popular soaps like dial or irish spring.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Contains no carcinogens, like cocamide DEA, or detergents as do many commercial soaps and shampoos.  It&#x27;s just pure, unadulterated, saponified soap.  I&#x27;m not sure when I originally ordered this (came in two 32-oz bottles), but I&#x27;m not even 50% through my order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a an active, fit man who used unscented Dove soap for the last 15 years.  I was looking for something animal-friendly as a replacement and I was motivated by the reviews to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for washing my entire body, including my hair, and my skin has never felt so soft.  It dried my face a little the first time I used it so, after doing a little research, I started mixing it 50/50 with jojoba oil for washing my face, and that has helped.  I use the jojoba post-shower as well, but I always needed a moisturizer after showering.  Interestingly, I no longer need moisturizer for the rest of my body.  Instead of drying the skin everywhere else, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s leaves it very soft and smooth without any drying.  I love the way that water beads on my skin now.  I&#x27;ve always liked the familiar almond scent that is used for this soap.  It&#x27;s subtle, not feminine, and is reduced to a very mild soap smell after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great for my hair as well.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem dried by it at all, as other reviewers have experienced.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps. I&#x27;ve tried the peppermint and almond.  I love that they are not watery thin like some others and they lather well.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a very LONG time but was scared I wouldn&#x27;t like it. I finally purchased the product yesterday at a local shop and I really like it! I smelled both the pepperment and lavender, were afraid they would be a bit too strong, and got the almond instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather I got was light and creamy, which I really enjoyed. But if you&#x27;re used to a soapy lather, it might take a while to get used to this. I put 2 squirts on my loofa, scrubbed and rinsed. It left me feeling very refreshed and clean and the scent was very light and pleasant. I kept smelling my arm! It also didn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the small bottle and cant wait until I finish it so I can try the citrus and the rose scent. I may even get the pepperment for hubby, I see from other reviews it&#x27;s great for shaving. I usually mix sea salt with oils for a scrub. I bet this would be fantastic with some sea salt added! I&#x27;m going to try that and also try washing my laundry with this stuff this weekend :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t contain any BS, has a crazy label and cleans everything.  It&#x27;s the only soap you need.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff..I use it for everything; washing, shaving. The other day I got some in my mouth while washing and I was alarmed at how good it tastes. Yum. Great for using with small children but I would watch and make sure they don&#x27;t discover its pleasant taste as I did...</li>
    <li> This is a great size bottle.  The smell is amazing.  I use this in my laundry and it is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this soap.  It smells sooo good.  We use it as a body wash.  Just fill a pump dispenser with half Dr Bronners and half water and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it&#x27;s safe for my family and the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have never made your own body wash or used liquid castile soap, I will warn you that it&#x27;s much more watery than you might expect which is why we use pumps and foaming dispensers!</li>
    <li> The subject line says it all, but I wonder why the price keeps going up so much these last several years.  That sent me to Amazon to find the best price.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of my favorite soap. Great for people who suffer from allergies and also can be used for so many things. In our home we use it for body soap, hand soap, and dish soap. I dilute it about 1:4 and a large jug lasts pretty long this way. Another great thing about this soap is that it quickly gets a nice lather and rinses off almost instantly! Saves a lot of water when washing hands! We love this soap and my whole family uses it now after visiting and experiencing it first hand :)</li>
    <li> fantastic product. it foams a lot and thus lasts forever. the itch that I sometimes used to get in my scalp is history. highly recommended and will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and good for so many uses.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does create a slippery film on the bottom of the tub.</li>
    <li> Love the Almond scent.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite Dr. Bronner scents/formulas.  I do notice however that with this particular flavor, for some reason, it varies when I buy at different stores and online.  Sometimes it loses its scent or it smells different.  Besides that, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Way cheaper on Amazon than my local health food store!  Amazon prime makes it a super win!  The cherry almond scent is my favorite and my boyfriend even loves it!</li>
    <li> Decided to start making my own cleaners.  I have been making my own laundry detergent for some time and decided it was time to do the same for all my products.  So I bought the almond Dr. Bonner knowing that these products are good.  I have made an all purpose cleaner and love it.  Such a clean and fresh smell to my home.  As soon as I run out of other products on hand I plan on branching out using the castile soap for other things.  So far a winner.</li>
    <li> This soap really cleans great. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. You can use it to clean a whole lot of things. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time, and it is very satisfying my expectation.</li>
    <li> From a brief amount of research, it doesn&#x27;t appear that there is any aromatherapy benefit for almond scent.  But it just smells so good!  My toddler loves being washed with &amp;#34;almond soap&amp;#34;; apparently he likes the smell, too.  This is a nice neutral scent that would appeal to either gender.  I don&#x27;t notice that the scent &amp;#34;lingers&amp;#34; on my skin like perfumed soaps.  I use this in the shower on a wash cloth, I sprinkle five or six drops on a wet cloth and squeeze to create a lather.  The lather is light and is not apparent by the time I get to the last bits of my body to be washed, but I know the soap is still there.  It rinses clean away.  Bonus: Soap scum build up in my shower has decreased.  I also used this soap in an all-purpose cleanser with essential oils, vinegar and water.  I&#x27;m going to try it next in a foaming pump soap dispenser, so I&#x27;ll post back with results of that adventure!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  You only need a dime size.  Should last forever.</li>
    <li> What a great product!!  I gave a bottle to my two daughters and husband and am telling all of my cousins how nice this soap is.  No film, and a softness that I usually don&#x27;t get from soap.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> best soap ever, i have been using it for years now and i&#x27;m very pleased with the soap. thank you</li>
    <li> Enough Said.  If you haven&#x27;t been educated on Dr. Bronners, hurry up.  This is all natural , organic soap that has natural oils that will treat the most sensitive skin with ease.  Ezcema or other skin irritations MUST have the magic soaps.  This isn&#x27;t the soap your momma use to make.  I wouldn&#x27;t put any other soap on my body.  If you are using any other soap, you are missing out on life.  Yes.  I said it.  It is that critical to a healthy, balanced and well noursihed body.  Your skin is the largest organ of your body.  Take care of it.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used for over 20 years. Cleans wonderfully for just about everything. We even tried it in our new Bissell carpet cleaner instead of the usual synthetic stuff, and the carpets came cleaner than ever before with only a small amount. It&#x27;s highly concentrated so it goes a LONG way. What I like best about it is that it lathers well and rinses away with no soapy residue left on the skin. I even use it as a shampoo for my hair for the first treatment, followed by Jason&#x27;s Tea Tree oil as the second wash, rinse. As a shampoo without the Jason&#x27;s afterwards, it tended to weigh my hair down a bit, but the Jason&#x27;s fixes the pH. I take Dr. Bronners with me whenever I travel because using synthetic soaps after using Bronners is like putting raw chemicals on my skin. It really does make you feel good and clean. The almond scent is wonderful, but I prefer the unscented Baby Soap. All variations are very mild and gentle. We use Bronners diluted on the sink for washing hands and face, and in the shower for all over body care.</li>
    <li> When I opened the cap of this bottle to take a sniff I thought OMG this is really AMBROSIAL . I love the almond scent and have purchased many different almond oil products but this is the BEST EVER!! Dr.Bronner has captured the true essence in this soap. Of course I didn&#x27;t buy this for just the scent. I have used Dr Bronners pure castile in the Baby formula for many years. It must be the purest soap on the planet. I decided I would like a scented soap just for my hands in my dispenser on the bathroom sink. This was a fantastic decision and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy this years ago. I actually think this is a little more concentrated than the baby soap. I diluted it and it has more lather than usual. There are even bubbles in the dispenser which I never had with the baby formula. These 2 bottles should last and last as it is so concentrated. I open the original bottle every now and then just to get a heavenly whiff. There are no better soaps than Dr Bronner, for shampoo, body, cleaning, anything. No sulphates or parabens. I am so very, very happy with this most wonderful product.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with this product. Whether you use the bar or liquid, you will alway have a great product that actually work. All you have to do is find the right scent for you</li>
    <li> The fact that I give this product five stars is really a matter of personal taste. All of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps are excellent. So I&#x27;ll just judge the qualities that make this particular type (Hemp Almond) special. First, the Hemp oils are smooth and easy on the skin. Not only does this soap keep my skin clean, it seems to help keep it moisturized as well. This is important for people who may have problematic skin. Second, the product overall can be used as a shampoo and is easy on the face and scalp as well. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps have done an excellent job with helping me to care for my skin. Even if your skin isn&#x27;t problematic, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
    <li> I wanted to escape chemical laced products and use only a natural product on my hair. It cleans fine. My hair is still adjusting to the transition and is having an oil festival. The verdict is still out as to whether or not it is the right product for me. Giving it a couple more weeks before I decide.</li>
    <li> I love using this product. I just moved to Texas from Calif. and I use this soap for everything, from brushing my teeth to washing my hair to washing my towels to cleaning around the apartment. It&#x27;s a great product for anything you want to clean. It cleanses so sqeaky clean, but doesn&#x27;t leave any type of residue. I would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a multi-everything type of soap. I don&#x27;t have a lot of room in my apartment for a bunch of different cleansers so this All-one Magic soap does the tricks for me. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Its magic.  Well I have to say after doing a lot of research this stuff does it all.  I am more than pleased as is my wife with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  My skin and hair feel better than I can ever remember. I use as body wash, shampoo and everything else in between.  It has a mild smell, wonderful lather in the shower or bath and no irritation whatsoever.  I would recommend to anyone who is trying to clean up there lifestyle and live without chemicals etc.</li>
    <li> Love the performance as part of my homemade&lt;br /&gt;laundry detergent mix, and while the smell isn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;one of Almonds, it is the perfect fresh-smell for&lt;br /&gt;clean clothes.</li>
    <li> My shower used to have bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash and cleaning products.  Now I only have 1 bottle that is used for multiple purposes.  Love the almond scent for shower and cleaning, it&#x27;s not too overwhelming.  I have yet to try it on my laundry but will do that soon.  I saved so much money only having to buy 1 type of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the first bottle for almost a month and the bottle still looks full.  This stuff is gentle on your skin and easy on your pipes and the environment.  Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Can i just start by saying..I didn&#x27;t know that soap could be so versatile! It smells like fresh almonds and is perfect as a body wash. It is highly concentrated so you don&#x27;t need that much. I found that out after i put a little too much on my lofah. It seems kind of expensive however it will last so much longer than any other soap. It works well for cleaning and regular hand soap if you are looking for multi-use.</li>
    <li> Cleans your skin with a great smell and plenty of lather which makes you feel clean. Greaat value for the price.</li>
    <li> Love Bronner&#x27;s products in general, and this hemp-almond blend is our new favorite. We use it for everything; great for washing vegetables.</li>
    <li> this soap creates a messy wax buildup in the sink/tub, and if used as a hand wash makes hands feel tacky.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It leaves your skin fresh and more important, does not dry out your skin. I also tried shaving with it and was impressed by the clean shave that I had.</li>
    <li> Since this year my husband got me hook on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap Hemp Almond and Eucalyptus to use it to wash my hair and body but not my face cause it broke out my so mainly I stick only to my Dudu Osun Black Soap and homemade pore strips. However, this product has took the oil and dandruff out of my hair I got rid of my other shampoos &amp; conditioners to save money on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
