<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a Phillips AccuVac that finally died after years of use.  The battery on the Phillips died a long time ago but I was able to use it plugged in until it finally stopped working altogether.  Through asking friends and reading reviews I learned that many of today&#x27;s cordless trimmers won&#x27;t work while plugged in; unacceptable since the battery fails long before the trimmer.  This led me to decide on a corded trimmer and purchase this Conair.    I have been using it for a couple of months.  Pros: Corded.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about charging and the power is much better.  I get a clean trim in one pass instead of needing several with my old trimmer.  Cons: I don&#x27;t know what it is, I think the combs are \\&quot;sharper\\&quot; than what I&#x27;m used to.  Using the trimmer feels like my face is being scratched and makes it a little sore.  Also, the adjustable comb has only like five length settings.  I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t find a length I liked but luckily was able to.  Third, my old AccuVac had a \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; in that it had a slot for hairs to fall in.  I always thought it was a worthless feature since a lot of hair ended up in the sink.  Boy do I miss it now; this trimmer sends hair everywhere.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a well made unit that does what I expect.</li>
    <li> These clippers do a good job.</li>
    <li> This beats the batery operated trimmer by a mile. This was a gift for our son who said so...so superior.</li>
    <li> Con air clipper are reasonably price but i wasn&#x27;t that impressed with their cutting abilities. I ended up passing them off to a friend who had nothing to use at all. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I will be succinct with my review:    This is not a very good trimmer for short facial hair. If you want to shave your face and just have a couple days of stubble left, this is not the trimmer for you... unlike what it says in the description.</li>
    <li> Considering how much this cost and how long it could last, it&#x27;s a great deal. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to. And if you clean it and don&#x27;t drop it,  it&#x27;ll last literally years. It came fast. Within specified time. Condition was 10/10. All in all considering the price, longevity, and corded definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Unless your facial hair is peach fuzz, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut. You just about have to scrape it across your face to have it cut anything.</li>
    <li> Very powerful, cuts nicely and never have to worry about batteries. I like it very much but wish it had a few more attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers just to tapper my back and sides (I am female).  The clippers work great and they are not loud.  I would definitely recommend these as they do a great job of removing hair. For the price, you can not beat it!</li>
    <li> Bought this item and have never really been able to use it.  After 2 or 3 recharges, it doesn&#x27;t charge right, doesn&#x27;t hold charge more than 60 seconds, and doesn&#x27;t even work if you keep it plugged in.  Just another example of cheap Chines junk.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and it worked great and very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer I use it for outlining,beard,mustache trimming.Love the motor well conair has the best motors in my opinion hands down.now the only thing I had to do was adjust the blades some a lil trickie that&#x27;s why I gave 4stars.after I did that I jus started trimming and outlining away.I knew they was ment to have because they also match my conair clippers ,gr8t buy for me.........................................................................................................................................................................  Update: It has been over a year and these trimmers still going strong no problems what so ever. They outlast my clippers the blades are still sharp and no rust what so ever. Will buy these again when the time comes for a replacement.</li>
    <li> No waiting! Just plug in and go! I owned two other conair trimmers before this one. They were ok, but the batteries finally gave out. I was tired of bulky little charging stations sitting plugged in on my bathroom counter. Now, I just wrap the cord around it and throw it under the sink. When I need it, I pull it out, plug it in and go with no worries that it may die half way through the job! It was originally 9 bucks, but then AMAZON threw in a 3$ discount. For 6 bucks I am one happy camper. It works just as well, if not better than the other 20$ trimmers I have owned, and I do not have to worry about charging! I am a satisfied customer! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> A powerful little trimmer.  Best part, no dead batteries when you go to use it.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck.  Other con air razors I used in the shower and they rust out and break.  I think the reason this one is still working is I dont want to take 120v into the shower :)  Writing this review 2 years later - this is great value and longevity.</li>
    <li> It works. It is very affordable.    The only negative -- it does not have a simple adjustment to get a very close trim.</li>
    <li> Another Chinese crap!! Really cheap stuff! The combs are really fragile and pulled my beard! And the trimmer&#x27;s head looks like it going to break every time you change combs. I would recommend investing a little more like for an Andis outliner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple months ago and I have no complaints so far.  The price is great compared to other trimmers and it is so much easier having it plug into the wall instead of having a rechargable (which tend to die quickly).      The product is a trimmer and is not an electric razor.  It is for trimming hair down; however I still think it can trim fairly close to the skin (it is not for shaving you face if that is what you are thinking).  I use it for a variety of areas and it has a close cut.</li>
    <li> I would definitely order this product for another gift. I love the fact it&#x27;s a plug in trimmer and so did the client I bought it for. I was not disappointed! Thanks</li>
    <li> this little unit comes with an adjustable head to cut your beard or mustache different lengths, and being a true 120 volt motor, is powerful enough to cut all your hair if you wanted.  This is a grooming mustache trimmer so it has a small head and it would take awhile to cut all your hair, but unlike rechargeable ones, it is powerful enough to do it.  I wish I could get a nose hair trimmer that was 120v plug in too, as I get tired of wasting good money buying rechargeable garbage that loses power quick and then pulls hairs, for more money than what this powerful clean cutting machine does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for the person that wants a powerful unit sitting on the sink ready to trim their beard at any moment for years to come, without worrying about batteries wearing out or being dead when you need it. It didn&#x27;t come with oil for oiling the head, but one drop of any oil in the house will keep it running smooth a long time. More than worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this from K mart for 9.99. After using it for 1 week the tip was broken. I am going to return it.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer and at a cheap price. I like it.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t straight razor my face because of razor burn. And lets be honest, I bought this for the pubes. Nothing like whacking down a jungle with this beast. I was going to use a machete but didn&#x27;t want to risk it. This product cut thorough them like a Samurai sword through hot butter. 10/10 would whack again.</li>
    <li> I switched to a wired model because I was sick of having batteries that barely hold a charge after a year of use.  Coming from a Wahl wireless model I have found it&#x27;s cutting power to be sub-par vs. that however.  I have to regularity go over the same area with 2,3,4 passes to get the job done.  It also occasionally tugs on the hair... I never experienced this with any of my wireless ones Remington, Wahl, etc).  Lastly I used to use my previous trimmer to cut close to the skin around the beard.  This is useless for that so I go back to the blade for trimming the non-beard areas.</li>
    <li> Although,the product&#x27;s quality is not the best,it still provides for an overall performance.Besides that it came extremely fast,and that alone stands out for itself! Amazon&#x27;s services are one of the best,and very reliable.</li>
    <li> Great considering what it cost.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. a great value, non-battery, lightweight. quality and value. easily replaceable when needed to discard and or replace with another when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was the best trimmer I have ever bought . I worked very well for me in all aspects both in price as well as performance I strongly recommend this product to any others</li>
    <li> I bought this because it plugs into the wall, I was tired of having rechargeable trimmers that puttered out before I was finished.  This doesn&#x27;t do that, but unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t have much power to begin with.  There&#x27;s just not a lot of oomph here, you have to make several passes over the same area to attempt a close trim, but it never does a stellar job.  I&#x27;m going to keep it for those emergencies when my rechargeable is dead or being finicky, but sadly, this is not the replacement I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> i was suggesting since it is for beard it should be cleaning my beard like a baby bottom but doesn&#x27;t work like that after used i still have to used razor in which im trying to avoid.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was sick of batteries wearing out on the chargeable models. Thought I would give it a try despite the reviews. It cuts ok and will keep it till I decide to buy a nice barber quality, corded model (then will keep it for backup). If you dont trim much but need a trimmer, I see no use in buying anything more expensive. If you have to trim at least a couple times a week, I would recommend just putting what you would spend on this toward a nice one that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend  requested  corded  trimmer for  birthday  I got  this  because  of  price .  He  tried  it  and  was  very  happy .  Said  it had  good  power  for  his  thick  hair  and  is  very  satisfied .  Now  I  am  too!</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my mustache and it won&#x27;t cut anything including soft butter save your money and get a pair of sissors</li>
    <li> Like having a corded trimmer rather than one with a battery that may/may not hold a charge. However, blade head is too wide for convenient, precise trimming of mustache at upper lip. Also, not much adjustment to mustache trimmer heads.</li>
    <li> Beats the H... out of Andis and Wahl when it comes to grooming your dog....  Cheap enough to throw away after a couple uses and with the cord... never runs out of power...  This order was for five more and I will continue to use these to groom our two standard poodles.  Again... the best damn pet groomer there is....</li>
    <li> The Conair trimmer is built well and seems like it will last, but I find the trimmer blades are either a little dull or they cut to slowly.  I have had my facial hair snag a little which can be a little discomforting but overall I am pleased with this product,</li>
    <li> very good and serves it&#x27;s purpose quite well. I&#x27;m gald I bought it. I&#x27;ve been using it fod a few month now and I thinks it was worth buying. No batterys needed anymore. This is my second bought. I gave the other one to my brother.</li>
    <li> None of the included attachments are short enough for my liking.  It also doesn&#x27;t have strong rpm&#x27;s, but for $7.50 I suppose it&#x27;s hard to complain too much.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the attachments or anything..I was just lookin for a corded trimmer I could use to trim my stubles and keep it short. This is definitely the tool for the job! I didn&#x27;t want one of those fancy pants rechargable trimmers..In all my years whether its doing yard work or wood work or whatever it may be..The tools with a cord get the job done best..And I got a conair hair clipper that cost me about $10 when I bought it and its about 15 years old and that thing cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter. So I said, lets get a conair because conair makes the right tools for the jobs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you got the 2 year warranty which you probably won&#x27;t ever have to use..But if by chance use was to maybe have a problem you send back to the guys at conair and they take care of use because they run a tight ship over there..Good guys over there. Those other cordless trimmers over there, what kind of warranty they give use? I bet 6 months because they know after 6 months they don&#x27;t work so well no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can take your little cordless trimmer and put it back on its little charger over there..I will put my conair corded trimmer back in my tool box!</li>
    <li> This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased so I did a lot of research. I went to a few local stores and found a lot that just felt flimsy and most depended on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time and am very happy with the results. The trimmer feels solid and is very easy to handle for defining my beard. The guides are very helpful and easy to put on/remove from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer and hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> Nice, this is a profesional stuf</li>
    <li> No problems here other than the color. It&#x27;s a bit pink for my liking but it works well. I can&#x27;t stand battery powered junk that quits working before I&#x27;m done.The attatchments are a bit tricky at first to get the hang of because the seem to cut at strange angles but over all when you figure it out they&#x27;re good.</li>
    <li> I have been using battery operated beard trimmers forever; this is a life saver! I would recommend this product over any battery operated one.</li>
    <li> Nice because there&#x27;s no recharging. I think corded is always better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m careful about buying cordless appliances, because they&#x27;re often under-powered, and run out of charge before the job is done. Batteries can lose the ability to hold a charge, and replacements usually cost more than the appliance itself. As far as trimming my beard and mustache, I need to have my glasses on in front of a mirror, so a cord doesn&#x27;t really limit me any further. The GMT8RCS does a fine job, and I&#x27;d give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. I&#x27;m knocking off 1/2 star for the attachments. I&#x27;d like to see different attachments for various lengths of cut, rather than the adjustable one included with this unit. You do get separate sideburn tapering attachments, but I don&#x27;t use them - I just free-hand it. Overall, I expect to get plenty of use from this trimmer, and consider it a very good value.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a while now.  It is a good product and has some quality to it.</li>
    <li> awesome little trimmer</li>
    <li> I want to send it back first time I use it and it get stuck on your beard.</li>
    <li> The blade is not sharp enough. I have to press is so hard on my forehead to get a tape. Even after so many repetitions,  I still could not get a good tape. I am not satisfied with the blade. I don&#x27;t use it anyone</li>
    <li> **Update**&lt;br /&gt;These overheated on me in late December 2015.  The plug prongs got so hot they partially welded themselves to the metal in the outlet.  Luckily they were plugged into a GFCI, so only a little spark and a tripped breaker.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that something worse would have happened if they weren&#x27;t plugged into a GFCI!  I trashed these and purchased:  Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Grooming Kit #9854-600  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3GEY?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0).  Excellent set of trimmers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this, and its perfect so far.  I got tired of replacing the batteries in my wireless trimmer, so I purchased this.  Not only is this quieter, but it gives a closer shave than my old trimmer!  No batteries to replace either.  Can get a little hot if used for more than three or four minutes.  Great buy for the price.  Don&#x27;t hesistate!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works excellent for trimming beards. Blows pretty much every cordless model out of the water.  The one complaint that I have is that the adjustable plastic guard is junky and doesn&#x27;t have many levels of adjustment. I wish the guard would improve and I would be fully willing to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Powerful consideringhow light weight it is. The clippers work perfectly on my mustache and facial hair. Considering the low price, this is a great investment.</li>
    <li> Works great!  It is exactly what I was looking for and I don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries!  Using it for my dog!</li>
    <li> Seen one exactly at ross for $15. Works great. Even for chest and pubic.</li>
    <li> Its a great trimmer. I bought this for my husband. High quality. Easy to clean. It trimmed my husband&#x27;s beard pretty good. Works amazing on him. Its worth in every penny!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a neck/ears trimmer during haircut for my children.&lt;br /&gt;Used just only once and very satisfied. Seems to be a very good product. If it last more than 3 years then it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I cut hair for a living and needed some inexpensive trimmers for work. They do a decent job of trimming &#x27;round the ears and the neck. Mustaches and beards too. The only reason I can&#x27;t give a five star rating is because these trimmers can not cut all the way to the skin. I recently ordered a higher priced Wahl trimmer to replace these but I sent them back because they cut a customer&#x27;s neck twice the second day I used them.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as he wanted new clippers to help trim his beard. Unfortunetly this was not powerful enough. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for some time now.  Much better than the Remington cordless one I used before.  This one is cheap, works well and can get pretty close to the skin with no guard.  Very satisfied with the price.</li>
    <li> Just like he battery op model but with the piece of mind that an AC cord will give. For me it does the job and is a decent price.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to these cats: terrible... so bad this is my first review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; rzero - &amp;#34; I bought this to trim my mustache and it won&#x27;t cut anything including soft butter save your money and get a pair of sissors&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rehan  - &amp;#34; Terrible trimmer! Do not buy! Not worth your money. I would try to return it but it came in terrible packaging and the only way to open it was to tear it apart.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> If I didn&#x27;t actually love the trimmer itself, I would have sent it back as well with a couple of other products that I had received..</li>
    <li> I was tired of my rechargeable trimmers never having enough charge when I needed them. I&#x27;ve had way too many rechargeable trimmers over the years. They all seem to last a few years then die at the most inconvenient time. Finding a corded model in stores is not easy.&lt;br /&gt;This Conair is compact and simple. It does not have the power that my Wahl has. But, it&#x27;s much smaller and easier to use on my facial hair. While it would be nice if it had a fancier trim length adjustment; The simplicity of this units design makes is super easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick facial hair and have had no problems with it bogging down or pinching. I don&#x27;t trim with fast motions. Maybe that&#x27;s why it works so well for me?&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Have had good experience with this clipper.  Worked great until my wife used it to try to clip a German Shepard.  Great for human beards and stashes.  Badddd for dogs.  Needed to get a second one afterwards and had to cut the old one out of the Shepard&#x27;s fur.  Second one works good too!  (Hiding it from the wife!) :)</li>
    <li> I love the fact it is corded. It cuts well. But it is impossible to clean and it rusted out after just a year. That is what I get for keeping it in the bathroom where we take our showers...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer would recommend to trim bread down. I got tried of wireless trimmer always dies on me.</li>
    <li> Admittedly it isn&#x27;t good for a close shave, but it works well for everything else. I use it combination with disposable razor and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has been my best so far. I got tired of batteries going out or previous trimmers breaking down altogether. This one is just the right size and more than adequately powerful for trimming my beard and mustache. I was a bit worried about the strength from the previous reviews. No worries at all. Great product.</li>
    <li> Works well, light weight, and no batteries to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:attracts beard hair through heavy static. It&#x27;s -very- hard to clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to edge and trim my goatee. I use an electric Norelco shaver and didn&#x27;t want to have to use a straight blade on my face anymore. It Trims okay but does not edge very well. I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a better edger</li>
    <li> I have been through rechargeable, battery operated and trimmers that were not powerful enough and were always losing charge and dying out.  Ordered larger electric thinking that is what I needed and learned the hard way that I didn&#x27;t need professional hair trimmers.  Finally got the right size and with the electric I don&#x27;t have to have poor charging or batteries going out all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would have ordered the electric the first time.  Runs with more power and is much faster than non-electric.  This one also has a nice long cord and two mustache and beard thinning attachments.</li>
    <li> This was a special offer and my old unit was broken.  With the free shipping, it seemed like a gift.  The fact that you know you have to plug it in removes all of the annoyance of the rechargeable battery units as they age and refuse to take a charge.</li>
    <li> The trimmers don&#x27;t cut nor trim like it was advertised. You get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great investment. Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy this. Highly recommend this product. You can not go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband and kids hair.  This is perfect for trimming side burns and ears.  My husband uses it for his beard and mustache.  Very nice and quiet.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy, just your standard plug-in trimmer. Get the job done, though it&#x27;s a little louder than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a replacement for a cordless trimmer that failed to keep a charge. This one works well for what I need.</li>
    <li> Love this product Well Conair is always good products. Arrived earlier than exspected packaged great safe. Use it when i cut my hair and beard. thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim off a 5 day growth of beard after which I would complete the job with a razor. This trimmer struggled to cut the beard, requiring multiple passes over each area. I will not use it again, it is not worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although reasonably priced, if it won&#x27;t do the job, it becomes expensive.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my beard/mustache lined up (i don&#x27;t use the attachments)between haircuts and its perfect for that. The machine is well made and not cheap plastic. I had a similar battery operated version which work good as well but batteries died way too quickly. This is much better and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love that this trimmer is actually corded, I have never cared for or had great luck w/ cordless and rechargeable razors. It is about what one can expect for the price, the quality could be much better, the plastic of the case is very light weight, the blades are also of typical Chinese quality standards, in other words not great. I figure this will be good for a year or twos service before it will need replaced, we&#x27;ll see. At the price it is near \\&quot;disposable\\&quot;. I wish it wasn&#x27;t the only corded beard trimmer I could find as I would prefer a solid quality product at a higher cost, but for the price it deserves a four star rating.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, however it really doesn&#x27;t get very close. I was hoping to use for some detail work due to it&#x27;s size and not requiring batteries that always go bad after a year or so.</li>
    <li> In the description it says the blade&#x27;s head is 3 inches wide, but it is only over 1 inch wide. THIS IS A GOOD thing, because if the blade were 3 inches wide, it would be a shaver not a trimmer. This is powerful enough to shave all your hair if you wanted but it would be hard to do so. Its pretty nice, it can cut really small hair on your upper lip and u can trim your fangs near your ears with it. Also, it comes with a little kit, so you can pick how long you want to keep your beard. All in all it is a really good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works great. I needed a replacement for my battery operated trimmer, and this trimmer is perfect. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Short cord is a pro/con depending on arrangement; I would like more &amp;#34;short-crop&amp;#34; settings .. but for the price, it seems like an ok product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Works better than my super expensive sharper image one with all the bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re on our 3rd one.  Does an awesome job, but only for a certain amount of time...then although the motor works strongly, the mechanism that changes circular motion to back and forth motion seems to quit.  Several handi guys have taken them apart but never get them working again.  BUT we get WAY MORE than 10 bucks of value out of them before they die.  When this one goes, will reorder again!!!</li>
    <li> This replaced a rechargeable, cordless Conair model with all the bells and whistles that I bought my fiance several years ago.  The old unit wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore so he asked for one with a cord for his birthday.  This was the only Conair corded version, and it was really cheap, but he just loves it.  No more worrying about it losing power mid-stream or trying to figure out when to charge it for future use.  (You couldn&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time.)  While I didn&#x27;t like the bright red color or the cord, I relented with his  promise that he&#x27;d keep it under the bathroom counter instead of leaving it out in plainn sight.  The good news is that all the  attachments from the prior unit fit this one too.</li>
    <li> We love it, arrived timely and is as described</li>
    <li> I bought this with a gift card I received for the holidays and if not for the fact that it was so cheap I would have sent it back immediately! This trimmer does not cut at all, it is very loud and is useless in my opinion. I guess the old adage is true that you get what you pay for; lesson learned!</li>
    <li> Terrible trimmer!  Do not buy! Not worth your money. I would try to return it but it came in terrible packaging and the only way to open it was to tear it apart.</li>
    <li> It was so hard to find a buzzer that plugs in and so happy that I found this one.  The price was great and so is the product.</li>
    <li> My favorite trimmer. And I have had a few... Doesn&#x27;t lose power like battery operated machines, doesn&#x27;t cut me yet get for close for the neck line.</li>
    <li> Not comfortable on the skin</li>
    <li> I just needed an  electric Beard trimer with a power cord and thats what I got. Nice and solid construction.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and much better than battery operated.</li>
    <li> I bought a corded trimmer because the cordless items just dont last long. This unit works well, the attachments are a little flimsy but seem to be holding up over all very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I wish it had batteries though  but it&#x27;s a nice qulity beard &amp; mustach trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped, but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain, it does the job.  And I like not having to deal with charger units that fail to keep their charge after a certain amount of use.</li>
    <li> Works really well, boys can&#x27;t break it, cleanup super easy, super sturdy. I still have the necessary I bought 10+ years ago.</li>
    <li> Got hot fast. Sharp biting blades. Ended up throwing them away.</li>
    <li> A nice trimmer, except that you have to make more than &#x27;one pass&#x27; for thick areas.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the job, didn&#x27;t want a battery version.</li>
    <li> As many others have said, the biggest plus of this unit is the fact that it plugs in and does NOT rely on batteries, rechargeable or otherwise.  I have had a Conair beard trimmer with all the fancy attachments, including 2 alternate trimming heads, and whatnot.  Only problem was it used a rechargeable battery.  It was fine for a few years but then it started getting weak before I was done trimming.  And trimming takes only a few minutes so running down that quickly is definitely annoying and unacceptable.  I made a habit of running the battery until it was totally discharged, as \\&quot;they\\&quot; recommend you do with rechargeable batteries.  But it finally got to the point where I could get part of my beard trimmed &amp; had to recharge the thing for a few hours (while I wouldn&#x27;t let myself be seen in public) so I could finish the job.  And then only just barely got it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So given that the old trimmer was fine other than the battery, I got another Conair.  Seems to me when I was shopping for that old trimmer, you couldn&#x27;t get one that just plugged in.  I was very happy to find this one, and the price is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some comments here that it doesn&#x27;t cut through the beard.  You guys must have beards like corn fields.  Maybe you ought to make your first pass with a pair of scissors before you use the electric trimmer.  I must say I sometimes get lazy &amp; let mine get a bit bushy, but the trimmer deals with it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for attachments &amp; all, I had them &amp; never used them.  I&#x27;ve always used the bare trimmer blade without any attachments.  I turn the blade over so the metal surface is against my face &amp; I shear away.  So I was perfectly satisfied that there were only a couple of attachments with this new one.  Which I will never use.  But I do wish they had included a little cleaning brush.  I just saved the one from my old trimmer.  Big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment says the cord gets twisted.  Ummmm.......  Untwist it every now &amp; then?  Duh . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment says it gets hot after 20 minutes.  What do you expect?  It&#x27;s an electric appliance.  Electricity generates heat.  What takes you 20 minutes?  We are talking about a human face here, right?  Not a gorilla?  Tools have applications.  Use this one for its INTENDED use, not something else.en?  Duh . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One comment says it gets hot after 20 minutes.  What do you expect?  It&#x27;s an electric appliance.  Electricity generates heat.  What takes you 20 minutes?  We are talking about a human face here, right?  Not a gorilla?  Tools have applications.  Use this one for its INTENDED use, not something else.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does what it claims and has a great price ($7 approx).  No dead batteries anymore and I love the color!</li>
    <li> This works better than any battery operated clipper that I have ever used. Very close cut. will only use this type for now own.</li>
    <li> Buy a real trimmer that plugs into an electric outlet, runs faster and thus trims better than battery powered models, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer at a local discount store when my old one failed after seven years of daily use.  I thought that a plug in model would be a plus after having to frequently replace three AAA batteries in my old one.  My old trimmer had more power and cut cleanly with one pass.  It also cut very close to the skin compared to the  Conair.  I also noticed that on the moving blade of the Conair, the teeth were wearing down in the middle and were shorter than the teeth toward the ends of the blade.  About a month later, it wasn&#x27;t cutting at all.  I looked closely at the blade, and while the motor was running, the blade wasn&#x27;t moving. I removed the cutting head and noticed that a part had failed.  There is a round plastic piece attached to the cutting head that accepts the small rotating metal post that comes from the motor.  The metal post had worn a hole through the plastic piece and it would no longer stay in place.  At least I only paid nine dollars for it.  My previous AAA battery powered trimmer lasted  six years and I paid six bucks for it.  Of course, I probably paid much more to keep it in batteries for six years.  Overall, the Conair was weak power-wise, did not cut efficiently, and contained defective parts.  I think I&#x27;ll give my barber fifty bucks to go buy me a professional plug in model this time.  She has had hers for many trouble free years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 rechargeable battery trimmers in the past. Both of them I disliked because the battery would lose charge mid-use, and I could not use the trimmers while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid the cord on this unit would get in my way, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature that is missing is replaceable cutting heads. My other trimmers came with  various heads such as one with a half inch blade that was great for fine detail trimming.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive beard trimmer with a cord and this is it.  It&#x27;s cheap and it has a cord.  But the quality and design leave you wishing you spent a little more money.  The adjustment comb is clunky and not terribly precise.  The cord is thin and is starting to twist, even though the trimmer is only a couple months old.  The cutting head just pops on and off on a small ball joint. There are no accessories provided like a small brush for cleaning, or any lubricant for maintaining the blades.  I really don&#x27;t need a rechargeable trimmer, since I&#x27;m about a foot from a plug.  But, it looks like it&#x27;s necessary to purchase the more expensive rechargeables to get the quality and functionality I want. It won&#x27;t be long before this trimmer is relegated to being a back-up.</li>
    <li> This product was definitely a great investment. So far it has done everything the seller promised it could do...it even worked as clippers to cut my hair. Warning using is it as actual clippers works but takes a long time ! Only con is it overheats when used for longer than 20mins.</li>
    <li> I wanted a corded trimmer specifically. I have had poor results with the less expensive battery operated models. The one works fine so far. It&#x27;s light and appears to be powerful enough. I do not like the attachments. The adjustable one is difficult to install, and the removal of any results in the accidental disengagement of the entire cutting head (which is designed to snap off for cleaning, which it most certainly does). That being said; I spent less than $10 on the cutter, and for that price I would say it rates 7.5 out of ten stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-24-2013 Update: I am having good results with this cutter. It does a fine job. It only took a short time to figure out a method to change attachments without trouble, and now it&#x27;s second nature. I would like to amend my review, and offer a full eight-of-ten stars, for function, and value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-17-2013 Still going strong. I&#x27;m using it a couple times a week, cleaning well after each use, and having no troubles at all.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I need. I no longer have to worry about charging or buy batteries just like my older trimmers.</li>
    <li> the product does not work as advertised it does not cut ur hair or mustach not enough power. I will have to eat the 18.00 i paid for this and try and find a better one.  No more Conair products for me!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and value for money; not&amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; but good for normal facial hair trimming</li>
    <li> Bought two. Powerful, corded does not pull. Tired of throwing away the battery only units that cost $30. Every six months. I have tried them all, Norelco, Wahl, Remington. These were only $ 7.57</li>
    <li> Purchased to trim my goatee.  It works well on facial hair.  The attachments are cheap but functional.  Tried to use it to shave my head with one of the attachments and cut hair will get stuck in the attachment not allowing any more hair to be cut.  After every pass you need to clean it out.</li>
    <li> All around great especially for the price</li>
    <li> I thought it does an adequate job for the money. Its not the best on the market but I didn&#x27;t want a lot of bells and whistles, just a basic trimmer. It does what its asked to do which is more than you can say for a lot of more expensive models.</li>
    <li> At the time I bought it, it was selling for around $12, for the price and value it is the best investment I ever made, it works without any issues and I like it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Dad, who is really picky about his mustache trimmer. He prefers a corded trimmer rather than battery powered and needed a nice petite trimmer to detail his mustache. This was the perfect trimmer for him. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Does the job, no problem!</li>
    <li> This shaver is great because it does not require batteries/recharging. It comes with a few attachments. It&#x27;s a great shaver!</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer for the price, small and portable. Make sure to apply oil once a month to keep it trimming your &#x27;stache for a long time. My only complain is that after applying some oil, it is a real challenge to put it together</li>
    <li> These little guys work great for my beard. I let it grow out a few days then shave. It leaves a little longer than shaving with an electric shaver. Perfect for what I wanted and the price was unbeatable. Seems to be a quality product. I will buy another one if this one ever dies, which they eventually do. Going on over a year now, think I paid $10 as an add on. I prefer wall plug ins over chargers, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that this ONLY works when plugged in and can not be charged via electricity. Primary trimmer is good - but the previous trimmer I had (another brand, which I lost while traveling) I really miss.</li>
    <li> I give my male relations haircuts and this is just right! The precision is sweet! And it reminds us of the barber&#x27;s clippers, in that the blade gives a little heat upon their head. The cord is a bit short, but we are saving money, in that we don&#x27;t have to buy any batteries. Thank you! I probably will come back and buy the same, but these seem like they will last for awhile. So, I&#x27;m unsure when that will be.</li>
    <li> With careful use this seems to work well  after some 20 trials. Would like to know how best to lubricate.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone thru several rechargeable trimmers over the years and they have ALL disappointed. So much so, that I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for years for a product with a power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was excellent, the performance is excellent and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a single comb that adjusts to five settings, so there are only two parts to keep track of. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And....did I mention it&#x27;s CORDED? No more crummy, rechargeable batteries that poop out before you&#x27;re done man-scaping!</li>
    <li> Some days I need to shave two times and using this beard and mustache trimmer makes it fast. This is a real man&#x27;s tool.</li>
    <li> Plenty of power and no rechargeable batteries to go bad.I got tired of rechargable batteries going bad.This trimmer works perfectly</li>
    <li> Good price. Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it plugs into the wall. The cordless shavers are great; however, by the time you need a battery, it is almost impossible to find a replacement. This one just plugs in the wall. No need for batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the close shave that razors give. I can shave in just a few minutes with this trimmer and I do not have to hassle with shaving cream and disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Wanted to post this review as a female. I usually use my guys trimmer so figured this would be okay for me as well. If you&#x27;re a female this trimmer will work for you. I use it to shave bikini area (with attachment), arms, and any other &amp;#34;fuzz.&amp;#34; Love that its NOT rechargeable as those never seem to last for me.</li>
    <li> You can afford to pick up another when the internals rust.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great.  I rated it 4 stars because I am  a little concerned with the life of the combs.  After multiple changes on and off they might fail.</li>
    <li> Works very well for such an inexpensive item.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because it needs no batteries. I originally had a battery operated Conair and enjoyed how close it cut with no marks. The money I save on batteries is well worth it and better for the environment too.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great if you like to leave a little stubble, or just to trim things down after not shaving for a few days.  Suprisingly powerful...MUCH better than the cordless that I no longer use.  I can&#x27;t believe this was less than $10!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. A little loud, but its an electric trimmer. Great build quality, thing feels like it will never die.</li>
    <li> Even for the price, it&#x27;s not worth it. Broken already upon opening the package. Even if it wasn&#x27;t broken at that time. The plastics inside the shaving head are thin and cheap, I think this would only last a month or so. Returned the item.</li>
