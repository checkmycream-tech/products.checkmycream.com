<li> The Color  in the photo is the color of my old set but</li>
<li> It lasted me this long and the only reason I bought this new set is because I lost the comb which I used everyday.  </li>
<li> Is much smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> i bought it for myself but am going to give it to my 3 year old niece since its soo small.</li>
<li> Used with my new and improved Conair blow dryer with its ceramic, negative ion producing heat and a retractable cord, not to mention it folds up...</li>
<li> wide.</li>
<li> but this one is less than 2&amp;#34;</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t pull with the comb or with the brush very hard since the handles are hollow on the inside.</li>
<li> it says mid-size but in reality it is small.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what I had in mind when I read mid-size</li>
<li> I would be afraid if my hair was long or thick that I&#x27;d break it.</li>
<li> but this brush is very small.</li>
<li> Also although it says it&#x27;s cushioned, it is very hard and can hurt while you run it against your head.</li>

    <li> Had this comb and brush since I was in Jr. High and I&#x27;m now in college. It lasted me this long and the only reason I bought this new set is because I lost the comb which I used everyday.  The Color  in the photo is the color of my old set but the actual Color of the new set I received is more of a darker blue and not the baby blue you see in the photo. These are gores great for travel too. I would buy again if I ever needed too.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I had in mind when I read mid-size but this brush is very small. I was looking for a palm sized brush but this one is less than 2&amp;#34; wide. Also although it says it&#x27;s cushioned, it is very hard and can hurt while you run it against your head.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a smaller brush and comb but it works great for me and my daughter. I got it to use the brush for me and the comb for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s just a basic brush and comb...no fancy frills or anything which is what I wanted so for me it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
