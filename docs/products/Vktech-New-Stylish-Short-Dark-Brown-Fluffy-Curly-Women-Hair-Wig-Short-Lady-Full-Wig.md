      <li>I wish I could write a better review; however, that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
      <li>This is a cute wig and can be used for a guy too.</li>
      <li>I love the style and fit.</li>
      <li>Came quickly and really for the price was great.</li>
      <li>However, if you don&#x27;t like your hair having a strong smell after you take it off, then don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>The wig has a strong chemical smell in the inside; I just wash my hair after I put it on.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it had a strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Is comfortable</li>
      <li>I think it will look great on a younger person.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth more than it costs here.</li>
      <li>I love this wig, the layers are beautiful, I wish they had this one in black.</li>
      <li>Its cute, and if you arrange it the right way, it has volume.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about this wig when I ordered it.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I saw this wig online that I just had to have it.</li>
      <li>I have many wigs, and I have spent a good bit of money on all kinds, styles, colors, and lengths.</li>
      <li>Most of my wigs r too large.</li>
      <li>Instead of looking like a stylish trendy modern hairstyle, it looks old and dated.  </li>
      <li>This wig is amazing for the price, I bought it and at first I was uneasy because it had such a unique style for very cheap, it did take a while to ship</li>
      <li>It says Dark Brown and its more of a very light brown .</li>
      <li>IF you put it on and style it right.  </li>
      <li>There was some problem with the courier being used to ship this item to me but the company waited for me to contact them to find out where the item was, rather than letting me know right away that they needed a street address rather than a postal box (which was never specified on the order form).  </li>
      <li>I woudn&#x27;t have a problem with the small amount of hair on the wig as it would be a great summer wig if the style was as seen in the picture.  </li>
      <li>As a joke I stuck it on my husbands head and was so surprised it actually looked good.</li>
      <li>very brittle and huge chunks of them come out with any type of brush or comb, sometimes even if I handled it too much.</li>
      <li>The wig is very much like the picture</li>
      <li>This is actually one of the better ones I have, I wore it to senior prom without any suspicion, and was complimented by many.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>Product looked exactly as described</li>
      <li>So this is my first time ever wearing a wig.</li>
      <li>This hair piece is exactly like I thought it would be,I&#x27;am</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, no matter how I work with it, I can&#x27;t get it to look anything like the picture.</li>
      <li>I must say I love the color and style in the picture, but not the same.</li>
      <li>I used it as a stage prop, however, it looked good enough up close to be worn on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>However, perhaps it would be just fine for short period usage, say in a play or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although the price was amazing, after shipping costs are included, the overall price is similar to others on the market.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very please with the wig.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold styling very well no matter what products are used (hair spray, hair wax,</li>
      <li>It looks real, if that helps you.</li>
      <li>It is very inexpensive, so maybe I was expecting too much.</li>
      <li>Not real looking, but for that money, that&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>so much of it falls out.</li>
      <li>Cute dark brown wig.  </li>
      <li>There was no problem with smell and since my head is small I was pleased with size.</li>
      <li>Fit range was smaller than expected</li>
      <li>Came early.</li>
      <li>It is kinda small, but it fits my head fine, I would recommend styling it though.</li>
      <li>but it was too small to fit around either of our heads.</li>
      <li>Shake it out and let the loose hair fall, and style it curly or straight.  </li>
      <li>you need a short brown wig I would highly suggest a different seller.</li>
      <li>The wig was, indeed, dark brown,  The hair was absolutely straight (no fluff at all).  </li>
      <li>There are two long strands of hair near where my ears are that just don&#x27;t make sense.</li>

    <li> Cute pixie cut  not the best n will not buy again  had to play with it and rub my fingers to get that messy look like the pic, to small for my head</li>
    <li> It was a gift and the person liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> Product looked exactly as described</li>
    <li> Unbelievable price! I am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Cute dark brown wig.  Shake it out and let the loose hair fall, and style it curly or straight.  Comes with net and adjustable elastic straps inside.  Cute and good price.</li>
    <li> I wish I could write a better review; however, that&#x27;s not the case. I was so excited when I saw this wig online that I just had to have it. Unfortunately, no matter how I work with it, I can&#x27;t get it to look anything like the picture. Instead of looking like a stylish trendy modern hairstyle, it looks old and dated.  The wig in the picture looks much fuller than the actual product, which has very little hair on it. There are two long strands of hair near where my ears are that just don&#x27;t make sense. They are way longer than any of the other hair. Straightened they look strange and curled they look like kiss curls and out of place on this wig.  I woudn&#x27;t have a problem with the small amount of hair on the wig as it would be a great summer wig if the style was as seen in the picture.  The color is supposed to be dark brown but it is dark brown with quite a reddish tint.  Although the price was amazing, after shipping costs are included, the overall price is similar to others on the market.  There was some problem with the courier being used to ship this item to me but the company waited for me to contact them to find out where the item was, rather than letting me know right away that they needed a street address rather than a postal box (which was never specified on the order form).  I am very sorry to have to write this review in this way. I was really excited about this wig when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Not as it appears!!!!!! Poor quality!!!!</li>
    <li> Wig in good condition. The color is what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
    <li> So this is my first time ever wearing a wig. The sole reason I bought it was to know how I looked with short hair if I ever thought of getting myself a short hair style. I believe this wig equals the money it costs. Its cute, and if you arrange it the right way, it has volume. However, if you don&#x27;t like your hair having a strong smell after you take it off, then don&#x27;t buy it. The wig has a strong chemical smell in the inside; I just wash my hair after I put it on. Hope this review is of use.</li>
    <li> I had to do a lot of adjusting with this</li>
    <li> This is a cute wig and can be used for a guy too. As a joke I stuck it on my husbands head and was so surprised it actually looked good. Alas he wouldn&#x27;t lesve it on. Made such a improvement over a semi bald head.lol.</li>
    <li> I love the style and fit.But the quality is very very poor .Every time you touch it  so much of it falls out. I gave it to Goodwill. I will not recommend this company  to anyone.</li>
    <li> This hair piece is exactly like I thought it would be,I&#x27;am a hair stylist,so styling is easy.here is no shedding on my hair piece,with care it will last.Thank you good customer service also.</li>
    <li> it worked for what i needed</li>
    <li> Also required a good bit of thinning and triming.....Is comfortable</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend. It was good and the right color and good quality but it was too small to fit around either of our heads.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I love this wig, the layers are beautiful, I wish they had this one in black.</li>
    <li> I got this one in the wrong color, but instead of sending it back, I just gave it to a hospital that gives away wigs to people who have cancer. It came in jet black. I think it will look great on a younger person. They were so happy to get them. So, now I look for on sale wigs and buy them to give them away. Came quickly and really for the price was great. Be careful that the color in the picture isn&#x27;t what your going to get. I was the one who made the mistake.</li>
    <li> IT WAS VERY BAD!!!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!! IT WILL GO TO THE TRASH IN ONE MINUT AFTER YOU OPEN THE  thing.</li>
    <li> I just received this product today, 9/26/15. I ordered since April. I must say I love the color and style in the picture, but not the same.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, the fit, color shortness is perfect, will be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Came with no instructions.  Very small.  Does not look like picture and hair falling off wig whenever handled.  For the price I didn&#x27;t think it would be any better.  Just has to see.</li>
    <li> This was a great wig!  Looks fantastic on!  I used it as a stage prop, however, it looked good enough up close to be worn on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews I was a little worried. What I did was wash let dry then sprayed with wig spray. There was no problem with smell and since my head is small I was pleased with size. Most of my wigs r too large. I ordered another.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied.  For the price, it is good quality.</li>
    <li> This wig is defiantly better quality than a lot of wigs I have bought before. Very difficult to cut the bangs in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The wig is very much like the picture IF you put it on and style it right.  I have many wigs, and I have spent a good bit of money on all kinds, styles, colors, and lengths. This is actually one of the better ones I have, I wore it to senior prom without any suspicion, and was complimented by many.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it will look like the picture if you spend the time styling it. It is definitely worth more than it costs here.</li>
    <li> Fit range was smaller than expected</li>
    <li> Not real looking, but for that money, that&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> Came early. Too small. Sheds everywhere. It looks real, if that helps you. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst quality wigs I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I&#x27;ve bought $4 wigs off eBay before.&lt;br /&gt;The fibers are very brittle and huge chunks of them come out with any type of brush or comb, sometimes even if I handled it too much. It doesn&#x27;t hold styling very well no matter what products are used (hair spray, hair wax, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;If you need a short brown wig I would highly suggest a different seller.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing for the price, I bought it and at first I was uneasy because it had such a unique style for very cheap, it did take a while to ship but I was very pleased with the quality, its not shiny and no hair falls out when washing or brushing unlike other wigs I&#x27;ve bought. It is kinda small, but it fits my head fine, I would recommend styling it though.</li>
    <li> Not enough hair to style the wig.</li>
    <li> The color din&#x27;t match. It says Dark Brown and its more of a very light brown .</li>
    <li> When am I going to received my hair?</li>
    <li> too cheap &#x3D; bad quality.  No more explanations</li>
    <li> I was unimpressed by this wig. Granted, i didn&#x27;t put much effort into it, but I found it very difficult to style. It did not style like the picture. It looked like a mop of messy hair. Additionally, it had a strong chemical smell. Lastly, strands of hair kept falling out, and all I did was try it in 3 times. I ended up throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for practical reasons, I lost my hair during radiation. However, perhaps it would be just fine for short period usage, say in a play or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my personal disclaimer, I have zero wig experience; therefore, I have nothing to compare it to. It is very inexpensive, so maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe if you&#x27;re used to wigs you&#x27;d have an easier time styling it. I&#x27;m not sure. As I said, I didn&#x27;t try hard.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Good service</li>
    <li> The wig was, indeed, dark brown,  The hair was absolutely straight (no fluff at all).  I could not get it to be fluffy.  Wig was very small; coming nowhere even average size.</li>
    <li> could not style it at all and took forever to get here</li>
    <li> It came in a baggie. When you brush it the hair falls out.</li>
    <li> I was just as it looks in the picture. I&#x27;m very please with the wig.</li>
