<li> Which is kinda creepy after a while you notice men following you from place to place...</li>
<li> is it was so small</li>
<li> Like to keep on hand these travel sizes for taking along on outings/nights out when I&#x27;m carrying a small purse.  </li>
<li> IT WAS SO SMALL.  </li>
<li> The container was very small for the price, but I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
<li> When I bought this in Victoria&#x27;s Secret, the scent lasted all day.  </li>
<li> So my opinion very expensive for the few sprays that you get.</li>
<li> this!you will not be sorry you purchased</li>
<li> I bought this small size because why spend the money if it smells terrible?</li>
<li> Very disappointed - did not realize this was a very small sample size and</li>
<li> I WAS SHOCKED.  </li>

    <li> My favorite brand of perfumes I love the smell. The container was very small for the price, but I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The scent only lasts about 10 minutes.  I think I must have got an old bottle.  When I bought this in Victoria&#x27;s Secret, the scent lasted all day.  I am not at all happy</li>
    <li> The price was RIGHT! I love Angels HEAVENLY Perfume. The size is perfect to keep in my purse. Now I&#x27;m looking for a larger size at a savings.</li>
    <li> VS&#x27;s Heavenly is a very nice fragrance for all ages.  Wanted to try it before I spent the money for a larger bottle and am well satisfied with the item and the transaction.</li>

    <li> So I bought this fragrance for my wife a few weeks ago and we both love it. It seems to last quite a long time and is not overpowering. I bought this small size because why spend the money if it smells terrible? Turns out we both like it and are now confident about spending much more money on the larger size. She loves the small size as she is able to keep it in her purse. Great 5 star worthy product!</li>
    <li> Looks nice in pictures but very disappointed with the size.  It is a tiny 3 inches tall and barely an inch wide at the widest point.  I guess it&#x27;s a real travel one.</li>

    <li> I thought this was a great way to see if I liked a scent.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it. small enough to carry in my bag</li>
    <li> the picture here really does not match up to what you get. rhe bottle i got was as big as my middle finger.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed - did not realize this was a very small sample size and the price is way to high for this.</li>
    <li> I paid over $30.00 for this item and it is only .25 oz.  I am fully aware that this was in the product description however it is very easy to read over and the picture makes the perfume look a lot larger than what it is.  It looks like a free sample that VS would hand out in their stores.  I will not be purchasing again.  What a rip off.</li>
    <li> Smells soo good. I always get compliments when people smell me in public. Which is kinda creepy after a while you notice men following you from place to place...anywho I just wish the bigger bottle didn&#x27;t cost so much more $$$ Perfect for your purse or clutch in the club</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of this perfume!!! But..... I thought it was going to be bigger than it is. It is very tiny. Probably like the size of your pinky finger heigth wise.</li>
    <li> I bought this item not realizing the true size and content. It is really smaller tham any pusre spray you may purchase for your handbag, however, it is the cologne it says it is.</li>
    <li> This particular bottle was smaller than a shot glass bottle. I love the smell of it. But i was a really pissed at the size of the bottle. This was a waste of a stamp..</li>
    <li> Love it very nice perfume  just wonderful only thing I didn&#x27;t like is it was so small but im satisfied with this item👍👍👍👍😘💙💚💛💜💖</li>
    <li> Product great. Felt I was mislead by seller not mentioning it was a sample size.&lt;br /&gt;Heavenly is a great smelling cologne. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it&#x27;s a great aroma while it lasts.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is currently one of my favorites!! this one is a SURE winner without dissapointments and gives positive compliments!</li>

    <li> It met my expectations. Received earlier than the date expected.i really love this fragrance . Very satisfied. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift....my mom said it was smaller than a purse size. So my opinion very expensive for the few sprays that you get. Pay attention to the size it looks bigger in picture. Other than that everthing else was great.</li>
    <li> bought it for a gift and the receiver was  very pleased</li>
    <li> This is a sample they&#x27;re selling as a bottle of perfume</li>
