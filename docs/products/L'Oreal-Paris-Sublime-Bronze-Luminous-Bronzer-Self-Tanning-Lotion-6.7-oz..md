<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this Luminous Bronzer very much.  The sparkles wear off within 24 hours, but they don&#x27;t really bother me anyway.  I like the color because it looks natural.  As with any &amp;#34;tan in a can&amp;#34; you need to be careful where it goes and be sure to rub it in until it&#x27;s dry. A little sticky at first, but that too goes away.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to streak like the old tanning lotions.  It contains some simmer pigment so it looks pretty when you wear it too.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST and trust me I&#x27;ve used plenty over the years.  It looks very good on and it goes on so smoothly...(tip:  I use gloves to apply, you can get a huge box at Sally Beauty for about $7)...works like a charm and I&#x27;ve had a lot of people comment on it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanners over the years, and this is BY FAR the all-time worst. The temporary bronzer is awful. It smells bad, stains clothes (even dark ones), and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly... resulting in an uneven tan.      Fortunately, Amazon is allowing me to return 7 bottles.    I&#x27;m surprised L&#x27;Oreal would release something like this, because their other tanning products are quite good. In fact, the resulting color with this product is good as well... but I can&#x27;t get past the temporary bronzer. I generally don&#x27;t like bronzers, but this one is especially glittery and difficult to apply. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product one time and it looks awful when you put it on. I was very dissapointed. It is very dark, and it streaks even after rubbing it in really good. I look orange and streaky. This was a total waste of money. I can&#x27;t wait until it fades away. The best self tanner I have ever used is Mary Kay, I will go back to using that.</li>
    <li> I bought this at CVS without reading any reviews then read reviews here and was going to return it based on some of the negative remarks, did not want to be glittery, orange or streaky. Never got back to the store and needed tan legs for a wedding so tried it. I don&#x27;t know what the people who are reviewing this badly are doing. It went on easily, you could see where it was as you were applying. It looks glittery when it comes out of the bottle but the glitter pretty much disappears when you rub it in. With only one application I already had a decent amount of color after a few hours, I am a pale blue eyed blonde and the color on me was very natural, not orange at all. I rubbed it in with circular motions after applying it all over my legs until it was completely absorbed.It already felt pretty dry but to be sure I let it dry completely while I dried my hair and applied makeup then I put on slacks to go to work. It did not rub off on the material, did not have a bad odor like some others, and that evening when I took my slacks off my legs had a great, even bronze color. After applying it I washed my hands with soap and an exfoliating scrub and had no problem with brown palms. I definitely recommend this and will buy it again, next time though I&#x27;ll buy from Amazon, it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> It is extremely hard to apply this product evenly, I had streaks and blotches all over, but they did not actually show up til the afternoon at which point I could do nothing about them. Also I HATE when it is sparkly but they don&#x27;t warn you about it. My skin was sparkly and weird smelling all day and the mission was NOT accomplished. Don&#x27;t try to go cheap with self-tanner -- get the good stuff, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This is pretty fantastic for when you meant to use self tanner for weeks before an event but forgot/were too lazy. Not only does it self-tan, but it gives you an instant shimmery (not glittery) golden-tan glow. I would be careful what you wear it with as it IS just bronzer so it will rub/wash off easily, but if you give it plenty of time to soak in you should be fine (I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it coming off on anything, but I could see it happening). I try to use a regular tanning lotion a few times a week &amp; use this more for special occasions or if I haven&#x27;t kept up with the tanner.</li>
    <li> I think this product was awesome! I got a summer tan in like 2-3 days. I&#x27;m hispanic so I don&#x27;t know if my tint helped with the process but I loved it. I wanted to know more about using the product such as if you needed to wash body every time, could you use lotion after application (because I have really dry elbows and the product did make my skin feel dry), and how quickly it would wear off. But couldn&#x27;t find the answers. So...     Pros: Quick action, natural looking tan, I loved the smell but husband didn&#x27;t but he is a guy and they don&#x27;t like fruity smells. One friend even said it reminded her of Brazil. It did not stain any clothing it dries in a good amount of time like lotion does when you rub it in. Never any problems with streaking only with incident mentioned below.     The glitter could be good or bad but to be honest it goes away as the day goes by. It really isn&#x27;t a problem. It may freak you out at first but it disappears after a few hours or even after a rinse.    Con: My palms were orange even with rinsing in between maybe I should have used gloves after all. If this does happen use lemon juice or baking soda. Be careful when rinsing/washing hands off because water will trickle down arm and cause a streak in the bronze if you don&#x27;t notice. That happened to me hehe. But it was quickly fixed with application. It did make my skin really dry with its first use but after that it wasn&#x27;t bad only maybe a little on my hands. Careful with nails it kind of made mine orange but it disappeared after soaking.     Overall I would highly recommend to buy!!!     If you need pictures, can email Roskarin@msn.com for the results</li>
    <li> I bought this a few days ago and tried it that same night after I showered. As I was putting it on I immediately notice the insane amount of GLITTER in this product. It&#x27;s ridiculous! This is not subtle \\&quot;micro-pearls\\&quot; as the bottle says, but more like you just attended a 5 year olds birthday party. After going ahead, I also noticed how sticky it is. An hour later I still felt so sticky that I had to lay with my arms and legs not touching or they would feel permanently glued together. At this point I got up and threw the whole bottle in the trash and went to sleep. The next day, after much of the glitter rubbed off on my sheets (to my husbands dismay), I saw a beautiful, glowing tan. It was the perfect not too light and not too dark tone. I am pretty fair, have some facial freckles, but I&#x27;m not ghostly white so I can take a deeper color. This was great! I actually grabbed the bottle back out of the trash bin and decided it was worth the glitter and stickiness. I figure I can just wipe most of the glitter off before leaving the house... Because seriously, L&#x27;Oreal, I&#x27;m 32 and work at a law firm. I can&#x27;t go around with chunks of glitter all over my body like I&#x27;m Punky friggin Brewster.</li>
    <li> UPDATE**  double checked my receipt &amp; actually paid MORE for this at Wal-Mart that the regular price on Amazon - Subscribe &amp; Save makes it even cheaper at Amazon - I will purchase here now :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using self-tanner &amp; build-a-tans for years.  Every year I&#x27;ve tried something new.  Two years ago it was the spray tan - took too long to see results.  Last year I bought a store brand that didn&#x27;t seem to build anything but smell.  This year I decided to try a bronzer and went with L&#x27;Oreal as I love their facial bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked great - no streaks &amp; I personally like the shimmer - would not call it glitter.  It reminds me of the shimmer panty-hose would give your legs - helps to even out the tone IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did make the following adjustments to application:&lt;br /&gt;1) applied hand lotion to hands directly prior to application&lt;br /&gt;2) only applied tanner to legs (shaven &amp; exfoliated)&lt;br /&gt;3) added regular body lotion to problem areas - knees &amp; ankles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not a typical self tan smell &amp; my legs had an immediately tan look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wait about 7 minutes before putting on clothes and had no issues with staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wal-Mart&#x27;s price is currently a smidge cheaper than Amazon subscribe &amp; save - so I will probably continue to buy from Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all very happy with this product - and if Wal-Mart raises their prices - will buy from Amazon :)</li>
    <li> I am challenged when it comes to using self-tanners - they end up streaky, blotchy and just a mess.  This one is so smooth, even I could use it and get a fabulous tan.  I like that it&#x27;s tinted -  that makes it much easier to see where it is on your skin.  I am super fair, and got a beautiful glow after one use.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell like self-tanner, which is a huge plus for me.      A little bit goes a long way, use it sparingly until you see how it develops.  My arms actually got a little too dark, lol.      Here&#x27;s a quick tip for your hands and feet: apply a small circle of the tanner on a makeup sponge and brush it on the back of your hands, the tops of your fingers, and on the top of your feet and toes. You&#x27;ll get the same great color all over and not look like a freak with tan arms and white hands.   Just make sure to avoid your nails and cuticles.  After about 20 minutes, use hand lotion all over your hands and feet, and wipe your palms on a wet washcloth.   Voila!  You&#x27;ll be tan all over and look great!</li>
    <li> I have olive skin that tans easily and self-tans quickly and easily too.  After reading reviews, I decided to try this self-tanner because I was looking for one that didn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  After following the directions to a T, I was seriously disappointed.  My skin ended up with a bronzed look, but it was uneven and covered in streaks after developing.  The \\&quot;cream\\&quot; is more of a gel, it is difficult to rub in, takes a long time to dry and doesn&#x27;t stay in place when you try to apply it.  I even applied it 3x in 5 days in hopes that it would even out. Nope.  I just ended up with more streaks just in time for my sister&#x27;s wedding.  Oh yeah, it also stinks after about 10 minutes until it&#x27;s showered off.  I am throwing this junk in the trash where it belongs.</li>
    <li> I AM HOOKED on this self tanner. I have been using this for YEARS and am always asked if I just came back from vacation. It&#x27;s that natural looking. I am thrilled to see that Amazon carries it as it is cheaper on amazon then buying it at the store.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years now!  It works wonderfully!  I just recently figured out the secret because I almost gave this up because I started to look funny like I had some kind of skin issue because I have very dry skin and you could see my pale skin cracked through the tan...bummer... But I did some research and listen to that advice and hope this helps someone else out there too... Exfoliate, Exfoliate, Exfoliate!!  This is a must EVERY time you shower!!!  Best advice I had read and now I can continue with this cheaper self tanner and get just as good of a tan as the expensive stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. the tan is not that normal weird orange color you get from self-tanners. it dries very quickly. it does have subtle shimmer. (i won&#x27;t even call it \\&quot;glitter\\&quot;) that washes off. you are left with a natual-looking tan that last for days, and at this price is well worth it. excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have had the same bottle forever (3 years??) and am finally going to purchase another one. If you apply it evenly you have a beautiful natural glow. My skin looks healthy as if a serum was applied. I love this stuff and recommend it to cold country dwellers to give them a healthy glow. I had horrible experiences with the old self tanners which turned me orange and looked uneven. This stuff washes off your hands. Looks great on your face and legs. The glitter is minimal (someone mentioned hating it in a review). Definitely the only product I like the shade of, others look too chocolate or too orange. This is a nice natural color!! And the liquid aspect of it is light on your skin. Shake it to re-blend it otherwise there is liquid separation. A+</li>
    <li> It works fast. I liked it, but I looked kind of orange...</li>
    <li> I prefer the older brand that does not have the luminous sparkle in the product and I find it a bit streaky</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll get color in 24 hours, although I think I have a bit of an orange hue. It&#x27;s still better than pasty winter skin color.&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEMS! This stuff has a cheap perfume smell.  There is a glitter in the product, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s to make you look &#x27;pretty&#x27; or to indicate where you&#x27;ve applied it. The product isn&#x27;t really a cream, it&#x27;s more like runny/watery catchup. PLEASE use latex/nylon gloves when applying, even when I washed my hands twice afterwords, I had stains on my palms for 2 days. It&#x27;s a cheap fix for pale skin, but I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this but people, i advise u becareful because u can streak! lol i made that mistake. wash in between ur fingers as well &amp; remember no gloves.</li>
    <li> This may be perfect for the young glittery-vampire worshippers but it contains far, far too much sparkle to suit this Olde Farte.  It&#x27;s not luminous, it&#x27;s just glitter!  Not the least bit natural a glow.  Too bad, because the color under all that sparkle isn&#x27;t bad; not orange at all, and the scent is nicer than most self-tanners.</li>
    <li> It was an awesome color when I woke up, and I even like how you can sort of see it when you first put it on so you can tell if you need more certain places. But I just can&#x27;t quite seem to get over the overly fishy smell. It even transferred onto my steering wheel cover even though I wash my hands super well afterwards....you and I just need to decide which is more important an awesome tan and smell like a fish market or be pasty and smell awesome. Oh the decisions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pale. Pale pale pale pale. Super fair skin. My grandfather always used to joke that I looked like Casper the Ghost when I wore shorts. When I first tried this tanner, I decided to go crazy with it. I put it everywhere, and rubbed it in really really really good. To my horror, despite rubbing it in for 15 minutes straight, it dried looking orange and streaky. Not to mention, it felt sticky. I always keep some makeup remover wipes on hand so I can quickly remove the tanner from around my ankles, backs of my knees, wrists, and hands. Instead, I took my makeup remover wipes and wiped off all the orange streaks and a massive amount of glitter. I went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....the next day, I woke up and looked at my legs. Oh my goodness, I am tan. My milk white skin is TAN! No streaks, just beautiful tan goodness. I&#x27;ve decided that the formula is only orangey brown to give an idea of where I&#x27;m putting it and what areas I&#x27;ve covered. It will look streaky when I first put it on. It will dry sticky, smell like soapy perfume, but all of that washes away with a good shower. All that is left behind is a beautiful tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion: Tie your hair up, strip naked and use this on the morning of your day off, when you are lounging around the house. Pay the orange streaks no mind. Let it get semi-dry (where the orange streaks stick to your skin and don&#x27;t move around easily), and put on some clothes that you don&#x27;t care about getting stained. If you rubbed tanner into your butt, wear a loose skirt and skip the underwear. Then go about your cleaning, cooking, TV watching, video games, whatever. In the evening, take a shower. Use some soap, and gently wash your skin. Get all of the orange streaks off. Use some rubbing alcohol on any areas that were accidentally tanned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ....Voila! A gorgeous, natural looking tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish L&#x27;Oreal would make a version without glitter.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product before and liked it because it did not make my&lt;br /&gt;skin look yellow, but this time it did turn a yellow color, do not know&lt;br /&gt;why??  So will not purchase again. carolann113</li>
    <li> This product does what it says! The description is exact, the package/label mirrors the contents. I have purchased numerous self-tanners over the years, always looking for the next best thing. For me this is it! Yes the glow is instant, safe to use on face, something I would of never tried before.&lt;br /&gt;I have no allergic skin reactions to product, in the past I have been sensitive to formulations using the tanning chemical. I plan to purchase the additional product that provides for long-lasting tan. I have subscribed to receiving this product that is how impressed I am with it.</li>
    <li> It worked like it said, looked like I had glitter on my face after I put it on. There was only one thing that was a problem --when you put in on your face, you had to be careful around the hairline, because the bronzer didn&#x27;t blend in too good and you could see where it ended.  Otherwise I loved it!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used. It looks very natural and you can put more on until you reach the level of darkness you want.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I exfoliated like they said and put the product on, I like the tint so I can see where I am putting it.  I also like the glitter, it is luminous, now I have not put any on my face yet, but just on my arms and legs and I love it so far.  I think the stickiness has to do with the environment, if it is warm and a even a little humid it will take a little bit longer for it to dry, but if is dryer and a little cooler it dries quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see a difference but people aren&#x27;t oohing over it like it is a stark overnight difference which is good, because you want it to look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now  all I have to do is lose about 30 pounds and I will be extremely happy, but this product is really making me feel a lot better about me.  Thanks Loreal, I love the luminous look too.</li>
    <li> As with any self-tanner, the results you get are going to have 95% to do with how properly/carefully it is applied and not the product itself... but I digress. I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s self-tanning products for a few years because I love the built in bronzer so that I get some color instantly PLUS the bonus of being able to see that I&#x27;ve applied the product evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the self-tanning novice, there are a few must follow rules to flawless self-tanning (in other words \\&quot;How not to look like an Oompah Loompah who mated with someone from Jersey Shore\\&quot;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliate well and shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply a light moisturizer to the area you intend to self-tan (paying special attention to the areas that get especially dry... ankles, knees, elbows, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;3. Allow the lotion to soak in for at least 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Optional: I use rubber gloves... a box of 100 is pretty cheap and you can rinse them and reuse them a few times :) Nothing cool about orange fingers from getting self-tanner on them and not getting it off in time!&lt;br /&gt;5. Apply enough self-tanner to cover the area you want covered, but without going overboard. The key to NOT looking splotchy or having darker areas is to keep spreading/rubbing the lotion around until your skin feels dry. If you feel like you&#x27;ve left a damp spot that feels cool from the air hitting it, that area WILL be darker or orangey. Just be patient and keep rubbing until it&#x27;s all rubbed in. This is super important around the ankle bones/knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a few summers of frustration before I finally read someone else&#x27;s review with similar advice, but since I&#x27;ve followed these rules, I&#x27;ve been really satisifed with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you&#x27;re really pale and worried that this will be too dark, even with one application, you can mix a little bit into regular body lotion to dilute it slightly and get lighter results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy tanning! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super pale and I hate tanning beds because of the obvious health risks, but I&#x27;ve always been weary of tanning lotions. This lotion rocks, I look awesome. It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as some of the other reviews have said, and it&#x27;s not sticky either. It absorbs really well and isn&#x27;t streaky. It gives you a really nice glow, definitely boosts my confidence. It does have a lot of sparkles though, but I don&#x27;t because I&#x27;m young so it&#x27;s nice to shimmer. I recommend this to all those pretty pale ladies who don&#x27;t have the time or money to tan.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to put it on correctly the first time, but worth it. Put this stuff on before bed. Take a gander at it in the mirror and look for any obvious inconsistencies in its application and smooth it out. Let it dry a bit before sitting down or putting on clothes. Wear some lose clothes to bed and leave it alone until your next shower. Take a shower, this will take away most of ugly \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; (glitter) and the orange tone that your legs will have. After your shower, your legs should be pretty nicely and evenly tanned. The tan usually lasts a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOST HELPFUL TIP: look at your legs in the sunlight when assessing the consistency of this stuff on your skin! The lighting REALLY makes a difference. I thought I had it perfect inside only to go outside and find my legs all streaky! Had to run back in to fix things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So worth it... IF you know how to use it. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.</li>
    <li> I love the tan that came with this bronzer. I work retail and everyone was asking what product I use. Im an esthetician and I love giving product advice. It was a beautiful streak free tan that hasn&#x27;t faded after two days. But the glitter was lame. There is so much. Felt like a stripper.</li>
    <li> this lotion is great, doesn&#x27;t make you smell like burnt flesh like most of the other lotions do.  Its nicely scented not overwhelming.  Adds a nice tan quickly and has a bronze tint to it so you get an instant glow.  Also has a great gold shimmer in it that makes you sparkle.  I love it and think it is a must have for people who self tan.</li>
    <li> honestly, i really loved the results of this product. i think everybody is going to experience it differently, depending on your skin type &amp; so on. but as far as i go, it worked very well for me. it didn&#x27;t leave my skin looking orange. it&#x27;s not really a tanning \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; in my opinion though, as it kind of has a gel-like consistency. i know a lot of people do not like the sparkliness of this tanner, however i didn&#x27;t feel like it was a deal breaker. the scent is very mild &amp; really didn&#x27;t bother me at all. it dried fairly quickly &amp; didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky like a lot of other products did. it&#x27;s a good price to match the results that it gave me. however, i would recommend applying it with latex gloves, because like other tanners, it&#x27;s going to make your hands look orange. also, i didn&#x27;t exfoliate before using &amp; it still worked fine for me, however, if you want to be extra sure that you&#x27;ll get good results, i would suggest exfoliating first. also, i didn&#x27;t find it necessary to mix with another moisturizer. it was fine as is :)</li>
    <li> This was absolutely awful. I have very pale skin so decided to try this since it&#x27;s supposed to gradually turn darker. Well...I suppose on someone not quite as pale as me it would do that. On me though...no. I used very little and still ended up orange and streaky. VERY obvious that I had an accident with a bottle of self tanner. You couldn&#x27;t pay me to use this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Works, my friends thought I was tan.  Looks good with summer outfits.</li>
    <li> I spotted this stuff at Walgreens, and went on a search for a cheaper price at Target. Just as I was leaving without it, I spotted it on a shelf and there was a coupon for 2 dollars off on the bottle :D I&#x27;ve never self tanned, or done any type of tanning for that matter, but because I usually wear jeans or work pants, my arms and shoulders are the only part of my body that have any real color to them. It looks quite obnoxious. I picked this stuff up at random and tried it as soon as I got home after showering. It is VERY glittery, but to be honest, I love glitter so I dont mind it at all and I dont think my legs have ever looked better after just one application. No streaks because I made sure to apply it in circular motions and to not use too much. It smells awesome too. This stuff is great in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am NOT a self-tanner person... I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cute when girls look orange or fake, and I officially gave up tanning beds about a year ago. I was trying to embrace my lighter, middle-of-January skin (I tan fairly easily, don&#x27;t burn, and have dirty blonde hair &amp; blue eyes) and I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I bought this lotion on a whim (first time self-tanning with a lotion) and I seriousy love it. It is not orange AT ALL, it goes on smooth and streak-free, and it doesn&#x27;t make SUCH a huge difference that anyone says \\&quot;Whoa, where have you been??\\&quot; Instead, people have told me that my skin is gorgeous! It took my color a few shades darker, and still looks like MY SKIN. A lot of reviewers don&#x27;t like the soft glitter but I think it is pretty (it washes away as soon as you shower). And it wasn&#x27;t sticky for me at all and actually dried really quickly - I put on my pajamas and climbed into bed 20 minutes after application and it left no messes. I&#x27;m thinking if it&#x27;s really sticky or messy you are using way too much. Also, the color lasted me about a week. (And I didn&#x27;t use it on my face -- I was a little afraid to, but it&#x27;s such a natural color that no one would notice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is gorgeous, INSTANT color. It is not thick, orange \\&quot;paint\\&quot; -- it sinks in quickly &amp; leaves a really pretty glow. My boyfriend used it on his face &amp; chest last night! We laughed about it but it looks great on him too!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Actually smells good- my mom always asks what perfume I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so nice&lt;br /&gt;Color develops quickly and looks naturally dark&lt;br /&gt;Actually dries quickly with no lingering heavy lotion feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Started to have an allergic reaction/hives on the third use- had to wash it off&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a sunburned feeling after a while which is scary....&lt;br /&gt;Does not really show you where it goes on via instant bronzing... it has dried with horrible streaks on last use, but I didn&#x27;t take enough care to wash it off my hands  and my feet were dry (Prep with exfoliation and lotion!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would use it again simply because the smell doesn&#x27;t offend and the color is nice (Personally I hate lotion on my skin so I love that it evaporates quickly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it is not heavy glitter, it looks just fine to me.</li>
    <li> This tanner works quickly and has a mild smell, not terribly unpleasant.  But it does streak, or rather it is darker on the first place I apply the lotion to my skin.  Also be very careful about knees and ankles, as these places will be darker as the directions warn; my question is how to avoid this without having a distinct line of tanner around these areas?</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT I HAVE PURCHASED IN STORES OR ONLINE. IT DOES NOT EVEN SMELL THE SAME. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Love this tanner. I use it every summer. Gives a quick tan and doesn&#x27;t streak or look orange. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Ok I bought this last summer and it was awesome! BUT..I noticed the last bottle I bought had and orange cap and this new one had a tan one. (I still have the older one but it was half empty)Anyway, I used this product now and it was horrible! It was like pure water and it wasnt rubbing in. I took a nice shower before hand and scrubbed the crap outta my entire body..then when I got out i used the new one with the brownish/tan cap and it wouldnt even rub into my skn. I went to bed and about 12 hours later I took a shower. The tan came off..ALL of it! I was back to my white polish self all over agian. Now, IF you can find the older bottle that must of been taking off the market, It was wonderful!!!! Gave me a nice golden tan.. I woke up in the morning, showered and wala...I was a golden goddess. Loreal must have just became cheap and used too much water in this new bottle. REMEMBER..IF you come accross this products with a bright orange cap BUY IT!..It worked sooo good for me!! LOREAL-PLEASE STOP BEING CHEAP AND BRING BACK LAST SUMMERS ORANGE CAP BOTTLE...Its liquid inside worked so much better. Im really dissapointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an instant bronzer, once you put it on your skin, you&#x27;ll see a brownish complexion. BUT EVEN WITH ONE COAT YOU&#x27;LL TURN TO KING MIDAS--YOUR SKIN WILL BE A GLOWING ORANGE!!! My friend called me carrot all day, because I was orange. Very embarrassing, and highly noticeable!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Neutragena instant bronzer (but I don&#x27;t think they sell that anymore), or Jergens Natural Glow lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store and thought it belongs to Sublime product line that I like, it would be as good as the other product I used last year. BIG MISTAKE!!    This product is hard to be applied even, leaving obvious streaks on my skin. But it is difficult to notice at the application time, however, I turned orange overnight with one application on the areas covered well but the areas not covered was still so fair. I felt so embarassed to step out. My PJs were tained brownish by the color.     Strongly discourage purchase of this product for people with fair skin tone.</li>
    <li> It watery and smells super funny.. Dint use it as much.. such a disappointment really.  Thought it was more like a creamy like.</li>
    <li> i agree with all the comments on the glitter, at first it is disturbing but it doesn&#x27;t last. I found the slight color when you apply helpful in avoiding streaks. When the color came up i was really happy with it. I have zero color on my legs - really, there isn&#x27;t even a hint of pink. If i make a mistakes applying tanners they are very easily seen on my white, white legs. So i used only a very small amount of this produce.  It spread well and the result is nice color. I&#x27;m happy with it but think if I&#x27;d used a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person amount it would have looked unnatural/orange/unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my take is don&#x27;t worry about the glitter and if you are pale go light on the amount you apply and you should end up with a nice summery looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AN UPDATE ............. so its been a few hours since my original post and i am now PUMPKIN orange. Normally a tanner comes up in a few hours (when i first posted) but this just keeps getting stonger and stronger and oranger and oranger ........... its horrific..........</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Honestly gives me better, deeper  tan results than I get from a spray tan at a tanning salon, for a fraction of the cost. Every time I wear it I get comments about how tan I look. I love using the sublime bronze an hour or two before I go to an event, or just use it right after a shower right before bed to let the tan fully develope. I use loreal spray tan for my back (I can&#x27;t reach it when I&#x27;m using lotion on the rest of my body) and I use it for a quick spray on my face. This stuff has changed my life! Will be using for years to come! 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product is a great quick tanning item....instantly gives color to the skin...no more waiting for the color to develop and it gives a sparkle to the skin and softness that is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Recently, I purchased the bronzer from this seller. I did not open the bottle until recently as I had to use up the last of my bronzer that I purchased at the store. 2 days ago, I opened the bronzer. Like the other buyers, my bronzer was diluted. The bottle says lotion, this is not a lotion its a liquid and obviously no security seal was in place to keep this unscrupulous seller from diluting the bronzer. I have no idea what they watered this down with and I am very disturbed that Amazon allows this seller to continue to rip off the customers. I will report these individuals immediately. Again, who knows what has been added to this bottle. Everyone - DO NOT purchase from this seller. Since I was still using up my prior lotion from the store, I missed the return deadline. This bottle is destined for the garbage can. DISGUSTED and PISSED.</li>
    <li> This product is good, as I&#x27;ve purchased it before locally.  However, when I received this lotion from this seller, it was heavily diluted.  It was like brown water coming out of the bottle.  I&#x27;m not even able to use it.  Absolutely horrible.</li>
    <li> Not an &amp;#34;old fart&amp;#34; as mentioned by another -- but why do my legs need to be glittery?  Too bad because it seemed to tan well but I won&#x27;t be using it again to find out how well it wears.  Really -- just silly to make glittery legs on normal everyday people who aren&#x27;t walking the beach regularly</li>
    <li> This product works very well but it smells like washing detergent but it gets the job done. It can be used in very VERY small amounts to achieve the right color.</li>
    <li> Imagine my surprise when I received this bronzer, that only lasts one application, and does not gradually tan your skin like it&#x27;s similar sublime products. I did like the effect it had after applying, but for the money I paid I was really looking forward to a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; that I could keep longer than a day.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Since I seem to never be able to lay out this works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Leaves my skin looking tan and radiant.  I mix it with my body lotion, this way it goes on even and natural looking.  Make sure to dab off the extra on your toes, feet, elbows, and hands.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL product.  Best one ever. Goes on smoothly with NO streaking. Dries almost instantly with no stickiness!!  I tried others before discovering this one.  No comparison.  This one is tops!!!</li>
    <li> Love love. I will always buy this. However nothing beats Sephora San Tropez. I really love how this product has sparkles in is tanning lotion. So ladies if you don&#x27;t like sparkles don&#x27;t get this product. However if you like a nice glow with a hint of sparkles added to it, you will love this!</li>
    <li> I have tried literally a COUNTLESS number of sunless tanners. I bought this one yesterday at target because it had a $2 off coupon attached (it&#x27;s still cheaper on amazon). I showered, exfoliated, shaved, and moisturized before applying the product. I also wore gloves to apply it and worked very slowly and carefully to apply it as evenly as I possibly could. The results were mixed for me.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smells nice, its a deep brown color to aid in an even application, the shimmer isn&#x27;t over the top like others have mentioned in reviews I actually thought it looked nice, the color is great...it&#x27;s not fake looking and develops fully in a few hours and you look noticeably tanner after one application&lt;br /&gt;Cons: looked horrible on my shins...this was strange because I spent the most time on them in the application process it was streaky looking and made my ankles look bad even though I made sure to create a barrier with regular lotion prior to application, also my skin is pretty sensitive and the product burned for a second on my legs when I applied it (that may have something to do with shaving beforehand), finally it was a bit sticky although the sticky feeling did go away after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this was a pretty good self tanner. I will probably continue using it but try something else on my shins!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy any products from seller. The bronzer was so watered down that it poured out as soon as I turned the bottle upside down. I have bought this stuff for years at Walmart and other stores and have never had the bronze in this shape. It is almost as if it has been used and filled back up with either water or regular lotion.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time because I prefer to look less like the walking dead--I&#x27;m naturally very pale and the sun only makes me burn, peel and get skin cancer.  I use this and I&#x27;m a reasonably real looking color with all over sparkles in the sunlight. (Right, instead of a zombie, I look like a vampire.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and I haven&#x27;t found it streaky.  You do have to be careful to wash your hands because you can end up with dirty-looking cuticles.  I also take my rings off when applying so I don&#x27;t accidentally leave some stuff under the rings that gets too brown.  I also suggest not wearing white clothes right after applying (wait until the next day).</li>
    <li> Not orange, just a nice bronze color. It works great on the face or body.  Yep it really, really does.</li>
    <li> This is the worst self tanner that I have ever used. I gave it two stars because the color itself is good. It&#x27;s brown, not orange and it actually works on extremely pale skin. I do have a problem with finding sunless tanning products that actually give me noticeable color. I&#x27;m a natural redhead, extremely pale. That being said, color is not everything when the product does not spread on your skin. It just doesn&#x27;t blend well at all no matter what you do. I tried it with and without a sunless tanning mitt. I even mixed it with moisturizer which helped with a more even application (also diluted it, which isn&#x27;t desirable), but it was still a streaky mess. I assure you that it is a problem with the formula, not my total lack of skill applying self tanner. I&#x27;ve been using self tanner for ten years. I&#x27;ve used lotions, gels, mousses, sprays. This is incredibly liquidy, it&#x27;s not like a lotion. It leaves your skin feeling really sticky (worse than most), and the smell is terrible. It has that self tanner smell. It&#x27;s really strong, but it also has a strong chemically smell right out of the bottle that&#x27;s hard to tolerate while applying and I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells. And finally, the glitter. There&#x27;s just so much sparkle to this. It&#x27;s unnecessary and ends up everywhere. Overall, I just can&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfectly, although it does make you sparkle right after you put it on which is kinda weird</li>
    <li> I have white feet and ankles and tan legs from working and walking in the sun with low-top socks on so I needed something to darken these areas so I could wear flip flops, sandals, and heels and not have tan lines.  I picked this out from many brands and gave it a try. I used a little bit cautiously and it worked perfectly in the first few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised.  I like the smell and just wiped off the glitter with a damp towel and it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly at first on a small area as a test and try mixing with a little bit of hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use much on my face - maybe just a dab mixed with some moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product was runny, watery, and didn&#x27;t work at all. Even if you let it sit on your skin for a while, it would was right off. Not even bronze your skin at all. I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried a LOT of self tanners and this is by far the most effective. It goes on fairly shimmery and the smell is strong but not bad at all compared to other tanners; I usually put it on a few hours before bed when I&#x27;m not going to see anyone and then shower in the morning. The color is quite strong but at the same time looks incredibly natural! My friends would ask me if I had been on vacation. My only warning is that for awhile, I was using it quite regularly every day for several weeks and then when I stopped suddenly, it looked kind of odd just because of the way your skin sheds skin cells--sort of scaly tan and white for awhile. Also if you make a mistake it is not easy to simply scrub off with a loofah in the shower--be careful! But overall this is a great product as long as you use it correctly and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Like many others on here, I have been using this product, purchased from brick and mortar stores for years with great success.  Bought this because of the price.  I&#x27;m not sure what this seller did to the product but my guess would be the low price is because he&#x27;s diluting it.  I bought a new bottle two days ago at the grocery and my skin is now the golden tan that it used to be before the Amazon purchase.  I would never buy from this seller again.  And to the person suggesting that L&#x27;Oreal has cheapened their product, not so.  If you buy it direct from the store it&#x27;s perfectly good.</li>
    <li> SO MUCH SPARKLE!! Did not like that too much but it gives a nice glow and has a nice light fragrance instead of a heavy odor like many other bronzer lotions do..overall good product would buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work as well as more expensive ones but I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway.  I have been impressed! The only thing I do not like is that it does not tan my face that well.  It&#x27;ll give a little color but not as much as other products have. However, I like everything else about it!  I didn&#x27;t try it sooner because I didn&#x27;t like the sparkly stuff in it but I use it at night and it washes away when I shower, so the tan stays but I don&#x27;t have to have the slight glitter.    I have used Fake Bake, SUN, Clarion&#x27;s, etc.. and this is right up there with them!  Don&#x27;t bother spending double/triple the amt. of money; this works great!  For my face, I use my makeup bronzer and that helps the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before but not in this formulation.  The smell isn&#x27;t too bad as all self-tanners have an odor.  I was having trouble with my eyes stinging horribly - to the point of needing to put eye drops in (liquid tears) - 4 or 5 times.  I finally figured out that it was the odor from this bronzer/self-tanner.  Once I figured out why my eyes were stinging so badly, I used a blow dryer (on cool) to dry my legs.  I only used it on my legs - nowhere near my eyes.  (They must have put a horribly powerful perfume in it to mask the usual self-tanner smell.)  MISTAKE! IF the perfume from this product is strong enough to make my eyes sting so badly and for so long, I can&#x27;t imagine what it is doing to my lungs! I actually like the product as a tanner/bronzer. Yes it has a bit of sparkle in it but after it dries, you are the only one who sees it. (Again, I&#x27;m using it on my legs.)  The coverage is like other self tanners and the bronzer does give you color immediately.  The color isn&#x27;t orange-y, at least not on my pale pink Irish/Swedish skin. I can&#x27;t use this again and will try to get a refund from Amazon or L&#x27;Oreal. Follow-up:  Amazon has refunded me the purchase price.  Thank you!  I hope that L&#x27;Oreal changes this product so that it doesn&#x27;t gas everyone out!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff Lil streaking but better than others ive tried</li>
    <li> Works perfectly if you&#x27;re careful and patient! (Patient in putting it on evenly, the results are right-away). Just make sure to wash your hands after applying because It&#x27;ll leave obnoxious brown marks on your palms if not. Definitely a sexy product. Might drive your bf wild.</li>
    <li> Always had great results with this product.  I use it 2/3 times a week and my skin looked so natural.  This shipment was watery and ran thru my fingers.  Could not use it.  Nothing like what I&#x27;ve gotten in the past!  Simply horrible</li>
    <li> Okay so I have always struggled with my tan, I have NEVER, ever, been able  to use self- tanners.  So i have always resorted to tanning.  however, i recently decided not to tan anymore for health reasons- but I am still like glow-in-the-dark color so i needed something.. I picked this up and WOW!  The first time you put it on you notice:  1.  It smells delicious, it is like a coconut smell  2.  It makes your skin glittery and soft  3.  It is easy to rub in ( I usually do it right after drying off after a shower, but it&#x27;s really good for any time of the day)  4.  It drys really quick so you don&#x27;t have to stand around waiting for it to dry before putting you clothes on because of fear of stains!  (I usually give it about 1 minute. and it&#x27;s always been great)  5.  It is a gradual tan, so you don&#x27;t have to worry that if you miss a spot you will look weird.      That being said, even after the first use, you can see a little bit of a glow, which is one reason why I love this product!  and after a couple of days, it looks great!  and then once you build up your tan, you can re-apply every couple days to keep it up.  it&#x27;s the easiest thing in the world, especially for a tanning dummy like me.  I am so glad that someone finally invented something like this.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous. It has the consistency of a thick lotion (and is translucent like a gel) and has a bronze tint right out of the bottle. This allows you to see exactly where you have already spread the mixture and see if it is rubbed in entirely. The first time I applied this, I wore gloves. This was a mistake (for me anyway). It is much easier to be able to feel wet spots with your bare hands. The lotion that was stuck in the creases of the glove made me have random streaks and smudges. Within a few hours, this product slowly turned my arms, neck and chest a beautiful tan color...it looked like I had gone to the beach and I started with fairly pale skin. Even better color than when I used tanning beds in my careless tanning years. My legs were streaky only because of my own application mistakes.     The second time around, I wore no gloves and had a dark/wet washcloth, and scrubbing brush nearby. I showered, exfoliated, and applied lotion to my body. Using my hands, I took a small amount and would apply the product a few body parts at a time (washing hands/scrubbing hands in between). I used a long-handled bath brush with a plastic glove over it to reach my back. After applying accordingly, I lightly rubbed the washcloth in area where I didn&#x27;t ant a lot of lotion (i.e. elbows, sides of feet, knuckles, toes, wrists, ect.)    All in all, this product is perfect, but not immune to human error (like my 1st attempt on my legs). Take your time to do it right and you will have a natural, glowing tan.</li>
    <li> This product left me very upset. First off, it left blotches of areas on my skin where it did not tan as well as dark blotches from the lotion. It was very un even and the lotion is so thick you use a lot and barely get it evened out on a reasonable area of the skin. It also let my palms orange, even after I washed my hands 3 times right after using the product. I had an interview in 3 days and had orange palms for it. I contacted L&#x27;Oreal and they are issuing my a refund. I don&#x27;t understand why others loved it and I had a bad experience with it.</li>
    <li> I used this product after taking a shower and scrubbing myself down to exfoliate. It moisturized my usually dry skin unlike other self tanners that made my skin feel dried out and like pleather. The smell is fantastic and I really like that you can actually see where you put the lotion and especially where there is too much! I think I much prefer the spray bottle ...like spray painting yourself tan! because I KNOW I am getting hard to reach(well, evenly reach) places. My HUGE BIG FAT reason I do not like this product is the glitter. Instant luminous glow&#x3D; more glitter than the disney world fairies pour over childrens&#x27; heads. I have to find some way to remove it before picking my son up from preschool! Why would anyone want to have this much glitter? So, great job on the tan, the smell and the ease of use but a huge thumb down on the massive amounts of tiny glitter that is everywhere.</li>
    <li> Color is great, especially for a drugstore sunless tanner... Problem is it&#x27;s the stickiest thing I have ever had on my body... It&#x27;s like rubbing maple syrup all over your body, except maple syrup would smell much better... They obviously tried really hard to cover up the DHA smell, but the fragrance they chose isn&#x27;t much better... Overall it&#x27;s not great, there&#x27;s definitely better options available even for as cheap as it is, I would recommend Jergens Natural Glow, they have a great line of products for super cheap that are better than this...</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty terrible when compared to the likes of Fake Bake et al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on my way out the door on a trip to a tropical location and realized I needed some way to get my glow on, and this is all that Walgreens had, so I rolled with it. In high school I actually used to mix the v1.0 of Sublime Bronze with lotion and blissfully self-tan that way, so I figured maybe things hadn&#x27;t changed much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um. Yeah. No. This stuff is all of the following: streaky, sticky, smelly, orange, rough, glitter overload, uneven, etc. etc. The stickiness might actually be the number one issue, because it makes application really difficult; the lotion dries into a sticky mess so quickly that you can&#x27;t smooth out streaks or even see where you missed, and if any of your limbs touch anything, you&#x27;ll end up with both a streak on your body and an orange blob on whatever you touched. Also, there was kind of a weird slimy sensation when showering / sweating. The smell is typical self-tanner bad, and the color results err on the orange side. And, while HS me might have liked the glitter, I felt like a disco baby after applying this, and not in a cute way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add one star because I think I hacked together a system toward the end of my trip that saved me from going pale. Here&#x27;s how I used this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;1. Exfoliate SO HARD. Everything. Rub yourself raw.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply in tiny little dime-sized squirts, rubbing in concentric circles to diminish streaks. Application on legs, arms, and chest should take about 10 minutes with this system.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use toilet paper or tissue to blot (gently touch) your elbows, wrists, knuckles, ankles, and clavicle.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wait at least 30 minutes for the whole shebang to dry, preferably standing like a scarecrow so you don&#x27;t inadvertently stick yourself to something.&lt;br /&gt;5. Once fully dry, take a superfast shower (step in, step out) to rinse off the slime, glitter, and smell.&lt;br /&gt;6. For the next two hours, keep a close eyeon tan development, and have a loofah nearby to blend in any streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using steps 1-6, things worked out okay for me, and I was pleased that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stain your hands (assuming you give them a good wash after application). But, dear God, if you can access Fake Bake, do so immediately.</li>
    <li> 1 plus it will give you a nice color tan.&lt;br /&gt;all the negatives, it doesnt go on evenly, it stays sticky even into the following day. anywhere sheets clothing etc touches it rubs off. Not to mention your legs etc will stick together.When you take a shower or get wet even 24 hours later it washes right down the drain.. I have bought much cheaper non brand name bronzers and tanners that work much better then this and actually stay on you a few days.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME AND I WAS VERY PLEASED! I HAVE A GREAT TANNING GLOW WHICH IS GREAT SINCE I WILL BE ATTENDING A WEDDING!</li>
    <li> I use this often. I just actually applied it. I&#x27;m glittery and tan. Has a bit of orange to it at first. After a shower the orange goes away. Good product.</li>
    <li> I like the tanning effect and I don&#x27;t mind the glitter, it reflects with the light and it&#x27;s pretty. But the smell is really bad and every time I use this lotion, it makes weird spots on my legs. It applies well but when it dries I end up with uneven legs.</li>
    <li> The most important factor, the color this product delivers is, by far, the most natural I&#x27;ve seen and the results are fast.  Within a couple of applications, the &amp;#34;white glow&amp;#34; is gone!  Once the product is dry, (which only takes a few minutes if you rub it in thoroughly) it&#x27;s not sticky at all and the scent is much less noticeable than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t wear off unevenly and it&#x27;s easy to control how dark your tan gets by varying how often you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is just how glittery it is.  It is very noticeable and since that&#x27;s not really my style, I&#x27;ve been applying at night so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m heading to the disco in the morning.  I plan to see if L&#x27;Oreal has a less glitterific version of this product, but even if they don&#x27;t, the color is so good I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> Wear it everyday.  Put sunscreen on, then apply this, and I&#x27;ve got a natural tan without the worry of sun damage.  Just got to rub it in really well, or you&#x27;ll get streaks.</li>
    <li> very blotchy and orange. not natural looking at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Natural Glow Daily moisturizer for years, and I wanted a darker tan (without having to apply a tan lotion every single day) so I picked this up and tried it out.  It worked fairly quickly- just 5 hours after I applied it, I noticed an all-over natural looking tan.  As other reviewers have mentioned- it&#x27;s really sparkly!  Fortunately the sparkles seem to rub off overnight.  I made a few mistakes during my first application: I got the cream on my ankles and knees which caused them to look too dark.  I did a second application a few days later with perfect results.  I put regular lotion on my knees, elbows, and ankles before applying the sublime bronze.  I applied a very thin layer of the cream all over and blended it in really well. I think the key to avoiding streaks and blotches with a self tanner is to use a small amount and blend it in really well.  Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This product gives you nice color and moisturizes fairly well. It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either. Just don&#x27;t put it on if you&#x27;re going out! The &amp;#34;luminous bronzer&amp;#34; leaves little specks of glitter all over you.</li>
    <li> LOVE the color. It&#x27;s not orange at all on me. I like that it has a bronzer in it so you&#x27;re instantly darker. It&#x27;s also helpful when applying. What I don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;sparkle.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t put it on and leave the house without looking like a Cullen in the sun. But, I put it on before bed, shower in the morning, and all is well... and tan.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a self-tanner that is actually dark enough to look like I&#x27;ve been tanning. I used to tan in tanning beds but gave that up for 1.) spending too much money and 2.) I don&#x27;t want leathery skin when I&#x27;m older! I&#x27;ve tried store brand (not dark enough) and Jergens Natural Glow (not dark enough either). I read some good reviews on Sublime Bronze so I decided to give it a try. I just put it on yesterday and WOW! It&#x27;s not streaky if you know how to put on a self-tanner. You also don&#x27;t need to use that much of it at a time, so I feel a bottle will last me a while! The price is right too - I&#x27;m willing to spend a couple dollars more (than on Jergens, for example) if it&#x27;ll make me look like I&#x27;ve actually been tanning. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I have used self-tanners now for almost 4 years (year round) and I have tried several products, from tubs of mud to tan sheets to gel and lotion; some worked okay, but were very messy and time consuming; others just didn&#x27;t give me any color to speak of (I am very pale).  This product has a pleasant smell, super easy to use, takes no time to dry and won&#x27;t rub off on clothing or furniture, and gives me a wonderful bronze tone tan all over (with absolutely no orange or streaks; plus, it leaves no sticky residue.  I recommend lotion beforehand on all dry areas, plus, applying in circular motions for each section of the body.  This product even tans my face, which I have had a terrible time finding a product to do that. For some reason, my face just will not take/hold any color from other products, however, this product tans my face as dark as my body and it stays there for days.  I am ordering extra bottles of this to make sure I never run out and would highly recommend you try this product if you are having problems with other products.</li>
    <li> blending is difficult. It&#x27;s also full of glitter which makes your skin look ridiculous</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, however I made some slight modifications that have helped me. I mixed the bronzer with regular lotion. This helped me control how dark I got, allowed for more even coverage, keeps your hands from turning orange, dries without leaving to much stickiness, keeps my skin mosturized and keeps the color from rubbing off on clothes. I shower, exfoliate and apply before bed, and then rinse off in the morning(which takes care of the glitter issue). I have had no trouble with streaking, uneven color or an orange hue. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> This is the worst self-tanner I have ever tried. I am an adult; I want to look tanned. I do not want to look like a child covered in glitter. The product claims it will give you an instant sun-kissed glow, but all it does is cover you with glitter like a 5 year old. Really horrible product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled so I would use it at  night and take a shower in the morning.  This did not keep the tan look as long but it still worked.  The third day application (using it AFTER the shower as directed) it started getting a bit orange, but two days I think looks awesome! I recommend applying with a glove on otherwise your hands turn a funky orange color!</li>
    <li> I cant find this in stores anymore, and its my favorite self tanner ever. It shipped sooo so quickly too.</li>
    <li> The delivery was very fast. However the item is very watery. Not the same consistency as when I purchased it at the make up store. It was difficult to apply as it ran all over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early to mid twenties, which means glitter can be a problem, but isn&#x27;t while I&#x27;m unemployed and looking for a job/finishing school. I just put this stuff on before a night at bars, and less people hit on me because... well, who wants to date the girl with glitter all over her body (mostly a joke)?&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to my biology, I&#x27;m an Asian American with a pale complexion and skin that takes forever to tan. On the rare occasions that I burn, I usually just rub vitamin E oil into my skin to prevent peeling - and it works. I can&#x27;t deny that I&#x27;m a little jealous of my family members who are a beautiful golden color all year long, or who can get there just by sitting out in the sun for a few minutes. Seriously, I go for a walk for four hours and my arms barely get darker than the rest of my body. Which is why I tried tanning products and actually sitting out in the sun for ten minutes at a time this summer. The results? I&#x27;m actually an even light brown color - and that was before I stepped out and started a small tanning schedule a couple of weeks ago. That just helps to maintain it. I went from being more white-skinned than my very Caucasian, freckled friends, to being a little more tan than they are. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;This product still only gets four stars, you know, on account of the glitter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this self-tanner off and on for the past few years.  I just bought a new bottle after a lengthy hiatus because I&#x27;m going to a wedding and while I&#x27;ve mostly come to terms with my pale, pale legs, the mismatch between the color of my arms (fair) vs. legs (super fair) is a bit too obvious for summer wedding apparel.  Oh, but you were wondering about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said in the title of my review, I think the effectiveness of this product depends on who is using it.  Not just how well a person applies it, although that is very important, but also individual body chemistry.  Today was the first time I&#x27;ve read others&#x27; reviews of the product and I am astounded that some people think it doesn&#x27;t smell, or that it even smells good.  For me, the off-putting smell is the biggest reason I don&#x27;t like this product.  The latest formula does smell different right out of the bottle than previous versions - kind of like a heavy perfume rather than obvious chemical.  But once it interacts with my skin...look out!  I always apply self-tanner at night, just before bed.  I let it dry fully before putting on PJs (5-10 minutes, unless it is humid which requires more drying time), and I shower in the morning.  The smell fades after my morning shower, but it is still quite noticeable.  And here&#x27;s the kicker - I can still smell it on my skin days later, with only one application, despite showering daily (yes, with soap).  Through my pants, even! Hence my new conclusion that it reacts differently on different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think this might explain why some people find it makes them orangish whereas others are beautifully bronzed.  If I apply it too frequently, I tend to look orangish, but one application gives me a nice glow.  The color of my skin after using the self-tanner does look different in different lighting, just as natural skin does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find it works well when I apply it carefully and let it dry - more even coverage than other products I have tried.  I have put it on my face by blending it with my daily moisturizer in my palm before spreading the mixed products over my face (50/50 ratio). That brings out a bit of color without overdoing it.  But I hate the smell of it on my skin, so I knocked a star off for that. I would have taken off two stars, but no one has ever commented on the smell, so either I have really polite friends and coworkers, or it is not as noticeable to others as it is to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last tip - definitely wash your hands periodically as you apply so you aren&#x27;t stuck with orange palms.  As for the shimmer (which they also, er, enhanced with this latest formula), it is very obvious when first applied, but I didn&#x27;t notice it all after it had dried and especially after I had showered the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a quick tan (I love the immediate bronzing effect) and don&#x27;t mind a little work to blend it in well (the product is slippery, so you have to really rub it in instead of swiping it on), it is worth a try.  If you find you look orange or smell badly after using it, maybe this just isn&#x27;t the product for your particular body chemistry.  Unlike sun damage, it isn&#x27;t permanent.</li>
    <li> one tube was not good, like water ,the other not as  bad. threw one away . will not buy again</li>
    <li> Came on dark, dried to skin tone. I used over half the bottle on my body and it dried up like plastic and flaked off! Came off instantly in the bath!  It could tan my face well, but washed off simply with water as well.  It smelled horrible, had to air out the house afterwards!  Nothing good about this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am a very pale person and even burn after 2 minutes in the tanning bed. This is the first self-tanner that I have tried that I actually like. I could see immediate results as opposed to other \\&quot;build-able\\&quot; tanners. What I like most about this is that it is both a build-able tanner and I can see immediate results. This means that I can see the color when I put it on and it is just the right amount of tint to keep using until I reach the right amount of tan. I don&#x27;t like results that I have to wait an hour to see. I had to take off one star for the following reasons: glitter...way too much glitter. I am 25 and do not want to look like a 16 year old fairy. However, I put this on after exfoliation at night, then when I woke up the next day, the glitter was gone and I had a beautiful glow. I recommend using this before bed and not before you go out because the glitter is so intense that it should come with a warning label. The second Con is that it was very sticky at night. My night gown kind of stuck to me before bed, but again, the stickiness was gone the next day. The tan that I got was bronze, not orange, which is hard to find for someone who is super pale. Other self-tanners always seen to leave me looking orange because I have a very pink pigment. Overall I really like this product and will continue to use it as long as the price doesn&#x27;t get higher. $10 is probably the most I would spend on a good self-tanner.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and have tried lots and lots of different self-tanners. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. I even mix some in my regular body lotion each day for a light glow during the winter months. It does have &amp;#34;that smell&amp;#34; when it dries, but they all do.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in this  - thought it would be a good \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; bronzer - but  it streaks on me -  does not look good....  I prefer the Bronzing towelletts...they work great !  Sorry  this luminous bronzer just does not get it for me !</li>
    <li> This works great if you need a little color for the day. It mostly washes off, but you won&#x27;t have any problems looking streaky or orange. It has a nice glow and warmth, more golden bronze than than a brown color. The smell is fine also. The only thing I&#x27;ve encountered a couple of times is people commenting about the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; I&#x27;m wearing. Not exactly what I&#x27;m going for, but in certain lights it can look a little glittery.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product before from retail stores and love it. Ordered it from Amazon because of the great price. The product is watery. It is awful to try to put on. It does not smell right either. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> This stuff was like water!  This is supposed to be a lotion not a watery substance.  I cannot use it because it just pours into my hand, through my fingers and onto the floor.  It is either old stuff or something.  The top is different on this bottle that from what I have bought in the past and not what is in the picture. I believe they sent me the wrong stuff.  Will not buy from these people again!</li>
    <li> This product gives you a beautiful summer glow. At a reasonable price too. It&#x27;s helpful to put on lotion after each application to help elimate any possible streaking. The only thing I would change is the glittery sparkle. My friends have accused me of being a vampire a few times. ;0)</li>
    <li> Smells a little funny, but works well. I had a few orange-ish spots on my body but I don&#x27;t know if that was user error, I&#x27;m new to this! I eventually mixed some of my own lotion in with it as this is fairly runny, and that seemed to help(along with less splotchiness), just takes longer to build up the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, nice product, everything came as they describe it.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer works really well for immediate results. I ignore the instructions though and I thoroughly rub the lotion in (I only use this on my legs) and I get no streaks when I rub it in. And I just make sure to immediately wash my hands and any areas where I may have unintentionally gotten the bronzer. It does leave a substantial amount of glitter behind but it washes and wears off after the first day. I don&#x27;t really mind the glitter. Would I normally apply glitter to my legs? No. But I chalk it up as fun and don&#x27;t concern myself with the glitter. If you don&#x27;t mind glitter or don&#x27;t let it get to you then it&#x27;s an awesome product that works extremely well.</li>
    <li> this product instantly tans you. did not work for my face at all, but I used it with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze Clear Self-Tanning Gel, and it both combined gave me a bronze instead of the orange color. use sparingly on hands and ankles though. my hands got so dark hahaha</li>
    <li> The amount of glitter is rediculous! The tube should read &amp;#34;sparkle Tan.&amp;#34; Emphasis on the sparkle! Going to return it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just like store bought except I didn&#x27;t leave my house. Came within 2 days. Packed great. Thanks</li>
    <li> This may be the best sunless product I have ever used. I am very very fair and have tried numerous products. I love that it works instantly and leaves a gorgeous glimmer on your skin. My husband loves when I use it and says I glow. If you follow basic sunless guidelines it does not streak. I love this product. Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> The immediate bronze Colorado is really weird with my skin, it&#x27;s almost a yellow green. There is also white a bit of shimmer. But, if you apply it at night before bed, you can shower off the shimmer and the weird bronze Color, and the resulting tan is pretty good. Its not super WOW-YOURE-TAN, but its a good subtle glow.</li>
    <li> color is great, you can go from white to tan overnight with one application, two applications and you are pretty dark. the sparkles are a little noticible, people have commented and i tell them, \\&quot;ya, it&#x27;s from my tanning cream, cool eh....looks great and better than skin cancer, lol\\&quot; I like em, and if your going to a club/bar even better. if you are insecure and self conscious use a different product from same company.</li>
    <li> I received this item on August 29th and tried using it a few days later.  I still had a partial tube that I had bought at Target so I knew I liked the product.  This tube was unusable as it was not thick like a lotion but rather thin and runny, more like the consistency of milk.  Amazon sent a credit immediately, no further questions asked.  I give this purchase a 1 star as the product was unusable and I threw the tube away; however, I believe this must have come from a bad batch and is not indicative of this product in general. I would order it again.  Other than the sparkles (which I could do without but do disappear after a nights sleep) I like the light, brown glow it imparts to my otherwise very pale skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this prodect because I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal Bronzers before and been very happy. Normally, I purchased them from a store, i.e. Walmart, etc. Naturally, I assumed this prodect would be similar. It is NOT lotion, but a watery bronze liquid. I thought I hadn&#x27;t shaken it up good enough but no matter how much I shake, it is still a watery bronze liquid. I used it anyway and it does work but it is very difficult to apply. It&#x27;s almost as if it should be in a spray bottle. I would not recommend this product. I&#x27;m going to use it because I paid for it, but I&#x27;ll never order it again.</li>
    <li> This ended up all liquid, not much of a lotion anymore. I did get a refund which was nice, and the product I bought at the store was still a lotion. I think the temperature changes may have made a difference with this, not sure. I didn&#x27;t find a date or anything. I may have just had some bad luck, thanks anyways.</li>
    <li> This bronzer has been diluted.  Unlike the normal, easy-to-apply gel that gives you a deep tan, this product is thin and watery with a strong chemical smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion was watery and runny.....I have purchased this from Walmart, AMAZON.COM DIRECT, and other retailers.....And it is a very thick lotion when it&#x27;s fresh and not watered down......But this lotion was watery and runny.....GROSS!!!..........I would NOT purchase this  particular product from this  supplier.......It was not worth packing it up and shipping it back!.....NOTE: This is the best self tanner on the market today.....very sparkly &amp; you get a permanent dark tan ( more like a skin stain) JUST NOT FROM THIS SUPPLIER.....ORDER DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON.COM NOT A SECOND PARTY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m irish, pale, and recently moved to Florida. My skin was eaten alive by the sun and I was diagnosed with PMLE - an allergy to the intense rays of the sun. Needless to say, getting a natural tan was out of the question. I picked this product up because several people suggested it to me. I started with it on my chest just to see if it works. The smell is thick, but not bad to me. the bottle instructed me to &amp;#34;rub it on like a lotion,&amp;#34; and some youtube videos said to put it on very light. I followed the rules, and from my chest, began to spread it all around. Due to my pale skin, it went on and took effect pretty fast, so &#x27;Instant Action&#x27; is no lie. What I noticed first of all was the sparkles. Wow, was I glittery! I didn&#x27;t like that so much. what I liked even less is how STICKY it is! I made the mistake of sitting down... Don&#x27;t do that. You&#x27;ll be glued to the chair. Definitely don&#x27;t put on clothes for awhile. In fact, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t even apply this stuff unless you have a full 10 hours of a boring day with no plans ahead of you. Once it&#x27;s on, you have to avoid contact with everything. and after about an hour, go ahead and shower, no soap or shampoo, just warm water. wash off as much as you can (which the instructions kindly do not include. Thanks!) and then dry off with a DARK towel, no white, you&#x27;ll stain it with &#x27;instant action.&#x27; Once you&#x27;re dry, you can see all the spots you missed. I myself had a huge blotchy pattern of pale white skin under my neck, which I&#x27;ve not been able to repair yet. I tried touching it up, but it seems like that single patch of skin just is immune to this product, no idea why. The result is, I look like I have a nasty birth mark. Hopefully other people have better luck. But bottom line? DOES this product work? Yeah, it works. In the most basic of senses, it stains your skin a darker tone. It just doesn&#x27;t work as overall well for some of us than it does for others. If you have 7 bucks to spare and can&#x27;t get a natural tan, or don&#x27;t want to spend more than that, then, yeah, give this a try. Just make sure you have plenty of time to spare and clothes that hide your body in case it doesn&#x27;t work, because it takes about a month to fade away. Also a tip, adding more of this product to a place of skin that it didn&#x27;t take effect to WON&#x27;T make it work. In fact, all it tends to do is cause it to peel off and reveal even MORE bare pale skin, looking worse than before. Either you get it right the first time, or you&#x27;re stuck doing touch-ups for a month. Good luck.ant to spend more than that, then, yeah, give this a try.

    <li> Great price and fast shipping. Goes on easy and is super pretty. I love it! No streaks and leaves my legs looking tan.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer and self tanner! It is very thin so you can glide it over your skin with no streaking. It also has a little bit of golden glow to it. I usually add one pump of my favorite body lotion so there is no smell, but even alone there is minimal &#x27;self-tanner-smell&#x27; to deal with. I&#x27;ve tried them all from $$$ to cheap and this is my go to!</li>
    <li> The product was really runny and hard to use. It was not a lotion... It was a liquid. I&#x27;ll stick with my first choice in a tube that was not available here.</li>
    <li> Watery and not anything like the actual product if bought in store.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Gave a nice sparkle too! I even used it the morning of the wedding with no worries of rubbing off.</li>
    <li> My story is that I didn&#x27;t intend to buy this product, Im a spraying tan person for yrs, as many of you might know. after like one week of spray tan, you really have the chance to look like a  leprosis, which is truly a downside ! anyway there this one time after I got my spray done, I went to target wanting to find some self-tanning products that I can use gradually to make myself less leprosy after my fake tan comes off. Here it is I grabbed this Loreal product. Honestly if you have uneven spraying tan or whatever on your body, you cant count on this product to instantly fill out the white spot, because of this, I discontinued using it, putting it on my bathroom table and haven&#x27;t touched it ever since until recently(its spring now). Im pale the whole body and one night I just came up randomly thinking why not put on this lotion see how it works, if it doesn&#x27;t  work or i don&#x27;t like the result, i can throw this away anytime i want, besides one time application wont hurt much:P So I started to put it on like i use other regular body lotion, it drys out super fast, at the moment i finish applying i can put on my pajamas no problem, it smells like coconut, and yes I&#x27;m glittering LOL i don&#x27;t feel any streaky or dry on my body. after using 2 days morning and night, i have reached the color that i wanted! and now im hooked! Officially say goodbye to tanning salon! I can save tons of money and no risks of being look like a leprosis or any health problems that you might get from beds:)</li>
    <li> Make sure to rub this on in circles until it is totally soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problem with lines, streaks, patches, or runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like a man&#x27;s cologne a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw reviews saying there were way too many sparkles making people look like disco balls, so I almost didn&#x27;t buy this...DON&#x27;T LISTEN. There are hardly any. More like a light shimmer that you can barley see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATURAL LOOKING TAN FAST! I put it on before bed and was 3 tanning sessions darker the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again when my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This is the first self-tanner that I tried before experimenting with other self tanners. It has a very strong chemical scent that gives me a headache and is very glittery. I thought it would just give me a sheer shine when in the sunlight but there are actually little pieces of glitter inside the lotion and a lot at that. I could not wear it out because it looked ridiculous. The tan it gave was also not very noticeable. I tried several applications but the strong smell and glitter made it difficult and frustrating to continue using.</li>
    <li> I researched quite a few Instant Tanning Lotions, Gels, &amp; Sprays before purchasing this product. I decided to buy this product (can be found at Walmart, Target, etc) so I can have a natural tan look in my wedding gown. I recommend putting this product on daily atleast 3-4 days prior to wedding day all over body except face and NOT putting it on on the actual day of the event. It did not rub off on my gown when I sweat and looks so natural. I applied it every morning after taking shower and exfoliating my whole body (TIP: the more you scrub your body in shower the better this lotion will go on &amp; blend). Before applying the tanning lotion I would apply regular moisturizer on my ankles, feet, knees, elbows, hands...common dry areas). This avoids dark spots. I chose not to apply the tanning lotion directly to my palms even though bottle says you can (wanted to avoid orange hands) and simply applied it to a wash cloth I would throw out later. I wiped the tanning lotion all over my bod and made sure it was rubbed in completely. Discard washcloth &amp; wash hands immediately after use. Then I chose to air dry for about 20-30 minutes (by time I blow dried the hair &amp; applied my face makeup I was dry and not sticky). The smell at first reminds me of caramel/sun tan lotion but when dry is not that strong. And yes it is glittery when first applied but when dries its not really noticeable. You will see after JUST ONE HOUR a nice tan and only gets better from there. People thought I got spray tanned because I&#x27;m normally so dang pale and do not tan at all. LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I applied this lotion this morning before work in a hurry.  It applies fine, although the fragrance is very strong, and more like a men&#x27;s deodorant than a women&#x27;s lotion.  Then I realized I was sparkling.  This lotion is full of glitter - and not labeled accordingly.  I guess that&#x27;s what L&#x27;Oreal means by \\&quot;luminous?\\&quot;  Looking (and smelling, according to my husband) like a stripper, I drove to work and used a wet wipe to remove some of the glitter, but it is tenacious, and I look like an idiot.  The \\&quot;luminosity\\&quot; is not subtle; my arms and legs are covered in glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m annoyed by the fact that L&#x27;Oreal is so sure women want to be covered in glitter that they don&#x27;t even bother to point it out on the label.  The hassle is hardly worth the refund price, but I&#x27;m going to return this product on principle.  The self-tanning qualities of the product are moot, since if you shower and apply lotion in the morning before going to a regular, non sex-industry job, you can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with this product because first of all, it smells like Old Spice or Irish Spring soap; second, it doesn&#x27;t go on very well - it felt like I was smearing honey on my legs - very sticky; third, the color is very orange on me; fourth, my legs are still sticky, sort of tacky feeling, and my clothes are sticking to my legs now. The reason I tried this product is because I break out with a rash whenever I use other self-tanning products. So, I was hoping this one would be better. No rash yet, but will update post.</li>
    <li> This stuff is extremely runny and gets everywhere. It gets me dark but it leaves a bunch of streaks and makes me look splotchy. Also WAY to much glitter in it.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin. I bought Jergens tanning lotion first, but got an awful rash on my legs from it that lasted two weeks! I really wanted to do sunless tanning though, so I tried again with Loreal. Compared to Jergens, it dried much faster, almost instantly. It also gave a darker tan than the medium Jergens one. Since I wasn&#x27;t prepared for that, I had a little bit of streaking on my first application. The second time around, I mixed it with regular lotion to do my feet. I also blended a little regular lotion when I felt it drying before I was finished applying it evenly. The result was a perfect tan, with no streaking. I love the hint of shimmer, but the sparkly effect is really not visible at all unless you are looking for it, which is fine with me. Also, compared to other brands of tanning lotion I have tried (Banana boat, Jergens, Mystic tanning spray), that sunless tanner scent is almost non existent, even on the day of application. I am thrilled to have discovered this product, and plan to keep buying it forever. I use the Jergens face lotion on my face and neck though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful glow within hours! Prior reviews mentioned the consistency of this product. With that in mind I purchased a self tanker application mit. With the mit, application is easy. Without the kit, I would be concerned about the thin consistency. That could be......traumatic! Get the mitt they&#x27;re on Amazon for like $3 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00297436O B00297436O]]  Get the mit!</li>
