      <li>This this is awesome, it provides instant relief from irritation and bumps and will continue to provide relief if you use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked like magic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad there is an item like this for razor bumps and ingrown hair.  </li>
      <li>and I was easily able to squeeze the ingrown hair out.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Ok seems to work fine</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot man and keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth.</li>
      <li>i am bump free</li>
      <li>my face is as smooth as baby skin</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and the most important - immediate results right after your first use.</li>
      <li>I used it under my arms and gave me a clean shave.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m super smooth.</li>
      <li>I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING A GOOD ROUTINE DURING A HOT SHOWER.</li>
      <li>it is worth every penny, I&#x27;ve spread the word to people I know</li>
      <li>Then for about 1 more week once a day use for a less than a minute Wizker made my problematic skin very smooth and absolutely razor bumps free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used exfoliating brushes before and while they are somewhat effective, they need to be used dry, and I would often forget to use them.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this if you want soft, smooth skin!</li>
      <li>I received the Wizker in the mail today and used it for the first time on an area with an existing ingrown hair.</li>
      <li>twenty minutes ago I used the WIZKER for the first time and</li>
      <li>hope this product sticks around for a while, because I will be buying more in the future.</li>
      <li>i see positive results non</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>it really hasn&#x27;t helped me at all...</li>
      <li>Special tweezers, chemicals, facial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m doing something wrong, I&#x27;d love to hear it, but so far this seems to aggravate more than help.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This is the best product to eliminate annoying razor bumps finally i found the real solution for my bumps after wasting a lot of money on creams and shaver non of em work when i tried this first time</li>
      <li>and if it works for you you&#x27;ll be doing the same, real talk!</li>
      <li>wow!  </li>
      <li>Very simple just brush against the grain at least twice a day,I brush 3 times,once in the shower,then right after I shave,once more at night before bedtime.</li>
      <li>Used lightly for a week to allow skin to heal from previous bumps.</li>
      <li>Still trying this out, but so far, I believe it has been helping my bikini line.</li>
      <li>MY PURCHASE WAS DIRECT FROM WIZKER</li>
      <li>and so far it does what its suppose to.</li>
      <li>I bought this item directly on another website.  </li>
      <li>Fast Forward,  I&#x27;m on my 2nd wizker brush and have been using the product since May</li>
      <li>So far no razor bumps or ingrowns since I&#x27;ve been using the Wizker brush.</li>
      <li>For along time I was so stressed about the bumps I had in the back of my head because I never had this issue, Now I have gained a lot confidence back,  and still get them fresh fades</li>
      <li>It does hurt a little bit at first and takes some getting used to</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s a reason they only show the brush side the other side is a huge concave hole not comfortable to hold while using!</li>

<li> And the most amazing part is that once the annoying bumps disappear they don&#x27;t come back unless you shave the wrong way for about a week or two and don&#x27;t use the Wizker after that.&lt;br</li>
<li> Wizker can be used wet or dry.</li>
<li> Well where to start, I was suffering from ingrown/razor bumps on the back of my head and neck area for about a year and half, I tried everything because I have never had this issue before.</li>
<li> much less sensitive or delicate areas such as face or bikini line!</li>
<li> buying one of these for my father who suffers mightily from razor bumps.  </li>
<li> Product is a stiff plastic brush with short, sharp teeth.</li>
<li> I was skeptical at first</li>
<li> This product, so far, seems to make them a lot worse.  </li>
<li> but sometime it hurts a little bit.</li>
<li> I use it after every shower and apply a little sea breeze after brushing.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with razor bumps and ingrowns for over 30 years,not all over but in 3 trouble spots on my face and neck.</li>
<li> You might as well buy some scrub brush from the dollar store, at least it would be less harsh on your skin</li>
<li> Price is too much for the material used, its hard to hold on too, very poor design!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone was raving about this product-</li>
<li> Not sure which is worse.</li>
<li> I have been dealing with bad razor bumps lately on my shoulders and back.  </li>
<li> Looking at it &amp; feeling how hard the bristles are, I&#x27;d be afraid to put it just about anywhere on my body</li>
<li> I was shocked</li>

    <li> This this is awesome, it provides instant relief from irritation and bumps and will continue to provide relief if you use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the liquid &#x27;bump relief&#x27; out there and this is the only product I have actually seen and FELT results from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product sticks around for a while, because I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Ok seems to work fine but there&#x27;s a reason they only show the brush side the other side is a huge concave hole not comfortable to hold while using!</li>
    <li> I bought this item directly on another website.  I&#x27;m glad there is an item like this for razor bumps and ingrown hair.  I use this item in conjunction with tweezers and it is 99% effective in solving my ingrown hair dilemma.  I plan on purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product for about a week now and so far it does what its suppose to.</li>
    <li> It worked instantly! I used it under my arms and gave me a clean shave. I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I&#x27;m an African American woman who has been fighting and suffering from ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;in my chin for decades.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  Special tweezers, chemicals, facial treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I swear--- twenty minutes ago I used the WIZKER for the first time and wow!  My skin was immediately&lt;br /&gt;exfoliated and all the ingrown hairs just appeared and the itchy, blotchy ingrown spots were immediately&lt;br /&gt;smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this supposed to happen so quickly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying one of these for my father who suffers mightily from razor bumps.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Well where to start, I was suffering from ingrown/razor bumps on the back of my head and neck area for about a year and half, I tried everything because I have never had this issue before. I began to wonder if it was my barbers clippers but it wasn&#x27;t that.  So I stumbled across this skin car page on Face book sponsored by the providers at Wizker and seen this wizker brush, for 15 dollars I said I might as well give it a try.  Within a week I saw instant results! I was shocked but it began to make sense, you have to exfoliate your skin.  I praised the providers at Wizker as this product did as it was intended to do.  I use it after every shower and apply a little sea breeze after brushing.  This is the smoothest the back of my head has ever been, this product has saved me.  For along time I was so stressed about the bumps I had in the back of my head because I never had this issue, Now I have gained a lot confidence back,  and still get them fresh fades I was use to getting.  Fast Forward,  I&#x27;m on my 2nd wizker brush and have been using the product since May and I&#x27;m super smooth. So give it shot it is worth every penny, I&#x27;ve spread the word to people I know and if it works for you you&#x27;ll be doing the same, real talk!</li>
    <li> Still trying this out, but so far, I believe it has been helping my bikini line.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! saw an instant difference. It does hurt a little bit at first and takes some getting used to but I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with bad razor bumps lately on my shoulders and back.  This product, so far, seems to make them a lot worse.  I&#x27;m using witch hazel too.  It seems that no matter how I shave, with razor or bodygrooming device, and no matter what I do to prep it or what I do afterward, I get the razor bumps.  This device hurts and when I use it, the bumps get darker red and don&#x27;t go away.  If I&#x27;m doing something wrong, I&#x27;d love to hear it, but so far this seems to aggravate more than help.</li>
    <li> I received the Wizker in the mail today and used it for the first time on an area with an existing ingrown hair. Without any pain or picking, it exfoliated the area to the point where the head of the pore opened up and I was easily able to squeeze the ingrown hair out. Awesome. I&#x27;ve used exfoliating brushes before and while they are somewhat effective, they need to be used dry, and I would often forget to use them. Wizker can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin smooth. Use it after shower. Removes ingrown hair successfully.</li>
    <li> Very good product, love it !</li>
    <li> I would have gave it 4 stars but sometime it hurts a little bit.</li>
    <li> Price is too much for the material used, its hard to hold on too, very poor design!</li>
    <li> This is the best product to eliminate annoying razor bumps finally i found the real solution for my bumps after wasting a lot of money on creams and shaver non of em work when i tried this first time my skin felt good rubbing with wizker after 2 days i see positive results non i am bump free my face is as smooth as baby skin lol thank u wizker for this great product</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!! Definitely reccomend this for people who suffer from&lt;br /&gt;Razor burn and bumps</li>
    <li> Product is a stiff plastic brush with short, sharp teeth. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone was raving about this product- it really hasn&#x27;t helped me at all...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with razor bumps and ingrowns for over 30 years,not all over but in 3 trouble spots on my face and neck.I tried lotions and they do help,but this brush actually works.Very simple just brush against the grain at least twice a day,I brush 3 times,once in the shower,then right after I shave,once more at night before bedtime.So far no razor bumps or ingrowns since I&#x27;ve been using the Wizker brush.Great product.</li>
    <li> Not sure which is worse. The claw marks or in grown hairs?!?</li>
    <li> Looking at it &amp; feeling how hard the bristles are, I&#x27;d be afraid to put it just about anywhere on my body much less sensitive or delicate areas such as face or bikini line! You might as well buy some scrub brush from the dollar store, at least it would be less harsh on your skin</li>
    <li> It works. Had tender skin when I got the brush. Used lightly for a week to allow skin to heal from previous bumps. Then I shaved. It worked like magic. Thanks a lot man and keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> USING THIS METHOD FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS IT REALLY WORKS FOR ME. I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING A GOOD ROUTINE DURING A HOT SHOWER. THEN A CLOSE SHAVE ABOUT EVERY 2-3 DAYS WITH A DE RAZOR * MY PURCHASE WAS DIRECT FROM WIZKER*</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but once i gave it a try....AMAZING product!!!! I highly recommend this if you want soft, smooth skin! It is a must for any daily shower routine.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:efde7c4987c9f34f978a6a4ec83b419e]] Wizker is a wonderful brush! Very easy to use and the most important - immediate results right after your first use. When i tried it almost all the bumps in my bikini zone  disappeared 5 min.  after i applied it on my skin. Then for about 1 more week once a day use for a less than a minute Wizker made my problematic skin very smooth and absolutely razor bumps free. And the most amazing part is that once the annoying bumps disappear they don&#x27;t come back unless you shave the wrong way for about a week or two and don&#x27;t use the Wizker after that.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing! Love it!</li>
