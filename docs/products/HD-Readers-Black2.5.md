      <li>I like the lenses but cant find a pair of frames they will fit in.</li>

      <li>I have one pair with seven breaks that were super glued.</li>
      <li>I have one more new pair stashed away and will NOT be reordering after it breaks...which I am assuming it will.</li>
      <li>The bifocals work fine but the frames, especially the top part of the frame over the lens, will break.</li>

      <li>frame quality is sooo  poor, I have no clue, why this kind of cheap plastic costs that much money, absolutely not worth about 10</li>
      <li>I bought two pair and both broke in exactly then same spot after just two weeks of use.</li>
      <li>I wear them motorcycling and they allow full view of instruments and GPS etc but the bifocal is low enough that it doesn&#x27;t intrude into the vision field.</li>
      <li>old dad and me</li>
      <li>The tan or  yellow color lens really make the blue and greens and flowers really stand out.</li>
      <li>the hd sun glass portion does not do till well on direct texas sunlight</li>
      <li>The lenses are just dark enough to keep me from squinting and yet light enough to allow me to leave them on inside or in shaded areas.</li>
      <li>old male.</li>
      <li>these glasses take a little getting used to you have to move the glasses around on your nose to get the right focus on the reading glass portion.</li>

<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
<li> I even tried to fix it with some glue/black tape, of course it is ugly, but it did not pan out....</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> How can you complain?  These glasses let me sit in the sun and read with my contacts on.  Easy to read with and easy to see through when not reading.</li>
    <li> I wear these all the time as sunglasses but if I am in a store trying to read small print I put them on in the store. Some people look at me kind of strange as to why I am putting on sunglasses in a store but if they help me to see the fine print it works for me. I always like to have a spare or 2 on hand in case they break.</li>
    <li> Great glasses, I recently had cataract surgery and only need galsses for reading. I use them daily and they are great to use on the golf course when entering scores on the score card.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased 2 pair one for my 73 yr. old dad and me a 52 yr. old male. I am very pleased, normally wear Vuarnet but to wear outside and read these do the trick and for a bargain price, quality is very good these will last me, a good deal, I use these to ride at night on my Harley.</li>
    <li> These were not good quality. I bought 2 pairs and both pairs broke within a week. With just simple every day use.</li>
    <li> these glasses take a little getting used to you have to move the glasses around on your nose to get the right focus on the reading glass portion. the hd sun glass portion does not do till well on direct texas sunlight they are to light and doesn&#x27;t block out enough light to be able to look directly into the sunlight</li>
    <li> Good bifocal, comfortable. I usually forget I&#x27;m wearing them. With age, the frame will break.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third pair.</li>
    <li> I bought two pair and both broke in exactly then same spot after just two weeks of use. COMPLETE waste of money!!</li>
    <li> For ages, had to swap between my sunglasses and my reading glasses, if I wanted to read a map while navigating for my spouse... after I discovered these, it has made our outings so much easier.</li>
    <li> I wear these exclusively. They are without a doubt the perfect sunglasses for anyone who needs to read,or operate devices while outdoors. I wear them motorcycling and they allow full view of instruments and GPS etc but the bifocal is low enough that it doesn&#x27;t intrude into the vision field.No other glasses I have used are this friendly! Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Can see great with these!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I always get these - have a few pair all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I look great in them as well</li>
    <li> not the same product that i had previously purchased @ a drug store these glasses are a copy of the ones SEEN ON TV</li>
    <li> Was just what I was looking for so that I could read my book at the pool or beach without having to put on two pairs of glasses and looking ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I find that these fit the bill quite nicely. Due to cataract operation, I need sun glasses&lt;br /&gt;and, a bi-focal for reading small print (crossword puzzles). These are great for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I love these glasses! The lenses are just dark enough to keep me from squinting and yet light enough to allow me to leave them on inside or in shaded areas. The reader lens is small enough and out of the line of sight so that they are not bothersome but plenty large enough to do the job! The hype about improving acuity is BS, but that&#x27;s not what I bought them for.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these and gave them as gifts. I like to wear mine in the Fall when the the leaves are changing. It makes the colors even more vibrant.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have super glue handy. These things break sometimes within hours of first use. The bifocals work fine but the frames, especially the top part of the frame over the lens, will break. I always buy five at a time if the price is less than $5.00. I need them to read in the sun. I have one pair with seven breaks that were super glued. I don&#x27;t know if the heat weakens them, but hey, they are advertised as sunglasses. Beware.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of food allergies,  and these are perfect when I shop, because I can read the ingredients.  I also use them when I get the mail. I don&#x27;t need anything for distance , bifocal sunglasses cost--these don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> NICE TO HAVE A TWO FOR ONE OPTION. DELIVERY WAS FAST. PRODUCT REALLY WORKS WELL. FORGOT MY READING GLASSES AT HOME HAD THESE IN CAR  DAY AND USED THESE. GREAT FOR MOMENTS LIKE THIS TO HAVE ON HAND.</li>
    <li> I used the glasses&lt;br /&gt;( HD VISION readers 2.5 as seen on TV )  for about 2-3 days.....then, as other customers described before already, the frame broke. I even tried to fix it with some glue/black tape, of course it is ugly, but it did not pan out....&lt;br /&gt;The frame quality is sooo  poor, I have no clue, why this kind of cheap plastic costs that much money, absolutely not worth about 10$, material has a value of max.2$.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed, returned it, and just wait for a refund, even though I really love the idea, having to use just one glasses for everything.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN BUYING THESE SUNGLASSES FOR A FEW YEARS. The frames constantly break. Due to heat, cold, stress from putting on and taking off your face. Frames are TRASH. I like the lenses but cant find a pair of frames they will fit in. I will no longer buy this trash and you should not either. You been warned.</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona in the winter and really enjoy these glasses. The tan or  yellow color lens really make the blue and greens and flowers really stand out. Its about the 6th or 7th pair I have bought so I must like them.</li>
    <li> Love the readers. I wear contact for distance and need reading glasses for close up when I have the contact on. These are perfect for driving and using them outside.&lt;br /&gt;Biggest problem is that the frame breaks in the same spot every time. I have purchased several pair in the past and they all break at the top of the frame on the right side. I probably wore the glasses 40 times which is not really a lot. Has to be a design flaw, but there has been plenty of time to fix that. I have one more new pair stashed away and will NOT be reordering after it breaks...which I am assuming it will. There is nothing on the box nor it there an insert that has a guarantee or warranty.</li>
