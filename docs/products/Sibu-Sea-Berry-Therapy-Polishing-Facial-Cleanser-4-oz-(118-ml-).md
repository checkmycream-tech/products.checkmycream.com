      <li>If your skin is more oily I think this would be good, but if you&#x27;re dry and/or sensitive, proceed with caution.</li>
      <li>but it actually cleans it nicely and makes skin feel fresh.</li>
      <li>I love this face wash, I have really sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok, this feels really nice on my skin and I thought I would love it.  Before you know it, I am broken out all over my face.  I stopped it and went back to my other cleanser and it took about a week for me to clear up.  Don&#x27;t know what the problem is but if someone else says that it&#x27;s impurities, I&#x27;d rather keep the impurities so that my face is clear.</li>
    <li> After years of using various products from expensive to regular CVS etc. brands, I had skin issues.  Finally, I found this product and my skin has never been happier!  I understand that everyone is different and skin is a very individual issue so I obviously can&#x27;t say this will work for everyone, but it has really been wonderful to me and I am so happy I found this product! I have been using it for a year now and still love it!  My skin is combination, oily T-zone etc. so this has been wonderful for me!  No harsh chemicals, organic ingredients - can&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> cleanses well without drying, an excellent choice for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I really love this product- it makes my skin tight and feel extremely clean.  I wear a heavy base makeup that is very hard to remove but this product takes it off easily.  A little goes a long way/ I only use 1 pump for my face!</li>
    <li> I have an oily T zone, and dry to minimally oily skin everywhere else on my face. I pair it with my MIA clarisonic cleaner and use it regularly. I feel like  it has balanced my face wonderfully in conjunction with the toner, serum, and repair creme. It has a lovely, light citrus scent and just the right amount of grit (not abrasive, just enough!) Highly recommend to those looking to balance their skin who have combination skin. I will use sibu forever.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser, mildy exfoliates makes my skin look great, people have been commenting how great my skin looks highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works excellent I have oily skin and it keeps that down as well as it clean thoroughly will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is good for your skin. It does not help you with the skin tone but it actually cleans it nicely and makes skin feel fresh. One of the pros about this product is that it does not dry the skin too much. It has this orange taste and feeling when you scrub it around your face. However, I recommend this product to everyone. It would give this 5 stars only if it did help with the skin tone balancing.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and bought this (and the sea buckthorn oil) to try out together. As I&#x27;ve posted in my other review, my face is a little redder from these but the texture/bumps are WAY less. I suspect that my skin may get worse before better, but the only thing that has gotten a little worse is the redness. The most embarrassing thing about rosacea is the dryness and bumps and this has calmed those better than products I received from the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser has a &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; texture that melts away as you rub it in, if you feel this may be bothersome to your skin, you can definitely use a bit of water in your hands with the cleanser to help melt the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; into a smooth texture before you rub it into your face.&lt;br /&gt;I personally (surprisingly) haven&#x27;t really had to do this, as it melts pretty quickly and I combine it with lavender and tea tree oil cleanser and they *melt* together and feel amazing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This smells pretty  nice, and overall it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin (at least yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One amazing thing about this cleanser, is it removes makeup AMAZINGLY and easily. It manages to get off eyelash glue mixed with mascara off my eyelashes with ease, which Pureology cleanser was unable to do ( I LOVE pureology facial cleanser, but this got makeup off even better and was gentle/ didn&#x27;t irritate my skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post updates of how my rosacea does with this cleanser for those who need it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: THOUGH it helped with rosacea for awhile, It made my cystic acne much worse with this (It was very painful to even move some parts of my face).. It could have been a reaction, or it could have been the &amp;#34;worse before better&amp;#34;. But my skin looked so bad from the cystic acne that I couldn&#x27;t justify using it everyday. It&#x27;s good time to time.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Too much for my skin, had to move onto other products. It&#x27;s very helpful for rosacea, but it just didn&#x27;t work with my skin otherwise. People with rosacea should at least try it, it could work out amazingly!ingly!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser it ia a staple in my beauty routine because it is the most natural gentle cleanser. I use it in the morning and my acne cleanser at night and I think its helped to not have my face dry out.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels and works great!</li>
    <li> Very picky and have sensitive skin so was careful in this choice. Love the very light scent, it&#x27;s clear but very hydrating and cleans throughly. Takes some rinsing so be sure to use lots of water to remove. I use the bar soap with my rotating brush but this cleanser is better used alone. Recommend</li>
    <li> love how it makes my skin feel. This product is light but actually cleans my face without any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser both morning and evening for a couple weeks now, and I am beyond happy with it! I typically use 1-2 pumps of the product, and apply as directed by working it into a lather in my moistened hands, and gently massaging it over my face. This product is definitely very gentle, and even with the exfoliating beads my skin does not feel tight or raw after I use it. My skin is usually left a bit red after cleansing, so it&#x27;s amazing that it just appears clear after using this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also impressed with how well it removes my makeup at night. Even my stubborn mascara comes off with this cleanser! I don&#x27;t have any need for makeup remover wipes when I&#x27;m using this Sibu cleanser.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cleanser. I&#x27;m into using natural products and saw this reviewed by a blogger. Gave it a try and loved it right away. So gentle and refreshing and really makes your skin feel clean. Does not irritate and has so many benefits for your skin.</li>
    <li> i was recommended this product from my local health food store.  i am very glad i tried it. i need the gentle scrubbing it gives along with the gentle cleansing.</li>
    <li> I am 57 yr old mom and have spent $100&#x27;s on products for my face. The beads are effective on keeping my pores clean so I  have few breakouts. I wish I ran across this product years ago. I bought on a whim st Marshalls. I use MAC makeup and my face is clean without stripping.  I do have a favorite moisturizer by Pristine Beauty. No, I don&#x27;t sell any of these products. I bought this cleanser for my 20y son and 40y niece at Xmas. Thumbs up. I bought  an extra bottle to toss in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> At first I thought &amp;#34;oh nice my skin looks less blemished.&amp;#34; But then it got dry, this isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;balancing&amp;#34; like the name implies and then I got really blotchy. I think I&#x27;m outright allergic to something in it. I&#x27;ve tried it twice because I wanted to like it. My skin is ridiculous. If your skin is more oily I think this would be good, but if you&#x27;re dry and/or sensitive, proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> Nice gentle cleanser but unfortunately drys out my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday and although it smells great and is all natural my skin has become drier than usual (i have oily combination skin). Maybe i&#x27;ll be trying a different cleanser in the future but I can still recommend this one, the price makes it a great deal.</li>
    <li> Sibu Beauty keeps the bar of excellence high with this wonderful cleanser.  It has micro beads for exfoliating as an added bonus.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the only cleanser that scrubs damaged skin and aging skin.  Sibu is an excellent product</li>
    <li> I recomend everyone these products!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser I have ever used  - Does not dry out my skin or leave a greasy film on it</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser for my aging skin. It is gentle but helps balance my oily and dry combination complexion. I am leery of exotic ingredients, but the Sibu product line has really improved the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser. Takes my make up off easily. Just be gentle when washing because its like a scrub. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. I saw it on a you tube video of reviewed natural products. So glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Good product my wife like it because it make her skin bright and smooth</li>
    <li> Means for the care of skin. As well as soap, shampoo and hair conditioner based on natural sea buckthorn. My whole family enjoys a long and happy. Production of Israel. Highly recommend to all, no matter the sex and age.</li>
    <li> Nice cleanser with very mild exfoliant, smell is pleasant, seems to remove dirt and makeup we&#x27;ll.  not sure it&#x27;s any better than OTC products.  Skin looks no better.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  What a wonderful discovery.  First review I have written.  It is an ideal cleanser - exfoliant, soothing, and cooling.  Your face quickly tells you, \\&quot;yes! This is right!\\&quot; And your skin shows you that it&#x27;s true.  It is the buckthorn.  Wow.  What is in it?!??  Will use for a long, long time in combination wih other great finds.  Loved the soap, too.  Keep it away from water as it will melt away quickly.</li>
    <li> Added this to the day moisturizer and night cream and Love all three Sibu products!</li>
    <li> It does not get much netter than Sibu! I love the products. This cleanser leaves your face feeling clean and soft. I would recommned using the entire line: cleanser, exfoliant, day and night creams for the best results. I have been using them for months and love the results!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. Cleanses without stripping face or leaving a film. My skin feels like normal,  balanced skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my roscea.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice as a cleanser... however has not helped with acne much. Wish it could clear my skin up better! Been using for about a month.</li>
    <li> This product does not have enough grit to suit me. Maybe some one with a more delicate skin will appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser.  It is gentle and seemed to help my skin become clearer. My daughter really liked it. Will probably order again.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample and I loved it. I love the smell. It doesn&#x27;t overdry my skin and it leaves it feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I looooooove this facewash! It has a great citrus-y scent and really leaves your skin feeling clean, balanced, and refreshed, while not over-drying. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> A type of berry known as the “beauty berry” in Europe and Asia is one of the ingredients in this gel cleanser. The “beauty berry” which is the sea buckthorn berry got its nickname from the many excellent benefits for the skin. The first thing I like about this cleanser is that it is gel and not a nonfoaming. I find that nonfoaming cleansers tend to work best at dry skin and not well on the other types. But the gel cleansers work good on oily skin, sensitive skin, combination skin, and dry skin. I have oily skin, with large pores, pimples, and blackheads. I apply this cleanser everyday, morning and night. Once applied onto my face, I rub it in and around in circular motions, and then rinse it off. After that, I feel that my skin feels cooled down and clean. Then, I like to continue with the Sea Buckthorn Exfoliating Scrub also from Sibu Beauty. After both products, my skin feels smoother than ever and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I believe that this helped clear my acne that was pretty bad for the last 3 years.  (tried accutane, antibiotics, and every prescription cream known to man-- nothing worked).  I use it with Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different moisturizing gel and an oil free bb cream.  WILL CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE!</li>
    <li> This is the only cleanser that I have found that removes all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Price is great. And it arrived the day after I ordered it which was Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Although it looks quite mediocre, she said the product is fantastic, better than any facial cleanser she had experience with.</li>
    <li> I have used so many facial cleansers that claim to treat and prevent acne and I have always been dissatisfied. This product truly helped my skin clear up and it did not over dry my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, I have really sensitive skin and this is so gentle yet does a great job at cleansing. Great price too because only whole food sells it and it goes for about $25.00 for this bottle.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and wanted a line that had natural ingredients, with a focus on age reduction. I used to get a couple pimples a month with my Neutrogena, but I have had very few issues since starting with Sibu. Even when I do have a bump or a pimple, they are much small. I also tend to have skin on the dryer side so this product is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out even more like most products. I also love the smell and the exfoliation beads. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Not over drying. Feels gentle on the skin and still left with a fresh and clean feeling. Like the exfoliating particles</li>
    <li> Barbara&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple weeks and so far I like it.  My skin feels smooth and clean and yet not quite so tight as it has felt with other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. A little bit goes a long way and it is very effective in cleaning my face. I love the little scrubbing beads which I think are from apricot seeds. It has a very lovely feel to the skin and smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product, altho I have trouble if I get around the eye area, and it bothers&lt;br /&gt;my eyes.  It feels very nice and clean after using it, but since I have a problem with my eyes&lt;br /&gt;probably will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I love the Sibu moisturizer, so I thought I would try this out. Unfortunately this did not work very well for my oily skin. Shortly after I started using it, I started breaking out. I really wanted to like this product, but after a few weeks of using it, I am throwing the rest of it out. Maybe I will go back to the soap, used that without any break outs.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is an excellent facial cleanser for my rosacia and sensitive skin.  I noticed improvement immediately.  My skin is softer and clearer.  Cleanser is gentle, smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. Very cleansing without being too drying.</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend of mine that has issues with her face being dry and scally. She likes this product and has help with the redness and the itching and burning.</li>
    <li> I first tried this about two months ago. I love it. Cleanses without over drying. Works well with my prescribed ERY 1% gel. I buy this with the oil and soap bar consistently now.</li>
