      <li>So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country.</li>
      <li>And if there is a product out there that promises to manage frizz and to moisturize (because dryness is a huge problem for me too)</li>
      <li>is the product description for Smooth as Silk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it, and have even gotten multiple compliments at the office.    </li>
      <li>helps retain my color longer, less drying, delicious smell, creamy texture, gets my hair clean and I enjoy using it</li>
      <li>I follow with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk Conditioner and a Giovanni hair serum.</li>
      <li>I saw the Smooth as Silk Moisture shampoo online and decided to try it after using the 50-50.  </li>
      <li>Miss Treated Shampoo Parabn Free (1x11 OZ)]].</li>
      <li>It is cruelty free too which is what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>My hair is so shiny and smooth since using this product.</li>
      <li>For all of my adult life, I&#x27;ve fought a losing battle against frizz - wishing that I had that straight, shiny smooth hair that looks so great on everyone else.  </li>
      <li>I would even go so far as to say that it moisturized my hair even more than cowashing!</li>
      <li>I color my hair and this product really helps to keep it look silky and smooth!</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing and keeps my hair healthy, even with some heat styling.</li>
      <li>and I have two full bottles.</li>
      <li>Use it regularly and my hair is very healthy and shining.  </li>
      <li>I have been trying to use sulfate free shampoos and this product was my first.</li>
      <li>I think that this is going to be my new favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>This one is good in the winter when I get dry hair.</li>
      <li>Omg this shampoo is the real deal!!</li>
      <li>Giovanni makes great shampoos, free of SLS which is way too harsh but is still found in most commercial shampoos.</li>
      <li>The women/girls in my family started using the Giovanni 50-50 clarifying shampoo at the recommendation of a relative and really liked how well it cleans our hair.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to retain moisturized hair after my wash day was complete.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my curly but thin hair.</li>
      <li>Absolutley love the hydration it offers.  </li>
      <li>And to top it off, these products cost 1/3 to a 1/4 of many of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and it doesn&#x27;t look dry; it is smooth, and if I may say so myself, it&#x27;s just beautiful.  </li>
      <li>Made my straight, fine, non-color treated hair look really greasy.  </li>
      <li>Recently, I did some research into sulfate free shampoos and decided to try Giovanni, because it&#x27;s also cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>Granted, you still have to smooth dry the hair straight, but my hair has NEVER looked better -</li>
      <li>During the first, my hair felt a bit stripped.</li>
      <li>I love Giovanni products, especially because they are cruelty-free!</li>
      <li>My hair is also really soft to the touch, which is fantastic.</li>
      <li>although good, leaves my hair slightly greasy feeling very soon.</li>
      <li>It smells great and cleans well without using harsh chemicals that strip hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is fantastic, which led me to buy this, and while it is ok, it is a bit of a disappointment to be honest.</li>
      <li>Starting using it fairly recently and love it!  </li>
      <li>I actually bought it for my daughter who has fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Shampoo has a pearlized formula that glistens in your hand and transforms your hair into a silky palette that&#x27;s ready for anything.</li>
      <li>* Cleanses gently for manageable smoothness&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only reason why I bought a new smooth as silk deep moisture shampoo was because I realized that the one I was currently using was manufactured in 2001 (I know more than a decade ago)!</li>
      <li>It lathers better than some other sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
      <li>Smells good but just not good for me.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair and this shampoo works well without leaving my hair limp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but next time I&#x27;m trying out the hair spray instead as the final touch.)</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that gets greasy at the roots but very dry on the ends.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> i have been using this shampoo for a couple months now , and i love it ! i have naturally curly hair and it tends to get frizzy , this shampoo is great for my hair type !</li>
    <li> Great, but I find the 50:50 shampoo leaves my hair cleaner and  bouncier. This shampoo although good, leaves my hair slightly greasy feeling very soon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  I have fine hair that gets greasy at the roots but very dry on the ends.  This shampoo cleans well without overstripping the length.  I also really love the light scent, which is not overpowering or synthetic.  I am a Giovanni devotee and I love the matching conditioner as well as several of their other products.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have alot of hair, I live in the deep South (think serious humidity), and my hair is in that horrible no-man&#x27;s land of neither straight nor curly....just enough curl to have frizz and not enough straight to be manageable.  I have battled with it my entire life!!  And if there is a product out there that promises to manage frizz and to moisturize (because dryness is a huge problem for me too) then I have bought it.  Nothing has ever worked for me, until now.  This shampoo and the coordinating conditioner is AWESOME.  My hair is so incredibly soft and shiny.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and it doesn&#x27;t look dry; it is smooth, and if I may say so myself, it&#x27;s just beautiful.  And to top it off, these products cost 1/3 to a 1/4 of many of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Not only is my hair happy, my pocketbook is too! :)</li>
    <li> I have long, straight hair and this leav-in conditioner was too thick and creamy.  It weighed my hair down and my hair is already limp as it is.    On the other hand, my three-year-old daughter, who has curly hair...it works better for it keeps the tangles out. Though, there are several cheaper products available locally that I can purchase.</li>
    <li> It works like any other shampoo but I didn&#x27;t notice any life altering. I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly and my hair is very healthy and shining.  Like this product line.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and plan to continue buying the shampoo and gels.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, slightly wavy hair, and I rarely use conditioners or styling products because they weigh my hair down. Giovanni Smooth as Silk leaves my hair silky but flat and limp, as if I&#x27;d used conditioner. I think I will save this shampoo for the warmer months when I start swimming again and need that extra conditioning to combat the chlorine. It lathers better than some other sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and the citrus and lemongrass scent is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best organic, daily use shampoo I&#x27;ve found for my fine hair is [[ASIN:B0011DJ6NW Kiss My Face Miss Treated Shampoo Parabn Free (1x11 OZ)]]. (My absolute favorite organic shampoo is Lea Journo&#x27;s Hydra-Riche Hydrating Shampoo, but it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive, so I don&#x27;t use it every day.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the product description for Smooth as Silk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * Luxurious lather soothes dry, chemically processed hair&lt;br /&gt;  * Cleanses gently for manageable smoothness&lt;br /&gt;  * Calms unruly hair to alleviate frizz&lt;br /&gt;  * Increases shine while smoothing dry or damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;  * Zero sulfates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft and smooth, sexy and sultry. It&#x27;s how you feel when you have silk against your skin. Now imagine that same feel in your hair. Smooth As Silk Deep Moisture Shampoo has a pearlized formula that glistens in your hand and transforms your hair into a silky palette that&#x27;s ready for anything. Lather and glow with the flow that begins your style. Smooth As Silk Shampoo wears beautifully on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Contains a blend of organic oils, ripe-harvested from renewable plants at the peak of their freshness, cold pressed and refrigerated immediately to ensure maximum purity. Infuses each individual strand of hair with vitamins, nutrients and protein for strength and vitality.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this shampoo. I actually bought it for my daughter who has fine curly hair. She damaged her hair when they changed the formula of her previous shampoo. She left this in the shower and I had to try it because it smells so good. My hair is straight, fine, and mid-back length and it does not weigh my hair down at all. I don&#x27;t actually have damaged hair, just fragile, but it really does leave it &#x27;smooth as silk&#x27;. I have never used my old shampoo again and I have two full bottles. I am a convert to this shampoo!    Both my daughter and I love this shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in serum. Even the shape of the bottle is nice. It doesn&#x27;t fall off the shower shelves being rectangular.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love the hydration it offers.  I color my hair and this product really helps to keep it look silky and smooth!</li>
    <li> The women/girls in my family started using the Giovanni 50-50 clarifying shampoo at the recommendation of a relative and really liked how well it cleans our hair.  I saw the Smooth as Silk Moisture shampoo online and decided to try it after using the 50-50.  Works very well on our hair to add back moisture after the 50-50 strips away dirt and finishing products and before we use a Giovanni conditioner.</li>
    <li> Omg this shampoo is the real deal!! My hair has never felt this soft</li>
    <li> Giovanni makes great shampoos, free of SLS which is way too harsh but is still found in most commercial shampoos. This shampoo also has a very pleasant fragrance and I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances.</li>
    <li> My hair is so shiny and smooth since using this product. My hair is also really soft to the touch, which is fantastic. The shampoo lathers well, and smells great. It is cruelty free too which is what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Made my straight, fine, non-color treated hair look really greasy.  While it wasn&#x27;t greasy to the touch, it definitely felt unwashed and like there was a lot of product buildup.  (I know I rinsed well.)  It was also hard to style.  It does seem to have moisturized a lot though, so I&#x27;ll keep whats left of the bottle for days I&#x27;m not going out and don&#x27;t care what I look like.  I can use it to cleanse before a conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to use sulfate free shampoos and this product was my first. Background information: I am transitioning to natural hair and I am 18 months post relaxer. This shampoo smell really good and is very high quality. The conditioner is thick enough to create a great lather in my very thick and dense hair. I have only used the shampoo for one wash so far, but it left my hair so soft and moisturized and I was able to retain moisturized hair after my wash day was complete.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! It is very moisturizing and keeps my hair healthy, even with some heat styling. It smells great and cleans well without using harsh chemicals that strip hair&#x27;s natural oils. This three pack is a great value, I get three bottles for the price of two in a store!</li>
    <li> This shampoo along with a Sprite chlorine sower filter and the Giovanni Dtox lotion literally saved me and my wife&#x27;s skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My hair likes this shampoo a lot. Smells great and. Leaves my hair soft and I also use the conditioner which real makes a manageable difference.</li>
    <li> helps retain my color longer, less drying, delicious smell, creamy texture, gets my hair clean and I enjoy using it</li>
    <li> For all of my adult life, I&#x27;ve fought a losing battle against frizz - wishing that I had that straight, shiny smooth hair that looks so great on everyone else.  Nothing worked.  Not leave in conditioner, shine serums, nothing.    Recently, I did some research into sulfate free shampoos and decided to try Giovanni, because it&#x27;s also cruelty free.  It WORKS!  Granted, you still have to smooth dry the hair straight, but my hair has NEVER looked better - I&#x27;m really happy with it, and have even gotten multiple compliments at the office.    Use this stuff - it&#x27;s terrific, it works, and it&#x27;s even vegan!  (PS: not as thrilled with the Giovanni shine serum.  It&#x27;s okay, but next time I&#x27;m trying out the hair spray instead as the final touch.)</li>
    <li> I love Giovanni products, especially because they are cruelty-free! This one is good in the winter when I get dry hair. In the summer I switch to the 50/50 variety by Giovanni.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo based on reviews as I was looking for a shampoo that would help my dry, frizzy hair.  They were RIGHT!!!!  This shampoo is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I bought a new smooth as silk deep moisture shampoo was because I realized that the one I was currently using was manufactured in 2001 (I know more than a decade ago)! Using the new bottle I realized it had a very different ingredients list, but I was still willing to give it a shot. During the first, my hair felt a bit stripped. The one I was using before left my hair completely moisturized during and after using it. I would even go so far as to say that it moisturized my hair even more than cowashing! I&#x27;m not impressed and won&#x27;t be using it again. I fan girl over the conditioners, but the shampoo is a no go. Giovanni why&#x27;d you fix what wasn&#x27;t broken????</li>
    <li> great, really makes my hair softer. Smells good too. I will buy again. Price is good too. best ever product</li>
    <li> Makes my hair stiff and horrible.  I had to stop using it immediately.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have ever tried--really makes my hair soft.  The only problem is with the bottle--it is very difficult to get the last bit of shampoo out of the rectangular top.  Really appreciate being able to find this shampoo on Amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> ships super fast and as always this Giovanni shampoo is awesome , can&#x27;t seem to even find it in the stores anymore though</li>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner that I will use. Great product for naturally curly or wavy hair. Smells lovely, too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner work well for me and my daughters-all 3 of us have thick curly natural hair and the girls swim twice a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after having used it at a friends house. Each time I get my hair cut, I&#x27;m asked what I&#x27;m using, as my hair is so soft and silky. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft and smells great.  It does as it advertises and takes out all the tangles in my hair.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo for my thick coarse hair. I follow with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk Conditioner and a Giovanni hair serum.</li>
    <li> Once you start using this natural product it is hard to go back to regular shampoos that use chemicals. I tried going back to joico and just can&#x27;t. I do like the 50/50 balance shampoo better that this though just because I like the smell or lack of it better. For some reason the fragrance of this makes my nose itch.</li>
    <li> I think that this is going to be my new favorite shampoo. I have 4b African american hair and I use it once a week and I love it.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo for the first time last night and the conditioner.  I could hardly get a comb/brush through my wet hair afterwards it was awful.  I guess it cleaned my hair but it felt so yuck while wet and while blow drying.  This morning I woke up and for some odd reason my scalp was itching.  It could only be these products.  I may or may not finish these products or I may take them back.  I also thought the smell was horrible because their was basically no smell.  I still like desert essence coconut shampoo and conditioner to best so far.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Smells wonderful and does a great cleaning job.  Hair is soft and shiny. As an added bonus since using the shampoo without all the parabens, sulfates etc the acne on my back has cleared up.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my curly but thin hair.</li>
    <li> This was highly recommended by my Hair Stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and can never find it at local stores so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. I have very fine hair and this shampoo works well without leaving my hair limp.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed... It actually made my scalp very dry and itchy. Smells good but just not good for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years.  Giovanni&#x27;s EcoChic line uses biodegradable ingredients inside eco-friendly packaging and is lauryl/laureth sulfate-free and paraben-free.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Starting using it fairly recently and love it!  Sampoo and conditioner are both really good products!</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it cleaned my hair without stripping it and kept it moisturized like it was marketed for.</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out! Tossed this after 2 weeks and hair left like straw</li>
    <li> This is great natural detangler and conditioner.  I use for myself and my daughter.  It&#x27;s a great price when you use the subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I found that this does not leave my hair as silky as promised. The conditioner is fantastic, which led me to buy this, and while it is ok, it is a bit of a disappointment to be honest. I have stuck with my shea moisture, moisture retention shampoo and that, along with the giovanni conditioner, does a great job.</li>
    <li> This product came about a week ago and it came as advertised. Nice packaging, and very lovely smells. :) You DO get three bottles, so they aren&#x27;t lying when they say &#x27;pack of 3&#x27;. The only thing that&#x27;s false about this product, is that weird brownish looking colour displayed on the picture. The shampoo bottle is not that colour, it&#x27;s white. :P I keep hearing so much about Giovanni, so I decided to test it out myself and purchase it. The only downside is, if you don&#x27;t live in the States, it&#x27;s a little harder to purchase this since apparently this item can only be sold within the States. So luckily for me, I was able to find a way to get it shipped to my country. Giovanni is mostly natural products too, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about all these harsh chemicals and bad odors. The scent is nice, very mild.</li>
