      <li>leaves my hair much more frizzy than my full size rusk ceramic ion iron.</li>
      <li>I have color treated blondish hair that is on the fine side.  </li>
      <li>This works fine.  </li>
      <li>If you have shorter fine hair (I do), it will be fine, but if you have longer or thicker hair, I can&#x27;t imagine this would work for you.  </li>
      <li>compact - heats up fast - love it!  </li>
      <li>The voltage says it&#x27;s for all voltages, which is really important for traveling.</li>
      <li>Great for European travel.  </li>
      <li>this is fabulous for travel.  </li>
      <li>I have short hair and it works great for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of how light it is</li>
      <li>The best thing I ever bought and it easily fits in a small bag for travel.</li>
      <li>It gets hot quickly and the travel case is nice.</li>
      <li>Awesome little straightener!</li>
      <li>The original plug-in is U.S., so you&#x27;d still need an adapter.</li>
      <li>Works better than my mom&#x27;s full sized professional straightener, and way more convenient.  </li>
      <li>I def do not want to have to lug my full size version with me wherever I go</li>
      <li>But it does work great, heats up quickly and does get hot enough to work well</li>
      <li>but as my hair grew out I could use it in so many different ways to make the &amp;#34;awkward&amp;#34; growing out stage become the, completely fabulous stage!</li>
      <li>It heats up super quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like burnt hair.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this on a full head of hair yet, but it does heat up fast and my test swipes flattened really easy.</li>
      <li>great size for travel because its small and light weight.  </li>
      <li>Good size (fits right in to my handbag) and gets hot enough.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, this product doesn&#x27;t worth to buy.</li>
      <li>The straightener is very tiny, so I would NOT recommend it if you want to straighten your whole head of hair, but if you only need it for bangs like me this works great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my second flat iron and this one is very durable and perfect for shorter hair.</li>
      <li>have a bob hairstyle that&#x27;s right around chin length.</li>
      <li>But, it does get hot enough and is nice and compact for travel.</li>
      <li>I have had this straightener for a year now and it still runs great after heavy use!</li>
      <li>I really only straighten my bangs and I travel a lot, so this little guy if perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Would recommend for light touches, not a heavy duty straightener</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the product description states this, and I had no problem with this, but please note this straightener is TINY.  </li>
      <li>but the knob would be so tiny it would almost be comical.</li>
      <li>So first of all let me say I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I just received the item about 5 minutes ago</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Makes my life so much easier when crashing with the bf!</li>
      <li>and this gets hot.  </li>
      <li>This was too hot for my hair and ended up doing some damage.  </li>
      <li>so having the mini version of the Revlon makes things so much easier!</li>
      <li>The case is a plus, because you can storage it even if it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
      <li>I pored over DOZENS of dual-voltage flat irons for travel and thought I had found the right fit.</li>
      <li>I know little about this, but this thing is so cute!  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, reasonable for price.</li>
      <li>The whole thing including the traveling case, weighs just under 6 ounces.</li>
      <li>this point, I would recommend it, but really, look at a ruler and prepare yourself.</li>
      <li>like my bangs to be straight.</li>
      <li>This flat iron works fine</li>
      <li>It could easily go in a carry-on, it&#x27;s so small and so light.</li>
      <li>Works great on my very short hair when I want to straighten out the small amount of curls I have.</li>
      <li>Heats up quick and cools down quick.</li>
      <li>It is super tiny</li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I found it grips chunks of hair better than tiny pieces, and it definitely gets hot enough.</li>
      <li>If you have a super long hairstyle, it probably is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth (unless you&#x27;re only doing touch-ups).</li>
      <li>so I could straighten my bangs (curly hair) and not only did it do a stellar job at that</li>
      <li>It gets hot enough that I bet you could do all of your hair</li>
      <li>The handle part stays cool, unlike other mini straighteners.</li>
      <li>Everyone is correct that the picture makes this straightener look bigger than it really is.</li>
      <li>Only problem it has, though it didn&#x27;t really effect me, is that it has no heat adjustments</li>
      <li>This &amp;#34;Straightener&amp;#34; will hold small strands of hair and easily curls it to create volume in a jiffy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is such a huge improvement over my previous Revlon flat iron. My kids even noticed that my hair looked nicer after using it.</li>
    <li> I (and even my husband) was so surprised at how small this hair straightener is. It is about 1/3rd the size of my normal straightener and comes with a great carrying case. I took it on a trip to Italy, Switzerland and Germany and it worked in all these places (with the correct plug attached). Because of its small size, it did take longer to do my hair (I have natural wave). And it would have been nice to have a temperature control. But the space it saved me and the adequate job it did straightening my hair, made these little inconveniences inconsequential.</li>
    <li> The straightener looks a lot larger in the photo... I&#x27;m sure if I&#x27;d taken the time they also explain the dimensions but it is really really tiny.  Its definitely not for doing every strand of hair unless you want to be there for an hour.  But it does work great, heats up quickly and does get hot enough to work well and I had no problems with it working in different countries.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use during a trip to Europe because of the dual voltage feature.  I&#x27;m sure the product description states this, and I had no problem with this, but please note this straightener is TINY.  I think it would take forever to do a whole head of hair with this little guy!  However that&#x27;s not the reason for my not so good review.  This only has an on/off button, nothing on it to adjust the temperature and this gets hot.  This was too hot for my hair and ended up doing some damage.  I have color treated blondish hair that is on the fine side.  For someone with really thick hair it might not be that bad, but it was no good for me.  I ended up purchasing a straightener while I was overseas, just to have something a little nicer than this one.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works fine but is really tiny. I read the dimensions but somehow thought it would be just a bit bigger. Would be great for someone who just needs to do touchups. Definitely too tiny to use on my whole head. The travel case is nice.</li>
    <li> Everyone is correct that the picture makes this straightener look bigger than it really is. The unit itself is about 6 1/2\\&quot; long. The heating plates are 2\\&quot; inches long and 1/2\\&quot; wide. The whole thing including the traveling case, weighs just under 6 ounces. Perfect size for travel. I have short hair and it works great for me. Someone with long might have problems with the small plate size, especially if they have thick hair and want to style all of it. It gets hot quickly and the travel case is nice.</li>
    <li> I wish they would post pictures of this next to a ruler; it would make it less shocking when you receive it. I know it says &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; plates&amp;#34; but thinking about it and actually seeing it in person is different. This thing is small. SMALL. The package it arrives in is about 9&amp;#34; long, 3&amp;#34; wide and 2&amp;#34; deep. Most of that is used to contain the heat resistant pouch. The iron itself is probably 3/4&amp;#34; wide, the plates really are 1/2&amp;#34; wide (take out a ruler and look at it). It&#x27;s about 7&amp;#34; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bob hairstyle that&#x27;s right around chin length. I haven&#x27;t tried this on a full head of hair yet, but it does heat up fast and my test swipes flattened really easy. But you have to be prepared to section much smaller than usual. My daily iron is a 1&amp;#34; full-size model. I bought this for an upcoming vacation and I needed dual-voltage. I haven&#x27;t tried it out in the foreign country yet so I&#x27;ll have to report back on that later. It will be perfect for packing. It could easily go in a carry-on, it&#x27;s so small and so light. In the heat pouch it&#x27;s only about 8&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34; with cord stuffed inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A this point, I would recommend it, but really, look at a ruler and prepare yourself. If you have a super long hairstyle, it probably is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth (unless you&#x27;re only doing touch-ups).</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for a year now and it still runs great after heavy use! I made this purchase after I got a pixie cut so I could straighten my bangs (curly hair) and not only did it do a stellar job at that but as my hair grew out I could use it in so many different ways to make the &amp;#34;awkward&amp;#34; growing out stage become the, completely fabulous stage! It heats up in a flash and stays hot enough to tame the cow licks! Only problem it has, though it didn&#x27;t really effect me, is that it has no heat adjustments but the knob would be so tiny it would almost be comical. Really though if you have short hair this makes styling a breeze, the perfect size. :)</li>
    <li> I pored over DOZENS of dual-voltage flat irons for travel and thought I had found the right fit. But when I got this thing, it was barely six inches long not including the cord (I swear they include part of it in the product measurements). No way will this work on my medium-length, fairly thick hair. I doubt it would have even done my bangs. I think the description is misleading. Returned to Amazon within two days.</li>
    <li> It works fine but its a little too small for people with long hair and the handle becomes hot to hold after a few minutes of usage. Otherwise, reasonable for price.</li>
    <li> So first of all let me say I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I just received the item about 5 minutes ago so I haven&#x27;t tryed it yet... Although I will write a second review once I start using it... So when it said \\&quot;Mini\\&quot; they ment MINI!! Lmao but its adorable though!</li>
    <li> For the size of the item, it packs a hell of a punch. Works better than my mom&#x27;s full sized professional straightener, and way more convenient.  Very durable model, I&#x27;m not really worried about breaking it at all.  Definitely a steal for fifteen bucks</li>
    <li> Im a guy, so I know little about this, but this thing is so cute!  It works too believe it or not. It&#x27;s my second flat iron and this one is very durable and perfect for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener! The voltage says it&#x27;s for all voltages, which is really important for traveling. The original plug-in is U.S., so you&#x27;d still need an adapter. I just tested it out and am very happy! I have naturally thick, curly hair and I like my bangs to be straight. The straightener is very tiny, so I would NOT recommend it if you want to straighten your whole head of hair, but if you only need it for bangs like me this works great! I found it grips chunks of hair better than tiny pieces, and it definitely gets hot enough. You don&#x27;t even need a glove! The handle part stays cool, unlike other mini straighteners. The cord also has a velcro strap on it so you can wrap the chord up and put it in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Revlon - Revlon, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. My family has used revlon products for years, and this straightener is well made and sturdy. Heats up quick and cools down quick. Comes with a great thermaproof case and good for traveling in style!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast, great for bangs, it is smaller than you would think but its actually a great travel item</li>
    <li> I got to get another one...my children are putting it to good use just before they set out to school!</li>
    <li> this is fabulous for travel.  Wouldn&#x27;t work for thick curly hair, but if you have thinner hair that just needs a little curl at the end, bangs or slight straightening, this will do the trick.  compact - heats up fast - love it!  Note: doesn&#x27;t seem to like the razor plug in which is found in many overseas bathrooms - so try another outlet in your hotel room to plug into (make sure you take an adapter).  No converter needed as it is dual voltage</li>
    <li> a very comfortable, high quality, useful and nice thing! it makes my obstinate curls a perfect straight! I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Guys, don&#x27;t get tricked by the picture! This straightener is extremely small. Only for bangs. I bought it and have to buy another one now. It&#x27;s too small that I can&#x27;t even use it to staight my hair....This cost $20 something and to reture it I have to spend around $10. I rather buy another one than to send it back for refund.....Anyways, this product doesn&#x27;t worth to buy.</li>
    <li> bought this for my UK trip. only thing bad about it is, sometimes it smells like burnt plastic, smell wont last long though. the bag is awesome, u can save time and just store straightener back into it while its still hot~! It is really small though, would not recommend it for people with super long or thick thick hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to picture even with the dimensions listed, so be aware this is really, teeny tiny. If you have shorter fine hair (I do), it will be fine, but if you have longer or thicker hair, I can&#x27;t imagine this would work for you.  It is great for travel and for touchups. Hardly weighs a thing. Heats up very quickly and stays hot - happy this comes with a thermal case.</li>
    <li> This works fine.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it burns my fingers if I try to squeeze it shut.  I have to be careful.  But, it does get hot enough and is nice and compact for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a student that will be traveling to Europe.  She said it is wonderful and will be easy to pack.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I really only straighten my bangs and I travel a lot, so this little guy if perfect for me. It heats up super quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me smell like burnt hair. I&#x27;ve had it for almost two years and it shows no signs of slowing down.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it said it worked with European converters, but when I took it overseas, it did not work. I would return it if I hadn&#x27;t already tossed the packaging.</li>
    <li> I posted 2 pictures just to show how small this is..... its just about the same length of a Sharpie pen. When Revlon says MINI they really mean MINI ! ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even mad about the size as I use a straightener mostly just for my bangs. I have the side swept bangs so this is great : ) It gets hot enough that I bet you could do all of your hair but it would take a while.</li>
    <li> still working like a champ after a couple years! perfect size for short hair!</li>
    <li> I have short hair and need to create some fullness. This &amp;#34;Straightener&amp;#34; will hold small strands of hair and easily curls it to create volume in a jiffy. The best thing I ever bought and it easily fits in a small bag for travel. Just love it !!!</li>
    <li> This one is okay, it&#x27;s TINY, but perfect for a dude with curly sideburn things.</li>
    <li> Great for European travel.  Good size (fits right in to my handbag) and gets hot enough.  I would reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great straightener. Great size and functionality. Totally recommend it. The case is a plus, because you can storage it even if it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
    <li> Works great on my very short hair when I want to straighten out the small amount of curls I have.</li>
    <li> be sure you read all the details before you order lol i was expecting a straightener&lt;br /&gt; that would at least straighten my bangs.</li>
    <li> I have thin (mostly) straight hair and this does the little touch ups I needed it for.  Would recommend for light touches, not a heavy duty straightener</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT to keep in my purse for the nights I stay at my boyfriend&#x27;s place. I def do not want to have to lug my full size version with me wherever I go so having the mini version of the Revlon makes things so much easier! I only use a straightener on my bangs (I have CURLY hair and have thick blunt bangs that I like to straighten) so I don&#x27;t need much to get those suckers straight but this does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the one downside might be its weight. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of how light it is or if it just needs some breaking into, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to grip down on the hair tight enough so it takes a little longer to get a small piece straight. It is super tiny so I know it will take longer regardless but I noticed it wasn&#x27;t a heavy straightener so it didn&#x27;t have the tight hold my other one does. Also noticed that it left my hair a bit more static-y than my other when straightening, but hey, its small, it travels, it heats up fast, and it does the trick so who am I to complain!? Makes my life so much easier when crashing with the bf!</li>
    <li> great size for travel because its small and light weight.  however the small size makes the straightening process long and tedious.  leaves my hair much more frizzy than my full size rusk ceramic ion iron.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in perfect condition, It was a gift to my daughter and she loved it! It continues to please! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because I was looking for something to help tame my hair that flips out on one side. I have very fine hair and this straightener gets the job done. It is very small and easy to travel with. The case is a great bonus. However, I would not recommend for someone who is trying to straighten all their hair. Way to small for that.</li>
    <li> I love it! It heats up fast and is great for touch ups! Awesome little straightener! It&#x27;s perfect for people always traveling or on-the-go.</li>
