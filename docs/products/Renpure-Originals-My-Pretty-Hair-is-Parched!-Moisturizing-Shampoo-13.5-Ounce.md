<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. I need Sulfate free for my keratin treated hair and salon products can be very expensive. This shampoo works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural shampoo I have ever tried, in fact, this is the first natural shampoo I have been able to use because all of the others I have tried are awful. It lathers wonderfully and actually gets my hair clean; other natural shampoos left my hair feeling dirty. I seriously buy 4 or 5 bottles at a time so that I am sure to never run out. I also use this product on my children. Great product; great story behind the product.. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo that I have found, and it is organic too!  It leaves my naturally curly, colored hair in fantastic shape after use.  I also use a Renpure conditioner and absolutely love that one too.  Also, many shampoos/conditioners break me out on the back of my neck and this is the only one that does not do that.  Will use it forever.</li>
    <li> Saw the other reviewer&#x27;s comments, and I had to say this shampoo is awesome.   So is the conditioner.  It leaves a light fragrance.  After 3 days of using this product, my hair feels soft like a toddlers.  I was shocked cuz it&#x27;s normally so dry from heat styling and excessive dyings. My hair is soft, bouncy, and stays cleaner in between washings.               Anyway-   First, it does not suds up with excessive amounts of foam and bubbles because it has NO SULFATES, NO PARABENS, and NO SILICONES.  Thats the harsh stuff you don&#x27;t wanna put in your hair.  and most popular brands load their shampoos with this.  It lathers just enough to get the job done.  In order to avoid residue build-up (I use a TON of hair spray to create helmet head - because I&#x27;m in the army and have to look perfect), you have to thoroughly soak your hair with water first while rubbing at your scalp and any product buildup, and this takes me a full 2-3 minutes because I have thick hair down my back.  Then you work in the shampoo, rubbing your scalp vigourously and working your way down the length of your hair, using about a dime size more shampoo if needed.                This shampoo really has made a difference and i won&#x27;t change unless there&#x27;s something even better out there.  (which I doubt)    :)</li>
    <li> This company&#x27;s claim that the product is organic is bogus.  Among other things, they use artificial fragrance.  I wanted to try the Amazing Miracle.  I should have looked closer and/or smelled it in the store.  I put some of the product on my hand to try it.  I had an asthmatic reaction and have washed my hands 3 times and cannot get the fragrance off.  Lying lowlife company...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the kind of girl who doesn&#x27;t like paying 40 dollars for salon shampoo and conditioners, so I try to get the best of what&#x27;s at walmart (: I had been using Herbal Essences for a long time mainly cause I loved the smells, but overall the product was just good, not great. So then I tried Tresemme... I have now grown to hate Tresemme, their products leave my hair looking really greasy after only a days time. Then I went back &amp; got this stuff along with the Miracle conditioner! This is where things get happy :D Renpure Organics made my hair feel soooo nice, &amp; I&#x27;m a frequent hair color dyer type person, and sometimes my hair&#x27;s a little dry, but NOT with this... It feels moisturized and renewed, and it almost feels like my hair is more voluminous (my hairs kind of thin, due to lots of layering). Plus my hair looks and stays clean for MUCH longer than before, even after all my hairspraying and straight ironing! I even went back &amp; got their hairspray! My new favorite brand! Go buy this stuff along with the miracle conditioner! :D</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner for every day use. I got tired of the way my hair felt using cheap shampoo you get at the store. I used this and my hair feels light soft, and shinny like you came out of the salon.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is simply amazing. I have coarse, fuzzy hair and other shampoos tend to strip all of the natural oils from my hair. I have only used this shampoo once, and already my hair looks shinier, there are less fly-aways, and it feels super soft. I did not change conditioners, so I know it&#x27;s the change in shampoo that made the difference. I use Renpure Keratin Conditioner. GREAT combination, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> First of all, I have to say...this product is hands down one of the best shampoos I have ever used on my hair. I have long hair ( about to the middle of my back ) that is extremely thick. My hair always ends up tangled, the ends are dry and I have a lot of breakage. I dont buy salon brand products, but I often switch between a few great kinds, herbal essence, aussie and pantene. I bought this on a whim after reading the reviews about how soft it makes your hair and I am more than thrilled with this product! I immediately noticed a difference when using this product. First of all, the scent is wonderful!  It gives a great lather, not too much and not too little.  Even before applying the conditioner I noticed my hair just had that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; weightless feeling to it.  I followed this up with the conditioner and this is hands down the best shampoo/conditioner combo I have EVER used.  If you have a long thick hair like me, a problem with tangles or dryness I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Hello amazon shoppers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every product has good and bad reviews so often times I look up reviews on amazon before buying a product. I purchased this product at a local riteaid for the same price listed on amazon. Now i&#x27;m a very skeptical person when it comes to hair products.I gave this product a 3 for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro:It&#x27;s not a heavy scented shampoo but yet it has subtle sweet smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;pro: it has certified organic ingreidents( now it DOES NOT say 100% organic anywhere on the bottle)there are other chemicals in this shampoo. I seen there was a couple reviews that did not bother to read the bottle you can&#x27;t get angry at a product that clearly states what is and what it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;pro: the price is cheap for a organic product.&lt;br /&gt;now to clear up some rumors i&#x27;m in the medical field so i&#x27;m just going to state this for the record everyones skin and hair is different so something that works for one person may not work for another.&lt;br /&gt;However this shampoo did not leave my hair with a residue like previos claims however when your rinsing out the conditioner your hair does feel a little weighed down so i just simply rinsed out more and there was no residue left.&lt;br /&gt;now i have side bangs and i often have to pull my hair back cause of work but this shampoo seemed to frizz the top part of my hair and bangs.&lt;br /&gt;and as i&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has gotten oily so this shampoo does not make my more oily it evens it out but i would recommend brushing your hair to let the natural oils out to get the frizz out. In addition to the frizz in those same places it gave me a small amount of dry scalp nothing to freak out over but still  you typically don&#x27;t want a shampoo to do that on the first wash. So this product had a ok out come my hair is soft a little frizzy the product was cheap for a organic so I really can&#x27;t complain. But.... I can help my fellow skeptic shoppers there is a line called aubrey organics that are truly organic and the shampoos are a little thin in substance but just add a little water and they suds up a little better. But typicaly you don&#x27;t want that much suds cause manufactors use a chemical that similiar to a harsh deteregent so your hair is clean but over processed. when I looked at the reviews for the aubrey products I could not find a negative review  which was a first. The only complaint really was about the suds. So i hope this review helps somebody.</li>
    <li> I hate to leave negative feedback, but I want to be honest to potential purchasers. I was dissappointed in that it did not lather very well and it didn&#x27;t rinse out cleanly. My hair felt dirty afterward and had no shine. It felt like it had residue in it. The only positive that I can give it is that it left my hair soft. I purchased it at a Walgreen&#x27;s sale where you \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot;. Then, it also had a hang tag for a rebate of the full purchase price, so all it cost me was sales tax and a postage stamp. However, now I have the problem of what to do with two bottles of shampoo I will never use again.</li>
    <li> I also bought this shampoo w/ matching conditioner at walgreens because the other shampoo i was using was becoming expensive. Seeing it had no sulfates or parabens made me want to buy it, because i have curly hair and it absolutely wrecks them. After weeks of using it, my curls became limp and it felt like they weren&#x27;t being properly cleaned of residue, so i ended up having to buy the neutrogena anti residue shampoo. The shampoo has a runny consistency that i was less than thrilled about too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my dry hair feel nourished. I use it along with  the conditioner, and my hair feels much better than with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Well, I have tried so many shampoos, even the most expensive. I saw this at my favorite store -- Walgreens-- and picked it up. I have to say that after even the first shampoo, I saw a huge difference. I love this shampoo and conditioner, took the others out of my shower right away.  I am sold! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Rite Aid on sale for buy on get one free additionally the full size green deep penetrating conditioner was attached to the shampoo and was free as well.  I thought to myself I am probably going to hate this but because of such a good deal I had nothing to lose.  I am soooooooooo impressed by this shampoo, I thought it lathered very well.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry when I wash it out, and I enjoy the smell, I actually think is smells very good!  I do not use this shampoo and conditioner everyday I use it every other wash.  On the days I do not use this I use baby shampoo as a starter (I know you are probably thinking why? But baby shampoo is very clarifying) then I follow with the Ren Pure deep penetrating conditioner.  I am very happy with this purchase and I really like this shampoo!  This is one happy girl with some really pretty hair :)</li>
    <li> I subscribed to this product when it was Renpure Organics.  It has since changed to Renpure Originals.  I wish the product change would have been communicated prior to sending me more of this item.  That said, the scent is pleasant, and the product has a lot of what many people seek in a similar shampoo (no sulfates, no parabens..).</li>
    <li> I prefer to buy organic, natural skin and haircare products and was really amazed when I was shopping at my local drugstore and saw these products on the shelf.  They had a coupon for buy one get one, so I picked up the \\&quot;My Pretty Hair is Parched\\&quot; set and it&#x27;s working well for me.  It&#x27;s not at all irritating to my sensitive scalp.  The price is also very good for this safe, natural shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Leaves hair clean and well-conditioned.  The only slight \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that the product seems to be a bit \\&quot;watered-down\\&quot; to me.    I was curious so I checked out their website and have to say I&#x27;m impressed by this company&#x27;s principles.  I think I&#x27;ll try the \\&quot;Amazing Miracle\\&quot; deep conditioner (for winter) too!</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that does a little bit of foaming without the stripping SLS ingredients. But I found it to be very drying regardless. I had to follow up with quite a bit of conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see this product as a \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; item at Walgreens, so I purchased along with the matching conditioner [[ASIN:B0023AV2UM Renpure Organics My Pretty Hair is Parched! Moisturizing Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce]]. I love the idea of shampoo that uses 100% certified organic products in it, this is why I am giving this product 2 stars instead of 1 star. My hair is extremely dry, and this product seemed to dry my hair even more! After using this product a few weeks I noticed increased damage to my hair (split ends, breakage of hair, etc.). Even though I was using the conditioner with this product, I was having to increase the amount of additional moisturizer I was using for my hair to try to counteract the dryness from this product. Also, I have dry scalp issues from the thickness of my hair. When using this product, I noticed an increase in the amount my scalp itched. Dry scalp is already embarassing, but the increase in the effects of it makes it worse. I did not notice residue left in my hair, because I believe this shampoo strips everything and more from my hair. I will not be using this shampoo again, and I would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this shampoo because I&#x27;d read an article that thinning hair might be linked to products with Sodium lauryl sulfate in them. This was the only product I found at the store that didn&#x27;t have that chemical. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true or not but I figured for $6 bucks it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. Well, I just tried it for the first time today so I can&#x27;t give a status update on any hair regrowth but I do have a very good opinion of the product now! I was also experiencing some flakiness near my scalp. I thought it was dandruff and tried head and shoulders for awhile. It just seemed to be getting worse. So then I thought maybe it was some sort of product build-up due to our terrible, terrible hard water. Whatever it was...it&#x27;s gone now after one use of this stuff. My hair feels so clean and pretty. It also smells really fresh. I&#x27;m in love. Like I said, I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far but I&#x27;m sold. Also should be noted that I only used the shampoo. They didn&#x27;t have any of the conditioner so I used a different brand that I normally use.</li>
    <li> Gluten free shampoo that leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized. I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and bought some for myself later that day. It&#x27;s tough to find shampoo and conditioner that are labeled \\&quot;gluten free\\&quot;. And, when you do, they are typically upwards of $20 a piece, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the very reasonable prices of these Ren Pure products.</li>
    <li> I just love the shampoo &amp; conditioner--I also have the hairspray. I get my hair colored about every 6 weeks &amp; have been searching for a really good shampoo/conditioner without the big Aveda price tag (don&#x27;t get me wrong-- I love Aveda&#x27;s product line, but it&#x27;s out of my budget for something like shampoo, which I use often. I still get a couple of their other beauty items). I go to the Aveda School &amp; they use all their products/hair color line---they asked me at my last visit what product I am using as my hair was in such great condition!  I stumbled upon the Renpure line at Walgreens &amp; am shocked at how soft my hair is after using it. My mom came up to visit &amp; she used it &amp; is now switching to this (she also colors her hair). I also love the smell! So--from now on will order through Amazon as the price can&#x27;t be beat! (I am using the \\&quot;My Pretty Hair is Parched\\&quot; Renpure line in the red bottle).</li>
    <li> I have very thick- frizzy bottom--oily scalp hair and regularly get Brazillian Blowouts and color.  My stylist told me to use low phospate shampoos if I wanted to switch off from the Braziillan shampoo and conditioner.  Because of the organic ingredients, I purchased the Renpure \\&quot;My hair is Pretty Parched\\&quot; products and felt they did a great job of cleaning without drying out my hair.  Also noticed that my hair is really shiny and the ends are much improved...I would recomend this brand to those with thick, unruly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Used so many salon products wasting to much money. Stumbled on this at the grocery store. Skeptical to try and holy cow it&#x27;s every thing it claims it is!!! My hair is beyond softer healthier in one try. It feels like silk. I&#x27;m sold will try more of these products. Inexpensive and salon quality. Every girls dream</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells awesome, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair, and leaves it silky smooth. Without all the added garbage of other hair care products, RenPure Organics makes amazing products that work, and work gently.</li>
    <li> I randomly picked this up at the grocery store because it was a) on sale (2.50 AND buy one get one free, can you say steal?!?) and b) Claimed to be organic, which is very important to me! I love that it is free of all those nasty chemicals pumped in the big brands. I have been a dove girl since high school and I can honestly say that I love this line of products and I think my hair feels 10 times fresher and healthier since starting these products about 3 weeks ago. And the scent is seriously amazing. Its like a mini spa session every morning. Can&#x27;t say enough good things! Seriously. Smells AMAZING. GET IT NOW</li>
    <li> Renpure Originals My Pretty Hair is Parched! Moisturizing shampoo. I love this stuff. only have wash hair 3 times in it so far. I love the smell and I smell my hair all day.. It has a very nice fragrance to the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Background:  So I was excited to use this because of it&#x27;s \\&quot;natural\\&quot; claims. I have a lot of fine wavy curls and have finally grown it out after dying it for years .I have been using this (as well as the conditioner) for over five months now (with very little substitution).     Issues:  I have noticed a few bad side effects: 1. It left me with build up and my hair appeared greasy and oily after a day. 2. My hair is still extremely dry (my hair is not dyed) 3. My  hair has been thinning out quite  a bit (which may or may not be a result of this stuff)     Since I am unhappy with these products I plan on changing my shampoo and conditioner to see if I can find a better fit.</li>
    <li> I have been using Renpure&#x27;s My Pretty Hair is Parched for years now and, though I stray and try different shampoos here and there, I always end up coming back to MPHiP because, at the end of the day, my hair looks good when I&#x27;m ready to go out the door.  Can I say that this product is for everyone?  No--only because I think everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  What works for me may not work for you and vice-versa.  But, having said all that, I do think that this shampoo is at least worth a try.  It&#x27;s paraben- and sulfate-free and, compared to a lot of fancy-schmancy options out there, NOT expensive.  (NOTE:  While shampooing, please don&#x27;t expect a lot of suds.  Use the normal amount you would use to wash your hair and rinse well for the best results.)</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this shampoo as the ones with lots of chemicals tend to make my head itch.  It lathers ok for me but my hair never seems to feel clean.  It leaves my hair with that little heavy oily feel to it.</li>
    <li> It left my hair very dry and I was allergic to something in it, so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the local store many times and it was great!  But when ordering from this online store, the product arrived either watered down or was old. We ordered several from here and they were all poor quality!  Highly disappointed :(</li>
    <li> The Renpure Organics Moisturizing shampoo is the first shampoo that has really helped to control the dryness and frizziness of my hair, which is thick and naturally curly. Summer heat and humidity make a mess of my hair, but using this shampoo and using the hairdryer less, has made a big difference. My hair is much softer,it lays better,and looks so much healthier! It is now the only shampoo I use, and it is made in the USA! No more \\&quot;wild\\&quot; hair!!!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is by far the best shampoo i have purchased. It smells amazing!! I have fine, curly, frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a month and my hair is a lot healthier.</li>
    <li> It make my hair feel so soft.  And glad it is at least better than most shampoo&#x27;s.  I recommend it all the time.  Wish I could find it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I am so gad I found this brand! I have been straightening and curling my hair a ton for years and this definitely helps with the damage. And it doesnt have all the harmful chemicals in them that I try to avoid. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried this product - however I ordered 2 bottles of GLUTEN FREE Shampoo - i am highly allergic to Gluten.&lt;br /&gt;They delivered 2 bottles - one Gluten Free - the other filled full of Gluten.  Why?  I live in Dubai &amp; a friend brought this product to me from New York.  I can&#x27;t sent it back and I&#x27;m very disappointed that they couldn&#x27;t get a simple order right.</li>
    <li> Left my hair flat and limp, although it was clean. This would be very nice for curly hair, I think.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was the first one in a long time to make my hair feel pretty! Kept my hair well hydrated and moisturized. I would recommend this to every one! Don&#x27;t forget the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this at CVS any more.  I love this shampoo.  And you don&#x27;t need that much either.  WOrks into a lather easily and I never shampoo twice.  Your hair feels silky smooth afterwards.  I blow dry my hair every day, so I am drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;This really helps moisturize it.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for organic/chemical-free/natural products for a better living and I liked the price compared to ones in natural stores and it&#x27;s a local brand where I live, so I&#x27;m helping out the community too! My hair feel soft and it smells good, so I&#x27;ll consider this brand again!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that when I first looked up Renpure I was kind of skeptical about it because of the cheap price. I&#x27;ve used David Babaii before and I thought I loved it, until I tried Renpure. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, David Babaii is great, but Renpure is even better. It&#x27;s really hard to find sulfate/paraben free shampoos and conditioners for a cheap price, and that&#x27;s also why I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for Renpure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so I went and bought \\&quot;Renpure Organics My pretty hair is parched!\\&quot; yesterday when I saw online that it is sold at Walgreens, and it was only 5.99 for the shampoo and conditioner each. David Babaii is like 10.99 each for the shampoo/conditioner when I&#x27;ve seen it at Ulta. (David Babaii is hard to find in stores now for some reason that I don&#x27;t know.) Anyway, I used it this morning and it is ABSOLUTELY amazing. It has a light fresh smell, whereas David Babaii smelled like coconut, which wasn&#x27;t bad, but I like the fresh smell better. And the best part about it is that my hair feels incredibly soft. When I used David Babaii, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say about this shampoo and conditioner. It did exactly what I wanted: it made my hair smell amazing and feel soft and great, without the damaging effects of sulfates/parabens, and for an incredibly cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND \\&quot;RENPURE ORGANICS MY PRETTY HAIR IS PARCHED!\\&quot; FOR EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!  It smells so good and is thick and rich and lathers so good!!! My hair feels so much better after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo for awhile.  Never faded my hair, never felt as if any residue was left behind.  Recommend using both the shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo and conditioner ever, it made hair so dry it&#x27;s falling out!</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to gluten, this is a great shampoo. Free of many harsh chemicals so it is safe for your color, but at the same time out performs all the natural hair care products I&#x27;ve found. This really doesn&#x27;t qualify as all natural, but it&#x27;s a nice compromise.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter to use and I tried it and love it. My hair is so soft,shiny and silky after one use.</li>
    <li> For those who are \\&quot;cone-free\\&quot;, this product DOES contain Amodimethicone.  It is pretty far down the list of ingredients, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem. Other than that, the product contains very good ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 3 years. I have given it as gifts and the  recipients love it also. Hopefully they will continue to make and sell it. I can no longer buy it at the drugstore where I originally found it. Thank you Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully! Perfectly light, but moisturizers very well and leaves my hair silky, soft and bouncy (I have thick, curly hair that is straighten each day, so its tough to find a great conditioner that works as well as this on).  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for curly/kinky textured hair. It leaves my hair feeling clean and hydrated. It also has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great with soft and moisturized hair in nice shaped bottle - great product for the price that too organic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Like most of us I was looking for a chemical free, sulfate free, propylene glycol free (they put that stuff in antifreeze), etc. for my hair.  But in my case it wasn&#x27;t just to give me healthy shiny think hair, it was to protect my investment.  You see I suffer from male pattern baldness and it was pretty advanced.  And my scalp was a mess with constant ingrown hairs, pimples, and other problems.  So after having over 2,500 hair graft transplants to restore my hairline I didn&#x27;t want to use just any shampoo and conditioner on my new head of hair.  I looked at all the expensive salon name brand products and they all seemed to have some sulfate additive or another that made me nervous to use.  I found Renpure at my local pharmacy with a free sample of conditioner and thought why not give its additive free all organic formula a try.  3 weeks later my hair feels great, its soft, shiny, and looks thicker than before.  And my scalp isn&#x27;t breaking out like it used to and my hair is healthy.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it has been just 3 weeks, but if I still have positive results in 3 months I will write a follow up and give it the extra star.  If it can give my $10,000 head of hair the results I needed then I recommend you give it a try too.</li>
    <li> EDIT: Combined with the My Pretty Hair is Parched conditioner, this product is wonderful. But I wouldn&#x27;t use it by itself and expect moisturized results.  -  I&#x27;ve got stick-straight thicker hair and I want to like this product so much! I&#x27;ve been looking for a great organic product for my whole family to use. The search goes on...  Smell:  I love the smell--it&#x27;s a combination of citrus and herbal and very strong.  Lather:  It lathers well, almost perfectly for the amount of shampoo I put in my hand (a dollar-coin size for shoulder-length hair). Always like an organic that lathers well because some don&#x27;t.  Rinse:  Rinses clean and feels nice when rinsed and still wet.   However... upon towel drying in a normal fashion, my hair knots up something terrible with this shampoo and it feels terribly dry. I had read reviews that said the reviewer didn&#x27;t need conditioner at all with this shampoo--I found that to be simply not true. Without conditioner, my hair was immediately damaged by trying to get my brush through it. This caused a lot of flyaways and again, my wet hair felt like straw. After drying and several brushings it&#x27;s soft, but still, not ideal. I just ordered the matching conditioner, hoping this will make a difference. I will let you know!  Note: On my kids&#x27; finer hair, it works all right, but still, the hair seems terribly dry after only two uses.</li>
    <li> All this does is clean way to good.  After your out and dried your hair.....Bam.!  your back to a dry frizz.  Just terrible.  Your going to need conditioner and a slab of butter to re-condtion it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great organic product.  Love how my hair is clean and healthy from this.&lt;br /&gt;Just switched to organics.  Used to get at BedBath but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.  Big dissappointment to have to order online.  Oh well at least I can still get it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  Arrived on time and I use it regularly.  THe packaging was awesome: no spills or drips.  Plan to order this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> This smells like...bubbles. And it just a basic job at cleaning. Not very stripping or anything like that but I still wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> They claim to be organic, and lead you to believe everything to put in this product is \\&quot;safe\\&quot;. I promise you it is not. Among the lengthy list of junk they put in this crap and market it as organic, they include quaternium-17 which is a known cancer causing agent. On the cosmetic database this product is given a safety rating (0being VERY safe and no risk and 10being very dangerous) it got a 5... which is just as terrible as any other off brand shampoo and conditioner at your local store. I cant justify the price for the product, and I think its terrible they try and label this an organic product when its FULL of chemicals.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have lately been having problems with dry scalp from using so much dry shampoo since my hair tends to get oily pretty fast.  This stuff really cleans your hair and leaves it extra smooth and silky and bouncy with NO RESIDUE.  I think the people who were complaining about residue were just using it wrong, you really need to work this stuff into your hair to get it to lather.  Alos, they may not have been using enough product...  It&#x27;s  a little extra work compared to what i usually do but so worth it.  Amazing results and this is coming from someone with oily hair who wants my shampoo to get it as clean as possible.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner combined work very well on my dry, colored hair. I&#x27;m constantly touching my hair because its so soft. I have natural curly, frizzy hair and this helps to soften and moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference in the product from what I was using.  Was a bit disappointed in the stiff feeling I was left with.</li>
    <li> I just tried this shampoo for the first time and absolutely love it.  I tried it because of the organic ingredients and absence of toxic chemicals that come in normal shampoos.  It definitely delivers on quality and the price is great.  I highly recommend this shampoo if you want to be pleasantly surprised by a product that lives up to its promises.  If only more companies would be like this....</li>
    <li> I love the Renpure Originals gluten free products. My 13 and 8 year old daughters also use it and have beautiful hair. Our hair dresser comments on how well our hair and scalp look.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier ... unless it was Renpure Organics My Savvy Hair Needs Sleek! Smoothing Shampoo!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product as well as the Renpure brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure why other reviews say it does not lather... cause mine lathers really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells fragrant and clean and can be used as a unisex fragrant.  I purchase another Renpure shampoo for my son though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to trying their conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product that contains no gluten or sulfates. It foams up very nicely (not all sulfate-free shampoos do) which I like as it makes my head/hair feel very clean. On the down side, it contains hydrolyzed vegetable protein which is MSG - a neurotoxin. HORRIBLE for the body/brain. It&#x27;s really too bad as it kind of ruins an otherwise very solid product.</li>
    <li> Great organic shampoo that is not sold in stores. It usually lasts me about 2-3 months. Leaves my hair full of volume.</li>
    <li> Great smell! It made my hair soft and shiny. I just wish the bottle was bigger. Oh, and I&#x27;m African American with permed hair that is past my shoulders, if that matters lol.</li>
    <li> Just reordered. Works as well for me as my spa shampoo. Was looking for something more natural with less or no chemicals. Found it -- inexpensive as well.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried this shampoo. It is definitely a keeper! I have become quite the fan of Renpure Organics products. Doesn&#x27;t leave that weighted feeling on my hair, no fly-aways ... just soft, silky hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The smell is not overpowering and was very pleasantly surprised to find the amount of lather it has even though there is no sls in it.  Thanks for providing a great shampoo and not breaking my wallet to get it.</li>
    <li> You know how you find a great shampoo for your hair and the first few times you use it it seems to do a good job. after a few times it starts to build up or just not doing what it was supposed to do? Not with this. It rinses clean while leaving your hair soft and shiny. I am so impressed that I just ordered the conditioner. Great for my colored treated hair.</li>
    <li> This product smells great but is really thin.  To top it off all the oils in it made my hair go from a little dry to oily.  Gross.  The first day I used it my hair was oily by 10pm, that&#x27;s never happened before.  It could work for others, and if it does, great, but for me, too much!</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my scalp flaky and itchy. I don&#x27;t recall ever having a similar reaction to another hair care product, and I don&#x27;t have dandruff. I stopped using the shampoo for a few weeks to see whether it was the product or the dry winter air messing with my scalp, and sure enough my head was fine while not using the shampoo but got itchy the first time I used it after the break. My hair also was limper than usual after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo every two, three or even four days during the winter, so I don&#x27;t think the product built up because of overfrequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely appreciate that this shampoo is free of lots of bad stuff -- and that&#x27;s why I bought it -- but I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like all of their products. They smell wonderful and make my colored hair feel like it used to when I was younger. Would highly recommend them to anyone !!</li>
    <li> Had high hopes looking for a mild, daily shampoo &amp; conditioner after reading amazon reviews. After using for 1 week, I hate it and can&#x27;t wait for the bottles to be empty! It feels like it doesn&#x27;t clean at all! Not much lather, faint \\&quot;doggy\\&quot; scent, and leaves hair rough and yucky! The conditioner doesn&#x27;t do anything, not soft or tamed or shiny, nothing! Dollar store shampoos &amp; conditioners do a better job! SO not what I was looking for! My long, dry hair will have to keep looking for good daily care!</li>
    <li> I tried out this product, but in the end it seemed more expensive and no more satisfying than the Clear Scalp brand hydrating line.  I have not repurchased.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering Renpure organics. I was disappointed to find out my mistake. Cancelled my continuing order because I needed organic</li>
    <li> This is one of the nicest shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. No chemicals to cause scalp itching. It does not dry your hair and lathers luxuriously. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product (shampoo and conditioner.) I tried them because I have thin, fine hair and was looking for a sulfate free product and it was very affordable. I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free shampoos that don&#x27;t lather well at all, and this one does lather decently. I&#x27;ve gone through two sets of shampoo and conditioner and my hair feels great -- soft, shiny and healthy. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If your hair is dry and needs moisture, this shampoo is great to use!  ANd I love the fact that it is organic.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find, so Amazon makes it easy to get.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes but was let down. It left my hair feeling dirty and greasy. I used it for about a week and couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. I have moved on.</li>
    <li> Great product,very pleased.</li>
</ol>
