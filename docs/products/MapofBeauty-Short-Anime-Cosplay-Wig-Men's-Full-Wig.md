      <li>It came faster than the shipping date and it fits good!</li>
      <li>This is a truly beautiful wig.</li>
      <li>This wig is great.</li>
      <li>Great quality and great for foxy the pirate cosplay</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great wig I loved it.</li>
      <li>It came with a wig cap, which is good.</li>
      <li>I love this wig!</li>
      <li>Great wig that arrived very quickly, but</li>
      <li>The wig came nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>It sheds very easily as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really comfortable and stays on fairly well.</li>
      <li>This wig is most likely one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
      <li>I could still see most of my hair under the wig.</li>
      <li>but it was ok.</li>
      <li>The color matches the picture, the quality is great for the price, &amp; some of my friends commented that it looked like it was my real hair.</li>
      <li>Okay wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice quality and vibrant color.</li>
      <li>But I wish it fit a bit better, or was more adjustable for head sizes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great quality wig, and it looks/fits very nice, but it&#x27;s a little shorter than it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>It came a week early and its very good quality highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>This is my first wig and I love it!</li>
      <li>The red was a great color though, and I made it look really cute with some work on my part (not to mention a hat).</li>
      <li>Though I like it on regardless and it is for an original design so the length isn&#x27;t a huge issue.</li>
      <li>As much as the picture makes it look neck length and suitable, its not.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and tangle free and fits nicely.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
      <li>However, that was the only thing good about this wig.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, soft wig.</li>
      <li>The color is nice, and that was the ONLY thing that matched the photo.</li>
      <li>I got this wig kind of last minute for an event.</li>
      <li>Just received the wig in the mail earlier than expected, which I was very happy about!</li>
      <li>Cane like a good 3 weeks before it&#x27;s expected arrival so that was a plus.</li>
      <li>This took over a month to ship, but was well worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more orange-y than in the picture, but it&#x27;s nothing major.</li>
      <li>I might just buy more if I need another one in the future.</li>
      <li>It is actually a little shorter in the back than it says in the picture, but the quality is good and it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
      <li>The only concerns I have is that I ordered one wig and received two, and the wig has a bit of a shine to it but for the price it&#x27;s overall really good.</li>
      <li>I was kinda worried that most of the hair would fall out but not really.</li>
      <li>The wig I recieved was shorter than what was shown in the picture, VERY short, and wouldn&#x27;t fit my head.</li>
      <li>That aside, this wig is actually really well made.</li>
      <li>I had to modify it to fit a larger head.</li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking for a trickster Dirk wig, I highly suggest this one!</li>
      <li>least the price is nice for what I got.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft, and no shine to it, making it look realistic.</li>
      <li>This wig was a little bit tight on me, but to be fair</li>
      <li>It was easy to style into the look I wanted, due the back already flipping out.</li>
      <li>It came much faster than expected as well.</li>
      <li>It feels sorta nice and uncomfortable but that&#x27;s probably just me.</li>
      <li>It comes a little short, and still choppy, but overall it&#x27;s amazing quality.</li>

    <li> Just received the wig in the mail earlier than expected, which I was very happy about! However, that was the only thing good about this wig. The wig I recieved was shorter than what was shown in the picture, VERY short, and wouldn&#x27;t fit my head. It&#x27;s as if it were a child&#x27;s wig. It sheds very easily as well. The color is nice, and that was the ONLY thing that matched the photo.</li>
    <li> I got this wig kind of last minute for an event. I didn&#x27;t expect it to come in on time, but I also didn&#x27;t expect it to come in a month later. Took forever to get here. And once it did get here, it was VERY small. I could still see most of my hair under the wig. The red was a great color though, and I made it look really cute with some work on my part (not to mention a hat). But I wish it fit a bit better, or was more adjustable for head sizes. It&#x27;s got a mesh lining which constrains it to one size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least the price is nice for what I got.</li>
    <li> Awesome wig. I used it in making a video.</li>
    <li> It is actually a little shorter in the back than it says in the picture, but the quality is good and it doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great quality wig, and it looks/fits very nice, but it&#x27;s a little shorter than it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> This is a truly beautiful wig. It matches a hair extension I bought. I thoroughly examined it for any signs of damage and I did not see any when I gave it a once over. This wig is just what I needed to finish off my pony cosplay. I might just buy more if I need another one in the future. I will definitely recommend this seller to others.</li>
    <li> This wig is most likely one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve ever gotten! It&#x27;s really comfortable and stays on fairly well. I will be buying from this seller again. The wig came nicely packaged. The only concerns I have is that I ordered one wig and received two, and the wig has a bit of a shine to it but for the price it&#x27;s overall really good.</li>
    <li> There return policy really stinks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for my trickster Dirk cosplay from Homestuck. It&#x27;s a nice, soft wig. Although, as soon as I took it out of the packaging, the hair began to fall out. It sheds quite a bit, but after I attacked it with hairspray and gel I no longer had that problem. It was easy to style into the look I wanted, due the back already flipping out. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a trickster Dirk wig, I highly suggest this one! It&#x27;s a bit more orange-y than in the picture, but it&#x27;s nothing major. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Cane like a good 3 weeks before it&#x27;s expected arrival so that was a plus. The hair is soft and tangle free and fits nicely.</li>
    <li> It came a week early and its very good quality highly recommend!!!</li>

Though I like it on regardless and it is for an original design so the length isn&#x27;t a huge issue.</li>
    <li> This wig is great. It came in about 2 weeks or so. It feels sorta nice and uncomfortable but that&#x27;s probably just me. I have long thick hair and it was kinda hard to push my hair through the wig but it was ok. I&#x27;m planing to cut my hair soon. I was kinda worried that most of the hair would fall out but not really. It&#x27;s a great wig I loved it. I haven&#x27;t style it yet but I will soon.</li>
    <li> It came with a wig cap, which is good. The bad part is that it&#x27;s not long like the picture. It fits me, but still. It shows the nap of my neck. I Suggest you not to push it aside, just trim the bangs.</li>
    <li> Great wig that arrived very quickly, but when it arrived it was several inches shorter than pictured.</li>
    <li> This took over a month to ship, but was well worth it. It comes a little short, and still choppy, but overall it&#x27;s amazing quality. It&#x27;s very soft, and no shine to it, making it look realistic. Only 4 stars because the wig is on the small side, and had to be stretched. I am using this as a base wig for my severa cosplay and would definitely but wigs from here again! ♥♥♥</li>
    <li> Okay wig. It&#x27;s thin and the wig cap can show through. I had to modify it to fit a larger head. We&#x27;ll probably have to sew in wefts to hide the cap and make it fluffier.</li>
    <li> Great quality and great for foxy the pirate cosplay</li>
    <li> We hAVE NEVER GOTTEN IT YET, but I like the pic.</li>
    <li> This is my first wig and I love it! It came faster than the shipping date and it fits good!</li>
    <li> This wig was a little bit tight on me, but to be fair I have a kinda big head &amp; thick hair. That aside, this wig is actually really well made. The color matches the picture, the quality is great for the price, &amp; some of my friends commented that it looked like it was my real hair. That, my friends, is what cosplayers want to hear.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 wigs. The black short one and this red one. As much as the picture makes it look neck length and suitable, its not. Its very short and almost impossible to get on. The black one was alright except it was tight, the red would barely cover my wig cap. Very disappointing.</li>
