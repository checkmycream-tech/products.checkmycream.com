      <li>and you&#x27;re now over 40 and still love it then</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume for my girlfriend for Christmas since this is her favorite scent.</li>
      <li>This is a free country and we&#x27;re free to do what we wanna do and be who we wanna be ladies!</li>
      <li>Has a nice fresh scent, not over powering to the senses</li>
      <li>I love this perfume not to strong a gentile light smell cant find it anywhere and everytime I wear it</li>
      <li>Fresh clean scent!!</li>
      <li>It is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>everyone wants to know what it is so many compliments love love love at first glow</li>
      <li>Such a great scent that is light but lasts all day.</li>
      <li>it is fabulous.</li>
      <li>Overall she is happy with it</li>
      <li>but the fragance is like I wanted  sweet and light for use in Sunny Days.</li>
      <li>I have looked floor it in stores without success, and purchased it online for a cheaper price (s+h included) than when i bought it in department stores!</li>
      <li>I received this product quickly.</li>
      <li>If you like Love&#x27;s Baby Soft</li>
      <li>If you grew up in the 70s and 80s and got hooked on Love&#x27;s Baby Soft</li>
      <li>Only thing, it did not come with the chain like the picture but other than that, smells great!</li>
      <li>Price is right...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the part of the fragrance that most likely is supposed to smell like skin.</li>
      <li>:) I will definitely purchase from them again!!!</li>
      <li>the first thing I notice was that it didn&#x27;t come with the JLo chain around the bottle.</li>
      <li>I like Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, and one reviewer pointed out that it has similarities, but I should have just stuck with the Baby Soft.</li>
      <li>and it really suits her.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;For you perfume lovers try Burberry body &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; and the original chole &amp;#34;its the yellow one&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a similar note that&#x27;s in the original &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; (also unwearable for me).</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this and only ordered it after reading great reviews, but for me at least, it&#x27;s unwearable.</li>
      <li>this two are very strong and long lasting of course are Eau de Parfum.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere hardly anymore, and it&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
      <li>I purchased this as a gift however my daughter highly recommends it.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I got nervous because the first thought that ran through my mind was that I received a fake, which was kind of embarrassing because she is well aware that they come with a chain.</li>
      <li>I have two fragances Jennifer Lopez Luxe and Live Luxe</li>
      <li>My guess is this is overall a scent you are either going to live or despise.</li>
      <li>AT FIRST GLOW is Eau de Toilette and don&#x27;t have very long lasting</li>
      <li>Very delicate and lovely.</li>

<li> It is so hard to find this fragrance.  </li>
<li> Hard to find...not so on Amazon!!!</li>

    <li> I rec&#x27;d this perfume for Xmas and fell in love with it.  I used it all and had to buy it for myself.  Love it.  I rec&#x27;d lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere hardly anymore, and it&#x27;s my favorite! I have been wearing it for years now! I&#x27;m so happy they carried this item, and at a great price! I received it so quick too!!! :) I will definitely purchase from them again!!! :) A+</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend for Christmas since this is her favorite scent. I believe she told me that they don&#x27;t make these anymore and aren&#x27;t sold in store which is why I turned to Amazon. When I gave this to her and watched her open it the first thing I notice was that it didn&#x27;t come with the JLo chain around the bottle. That&#x27;s when I got nervous because the first thought that ran through my mind was that I received a fake, which was kind of embarrassing because she is well aware that they come with a chain. However, the scent seems to be just as it should and it lasts quite a few hours. Overall she is happy with it so that doesn&#x27;t make me too upset. I&#x27;m just warning everyone else to be cautious about your purchase.</li>
    <li> excellent product, excellent service</li>
    <li> This perfume is nice.  Only thing, it did not come with the chain like the picture but other than that, smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought it for use in summer I have two fragances Jennifer Lopez Luxe and Live Luxe this two are very strong and long lasting of course are Eau de Parfum. LOVE AT FIRST GLOW is Eau de Toilette and don&#x27;t have very long lasting but the fragance is like I wanted  sweet and light for use in Sunny Days.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it love it! I have this perfume and since it smells so nice i had to get another~ I even ordered one for my mom!&lt;br /&gt;For you perfume lovers try Burberry body &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; and the original chole &amp;#34;its the yellow one&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this and only ordered it after reading great reviews, but for me at least, it&#x27;s unwearable. I can&#x27;t pinpoint what the note is in this that makes me cringe, but I just can&#x27;t get used to it. It&#x27;s a similar note that&#x27;s in the original &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; (also unwearable for me). It&#x27;s the part of the fragrance that most likely is supposed to smell like skin. To me it&#x27;s kind of like a musky b.o.  Ugh. I like Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, and one reviewer pointed out that it has similarities, but I should have just stuck with the Baby Soft. My guess is this is overall a scent you are either going to live or despise. I just need to figure out what to do with this if it&#x27;s not returnable.</li>
    <li> Smells so good had this many years ago and was very pleased to see this on amazon, packaged well and arrived intact!</li>
    <li> The item showed up with out the JLo charm which is no real big deal but the pump sprayer sprays in a stream instead of a mist which causes it to run down my skin and wet stains on my clothing.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean scent!! Not overpowering. Love this! Hard to find...not so on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume not to strong a gentile light smell cant find it anywhere and everytime I wear it everyone wants to know what it is so many compliments love love love at first glow</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find this fragrance.  This is my daughters favorite cologne and it really suits her.  I hope they are still making it.  It is not too strong.  Has a nice fresh scent, not over powering to the senses</li>
    <li> I received this product quickly. It&#x27;s rating proceeded it, i love the product! I have looked floor it in stores without success, and purchased it online for a cheaper price (s+h included) than when i bought it in department stores!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this perfume or not just by reading the scents/ingredients it has. However, I am SO glad I bought this perfume it is fabulous. Such a great scent that is light but lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift however my daughter highly recommends it. The scent is appealing to all around you.</li>
    <li> If you like Love&#x27;s Baby Soft then you&#x27;ll go for this. It smells very similar. Very delicate and lovely. Geared toward teens and 20 somethings, but you know what? If you grew up in the 70s and 80s and got hooked on Love&#x27;s Baby Soft and you&#x27;re now over 40 and still love it then hey, you go ahead and indulge. This is a free country and we&#x27;re free to do what we wanna do and be who we wanna be ladies! Love At First Glow is a great fragrance!</li>
    <li> Price is right... Smells really good.</li>
