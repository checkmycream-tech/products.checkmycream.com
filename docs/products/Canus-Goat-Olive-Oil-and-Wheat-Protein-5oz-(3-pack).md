<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these soaps. I have psoriasis and helps not to irritate my skin, like regular soaps do. Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a while and was happy to find it on Amazon. I love it. It is great for my dry skin. My daughter and granddaughter are both using this soap now. It is really good and not expensive either. It feels very creamy and luscious. This is the only soap I use. I have never used soap on my face before, but I do this one. I would recommend this to all of my friends. It&#x27;s just that great!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced real goat milk soap.</li>
    <li> We have been using the soap for several months now. Her skin was dry before and now it is so moist and soft. We are older and your skin dries out more when you are older so this was a godsend. I would recommend this out to anyone it&#x27;s dry skin. Even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin it is really nice because your skin feel so clean afterwards</li>
    <li> Love this soap- better than Dove for a beauty bar with great lather.</li>
    <li> Large bars, fragrance-free as advertised, produce a thick, creamy, low-suds lather. My skin feels great; no itching!</li>
    <li> Have used this soap for three years and it helps immensely with keeping at bay the Texas leathery skin.  My husband even uses it during the winter.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin so much.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. Have ordered in the past and will order again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin so soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> I bought a bar of this soap last year, shortly after I bought several of my favorite expensive French-import brand.  I only bought it to try.  My skin responds differently to various soaps and lotions--everything from my face, neck, arms, hand and body.  My other soap finally ran out and I was reluctant to pay so much to order another batch.  Which meant that I had to open that bar of soap up and use it.  Result:  Instantly changed my loyalties!  It simply feels great, lathers beautifully and leaves my skin feeling good.  I liked it so well that I ordered the Canus face cream, as well...and also instantly changed my loyalties in that regard.</li>
    <li> HAVE BEEN USING THIS SOAP FOR MANY YEARS AND IT IS FANTASTIC.  IT IS VERY GENTLE TO THE SKIN AND LEAVES NO RESIDUE!!!</li>
    <li> need to work with the lotion to get the most out of it. have now bought for gifts for our daughters</li>
    <li> This is the only soap my daughter with sensitive skin will use.</li>
    <li> Make skin so soft and smooth.  One down side it is not a deodorant soup</li>
    <li> i wanted to try a soap bar that milk in it.&lt;br /&gt;just love it very gentle my skin stay moist and&lt;br /&gt;help with dry skin that get .and use less&lt;br /&gt;meds cream to clear up.i say buy it great soap.&lt;br /&gt;and no smell at all.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap leaves my skin feeling.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin at all and when they advertise &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; they really mean it. The price was good.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I&#x27;m allergic and can only use this brand and type. However, Canus keeps raising the price too much.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I have been using it for about 6 months now. Skin is soft and leaves your skin clean.</li>
    <li> This has been the best soap so far that I have ever used on my face. It&#x27;s non-drying and no irritation which is a plus because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! I used this when I use to live in north Texas because of the hard water and I still use it since moving back to the Caribbean and it makes my skin smooth, helps with eczema and removes every single shred of dirt!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling very clean and soft. Very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Best soap out there---doesn&#x27;t matter if you have sensitive skin or normal</li>
    <li> nice soap, makes skin feel soft</li>
    <li> we both use this daily and skin problems have lessened. Love the creaminess and scent free. will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the opportunity to purchase a good fragrance free product. This soap is an essential for us that find the world of perfumes and dyes lethal to our health and others that just like the smell of clean without all the foo fah rah.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Ihad a bar and couldn&#x27;t remember where I&#x27;d bought it; perhaps a Farmer&#x27;s Market.  Was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrance so even the &amp;#34;unscented, for sensitive skin&amp;#34;  products were starting to cause problems for me.  As a Prime member, I had my soap within 3 days...just in time.</li>
    <li> I like it, however, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
