<li> The description on the order form clearly says Disposable Plastic Bibs with Crumb Catcher 16\\&quot;</li>
<li> I would recommend SNL Quality Disposable Adult Poly-Lined Bibs - 16&amp;#34; X 33&amp;#34; - Tie-Back (Pack of 300)</li>
<li> The bib &amp;#34;blows&amp;#34; all over when the child moves, there is not enough weight to the product to keep it flat on the child&#x27;s torso.</li>
<li> about 30\\&quot; long rather than 24\\&quot;.</li>
<li> The bib was too short and the neck area could not fit around an average adult&#x27;s neck.  </li>
<li> Not the same size as previously ordered.  </li>
<li> The bad part is dad doesn&#x27;t enjoy the ritual, and some of stain doesnt come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Ruins her clothes so we got her these.</li>
<li> She makes a mess every time we eat out.</li>
<li> Picture did not accurately represent bib.</li>
<li> The ties for the bib are in the wrong place, so the bib just hangs down the middle, instead of covering.</li>
<li> These bibs are to small for senior adults.</li>
<li> Not good quality at all.</li>
<li> Very thin, and expensive compare to other product that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
<li> The end ties are attached to the sides of the bibs and the plastic is so thin they rip off when you try to loosen to use.</li>
<li> Again the plastic is way too thin.</li>
<li> Will not reorder, sorry.</li>
<li> They are very thin and flimsy.  </li>
<li> Yes it&#x27;s very thin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does the job and can be used more then once. Yes it&#x27;s very thin but it&#x27;s something to protect your loves ones clothes. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Same a s a lobster bib you get in restaurants.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my dad.  We used to change his cloths and pants after every meal.  The bad part is dad doesn&#x27;t enjoy the ritual, and some of stain doesnt come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he would juse wear this during meals and throw it away after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functional, convenient, and effective!</li>
    <li> Very thin, and expensive compare to other product that I&#x27;ve been using. Will not order this anymore</li>
    <li> Really does catch the crumbs.  Reasonably priced.  Since my 90-year old mom uses these 2 to 3 times a day, it was great to find them in a 500 count pack and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought these plastic disposable bibs for my mother who has Dysphasia which creates difficulty in eating without spilling food on herself. The bibs work fine. Wish they were about 30\\&quot; long rather than 24\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> We love these and use these everyday….and easy enough to take when away from the house.</li>
    <li> taking care of mom or dad?...works well with someone who is challenged by sight or motor skills ( or both!) keeps the clothes clean and the price is right</li>
    <li> I did NOT receive what I ordered. The description on the order form clearly says Disposable Plastic Bibs with Crumb Catcher 16\\&quot; X 24\\&quot;. What I received in the mail are Disposable Plastic Bibs WITHOUT crumb catchers that are 15\\&quot; X 20\\&quot;. It I wanted smaller bibs without crumb catchers, I would have ordered that size &amp; style!</li>
    <li> These were the greatest!&lt;br /&gt;No problems at all!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny! My wife is so happy with them an that means I am happy!</li>
    <li> Not big enough for my daughter.  I also need bibs to tie around her waist to keep her extra clean.</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking it was the same I ordered last year. Big mistake. These are too thin..even though they are the exact same brand. Next time I will order from BHmedwear again ..</li>
    <li> Picture did not accurately represent bib. The end ties are attached to the sides of the bibs and the plastic is so thin they rip off when you try to loosen to use. Again the plastic is way too thin. Will not reorder, sorry. Delivery time was excellent.</li>
    <li> Works great, saves a lot of time from not having to wash clothe bibs, if your somewhat careful these can be used more than once. Best deal for the money.</li>
    <li> Live these.our daughter is 33 and downs syndrome. She makes a mess every time we eat out. Ruins her clothes so we got her these. Live them. Catches food at the bottom and we just toss them after. Used today at a Mexican restaurant. Perfect and she is a large woman!</li>
    <li> very flimsy and not really user friendly.</li>
    <li> They were perfect. I live in a assisted living house.I&#x27;m messey so the Crumb Catcher comes in real handy.I only have use of my left hand so the bibs really  filled my need</li>
    <li> This napkins are handy for my father, but are very flimsy and not wide enough.  As a result, we always get some stains on his shirt on the sides.</li>
    <li> The ties for the bib are in the wrong place, so the bib just hangs down the middle, instead of covering.</li>
    <li> Not good quality at all. The supplier just have changed because I used to buy these often but had to find another source.</li>
    <li> Not the same size as previously ordered.  The bib was too short and the neck area could not fit around an average adult&#x27;s neck.  May be suitable for a small built adult.</li>
    <li> These bibs are to small for senior adults. I would recommend SNL Quality Disposable Adult Poly-Lined Bibs - 16&amp;#34; X 33&amp;#34; - Tie-Back (Pack of 300)</li>
    <li> I use these in my classroom for my special needs children. They work great keeping food off their clothing, but are really thin and crinkle or fold easily.</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  Bibs are the right size for my Dad (who is over 100) and they provide great protection.</li>
    <li> Good Toddler basic. They cover the whole front for extremely messy foods, yet allow the child to do it for themselves without leaving us a huge mess to clean up. just fold it all inside and toss it away. They come in handy when we still need to do laundry. we still use reusable bibs also.</li>
    <li> They are very thin and flimsy.  The bib &amp;#34;blows&amp;#34; all over when the child moves, there is not enough weight to the product to keep it flat on the child&#x27;s torso.</li>
    <li> Brad uses these all the time when we go out to eat!! Will buy more from the seller when these run out. Fast Shipping!!!!</li>
