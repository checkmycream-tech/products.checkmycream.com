<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this for gloss for after I blow dry my hair. You do not need very much. It also smells like strawberries!!</li>
    <li> makes my hair look greasy but then dry and frizzy a couple hours later.  hate it.  what a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Love it for my fine hair. Use one small squirt and it makes my fine colored hair soft and beautiful. I&#x27;m out and need to purchase more so I figured, if I&#x27;m buying more why not tell the world how great this product really is.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I like to curl my hair with a curling iron but lately it has been looking tangly and frizzy...Even using Biolage styling products like the smoothing serum, smoothing shampoos and conditioners.  My Salonist just happened to use this product before she dried my hair. I loved it!  I didn&#x27;t get to really try it out till the next week.  I washed my hair in the evening and applied the product in my hair.  I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work as well because I wasn&#x27;t planning on curling my hair till the next day...Got up the next morning and started curling, it actually helped hold the curl all day, shine, noooooooooo frizzies whatsoever, my hair looks very healthy.  It&#x27;s 10:30pm and my hair looks like I just curled it!  I hope everyone gets a chance to try this product!</li>
    <li> Love this item. My daughter and I bought this in a salon over a year ago and just loved it. This makes your hair so smooth and shiney and clean feeling. You can even use this on your skin as well as a lotion. Would highly recommend for anyone with frizz problems. Can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, smells great, and keeps hair looking glossy but not oily. I&#x27;ve used a million and one polishers over the years, for a nice finish after flat ironing my hair, or for before curling, and Kenras Silkening Gloss. By far is the best polished!! Nothing else needs to be said except....BUY BUY BUY. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> after I put it on my hair it feels very soft and I it doesn&#x27;t get damage when I use my iron. I love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am mixed with Black, White, Indian and German so my hair is curly/frizzy and unmanageable at times and I usually need a ton of things in my hair to keep it straight after pressing it out with a flat iron. With this, all I do is section my hair in to three areas, put 2 pumps on each section and that is all it takes to keep my hair tame and soft and shiny. I must admit I had my doubts but this really worked so well for me and is not greasy/oily so my hair looks fresh day after day (maximum 4 days then it starts to look oily, of course time to wash and repress) and lasts A LONG time. Plus it&#x27;s so much cheaper than buying it in a store. Also, I did not receive the initial order. It showed delivered but I had not received it so they sent me another bottle with no questions asked. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged and brittle. I was having a terrible problem with breakage  This product leaves my hair soft, smooth and gorgeous. I use this product along with the Platinum blow dry  Both products are excellent.  And the results were immediate.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome service!</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive hair product I&#x27;ve ever purchased (was $18 at the salon)...just not really my thing to blow money on.  But my stylist used it on me once and I was hooked.  I love the smell...would NOT have guessed that it&#x27;s strawberry, like another reviewer mentioned.  Maybe it&#x27;s just power of suggestion from another product of theirs that I occasionally use, the \\&quot;taffy\\&quot;; it really just smells lightly of some kind of taffy to me, but not like something that only belongs on pre-teens.  And a bottle DOES last a long time...which completely removed any qualms I had about paying a little more for it.  It has just enough of a presence to work wonders to smooth down my hard to manage hair, but it keeps my hair feeling clean and styling product-free.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m lazy and a slacker, I spend almost no time on my hair. But I like shiny, pretty hair, so using this silkening gloss is one of the things that I actually do. I love the strawberry smell and the way it makes my hair look and feel!</li>
    <li> Works great in my hair. Makes it sleek and shiny. Great smell too. Works great on my dry hair without making it greasy.</li>
    <li> pacjaging was terrible it didn&#x27;t leak out but I  an surprised it didnt</li>
    <li> This product is nice on the hair but the smell is a little overwhelming. It smells like passion fruit</li>
    <li> Amazing spouse cant be without it, smells great, works great shes amazed so of course I&#x60;m amazed worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Very good price--beautiful shine to hair and smells wonderful my daughter, granddaughter, and I use it after each hair washing.  Will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Smells great</li>
    <li> I love it, but pay attention to the expiration date. I got free shipping and saved roughly a $1.50 from the salon, but it expires in like months. Going forward I&#x27;ll buy this in store because this stuff last a while and I know after the expiration date it loses it effect.</li>
    <li> Smells so good like strawberry. Expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very nice product...it adds a deep shine to my hair and has a great scent. It is also a wonderful detangler if you have long hair like I do. I highly recommend this product. The Kenra line of hair products never disappoints.</li>
    <li> This works on the hair, skin, face. A nice product which leaves whatever you put it on feeling supple and smooth. The tiniest drop works so it lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good and it leaves your hair silky and smooth.  My daughter tried this and she&#x27;s crazy about too.</li>
    <li> Product was fine, but packaging not. It was leaking when I opened the box. Tightened bottle and it was good to go.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Always have and I can get it cheaper here than in the salon I used to go to. My new salon does not offer kenra. I purchased their product that does the same thing and do not care for it as much. So I found this and am happy.</li>
    <li> I saw such good reviews for this product to tame frizz and yet it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> So in love with this little bottle of gold! (Technically Silver) this has an incredible smell to this product which is huge to me! Usually when something smells good it isn&#x27;t always the best for your hair but in this case you can have a great quality product and have your smell too! For my thick and naturally curly blonde hair. This has been a miracle, it has helped my ends tremendously. Keeps my hair under control as far as frizz taming and adds a luminous luster to my hair without looking oily and the texture is soft not tacky or damp and won&#x27;t leave your hands or hair looking like you just got done using baby oil! No such thing for this product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Leaves hair shiny and frizz free</li>
    <li> this is the best prouct, better priced online than in beauty stores! great for all hair types and smells great too</li>
    <li> smells really really good and makes your hair silky i love this product and how it looks also glad i bought this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really impresed with this product is nothing like the one i use from the beauty shop is almost like watter</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. The smell... meh, it&#x27;s strawberry. Not something I usually want my head to smell like. It&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s not a strong scent, so no biggie. I have a ton of really fine hair, it damages easily, it frays and gets split ends very easily. This stuff really helps the texture and also helps protect my hair from heat styling. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it feel oily, but you have to remember to avoid putting it on your roots. Apply to hair mid-way down the strand and to the ends and only use a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** This is the only hair product (other than shampoo/conditioner) that I have actually used up the entire bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/2013: I *still* use this stuff. Its SO awesome. I hope they never stop making it, because I seriously live in fear of that.</li>
    <li> First, you can&#x27;t talk about Kenra without talking about how great they smell.  But this product is really great for giving your hair shine without weighing it down and helps keep the frizz away.  You can also use it for smoothing on skin.</li>
    <li> Aside from smelling great, my hair feels soft and shiny and most of all, no Frizz !!!  I just love this stuff</li>
    <li> Love this!  Makes my hair look great and feel great!</li>
    <li> I love this product....makes the final finish of styling look posh. Hair feels &amp; smells great! Ulta stopped selling the smaller size. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
    <li> Love it smells good packaged very well fast shipping would purchase again wish it had more directions for use but overall great product</li>
    <li> If you ever wanted your head to smell like a delicious strawberry cake, get this stuff. It works too, especially when using a hair straightener. Additionally, Kenra does not test on animals, which is really important to me. My hair is curly, thick, and hates me. It likes this stuff. You will be happy.</li>
    <li> Exactly as listed would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years. I have FRIZZY hair. I apply this after straightening &amp; it makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I prefer Paul Mitchell skinny serum. This product doesn&#x27;t feel like it penetrates as deep which says a lot bc what I like most about the skinny serum is how light it is. Definitely feels like a very superficial, light, not lasting shine effect and nothing more than that. If that&#x27;s what I was looking for I could get my $4 silicone spray from the kinky hair section at Walmart</li>
    <li> I found this product did little if anything to put shine in my very fine hair. I ended up giving it to my hairdresser to see what she could do with it. I noticed she is not using it either.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product at a salon when my stylist used it on my hair, since I loved the way it felt and smelled (it smells like strawberries; the scent lingers pleasantly without being overwhelming). I was so happy when I found it on Amazon.com, and 20% cheaper than at the salon!! It is very light and helps my hair look smooth and shiny. I have naturally wavy, somewhat curly hair; the strands are fine but very numerous, so my hair looks thicker than it really is; it can also be subject to frizz on humid days. This product is wonderful for smoothing down frizz without weighing my hair down.It is an oil-type product, so you only need a little bit (I use less than a pea-sized amount...more like half a pea?). A little bit goes a long way, so this will last a long time even though the bottle doesn&#x27;t seem like it contains much. It took me about a year to use one bottle this size. I use this product almost daily, whether I&#x27;m wearing my hair naturally wavy or if I&#x27;m straightening it, and it can be used on wet, damp, or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase again? Definitely will.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend to a friend? Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;Did I receive a promotional credit on this item? Nope. I was fine with buying it at the salon since I liked it so much, and overjoyed to find it at a lower price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This products really moisturizes and eliminates fly-aways without weighing my thin hair down. It also smells really good and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
    <li> As a Hairstylist I say this is the Best product of its kind. And the smell is delicious.Well worth its money</li>
    <li> Love this smell! While it hasn&#x27;t changed the texture or feel that much, the smell is AMAZING. Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I have moderare frizz with wavy hair.  I have used it on both wet and dry hair.  It does a pretty good job of helping smooth the frizies. However I can&#x27;t say it really works better than some less expenwive brands that I&#x27;ve tried, with similar ingredients.  It does have a nice pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Best product ever especially if you like the smell of cotton candy!</li>
    <li> great product, timely delivery</li>
    <li> ordered this for my lady friend, she loves it on her hair. smells good&lt;br /&gt;great product! i am balled on top with about a foot pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;put some on what hair i have left. wo made it soft and shinny&lt;br /&gt;love this kenra platium, for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;Ric P.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Perfectly smooths my hair, even on Florida&#x27;s most humid days!  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff really is great. It is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold, especially in the winter months when hair seems to be more frizzy or static-y. I color my hair so often times after I blow dry it it will be more bull and harsh looking, but I just add one squirt to my hands and rub it in and wow, shiny healthy looking hair immediately. Oh and the fragrance is awesome. Not sure what it is, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that is what heaven will smell like.</li>
    <li> Pump doesn&#x27;t work to good.  I love the product just wish the pump worked better.  I can barely get anything out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times at the salon. I am so glad I found it on here. It smells great and leaves my hair softer than anything!</li>
    <li> Love this product but only use small bead size or will weight hair down...</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product it smells great and leaves your hair shiney, and not to greasy or heavy, I totally recommend you buy and try this product</li>
    <li> I have to be honest I didn&#x27;t like this product at first because most products like this make my hair really oily but after a few trys I loved it! The light sent grew on me too. I also love how you can put it on you skin as well. It makes my hair feel weightless and if you put it in you hair while its damp and blow dry it, it makes your hair look feel sliky and glossy. Well thats why its called silkening gloss lol. All in all this product was a must!</li>
    <li> I am a male who has wears a hair replacement. I have for over 13 years and for anyone male or female who wears a hair system you know that the hair becomes dry and needs lots of moisture to keep it from looking dead.  I put this on everyday and it stays moist all day. It extends the life of my hair system and keeps it styled all day. I hope they never stop making this stuff. I also like how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome product !!!  I have been using it for years.  Great for taming the frizz and a small amount goes a long way.  This bottle will last me for at least a year and I have long hair.  This is a product you will not regret purchasing !!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF ALL HAIR ELIXORS! I have curly frizzy hair and I blow dry it and straighten it every single day for the passed 13 years. This really tames my hair and makes it so that when I am exposed to rain and humid weather it really keeps my hair intact. Doesn&#x27;t even make my hair greasy AT ALL. I will be buying this until I am old and on my death bed. HECK YES!</li>
    <li> My hair is straight, strawbery blonde and never been colored. I feel though it still lacks luster, softness, and beauty that my colored hair friends seem to have. I bought this gloss and use it once a week. I apply, small amount, one to two pumps to my wet hair, down past shuolders. I rub it from end to tips then blowdry. The smell is very nice, like sweet fruit scent. When dry, my hair has a bit more body, it is light and flowy, it smells good, its shiny, soft, lustrious. Yean! It does cause some acne on my hair line sometimes due to the extra oils, i have sensitive skin, I would definetly recommend this to any friend. Good price. Still good second day after shower. Have to re-appply after four days. Will get way to greasy if you add too much or applu too many days in a row.</li>
    <li> please never discontinue Kenra, I finally found a gloss that I love and works perfectly with my curly hair! :)</li>
    <li> i really lopve this serum mainly for the orgasmic smell assoicated with this silkening serum that can be applyed strait top your skin as a moisterizing softening massage rub:)</li>
    <li> Love this product! Fast shipping and good price!</li>
    <li> I am somewhat indifferent to this product. Don&#x27;t hate it but don&#x27;t love it either. I feel I have used better silkening gloss before. I will finish this bottle and then go back to previously used brands.</li>
    <li> it didnt make my hair super shiny, it doesnt do that but does make it super soft...but that just could be my conditioner...i cant tell</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy. I have fine straight hair, and it is hard to find products that don&#x27;t weigh it down. As long as you only use a few drop/pumps it is fine for fine hair. Adds a nice shine. All Kenra products seem to be good.</li>
    <li> I could have swore I did a review on this product already, but here goes again. The hair oil has a very nice smell to it and it is very light which is a plus! I didn&#x27;t like however that when I received my package some of the oil had leaked out. But, I guess that&#x27;s to be expected when expecting liquids through the mail.</li>
    <li> I loooove this stuff! It make  your hair silky,  shiny, with no greasy or crunchy/flaky residue. It also smells yummy, like roses and sugar and vanilla! I would recommend this to anyone with any hair type, this stuff is a miracle!</li>
    <li> Have been using for years. Best smoothing treatment there is! Found on amazing for a great price..will keep buying from here.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It is the best smelling of all my hair products. I don&#x27;t know if it really helps my hair to look smoother but the smell is worth it just to have it on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Chi product is equally effective.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite hair products and smells delicious!</li>
    <li> Hard to get out of bottle something&#x27;s just not right about it.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> Smooth and lovely smell</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! You barely have to put any in your hair, and I apply it more towards the bottom half of my hair and then curl or flat iron it. It makes its SO soft and shiny without it feeling oily (unless you use too much), and it also takes the frizz out. Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> Made my hair look great!</li>
    <li> Kenra by Kenra Platinum is a true silkening gloss. It makes my long black hair glisten night and day! I recommend this product and its seller.</li>
    <li> A really good friend gave me this product to try...I had been having trouble with my bangs looking dry and frizzy (not sure why) and this stuff tamed it instantly! Made my hair look so soft and smooth not weighed down and greasy. I was very impressed! And it smells heavenly...kinda fruity, like strawberries or something. I flip my hair just to smell it. :-)</li>
    <li> Love the product,  but when it arrived it broke in the mail and the liquid was EVERYWHERE  contacted company with no response,  so my mail box smells awesome but my hair never got to meet the sweet apple silkiness it always dreamed about.</li>
    <li> This smells like wonderful strawberries and makes my hair shiny without an oily feel! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is the best for the frizzies.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! My hair tends to get very course&amp; dry, so it&#x27;s nice to have a serum to put some shine back in. I use it very sparingly and it has lasted a long time. The scent is great to me, but I can see how not everyone likes it. It&#x27;s a very sweet strawberry scent. The price was much better on Amazon than any where else!</li>
    <li> Heavy. It weighs your hair down.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  I&#x27;ll make sure I order it again.  Left my hair shiny &amp; silky.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Gooey.  Makes hair greasy.</li>
