<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for just over a year and I like it. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it causes a drastic change but I do feel that it helps your hair grow. It does not happen over night so I would recommend using it for awhile. Overall good product. I would recommend trying it atleast.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female who experienced a long drawn out illness.  While recovering my hair started falling out by the handfuls I was very stressed by this, I&#x27;m assuming this occurred due to the medication I was taking.  After completing the medication I was told about Alter Ego and what a blessing it has been.  I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, hot oil garlic conditioner and the revitilizing lotion.  I shampoo and condition my hair twice a week and use the revitilizing lotion everyday.  After three weeks of usage twice a week I saw little to no hair falling out.  These are remarkable products!!!  I am forever grateful to Alter Ego, now I&#x27;m just waiting for the new growth.</li>
    <li> well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is still falling but I had only two week using it, so I will give it a bit longer but so far its not looking good for this product. I guess you learn by trial and error. I hope not to go bold.</li>
    <li> I was going through a really stressful time in my life and my hair was just falling out left and right.  If I just ran my fingers through my hair when I was in the shower, I had 10-20 strands that fell out EACH TIME! A good friend of mine swore by this product and recommended it to me.  This was a couple years ago now, so I dont remember how quickly is started working, but I remember it really worked.  After no more than a couple weeks I was able to run my finger through my hair and only get a 2-3 strands if any.  I was quite sparing with it too so it lasted a while.  I would recommend this to anyone who has hair loss do to stress!</li>
    <li> this is the best thing for people who are having problems with thinning and breaking hair. Have tried so many things for my hair but this one really work. I purchase all three including the garlic conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product for hair growth and renewal!</li>
    <li> Cant say enough about this. It grew out my edges and struggling nape on one side!</li>
    <li> Hair keeps braking I had to cut it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I started using this product almost 10 years ago. For a while I wasn&#x27;t able to find this exact one in the salon that I go to and then I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that grows but it relaxed with highlights so I use this as proactive treatment. It keeps my hair from shedding and breaking off. It feels so good when its applied to your scalp. I take it with me to salon and my hair dresser applies it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in combination with the Alter Ego Garlic treatment &amp; the hairspray. After reading all the positive reviews along with some personal recommendations I&#x27;m giving this a try. I&#x27;ve only used it once so i cannot attest to the whole \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; thing just yet but I can say my hair looked a lot healthier after I took it to the salon and had them treat my hair with it. I also felt the lotion stimulating my scalp with a tingling sensation as the stylist applied it. Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing or what, but like i said, it was only the first treatment. I plan on treating my hair every week with this so I&#x27;ll provide an update when I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle!     Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I see some improvements on my hairline.  My hair was thinning but just 1 month of usage I actually see a change.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase.  I will be trying the Garlic conditioner next.</li>
    <li> I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT OVER; AND OVER AGAIN. I WILL RECOMMAND IT TO ANYONE; WHOM MIGHT HAVE A HAIR PROBLEM.</li>
    <li> My hair is doing so much better</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I got any growth( regrowth) or anything from this.  I&#x27;ve used it about 6-7 months.  It smells the least like chemicals out of the 4 that Alter Ego makes.  It doesnt weigh my hair down, it doesnt flake and does not counteract my other sweet-smelling products.  It did not fill in ball spots on my scalp and I really cant say that it kept my hair from additional loss.  My hair shines though I can&#x27;t say its from this. Over- hyped.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend and I really like it, it has my hair growing in nice and thick.</li>
    <li> i have used alter Ego in the past ,but only the garlic treatment which is great. Being that I was alot of people use this product at the hair salon i decided to buy it. When I put the lotion in my hair , I felt an amazing cooling sensation that made my scalp feel great. After drying my hair felt light and bouncy. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I cannot go without it. My hair &#x27;acts&#x27; more manageable when I use this product. My hair also looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but I think my hair isn&#x27;t breaking as much as it was.  It smells good and it is easy to apply.  I have nothing but high hopes for this product because so many people swear by it.  My hair dresser suggested that I purchase it and I trust what she says.  I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find proper directions or ingredient list anywhere.  It scared me to put such a foreign item on my scalp but I did use about half the bottle (I was trying to reduce shedding).  It did nothing.  Their garlic mask is amaze for shedding though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff a few years back and I was thrilled with the results. I was living and working in a high stress environment and my hair was falling out in bunches. Once of my employees (who has beautiful hair) gave an almost full bottle that she uses in her hair. I fell in love, the smell is great and it actually relieved my psoriasis that I have in the back of my scalp. In about a week I started seeing a difference in my hair, it was getting thicker, shiner, and it wasn&#x27;t falling out. Once I finished the bottle that my employee gave me, I tried to find places where I can buy it from, silly me didn&#x27;t look on Amazon, so I went 3 years without using this product. My hair didn&#x27;t fall out as much as before but it still fell out. I used so many products, like Kronos Shampoo and products which are awesome, but very expensive, so I had to stop using it because I couldn&#x27;t cough up $50 a month on Shampoo. But those who can, believe me, try it! Anyways this is about Alter Ego Revitalizing Lotion, as I was saying, even thou my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out in chunks my psoriasis came back and with avenges, since I didn&#x27;t have the Alter Ego Revitalizing anymore I was always itching and flaking. A few weeks back just browsing on Amazon I come across Alter Ego Revitalizing (mind you that I have looked for this on the internet and even thou I did find it, no one would ship to Puerto Rico), I was so happy, I tried to order with another seller but same story, \\&quot;We Don&#x27;t Ship To Puerto Rico\\&quot;, I saw this seller and expecting to hear again the story of my life,I ordered and to my surprise my product was at my mail box in a few days, wrapped neatly in bubble wrap. I was so happy! Finally someone who delivered and cheaper than their competitors and shipped FOR FREE!!! Awesome! I immediately started using this product and in a week again, I started seeing a difference! Again flaking, dryness and itchiness is down to a minimum to a point that I don&#x27;t scratch in front of people anymore. Now once I am done with my bottle I will definitely order again. This is great stuff!nce I am done with my bottle I will definitely order again. This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I went to the Dominican&#x27;s to get a blow out and my hair began to fall out. So much heat on my hair was not good at all. All of my hair began to thin out in the middle, so the beautician told me to purchase this product that she was selling in her shop for $37.00. It WORKED WONDERS on my hair!!! My hair is now back thicker and longer than ever. I actually massage my scalp with this every other night. Love It!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if its working.</li>
    <li> Alter Ego is worth the money because it actually does &amp;#34;revitalize&amp;#34; the hair and seems to aid in hair growth.  It also makes my hair look healthy, shiny, and sleek when I wear straight styles.  And, when I want a style that requires length, Alter Ego seems to do the trick.  Alter Ego Revitalizing Lotion is good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month.  I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet, but that could be because it has only been a month.  I will update further in another month.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I has worked wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> I just start using the product and does not have a decision as of yet.</li>
    <li> So my hair was thinning in the front hairline area...(due to age and that&#x27;s what happened to my mom) and I didn&#x27;t want to take anything as harsh as minoxidil because I&#x27;m trying to have a baby soon.  This works wonders....my hairline is coming back in and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I ordered, and I received it much quicker than expected, and the packaging was very professional to keep item from breaking.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It really has helped my hair to grow. Try this product, you will not regret it! Awesome! Awesome!</li>
    <li> After using this product, consistently, for a month, I have not noticed a difference.  Since it came with no instructions, possibly I am not applying correctly.</li>
    <li> It arrived when it said. It seems to be a great product!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a handful of times but I have noticed that my hair has grown a lot and is also a lot thicker as well.  Will be getting some more of this product whenever my current one runs out.</li>
    <li> this product maybe is fake!... it did nothing for me and the hair just keep falling as much as it did... no change at all</li>
    <li> es un buen producto hace mi pelo mas fuerte cresca rapido</li>
    <li> My dominican hair stylist started using Alter Ego (aka the drops) on my hair back in 03-04 when my hair was growing back after years of keeping it short.  When she started her first words to me were \\&quot;watch your hair grow wild.\\&quot; Wild was an understatement, it went crazy.  I stopped using Alter Ego for awhile and in the winter of 09 when my hair was at its longest, I was laid-off and diagnosed with MS.  Between the stress of the two along with the medicine, my hair just shed everywhere.  Once again, I went back to my lady and though she had to trip lots of my hair she was able to grow it right back with the assistance of the Alter Ego.  Unfortunately, last summer, when like a fool I went to another hairdresser they put the wrong perm in my hair and because it was the wrong perm, it started alopecia. Ugh! Iam lucky its a very mild case and was told by a dermatologist that I caught it early to stop any progression.  So here I am again, growing my hair back and once again, I&#x27;m using Alter Ego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alter Ego does work for the nay sayers.  Currently, I&#x27;m hating my new hair cut that ofcourse once again had to happen from damage, but I&#x27;m back on my drops and look forward to seeing my new hair growth very soon. Best of luck to all.</li>
    <li> Great for dry brittle hair and balding areas. Love it!</li>
    <li> I shaved the back of my head last year. To grow my hair back I started to braid my hair. While the braids were in my head I would use the drops twice a week. Omg when I took my braids out my hair was THICK, and SHINNY. I literally get a compliment everyday on my hair. Thanks to whoever made this treatment.</li>
    <li> Miracle in a Bottle    That&#x27;s what they should call this product.  I am a black woman from the Caribbean.  I never had problems growing my hair.  In fact, the length of my hair shocked most people.  It&#x27;s been pulled and tugged by the strangers around the world.   My hair was my pride.    A new high stress job with an energy company, the end of a 14 year relationship and the fright of raising three children on my own, sent me into a state of stress and panic.  Although I looked calm on the outside, my hair was breaking in clumps.  To save face, I chopped it all off less than one inch stating to all who asked me why I would cut my hair that I wanted I change.    The truth is I didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair, but the stress from the job and everything else sent my hair to the bathroom floor every morning.    After seven months. I left the job, started doing meditation and yoga to regain my centre but my hair continued to struggle.  A friend suggested Alter Ego.   The only words that describe this product are Miracle in a bottle.  In just one month my hair has nearly doubled in length. I actually feel my hair growing.  Its pricey, but it worth every penny.  I use it twice a week.    I am about to purchase the garlic deep conditioner.  I cam sure the results will be positive.</li>
    <li> I will buy this product from now on. It makes my hair more shinny, grow, thicker and the folic of my hair stronger. I am so glad that I bought this product.</li>
    <li> My mother in law uses this stuff.  She use to tell me about it so I got some.  I don&#x27;t know what its suppose to do but I like the tingling sensation I feel when I put it on my scalp.  I use it to massage my scalp.  Cant do it everyday seems to strong.  Smells like it may have a lot of alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> i received this shipment quickly and it was less expensive then in the store..  ii will order this again and from this vendor</li>
    <li> My hair was long (middle of my back) however I was transitioning from a relaxer to natural and suffered a lot of breakage.  My beautician recommended Alter Ego Revitalizing Lotion to help strengthen my hair and stop the breakage.  Every week after I get my hair wash she applies it to my scalp. It stings a bit but it helped a lot. I recently cut my hair (to the nape of my neck) and even though my hair is healthy I continue to use the lotion. I believe the products I use including the lotion greatly helps with maintaining the health of my hair.  I love Alter Ego and their products; this is no exception.</li>
    <li> Purchase this again it gave me a headache &amp; while I thought about returning it I decided to make sure it was the product and not just me experiencing headaches. IT&#x27;S the PRODUCT! thumbs down for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and it works well. I have yet to start with this bottle; I hope to do so very soon.</li>
    <li> Love this product and it smells so good! I apply to my scalp every other day bc I workout often. I&#x27;ve seen great hair growth with this product! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> read product review before buying. very good product. had small bald spot on top of head. took about 3 to four weeks to noticed  changes. but it does work. at least I am happy with this product. just ordered another bottle to give as a gift to a relative</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since March 2012 and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of growth, I did a Big Chop in Feb 2012 BECAUSE MY EDGES CAME OUT FROM A BAD QUICK WEAVE, and began using Alter Ego in March 2012 but I can&#x27;t tell 100% if it&#x27;s the main reason of my hair growth. In May, my hair grew long enough for me to get braids, which I&#x27;m currently wearing. I massage Alter Ego in my scalp once a week and I also use it after each shampoo. My hair has been growing faster than I expected so, I have to credit Alter Ego for PART of the growth since this is the ONLY product I&#x27;m using in my hair. I&#x27;m assuming if you use it consistently, it will work GREAT. Some say this doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell but I actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ALL KNOW OF ANYTHING ELSE I COULD USE WITH IT, LET ME KNOW, THANKS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice and love the results. It leaves my hair smooth and easier to manage.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My hair was shedding a lot, someone reccomend that I use this product three times a week and they guaranteed the shedding would stop.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for two week, I can already see the difference in my hair straight. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 or more months. I think its a little too early to say my hair is growing extremely fast. But I will say that I appreciate the tingle sensation on my scalp, I do believe my hair is becoming stronger. I have notice a lot of little hair forming around my hair line. So I like it a lot, I need more. When I wash my hair I apply it to my scalp while my hair is wet, I also applied it 2/3 times before washing again. It causes softness to my hair. I think I love it, my hair is already long so its hard to tell. But I have gained 3 inches since my last trim 6 weeks ago. ;)</li>
    <li> I have discovered this product when i would go to the dominican salon. The would place the drops on my scalp before i went under the dryer. it has a good smell and my scalp and hair always felt refreshed and strong. i reccomend using this product on wet hair before styling as it is not well absorbed on dry hair like oil and will make your hair wet if its dry. i wish i have used this product consistantly to reap the full benefits. Some hair salons sell the product for $40+ so getting it on amazon is a steal! I would say use this product on your scalp(If you tilt your head back and apply, it will run to the back of your hair so a little goes a long way) every time you wash your hair! Works well on natural hair and has no oily or greasy build up and will not weigh hair down!</li>
    <li> This tiny bottle is awesome! I don&#x27;t know what are the ingredients but they work on my hair! I have been using it for only 6 months and my hair is longer than ever. I highly recommend this treatment.</li>
    <li> It was first introduced to me by an hairdresser  for about 4years now &amp; I have been using it since. It really makes my hair grow, strong &amp; healthy. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this product after being recommended by a friend, I am loosing all my hair, and is also thinning on the top front part, used the bottle and did not see any changes! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Hair feels great! My haidresser used this years ago and I couldn&#x27;t wait to find it again. I&#x27;m satisfied with the results so far.</li>
    <li> Used it before, love it!!</li>
    <li> I dont know about this,it smells strongly of alcohol and i din&#x27;t notice any change,or maybe i din&#x27;t use it long enough,it seems to work for other people who have reviewed it,not for me,i cant say if its worth it or not,perhaps it needs time? i dont know.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I am an African American woman with medium short hair that I am transitioning from a short cut. My hair is relaxed and color treated. I&#x27;m looking to grow my hair and maintain healthy hair.  It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks so I&#x27;m not absolutely sure that my hair is growing, but I think it is. This product smells wonderful and sort of works like a setting lotion when I wrap my hair. I am most definitely a fan and will purchase again. Btw: I use it every night before I wrap my hair. I apply several drops to my scalp and then massage.</li>
    <li> I cant give alter ego anything less than a 5 since all their products are excellent but I am not sure what this product is really meant to do except put the salts and proteins back into the hair? Well, I use the drops when I use the conditioner. I either put a few drops along with the garlic mask and I sit under the hair dryer. Hope this can be a tip for most of you on here :-)</li>
    <li> This product has helped the growth of my hair at least three inches in the last month.  I am excited about the progress of my hair in the next six months.</li>
    <li> First bought this product from my Dominican stylist. She recommended this product for the extreme breakage i was having. My hair grew about 3 inches within a month. I LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
