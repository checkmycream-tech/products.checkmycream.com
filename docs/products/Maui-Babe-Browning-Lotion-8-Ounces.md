<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;d advise using the 30 sunscreen under the browning lotion to start off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotionfor years! I&#x27;ve got everyone hooked on it in Ca. Love this stuff, works excellent and it does what it says it does. The smell is great! Even the sun screen smells good. Once you use this you won&#x27;t go back to your old stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this after I used on a Hawaiian vacation. Works great and the after sun lotion smells good and helps your tan stick around</li>
    <li> I love using the sunblock along with the browning lotion.  I tan and don&#x27;t burn at the same time.  I&#x27;m light skinned with freckles so its hard for me to stay out in the sun and not burn.  With this combination I can tan and not have to go through any peeling in the future.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the browning lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t soak in as fast as I want it to.  If you can get past the oiliness of it at first you would love it.  I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> bought this before going to Maui and love it.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars for protection from the sun, but I had to return the larger bottles as I couldn&#x27;t carry them on the plane. Both my husband and I always get a sunburn when we travel to Hawaii, but Maui Babe helped us get a great tan without burning.  The browning lotion was a little messy, but the smell wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Excellent product a little greasy when it goes on but the coffee smell is nice and I will often burn when first in the sun.  I use this product after a few days in the sun when i have a base tan.</li>
    <li> The spf was expired! Sending back!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin. When I tan, I burn first then it starts going dark, but I have to be going very consistently to build it and keep my tan. I just got this product and have used it only once and wow! I am amazed. I have gone three shades darker in just a few hours at the beach on a slightly cloudy day. I received 80 SPF in this pack and I was a little concerned but I still got red in some areas, but unlike other store bought lotions, I&#x27;m not burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lit about the smell and it is not unpleasant or overwhelming in the slightest. Its a very sublte coffee scent that doesn&#x27;t stay in you. It does slightly stain your towel and clothes but it comes off. It&#x27;s also oily but not unpleasant, in the contrary making me feel really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very pricey but so worth it. I can&#x27;t wait to use it once or twice more. To really build in this tan. It does an absolutely amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: I qualified for free shipping and it still came in exactly two days after ordering. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well over 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it really works.  My girlfriend raved about Maui Babe and always buys some when she is in Hawaii.  I decided to give it a try and I was tanner quicker even using sun protection with the product.  I love to look tan but am careful. Oh ya, it smells yummy....like coffee.</li>
    <li> that the tanning product squirted out of the bottle onto things I didn&#x27;t want to be tan.  After I learned to control this defect, I loved everything about each item!</li>
    <li> We found this while vacationing in Maui, and my husband fell in love. I find that this works best for those that tan.it definitely enhances your tanning ability.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my tanning pack, but when it came the bottle was cracked and the tanning lotion was oozing out. I was so bummed!</li>
    <li> great color, recommended to friends !</li>
    <li> I think the smell is delicious, but I really like a rich coffee scent.  The only issue I had with it  was that it could pill while applying it, so I made sure to apply it in the shower stall.  The aftercare lotion smells amazing and my skin felt very soft.  After my vacation, my tan lasted several weeks.  it was even and a nice color.  I am usually pretty fair and burn easily, but when I kept applying the spf I only got a little bit pink on my shoulders, but no burn or peeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product normally.  But this time, the bottle of suntan lotion was delivered with a crack in it.  I took it to the beach with me, and wound up with lotion all over everything in the bag.  I had to throw the bottle away.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced Maui Babe to me in Hawaii where they have a home but was not able to get it here until I found it on Amazon.  You get color immediately upon application and turn brown and the after sun is new to me and worked so well that I could even put it on my face. Please still use a 30 or higher sunscreen uva/uvb product.  There is no protection here so I apply zinc 1st then a light coat of MB over the top and reapply sunscreen as required.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product. I got a great tan with the suntan lotion and browning lotion. I usually don&#x27;t tan well.</li>
    <li> First of all, I received the package and they had not taped the lids down.  Somewhere along the line the lid on the tanning lotion became loose and leaked all over the body lotion.  I also feel ripped off because I only received the tanner and the moisturizing lotion!  The third bottle was missing!  For the price, it is a rip off!  Next time I will buy this directly from the company who makes it!</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to receive this product so I tried it out immediately!  I took it to the beach and used it when I was laying out in my yard at home.  First off, this stuff STINKS!  Some of the people on these reviews talk about how great it smells but I disagree!  It does have a coffee-ish smell and I LOVE coffee but I certainly do not want to smell like a cup of joe when I am trying to tan.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not go on smooth.  It clumped up on my skin.  I tried exfoliating before I used it the next time and it still clumped up and would not rub in.&lt;br /&gt;I could have gotten past those issues had the product worked but it did not.  When I returned the pack to Maui Babe I did not receive on penny back from my purchase and they refused to ship it back out to me so I could give it away.  My email from them said that the product had been destroyed since it was already open.  Clearly they do not give any sort of guarantee of their product.  I will never waste my money on anything form them again!</li>
    <li> Gives the perfect color with protection!</li>
    <li> LOVE these products!  Used with sunscreen this summer and did NOT get burned at all, but instead got a long-lasting, even tan!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, found the best value here and in. Las Vegas. I recomend it for a great long lasting tan</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, however you must make sure to use the sunscreen with it. It gives you a nice glow.</li>
    <li> The best stuff for a delicious tan!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly awesome. At first I was not sure about this trio but I am happy I ordered it. Protects my skin from sunburn gives it a glowing tan and moisturizers nicely after taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is. The tanning lotion is brown so when I wore my white bikini I had to be slightly careful to not stain it. But the little bit of lotion which eventually rubbed off on my clothing easily washed out. So it wasn&#x27;t really a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;It gives you an amazing tan.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent. ( moisturizer) the tanning lotion smells like coffee.</li>
    <li> Awesome products !  I am not a lifelong customer.</li>
    <li> Great product I love it and have turned other people on to it so now every one asks me which tanning products I use and the answer is always the same &amp;#34;Maui Babe&amp;#34; products!</li>
    <li> This lotion is all about getting the perfect golden tan .  We layered with this product -- first with the no. 30 sunscreen by the same line and then with the non- SPF version .  We have never been browner without burning .  The coffee smell was appealing and inspite of the color, did not appear to stain the skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great, makes skin feel smooth after use</li>
    <li> On vacation in Oahu, I found this in a Resort gift shop.  The bronzer goes on brown so you feel tan just applying it, and it smells wonderful!  The spf 30 is a bit on the oily side for those used to lotions, but compliments the bronzer wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I really like this set, but had an odd issue...  I bought this set for a beach vacation. I tried the browning lotion both on it&#x27;s own and over the sunscreen. While I did get some good color (I&#x27;m very pale and don&#x27;t tan easily), application was a bit complicated with this stuff. One of the ingredients in the browning lotion made my skin peel up... as in, unless I had JUST exfoliated my entire body rigorously, I&#x27;d get little clumps of dead skin cells while trying to spread the lotion. I could put the sunscreen on just fine. I could use the after lotion just fine. But every time I used the browning lotion... it was just.. well.. gross. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any kind of lotion/bronzer/sunscreen before. Anyone else have this issue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO recommend this, though. It smells good and will give you great results. Just make sure you exfoliate and dry off well before applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times (4 to 6) and I did notice a difference at all.  I bought it on a great recommendation from my friend so I am hoping over the next summer I will be able to use it more and update my review.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t just for females. I&#x27;m a male who doesn&#x27;t tan easily, and on my vacation to Puerto Rico and St. Kitts, I tried this out, and I got tanned in roughly 3 days. I like the fact that it comes with all 3, and the one for after sun, keeps your tan without the struggles of peeling. I can&#x27;t wait for next summer so I can get my tan on again!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Maui Babe is wonderful and does everything it says.  Leaves you soft and brown.</li>
    <li> Ok lotion, doesn&#x27;t get you as tan as you would think. It is also greasy. Overall not too bad. The smell is bad at first too but after soaking in the sun for about 30 mins. Overall its just ok.</li>
    <li> It works well and smells good but be aware that it is very greasy and you should have freshly clean legs before applying it.</li>
    <li> came broken and I had to return it</li>
    <li> best lotion you will ever use!</li>
    <li> The browning lotion helps you get a darker tan but the ingredients stink, literally and figuratively.  Not only do these lotions smell bad, they are full of parabens and mineral oil.</li>
    <li> Browning lotion leaves brown residue. This lotion works but left embarrassing marks on the cabana chair towel.</li>
    <li> very good product i would reccomend to others it def wrks if ur white or light skin u will have a beautiful tan if ur on vacation or kings island disney world a water park all day with this on wow youll be flawless even looks good on a light brown person it wrks i found out bout it at kings island i ask a lady wht she used and ths it waht she tld me she was white lady it look like she had on a pretty color coffee stockings</li>
    <li> I love this line of products. The browning lotion is awesome- works quickly and tan lasts long. The coffee smell is wonderful. There will be a brown residue if you sweat, but it does not stain. The after browning lotion is a dream- I will slather it on after tanning in the sun all day, and I did not burn or peel. In the future, I will by twice the amount of this lotion. I also like the fact that you can use the browning lotion and sun block together. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our dental hygienist as a great product that she swears by.  We utilized it while in Jamaica.  It did tan us out more, but still didn&#x27;t stop from burning.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product but I didn&#x27;t really have the results everybody else is claiming to haveI have very pale skin and when I use the lotion it does work but it doesn&#x27;t give me a brown color or even a tan color  others are reporting to get I do feel protected when I use The sunscreen and it smells great!! I Will try again next summer</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion. This lotion worked really fast with a nice dark brown tan. I highly recommend this to everyone who wants a good lotion.</li>
    <li> It works great, tans a nice deep brown, and smells like chocolate.  What more could you want?  This product is excellent.</li>
    <li> I bought Maui babe while on vacation in Maui (2013) and loved it! You DO receive results when using the browning lotion along with the other lotions. The smell is wonderful as well.I was so glad to see amazon carried this product since I was headed to Mexico this year and I had used up all of my Maui babe lotions last summer. You will notice that after you apply the browning lotion then the tanning lotion your towel may turn a brown color. No big deal, I thought I would mention it. Next trip is FL in a month and my Maui babe is already packed!</li>
    <li> The browning lotion, and after sun were awesome, but the sunscreen was gross. It came off and would ball up. So I started using regular sunscreen and the other two and they worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> As a women of color who loves to tan and soak in the sun and good tanning lotion is important. I&#x27;ve used this product incorrectly before and had first degree burns on my face. This time I used it with the sunblock and after tanning lotion and there were a few positive and negatives. First, I didn&#x27;t burn, which was great however I didn&#x27;t get as dark as I would have liked either. The best part about the product is I had little to no peeling which was awesome. Overall all good product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> I came across the browning lotion in a local supermarket by chance early this past summer, so I purchased it to give it a try. Never in my wildest thoughts did I think a browning lotion which smelled so bad that it actually repelled the flies at the beach, would work as well as it did to tan my already olive toned skin. The only way I could describe the odor is like strong coffee, but, Maui Babe browning lotion works very well. As far as the sunscreen, my husband loved the scent, and the fact that he didn&#x27;t burn like he normally does. I loved the after sun moisturizing lotion. My skin was soft, and I loved the scent. I found the scent of the after sun lotion to be like that of tropical flowers. My husband didn&#x27;t use it, as it was a very feminine scent. He loved the scent on me though. I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love Maui babe! Have not used it yet!</li>
    <li> I thought the browning lotion was FABULOUS but would not buy the other 2 again as they were not any better than any other product I can get locally. But the browning lotion REALLY worked!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and this is the only product that gives me a tan. I&#x27;m tanned in a day! Great smell too!</li>
    <li> I did not even get a chance to try this product, because they only sent me half of the products instead of the whole set. Had to send it back and just went and bought the browning lotion at my local Ulta store and will use with my own 30 spf sunblock. Highly disappointed since I bought this for my beach trip.</li>
    <li> Maui Babe is a great product and i&#x27;ve used it for years. You really get that nice Maui Tan! without looking like you fake and baked</li>
    <li> Overall a great sun tanning package. Nice smell. However, I found that the browning lotion caused my skin to breakout and had to stop using.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I was told about this lotion by a friend and npw I recommend it to everyone! Works amazing and leaves a long lasting tan!</li>
