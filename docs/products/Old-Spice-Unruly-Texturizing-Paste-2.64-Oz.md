      <li>Nice hair care product.  </li>
      <li>People have also commented on liking the smell, which is nice but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>and it smells nice too, hey</li>
      <li>(WHY???), it has a kind of nice generically citrusy dad-like smell.</li>

      <li>but so far, its been the best product ive used.</li>
      <li>Best paste I have found so far.</li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for this product to do anything more or differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The bonus is that they are telling me it lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>and they all love this product).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that most &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; type hair products do that as well</li>
      <li>I love using texturizing paste instead of hair gel.</li>
      <li>It holds me air better than the Axe product did as well.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re jumping out of bed and applying this paste to a bed head, you will have to use more product.  </li>
      <li>I like it alot more than the Axe product.</li>
      <li>Of the 5-6 varieties that I tried, this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that, I guess.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty good, too.</li>
      <li>the hold it gives you is more than sufficient, but not intolerably strong...</li>
      <li>In that case, you work it through your hair, I find after shower wet hair is best, and then comb your hair to where you want it.</li>
      <li>cannot overstate how fortunate I am to have found a hair product that costs all of $5, and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
      <li>This Old Spice Unruly Texturizing Paste has a great &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It is also great for a more traditional look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pomade is easy to apply, and washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it does have a fairly strong scent.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky to the touch, hold your hairstyle without having a &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, and doesn&#x27;t have too strong of an odor.  </li>
      <li>like that it is light, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that this one clumps the hair in strand bundles quite as effectively as the original Garnier product (first link)</li>
      <li>but that wasn&#x27;t terribly important to me.</li>
      <li>It has a medium to light hold -</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not take much to get a nice, styled look.</li>
      <li>It fixes my hair calm and helps not to fizzy for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it rinses off my hands (and my hair) quickly and easily</li>
      <li>This is a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure of how I felt about its concept when I first received it.</li>
      <li>The Old Spice Unruly Texturizing Paste has a pleasant, modern scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and disappears fairly quickly after use.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I get it, but personally would prefer a more neutral scent (or none at all).</li>
      <li>It is a good paste if you have short hair.  </li>
      <li>Wears out quickly during the day.</li>
      <li>main ingredients (I guess that you find them in most hair care products) freak me out: Mineral Oil, Petrolatum, Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Propylene Glycol, Carnauba Wax, Polyglyceryl-3 Dicitrate, Paraffin, Lanolin Wax, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Aminomethyl Propanol, PVP, Microcrystalline Wax, Dmdm Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Synthetic Wax, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Polyethylene, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used odorless or mild smelling hair product</li>
      <li>I found this paste not too long ago in the store and immediately loved how it worked - it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair as sticky as some of the pastes..  </li>
      <li>paste has a nice smell, not too strong, and it dissipates after drying, so it will not fight with other product smells, and you are not going to be a walking perfume factory.</li>
      <li>My son and his messy spike were happy.</li>
      <li>those looking for a powerful hold of some sort, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
      <li>I know nothing about hair products, so take that opinion for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light, clean scent without being sticky or too stiff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love it more with about half the scent, but other than this, it&#x27;s just a good not-so-aggressive hair tamer.  </li>
      <li>For my personal needs/tastes, this is hands down the best hair styling product i&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
      <li>and I can shape my hair to stand straight up or to do battle with a natural growth pattern, quickly and easily.  </li>
      <li>One jar will likely last you quite a while, since you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, I don&#x27;t think it did a great job of styling my hair.  </li>
      <li>Unlike Suavecito, this old spice paste doesnt come off my hands that easy</li>
      <li>this product better addresses those issues than any hair product i&#x27;ve ever tried, including the entire line of (IMO) overpriced Crew</li>
      <li>This stuff really helps!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have enough hold and tended to show more scalp that I like.</li>
      <li>One note is I have thinning hair and in some areas it seems to make the bald spots a bit more obvious.</li>
      <li>Again, it does exactly what it&#x27;s designed for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>first)</li>
      <li>I went back to get more, but they ran out, so I found these on-line and purchased.</li>
      <li>exactly what I&#x27;m trying to avoid.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming for those that might think that while reading my last sentence.</li>
      <li>The end result is pretty similar, but the package is more convenient.</li>
      <li>The scent is not entirely unlike one of my favorite perfumes ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a little much for my taste, but as a hair product it does a good job.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge fan of huge containers that don&#x27;t provide more product.</li>
      <li>It smells great, is subtle, and is very inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>This has a mild scent - not even close to the often overpowering Axe scent or the Old Spice stuff</li>
      <li>Not as strong of hold as advertised or to my liking (compared to similar products).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a small box of texturizing paste, about 2.7 Oz that comes in a container of 6.7 x 6.7 x 5.8 inches. I use this once a day in the morning when I get ready to go for work. I rub a small amount in hands and run through semi-damp hair. It does not stick as hard as gel; but be sure to use small amount of paste. The product does not smell much as few other products I have used. Overall, it gives a textured finish and medium hold. I have rated three stars for overall satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Nice hair care product.  This is a medium hold, so it didn&#x27;t work as well with my finer hair as it did for my teenage son who is blessed with his mother&#x27;s thicker hair.  The medium hold leaves hair a bit wavy and flexible - perfect for those whose hair doesn&#x27;t need as much help.  The scent is nice, too - kind of light, and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair somewhere between very short and short, so I don&#x27;t often need hair gel/cream/paste/mousse/etc.  However, I&#x27;ve recently let it grow a little longer and this Old Spice Texturizing Paste is a fantastic product: inexpensive and does the job, holds all day, doesn&#x27;t flake, and has a the classic Old Spice scent (but very faint, especially after an hour or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste is a cream-colored product and I found only a very small amount is necessary, making it very competitively priced.  It&#x27;s not sticky and it rinses off my hands (and my hair) quickly and easily and I can shape my hair to stand straight up or to do battle with a natural growth pattern, quickly and easily.  If you&#x27;re jumping out of bed and applying this paste to a bed head, you will have to use more product.  If you&#x27;re using it on freshly washed hair, less is more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  It smells great, is subtle, and is very inexpensive.  Old Spice really got it right.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works well. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that, I guess. My son and his messy spike were happy.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I wasn&#x27;t sure of how I felt about its concept when I first received it. I don&#x27;t often make my hair unruly on purpose but for those who do, this is a very good product. It isn&#x27;t as stiff feeling as many sculpting or spiking gels but it does put your hair exactly where you want it it to be controlled. If you like the messed hair look it won&#x27;t let you down. It is also great for a more traditional look. In that case, you work it through your hair, I find after shower wet hair is best, and then comb your hair to where you want it. I find it great for when I want an alternative to my hair spray. That being said, I found that after a comb through this product left my hair slightly more stiff than when I used my hair spray but that wasn&#x27;t terribly important to me. I like its fragrance. It&#x27;s masculine but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair.  I received the Old Spice Spiffy Pomade to review, and this is promised to offer medium hold with a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;The product has a decent smell which reminds me of the Axe-type odors you see targeted at the younger generation.  It has somewhat of an apple odor to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pomade is easy to apply, and washes off easily.  It doesn&#x27;t feel too sticky.  One jar will likely last you quite a while, since you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, I don&#x27;t think it did a great job of styling my hair.  It didn&#x27;t have enough hold and tended to show more scalp that I like.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is a little much for my taste, but as a hair product it does a good job. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out and turn dusty or flakey, it continues looking good for hours, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> This has a mild scent - not even close to the often overpowering Axe scent or the Old Spice stuff almost every guy used to use. The stuff is white and looks like a thick skin cream. I found that it works best when my hair is damp - I have naturally very curly hair. Applying when my hair is dry accents my curls - exactly what I&#x27;m trying to avoid. Applying when the hair is damp (not wet) works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mild hold, not glossy or &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; like many other hair gels.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Axe Messy haircare product, but I am definitely switching to this &amp;#34;texturizing paste&amp;#34;.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky to the touch, hold your hairstyle without having a &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, and doesn&#x27;t have too strong of an odor.  The only drawback is that the tub is a little large for travel (or for your gym toiletry kit), but you could scoop out and place the product into a smaller jar for this purpose.</li>
    <li> The Old Spice Unruly Texturizing Paste has a pleasant, modern scent that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and disappears fairly quickly after use. The paste isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy to the touch. It has a light hold and slight glossy look on the hair. It is great for a casual styled look, and makes the hair more manageable without the wet, rigid look of a traditional mega hold gel that is immediately noticeable. I can still comb my hair casually after use without ruining the look.  A little dab of this goes a long way. The only problem with this paste is if you apply too much, it will leave a white appearance on the hair and it will take some time and effort to rub it in. If you prefer a light hold and a casual look, this is a good product to try out.</li>
    <li> Pleasant, manly smell and provides good textured appearance.</li>
    <li> The hold on this is decent but I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it still gives me hair a slightly greasy look and feel.</li>
    <li> It is a good paste if you have short hair.  It fixes my hair calm and helps not to fizzy for many hours.&lt;br /&gt;But it does not do the best job when your hair is longer than about 2 inches. It holds well enough but you may not able to set your hairs in many different styles.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it allowed me to sculpt my hair any way I wanted and it had holding power. I did not like that it was too heavy for my hair leaving my hair looking weighed down with the way I like to comb my hair. I just needed something to control my hair and make it lay down and quick sticking up. This paste was overkill for me but would likely work for someone looking to sculpt their hair and make it stand up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Axe and expensive American Crew products for years. I never really found the look I wanted until I tried Old Spice Unruly. My hair isn&#x27;t too shiny or filled with gel like some other products. It stays the way I want for the day and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Would not recommend for really short hair.</li>
    <li> It smells great and leaves hair in great shape</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Makes my hair look great and have received many compliments since using it. One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Best paste I have found so far. Good hold, but not too strong that my hair doesn&#x27;t move.</li>
    <li> great product just if it is in a prime pantry box it seems to get broken open and makes a big mess.  I had to through other things away like a 28 lb box of cat sand that was in with it that is prob what broke it open</li>
    <li> A year or two ago I tried Garnier Surf Hair and really liked it. It makes that matte messy look that looks a little styled and a little crazy/free, without being oily, crunchy, or shiny. It&#x27;s been quite some time since there has been another product that has a similar weight and function, and this is the second product that I&#x27;ve found that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Garnier product (http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Fructis-Style-Texture-Paste/dp/B004ZWMDZ4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390060828&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;garnier+surf+hair) recently changed their container to be larger (http://www.amazon.com/Garnier-Fructis-Style-Surfer-Power/dp/B00BV80SIE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390060828&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;garnier+surf+hair) though there is no more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge fan of huge containers that don&#x27;t provide more product. So I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that this one clumps the hair in strand bundles quite as effectively as the original Garnier product (first link) but I also think the new bottle isn&#x27;t quite the same either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in the sun drenched beach tossed hair look, this and the Garnier product are both good ones to try, and this one doesn&#x27;t fake you out with a large container with lots of free space in it.</li>
    <li> I have twin 13 year old boys that are really into how their hair looks (finally!).  They like a gel/cream that holds their hair in place throughout the day but doesn&#x27;t appear or feel sticky, wet or crunchy.  We&#x27;ve tried so many products and have yet to find the PERFECT product yet!  This Old Spice Unruly Texturizing Paste has a great &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; fragrance but after applying the product it leaves a dull look to the hair.  I&#x27;ve found that most &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; type hair products do that as well so I didn&#x27;t expect anything different from this one.  After a full day at school their hair looked dull and limp.  It didn&#x27;t leave the sticky, wet or crunchy look but it also didn&#x27;t hold their hair in place.  We&#x27;ll continue to give this a try but from the onset we were disappointed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use hair products a lot, but occasionally I like to sculpt my hair just a little...to get the look I like. It&#x27;s really hard to find a good hair product since most have significant flaking, create a wet look, or dry rock hard for a 1987 vibe. Not this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is light, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t flake. The hold is pretty strong (but not on a level of true sculpting) and it dries naturally, not with a hard look. However, it does create body and holds the hair in place. Also, the price is good and it only takes a little to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have a fairly strong scent. It fades over time, but still remains there. Honestly, I get it, but personally would prefer a more neutral scent (or none at all). Still, as hair products go, I can recommend this one.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m not the target user of this product. At all. I am a small middle-aged mixed-race curly-haired woman, and I got this thinking, well, if t doesn&#x27;t work for me I can kick it down to my 30-something pompadoured housemate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is AWESOME. A small dab rubbed through wet hair gives me near-perfect curl definition, and instead of the cloying barf-o-matic sweet perfumes so often found in women&#x27;s hair products, especially hair products for women of color (WHY???), it has a kind of nice generically citrusy dad-like smell. I really don&#x27;t mind if my hair smells like my dad, that&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used hair spray, mousse, gel, wax, and such in my hair through the years, and Old Spice Unruly Texturizing Paste ranks up there with my favorite of these products (I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s very similar in both application and behavior to Axe Control Cream though the Axe product results in a &amp;#34;crustier&amp;#34; hold). It holds as firmly as a hair spray while being easy to apply with your hands like hair gel. It results in a nice look, if I may say so myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2.64 oz size means that you can take in your carry-on baggage for a plane flight - it slips under the TSA&#x27;s 3.4 oz limit for liquids and gels. That&#x27;s helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and just a bit - a drop - is needed to style my hair. Consequently, one jar of the stuff lasts me quite a while.</li>
    <li> For my personal needs/tastes, this is hands down the best hair styling product i&#x27;ve ever used...I have pretty long hair for a guy, and it gets awful curly in some places...my main issues are keeping it out of my face and keeping it from looking flat/textureless.... this product better addresses those issues than any hair product i&#x27;ve ever tried, including the entire line of (IMO) overpriced Crew products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; is a white lotion-like substance (a little thicker than lotion, really) that is easy to apply through even thick, long hair (just dampen it a bit first)...the hold it gives you is more than sufficient, but not intolerably strong...it will give your hair a nice subtle sheene and texture, but will not make it hard, dry and crusty like the Crew/Axe styling products will...lasts all day for me, and holds up well to sweat/humidity...rinses out just fine with water...smells real nice...Also, super versatile; my roomate has short straight hair, I have long wavy hair, and we both use Unruly exclusively.  As far as drawbacks go, from my perspective, there are none.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t ask for this product to do anything more or differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot overstate how fortunate I am to have found a hair product that costs all of $5, and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve encountered.  No doubt this is a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> I bought this at walmart and ive been using it for the past week before writing a review on here. First off, it has a great scent and it stays without throughout the day, which is good. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming for those that might think that while reading my last sentence. I reduced one star to the rating because it has very minimal hold. It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair (I don&#x27;t spike it up, I do a comb over). I reduced the second star because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; to my taste. Before giving this paste a try I was using Suavecito pomade and I really liked it because it was so easy to wash off. Unlike Suavecito, this old spice paste doesnt come off my hands that easy and I actually need soap to wash off the oil. Its not horrible where you cant grip an object, but it is there. I guess it helps with the shine, which is good and not too shiny. I dont work for Suavecito but so far, its been the best product ive used. You guys should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Men&#x27;s hair paste that is subtle yet works on thin or thick hair. Not too thick for my fine hair but it hold&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s wiry hair.  It is very lightly and pleasantly scented.</li>
    <li> I got this for my young son who likes Old Spice products, but he didn&#x27;t like this paste because it clumps too much.  His hair is about 3-4 inches long in places, and this stuff is just too hard to comb through.  I was hoping he would like this paste as an alternative to hair gel, but maybe he&#x27;s not willing to put the effort in to get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short, and this stuff works well for me, but I have a thick set of hair, and so this paste doesn&#x27;t actually fix any problems for me.</li>
    <li> When I put it in my hair my penis size increased by 4 inches</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps! I LUV it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve attached a photo of myself wearing the Unruly paste about 3 hours after showering and applying after the gym. I recently stumbled upon this product after having loved a few similar products, my favorite being the Redken Men&#x27;s Molding Paste. I appreciated that it was FAR cheaper than the designer equivalents, and even somewhat cheaper than Dove &amp; other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not take much to get a nice, styled look. I Included a picture because I wanted it to be obvious that this product is the glossy style. I always apply with damp hands and damp hair - so you may be able to get a more matte finish with dry hair &amp; hands, but I&#x27;d be afraid you might be able to see some of the white paste if you don&#x27;t take a lot of time to rub it in. In any case, if you&#x27;re not after the glossy finish, Old Spice clearly labels their products to indicate, and there is a different variation to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells quite similar if not the same as my Old Spice Fiji collection. The scent is not overwhelming and fades considerably once it dries, but I find it to be pleasant enough to prefer it to unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my Redken paste, this stuff is less pasty/sticky and more waxy, but still with somewhat of a pasty texture. It is definitely easiest applied with wet hands. It has a medium to light hold - your hair gets slightly stiff but still somewhat flexible. If your hair gets messed up through the day, you can always dampen hands and refresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, I have not experienced the dreadful white flakes that you get with cheap gel products. Even if I try and rub the product out dry, there is no flaking - my hands just get a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product. I will continue to leave it in my gym bag, and when my other products run out at home, will likely be buying one of these for the bathroom!</li>
    <li> I use this paste daily. I like it because its a good value. The hold is lighter than described.</li>
    <li> My husband used this on his hair to keep the curls in place throughout the day and that it did.  He didn&#x27;t make or want his hair to be unruly, which is what this product is really for.  He is Puerto Rican with very curly, jet-black hair.  To me, this product really made his hair look CURLY like each individual curl had its own definition. Normally when he uses product in his hair, all the curls are together in an almost uniform way.  It made his hair a bit crunchy and dry, not soft to the touch at all.  Personally, I loved it, the mass of wild curls, but for the man who wants something to tame his hair, this is not it!</li>
    <li> I used to use L&#x27;Oreal Hair Putty but it became difficult to find. That&#x27;s when I began testing the offerings from Axe and Old Spice. Of the 5-6 varieties that I tried, this is my favorite. It allows my hair to be styled while still appearing natural. It smells pretty good, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve appropriated this container of \\&quot;texturizing\\&quot; paste because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) it seems to closely resemble other \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; or gender-neutral products that approximate a \\&quot;messy\\&quot; look; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) My husband won&#x27;t touch it.  He has a general aversions to scented products, right down to his laundry detergents and fabric softener.  Well, a girl can try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is a pretty decent product.  The scent is not entirely unlike one of my favorite perfumes ([[ASIN:B001O0HP7Q Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Dead Sexy No. 6 Parfum]]), but I guess that&#x27;s really to say that \\&quot;DS\\&quot; is kinda like Old Spice, a fragrance that has been around forever.  In any case, the scent dissipates for me considerably after 30 minutes to an hour.  If I have to jump right out of bed and rush out of the house, I don&#x27;t use it, as it would be embarrassing to smell that much of Old Spice.  Otherwise, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is enough to tame crazy curly hair a bit, while leaving a natural-looking bit of unruliness, but not really firm or \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; - if I&#x27;m trying to keep the shape of a style, other product or hairspray is still needed.  It&#x27;s really neither glossy nor dulling, and that&#x27;s what I prefer, as opposed to the product calling itself out visually.  It&#x27;s a good choice for my own wavy-to-curly (depending on humidity) chin length hair, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have yet triggered my skin allergies.  And it&#x27;s \\&quot;neat\\&quot; - if you&#x27;ve ever gotten the creepy crawlies from product residue on the skin, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ad copy for this product had me half thinking that it would make hair stand on end 1980s style or weigh down to make hair look filthy dirty as is today popular - for some unfathomable reason - on some of the trendiest catwalks.  Yeah, give me some of THAT, and also some dark circles under my eyes; I&#x27;m auditioning to be an extra on \\&quot;The Walking Dead\\&quot;.  Not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love it more with about half the scent, but other than this, it&#x27;s just a good not-so-aggressive hair tamer.  A product like this is always helpful in dry, static-y winter or under conditions of high humidity, for persons of either gender.ressive hair tamer.  A product like this is always helpful in dry, static-y winter or under conditions of high humidity, for persons of either gender.</li>
    <li> The man in the family likes that it keeps his hair tossled but not messy. Once it drys (about 15+ minutes) the scent can&#x27;t be detected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredients (I guess that you find them in most hair care products) freak me out: Mineral Oil, Petrolatum, Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Propylene Glycol, Carnauba Wax, Polyglyceryl-3 Dicitrate, Paraffin, Lanolin Wax, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Aminomethyl Propanol, PVP, Microcrystalline Wax, Dmdm Hydantoin, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Synthetic Wax, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Polyethylene, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer -</li>
    <li> I found this paste not too long ago in the store and immediately loved how it worked - it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair as sticky as some of the pastes..  I went back to get more, but they ran out, so I found these on-line and purchased. them.  I hope that this isn&#x27;t being discontinued, because I finally found one I like!</li>
    <li> Got this for my teenage son but now my younger son, adult son AND husband use it, too. It has a nice light, clean scent without being sticky or too stiff. I will be buying more. They all like it because it doesn&#x27;t irritate, flake or look &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;-ly/shiny. The bonus is that they are telling me it lasts most of the day. Works well on short to longer hair (each of my boys have hair that is 1/2&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34; long and they all love this product). As mom &amp; wife, I like the smell &amp; look of the product, the fact that all my boys like it, and the price! WILL be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Certainly holds hair with a nice subtle and not overly greasy feel. The fragrance is slight and certainly not objectionable and will not threaten any man card. Seems to hold all day long. One note is I have thinning hair and in some areas it seems to make the bald spots a bit more obvious. Your mileage will certainly vary.</li>
    <li> Old Spice has nailed its product purpose on this one. The Unruly Paste does the effortless bedhead look, and does it well. But make sure this is the look you&#x27;re going for because, while this paste does the chunk quite well, it would be difficult to work with if you are expecting a more controlled outcome. Again, it does exactly what it&#x27;s designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me was the overbearing scent. I know that scent is a personal choice, but the scent of this paste if powerfully pungent. As in other people will definitely notice that you are emitting a scent. This fact limits the opportunities that I will reasonably be able to utilize this paste to wide open spaces. I believe it would be unfair to innocent bystanders to wear this paste in an environment in which it might encroach upon the airspace of others.</li>
    <li> I love using texturizing paste instead of hair gel. The end result is pretty similar, but the package is more convenient. And since it&#x27;s not a liquid, you can put this in your carry-on luggage without having to put it in a clear plastic bag; or put it in your check-in baggage without worrying about the air pressure pushing your hair gel out and making a big mess. And, one little can will last you a long time--my guess is 3-4 months, at least, since you only need a tiny little bit each day.</li>
    <li> The packaging is quite nice. The Old Spice red works well with this shape and size, easy for your medicine cabinet or travel. The texture of the white paste feels similar to a pomade. It quickly melts into your hand for use in your hair for a low-medium hold with a subtle shine. I have thicker hair so this didn&#x27;t give me the hold or styling capabilities I typically need when my hair is longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the biggest problem with this product is essentially a matter of preference. I&#x27;ve always used odorless or mild smelling hair product so I&#x27;ve never really noticed the smell but after using this product, that smell lingers on until you can wash it off. If you like the smell of Old Spice and want your hair to smell like that, then I guess it&#x27;s a non-issue. But for me, I hadn&#x27;t realized how unsettling and distracting it was to constantly smell what my mind compartmentalizes only as deodorant throughout my entire day. I guess you could use less product to get less fragrance but then you&#x27;ll get less hold so I&#x27;m not sure how to get around that problem.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Axe messy look styling gel and then i got this. I like it alot more than the Axe product. It has a much pleasanter scent which lasts longer. It isnt an overpowering scent in my opinion. It is a pasty white wax substance, less viscous than the Axe product. It holds me air better than the Axe product did as well. I would highly recommend this</li>
    <li> The paste is medium hold, it is not designed to make stiff spikes, as well as it is not for wet or sleek style. It is indeed for &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; look. It works quite well, and leaves the hair feeling and looking nice. You only need a tiny amount - rub it between your palms first, and then apply to hair.&lt;br /&gt;The paste has a nice smell, not too strong, and it dissipates after drying, so it will not fight with other product smells, and you are not going to be a walking perfume factory.</li>
    <li> Not as strong of hold as advertised or to my liking (compared to similar products).  Wears out quickly during the day.</li>
    <li> I use this product in my beard.  I have a very bushy, long beard, and like to keep the friz down, and this seems to do the trick.  People have also commented on liking the smell, which is nice but not overpowering.  The lack of frizz-i-ness seems to last for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for a powerful hold of some sort, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  I know nothing about hair products, so take that opinion for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Old Spice Unruly Texturizing Paste 2.64 Oz, 2.640-Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way this made my medium length hair a little unruly.  I took just a medium bit and rubbed my hands and the spread it through my damp hair. When it dried I had hair that was curled but not crispy. Good hold and it smells nice too, hey it’s Old Spice! I’m very happy with the results. I did not look like a greasy mess.</li>
