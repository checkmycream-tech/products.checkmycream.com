      <li>This stuff really works good!</li>
      <li>works better than prescription cortisone treatments.  </li>
      <li>Works better than cortisone cream to treat itchy hives.</li>
      <li>and  I like it more and more.</li>
      <li>I tried so many and even had to use cortisone while I was waiting for this to arrive.</li>
      <li>I started to realize that this seems to be more allergic reaction that is causing this acne.  </li>
      <li>Tea tree oil isn&#x27;t the most yummy of fragrances,  but it can&#x27;t be helped.  </li>
      <li>The scratch marks have gone much better.</li>
      <li>I hope you feel better soon.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>The tea tree smell is rather strong, so it&#x27;s better to be used at home</li>
      <li>This is a nice texture that moisturizes really well and is effective at stopping the itch.</li>
      <li>Works as good (or better than) calamine lotion for itchy, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is of strong mint.</li>
      <li>if you like that strong scent.</li>
      <li>it has a very strong scent(as tea tree always does), but the powerful relief makes it totally worth it!</li>
      <li>The scent of tea tree oil is light</li>
      <li>Pros: good for sensitive skin, children, bug bites, razor burn etc.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find a product that used natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best lotion for really itchy dry skin and also calms itching from insect bites.</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be sure, it smells strongly of tea-tree oil, so if you are not a fan of this particular aroma, be warned.  </li>
      <li>Smell is pretty strong, not bad, but strong.</li>
      <li>It is a light cream that is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Very cooling and refreshing.</li>
      <li>This lotion Relieves the most intense itching after leg shaving for her.</li>
      <li>Overall, good product.</li>
      <li>Have this particular lotion to be pretty effective for itch relief after application..</li>
      <li>When my skin is itchy and I&#x27;m trying to get lotion on quickly to stop the itch...</li>
      <li>I have severe eczema (since age 3) and have gone through many, many trials of different lotions, creams, ointments, cortisone treatments, etc.  </li>
      <li>Of all the the OTC products I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best, outshining other anti-itch lotions in terms of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you need a lotion that works fast and don&#x27;t mind strong smells</li>
      <li>most lotions i&#x27;ve tried help the dry, but leave my hands itching even more, even prescription cream.</li>
      <li>It is also a natural product which is very important for me.  </li>
      <li>Tea tree oil has a distinct odor but that disappears once the lotion dries on skin.  </li>
      <li>For being more of a natural product this works well to stop itching.</li>
      <li>Right off the bat, the pump doesn&#x27;t work, so I need to take the cap off and dump it onto my palm to apply.</li>
      <li>The pump is a nice addition, I usually have a tub of lotion, but this is more convenient.</li>
      <li>The smell is string at first but dissipates almost immediately and the soothing and antiseptic qualities of the tea tree are well worth any odor.</li>
      <li>send it to Philippines, told me they like it very much</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a personal preference thing.</li>
      <li>This lotion works the first day I applied</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll help later on when the rash is more faded, but it does not do a thing for me to stop any itching.</li>
      <li>This is the only lotion that my daughter has been able to use on her face.  </li>
      <li>My son has extremely dry skin on his hands and feet, all year, so you better believe I have tried everything.  </li>
      <li>Derma e products are very high quality</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this lotion.  </li>
      <li>She couldn&#x27;t shave her legs because of the intense itching.</li>
      <li>Really stops the itching from bug bites.</li>
      <li>When I use this, it really helps and I have tried everything.  </li>
      <li>but the tea leaves smell may be a bit too much for some.</li>
      <li>Even calamine lotion didn&#x27;t help as much as this did.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I guess I really like it.</li>
      <li>It takes only 26 seconds for something you put on your skin to get into your bloodstream, so it is important to read the labels of all your health care and beauty products.  </li>
      <li>I have an intense itchiness on my arms that is driving me nuts.  </li>
      <li>This relieves itching much better than any other OTC product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>It has a very strong smell but it fades after a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Just about the only thing that works well and quickly.</li>
      <li>It is the only things that provides relief and heals the problem quickly...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
      <li>WOW!!</li>
      <li>Only caution is the tea tree oil scent might be a little strong for some, but it goes away quickly, and is well worth the relief, especially during allergy season.</li>
      <li>The Drospirenone hormone made my daughter&#x27;s skin extremely dry and this lotion has helped tremendously with the dryness.  </li>
      <li>Gold bond itch relief lotion definitely works better at actually moisturizing which helps to actually prevent itchiness instead of just relieve it</li>
      <li>I got this product because I have very dry itchy patches of skin, the cream my doctor prescribed me really didn&#x27;t do much for me and would make the patches burn.</li>
      <li>All natural, so can be used as often as needed.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter because she has been suffering from acne for years and her skin is hyper sensitive and she allergic to anything that touches her face.  </li>
      <li>This really helped the itching and actually got rid of redness and inflammation when nothing else worked!</li>
      <li>I wanted to find something natural</li>
      <li>This lotion really does help me with the itching sensation and actually seems to calm down my skins inflammation.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not a typical fragrant lotion</li>
      <li>We have taken her off and put her on a normal low dosage non Drospirenone pill.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I have tried that actually completely eliminated the itch for the entire day.</li>
      <li>I have found it to be fairly decent bug repellant due to that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use this multiple times a day to keep my dry skin soft.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s thin enough that putting it on is soothing and the anti-itch factor is strong enough to relieve the wakes-me-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-my-hands-get-so-itchy feeling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My son has extremely dry skin on his hands and feet, all year, so you better believe I have tried everything.  He has to apply lotion several times a day to keep it from cracking and bleeding. Anyway, this product works great, however, if I put this product anywhere on his body besides his hands and feet, he has a reaction to it. His skin becomes red, and itchy. The smell is of strong mint. My son hates it, but it works well for the areas we need it to.</li>
    <li> This stuff does a great job of curbing the sever itching from eczema. It also calms the redness and bumps, the only downside is the pungent tea tree oil scent but the pros outweigh the cons here. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> This is the best non-cortisone anti-itch lotion! Great tea-tree smell....if you like that strong scent. It didn&#x27;t bother me once I used it and it soothed the itch from hives. I tried so many and even had to use cortisone while I was waiting for this to arrive. I will continue to use and recommend this product. I am sold!</li>
    <li> i have chronic excema on my hands and they get excessively dry and itchy. most lotions i&#x27;ve tried help the dry, but leave my hands itching even more, even prescription cream. this lotion is my savior! it&#x27;s thin enough that putting it on is soothing and the anti-itch factor is strong enough to relieve the wakes-me-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-my-hands-get-so-itchy feeling. it has a very strong scent(as tea tree always does), but the powerful relief makes it totally worth it! truely awesome!!</li>
    <li> I have an intense itchiness on my arms that is driving me nuts.  When I use this, it really helps and I have tried everything.  Even calamine lotion didn&#x27;t help as much as this did.  I am using it daily and it seems to be lessening the itching every day.</li>
    <li> I have contact dermatitis and this lotion helps a lot with the itching.  Very cooling and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I have found that stops the itch of atopic dermatitis (eczema) and treats it at the same time. I hope Amazon will put this back on prime and also subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Just about the only thing that works well and quickly. Given the personal nature of itchy skin, you have to go through several different solutions to find what works for you. I&#x27;ve been through several and I find this is what works for me. Other than the smell, which isn&#x27;t terrible, just not pleasant, it&#x27;s a good value and I&#x27;ve purchased it several times. I hope you feel better soon.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works good!</li>
    <li> The smell is awful and is unbearable to me........</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have very dry itchy patches of skin, the cream my doctor prescribed me really didn&#x27;t do much for me and would make the patches burn. I wanted to find something natural so I bought this. It really is great. Wish there was bigger bottle!!</li>
    <li> Helps me.  I have eczema and severe dry skin.  Sometimes I feel like scratching my skin off, but once I got this product it is not as bad.</li>
    <li> Have this particular lotion to be pretty effective for itch relief after application..</li>
    <li> This definitely works immediately to stop itching associated with very dry skin and/or excema, I however do not think it actually does anything to moisturize it&#x27;s just that the tingling from the tea tree oil helps to treat the itchiness.  Gold bond itch relief lotion definitely works better at actually moisturizing which helps to actually prevent itchiness instead of just relieve it temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion also smells pretty bad, unless you like the smell of tea tree oil of course.  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just a personal preference thing.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this lotion. She couldn&#x27;t shave her legs because of the intense itching. This lotion Relieves the most intense itching after leg shaving for her. It smells very strong because of the tea tree oil but she doesn&#x27;t mind it. But it&#x27;s not a typical fragrant lotion so don&#x27;t expect that.</li>
    <li> I break out in hives every day.  It&#x27;s a combination of things...being allergic to my dog AND to my own sweat.  I choose not to take medications for this problem, which means I have to deal with intense itching on a regular basis, and as a result will try any skin-care product that purports to alleviate this annoying condition.  Of all the the OTC products I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best, outshining other anti-itch lotions in terms of performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, it smells strongly of tea-tree oil, so if you are not a fan of this particular aroma, be warned.  Me, I could care less as long as it didn&#x27;t reek of sulfur.  I cared about the results and the results were good.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again, especially as the warmer months approach.</li>
    <li> This lotion does work well as I&#x27;ve had this odd itching problem for the past for weeks but the tea leaves smell may be a bit too much for some. I wish there was a way for others to smell it before buying but sadly technology its that far yet, if you&#x27;ve ever had an herbal tea or smelled a tea leaf then thats basically the smell you&#x27;ll get. If you need a lotion that works fast and don&#x27;t mind strong smells then this is for you, if not I&#x27;d recommend Aveeno&#x27;s anti itch lotions.</li>
    <li> All natural, so can be used as often as needed. Only caution is the tea tree oil scent might be a little strong for some, but it goes away quickly, and is well worth the relief, especially during allergy season.</li>
    <li> For being more of a natural product this works well to stop itching. It has a very strong smell but it fades after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful anti-itch lotion. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This relieves itching much better than any other OTC product I&#x27;ve tried.  Tea tree oil has a distinct odor but that disappears once the lotion dries on skin.  Wonderful product.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got bad eczema recently.  In between using prescribed steroid cream, I apply this to relieve the itch so I scratch less.  The less  I scratch, it allows the inflammation to heal.  The scratch marks have gone much better. The tea tree smell is rather strong, so it&#x27;s better to be used at home</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has been suffering from acne for years and her skin is hyper sensitive and she allergic to anything that touches her face.  I started to realize that this seems to be more allergic reaction that is causing this acne.  We found out that the birth control pill called YAZ and other YAZ brand names with Drospirenone synthetic hormones was actually causing her severe acne rosacea among other life threatening problems such as chest pains, kidney stones, etc.  We have taken her off and put her on a normal low dosage non Drospirenone pill.  This is the only lotion that my daughter has been able to use on her face.  The Drospirenone hormone made my daughter&#x27;s skin extremely dry and this lotion has helped tremendously with the dryness.  If you have acne or any other skin allergies or disorders, give this lotion a try.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really stops the itching from bug bites.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing!  It&#x27;s the best lotion for really itchy dry skin and also calms itching from insect bites.</li>
    <li> I had severe itching due to a combination of allergies that resulted in hives as well as dermatitis. I had been using hydrocortisone, Benadryl pills and the gel as well as ato help ease the relentless itching. I finally found this and it has been absolutely amazing. The smell is string at first but dissipates almost immediately and the soothing and antiseptic qualities of the tea tree are well worth any odor. I have not had to use anything else since and avoid the potentially dangerous side effects of habitually applying a steroid cream and or over using and anti histamine.</li>
    <li> I get flare ups or Ptyriosis Rosea and this works great to help with the annoying itch.</li>
    <li> To me and wife...the smell of this stuff STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;But it will stop your itch almost instantly.</li>
    <li> The *only* reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is the smell.  Tea tree oil isn&#x27;t the most yummy of fragrances,  but it can&#x27;t be helped.  That said, this lotion DOES help the itchies that come about by way of a bug bite or minor skin irritation. My granddaughter also uses the Bert&#x27;s Bees itch stick, and while it works well enough for bug bites, application is not necessarily easiest applying on larger areas. It&#x27;s a thin lotion, so use a sparingly initially. Best of all... it gets rid of the itch!</li>
    <li> There is no derma e product that I have used that does not do what it says it will do.  They started off with this line and now they have products for every skin type.  This is a great product.  Stops itch immediately.</li>
    <li> Derma e products are very high quality and I have used four different kinds of their lotions. This is a nice texture that moisturizes really well and is effective at stopping the itch. The pump is a nice addition, I usually have a tub of lotion, but this is more convenient. The scent of tea tree oil is light and  I like it more and more.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I know that will stop the itch immediately.  It is also a natural product which is very important for me.  Especially to use on my son with autism.</li>
    <li> seems help a lot for my itch skin, will recommend it.</li>
    <li> In the winter my legs get very dry and itchy.  This is the only product I have tried that actually completely eliminated the itch for the entire day.</li>
    <li> I uses this on the dry skin that my eczema produces.  It is a light cream that is quickly absorbed into the skin.  I use this multiple times a day to keep my dry skin soft.</li>
    <li> Pros: good for sensitive skin, children, bug bites, razor burn etc. I like the Tea Tree scent, but that&#x27;s not for everyone. I have found it to be fairly decent bug repellant due to that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: hmmm. Nope. I guess I really like it.</li>
    <li> I have severe eczema (since age 3) and have gone through many, many trials of different lotions, creams, ointments, cortisone treatments, etc.  This lotion really does help me with the itching sensation and actually seems to calm down my skins inflammation.  I still felt the need to add a thicker cream for longer lasting moisture,  but this is the norm&#x27; for me.  My skin sucks up even the thickest of creams. I applied it twice a day and I&#x27;m already to the bottom of the bottle.  Wish it came in a larger size and maybe not so pricey, but I recommend it to anyone with an itch to scratch.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this lotion.  He has very dry skin and has tried several other brands.  This one works the best.</li>
    <li> Derma E itch relief lotion is excellent for relieving the intense itch for the rash that I have.  It is called Bullous Pemphigoid.</li>
    <li> send it to Philippines, told me they like it very much</li>
    <li> This really helped the itching and actually got rid of redness and inflammation when nothing else worked! The very best.</li>
    <li> Have been suffering from fungus between the toes for a long time. Have always felt an urge to scratch the areas between the toes the moment I take off my shoes after a day&#x27;s work. Tried medication as prescribed by doctor but the itch would return once I stopped. Tried to use other brands of tea tree oil cream but they were not very effective in stopping the itch. This lotion works the first day I applied and I no longer felt the urge to scratch anymore. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works as good (or better than) calamine lotion for itchy, sensitive skin. Smell is pretty strong, not bad, but strong.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on my eczema.  It is the only things that provides relief and heals the problem quickly...works better than prescription cortisone treatments.  It relieves the itch, relieves the pain...it&#x27;s great stuff.  I was delighted to find a product that used natural ingredients.  It takes only 26 seconds for something you put on your skin to get into your bloodstream, so it is important to read the labels of all your health care and beauty products.  This is one items I don&#x27;t mind putting on my body...or in my bloodstream.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. Have used it to treat hives, contact dermatitis and dry, cracked skin. Works better than cortisone cream to treat itchy hives.</li>
    <li> WOW!! This is a product that realy works and instantly stops itching even with hives. I am delighted with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles. However, I&#x27;ve had a couple of bottles that the pump didn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s frustrating when I&#x27;m purchasing such an expensive product that doesn&#x27;t work properly. When my skin is itchy and I&#x27;m trying to get lotion on quickly to stop the itch...a useless pump doesn&#x27;t help matters. Aside from that and the terrible smell of this lotion...I have no complaints. I personally don&#x27;t care how bad it smells since it provides me relief, but my husband and father make a huge deal about how bad it smells. Oh well, it works!</li>
    <li> Right off the bat, the pump doesn&#x27;t work, so I need to take the cap off and dump it onto my palm to apply. I have a viral rash so I thought that this cream could help. Maybe it&#x27;ll help later on when the rash is more faded, but it does not do a thing for me to stop any itching. And I don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells weird.</li>
