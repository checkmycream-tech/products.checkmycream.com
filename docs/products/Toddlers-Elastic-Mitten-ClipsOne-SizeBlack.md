      <li>Cheaply made, bulky.  </li>
      <li>I originally got them to keep my sons mittens on his coat sleeves.</li>

      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>These are useful clips.</li>
      <li>(hand me downs; it&#x27;s nice to have an extra coat to wear if I have to wash one).</li>
      <li>but they are very large.  </li>
      <li>The strong clips have kept the gloves on all winter so far, no problems.  </li>

      <li>Old fashioned, but the work great to keep track of little one&#x27;s gloves.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t really use these for mittens.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>I love this.i was not sure it will have the right length when i ordered</li>
      <li>I thought since they it would be clear they are meant for winter coats they clips would be nice and tight but they don&#x27;t seem to be.  </li>
      <li>Decent quality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>fit as expected!</li>
      <li>Although they stay on the coat very well themselves, my two-year old knows how to easily remove them (which kinda makes them pointless).</li>
      <li>Right now he can just put the mittens on but not for long.  </li>
      <li>So hard to find these in the local stores any more!</li>
      <li>Works fine, just larger than expected.  </li>
      <li>A little short, but ok.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package I thought I must have misread the item description and ordered adult mitten clips.  </li>
      <li>They look like they should be for an adult.</li>
      <li>He had been losing his mittens constantly and these work very well.  </li>
      <li>I bought these for my 15 month old.  </li>
      <li>I wish we could get the old mitten on a string</li>
      <li>I have some long steampunk skirts I wanted to hike up and make look unusual</li>
      <li>(unless your child is too young to remove them, or old enough to know not to).</li>
      <li>I got these for my 2yr old son because he is constantly losing his gloves/mittens.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m petite so normal boot straps are too long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not long enough and it hurts your feet.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not long enough and it hurts your feet.</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve used them with two kids under 4 for a few weeks and they consistently come off, but that&#x27;s about what I would expect from a kid whose not being careful with them at all as they swing their arms around, etc.  </li>
<li> They need to be seamless, not hanging down.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t bother with these - complete waste of money.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not too short like the other one i had</li>
<li> and so far seem to be difficult for my 6years old to open it.</li>
<li> 4 stars only bcuz they are black.</li>
<li> These have an extra little bit of plastic &amp;#34;teeth&#x27; that grip the coat inside the clips.</li>
<li> The clips do the job, My grandson can not get the mittens off, but the clips are a little too big, they leave marks on his wrist, and he complains about it.</li>
<li> They seem a little larger than expected.  </li>
<li> I got what I expected, I needed those to give to a friend who is expecting a baby boy.</li>
<li> These were exactly as expected.</li>
<li> I discovered using nylon long sholaces looped thru the collar hook instead &amp; down the sleeves &amp; tied to each mitten.</li>
<li> I have bough other clips before.</li>
<li> Though they are still pull-offable,  I think these hang on about as well as could be expected!</li>
<li> I used this to hold my pants down to wear in boots.  </li>
<li> Clips stay on tightly.  </li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t have lived without it when my kids were little.</li>
<li> For some reason I thought they would be a little longer.  </li>
<li> They can be worn plain or dressed up with a broach.</li>
<li> Did not stay hooked on very tight, lost 1 glove after having it for a week.</li>
<li> Total waste of money, useless product.</li>
<li> No more mismatched mittens.</li>
<li> That proved pointless, but not because of the clips.</li>
<li> I hardly ever feel them either.</li>
<li> People complained about them hurting their feet.</li>
<li> And the elastic is thick and nonforgiving.</li>

    <li> I used them to hold my pants together when I was pregnant and it worked great.</li>
    <li> These worked great for my grandson hasn&#x27;t lost a glove since we received these what a great little thing to have in the winter</li>
    <li> These are great. I purchased them to keep my jeans tucked in my boots. People complained about them hurting their feet. This hasn&#x27;t been the case for me at all.</li>
    <li> I use these for stirrups under my feet for my jeans so I do not get wrinkled Knees : )  They work great!</li>
    <li> Used these for my jeans in boots and worked great!</li>
    <li> These clips look ridiculous! They need to be seamless, not hanging down. I wish we could get the old mitten on a string but sadly they&#x27;re nowhere to be found. Don&#x27;t bother with these - complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Used as boot clips. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have bough other clips before. They always fall off! These have an extra little bit of plastic &amp;#34;teeth&#x27; that grip the coat inside the clips. They work great- when my daughter doesn&#x27;t pull  them off! Though they are still pull-offable,  I think these hang on about as well as could be expected!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 15 month old.  They seem a little larger than expected.  Works fine, just larger than expected.  Would work well for adults as well I think if you would want to attach these.</li>
    <li> Too big for toddler jackets</li>
    <li> Did not stay hooked on very tight, lost 1 glove after having it for a week. I haven&#x27;t found anything better though.</li>
    <li> I love this.i was not sure it will have the right length when i ordered but it did so it&#x27;s not too short like the other one i had and so far seem to be difficult for my 6years old to open it.</li>
    <li> I originally got them to keep my sons mittens on his coat sleeves. That proved pointless, but not because of the clips. I discovered using nylon long sholaces looped thru the collar hook instead &amp; down the sleeves &amp; tied to each mitten. A bit of work but wofth it. I dont lose mittens or money replacing them AND I used my clips to keep my seat covers in place which drove me nuts</li>
    <li> Mitten clips came when expected and they work great!</li>
    <li> These are useful clips. They perform as well as I would expect any mitten clips to perform. We&#x27;ve used them with two kids under 4 for a few weeks and they consistently come off, but that&#x27;s about what I would expect from a kid whose not being careful with them at all as they swing their arms around, etc.  I wish there were a better solution to keeping gloves on (our school doesn&#x27;t allow strings through the coat), but this will do... Not displeased with the product, but wish there was a better solution overall.</li>
    <li> These boot clips work perfectly at keeping my skinny jeans tucked into my boots, even though they say they are to keep kiddies mittens on coats.</li>
    <li> Keeps my son&#x27;s mittens to his jacket very well.</li>
    <li> Had to stop using them because the buckles were scratching our kid&#x27;s hands when she was not wearing her mittens and they were dangling from the end of her coat sleeves.</li>
    <li> Old fashioned, but the work great to keep track of little one&#x27;s gloves.</li>
    <li> Decent quality. Bought to use as boot straps, they could be just a tiny bit longer.  I&#x27;m petite so normal boot straps are too long.</li>
    <li> These type of clips are necessary if you don&#x27;t want to keep losing all those gloves/mittens.  Personally , i prefer a somewhat shorter length, but does the job</li>
    <li> We were on our third set of mittens for the winter and it was not even December.  I bought these in hopes they would help us keep track of the elusive mitten.  It has worked out great!</li>
    <li> If you have another way to prevent a toddler from losing their mittens, tell me. Otherwise, this item is perfect. Used it all winter and no damage or breakage. Works as you expect.</li>
    <li> These were a great price and a great product.  I got SO sick of constantly looking for gloves in the morning.  Look no more! Now they&#x27;re always attached to my kids&#x27; coats.  I bought four sets because each kid has two coats (hand me downs; it&#x27;s nice to have an extra coat to wear if I have to wash one).</li>
    <li> These were exactly as expected. I purchases them not for mittens, but to use to clip the back of blazers and vests. They can be worn plain or dressed up with a broach.</li>
    <li> Wife is very pleased!</li>
    <li> used for my grandchildren to keep track of glove and make pants tighter. Great item. Couldn&#x27;t have lived without it when my kids were little.</li>
    <li> They were perfect for what I needed! Very fast shipping! Definitely recommend to others for boot use, they might be to big if used as mitten clips</li>
    <li> Used them to keep pants it boots.  A little short, but ok.  Better that what I had...</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, bulky.  I bought 2 sets, and one clip immediately bent when I attempted to remove it from its cardboard packaging!  One pair was for mittens and I wanted to use a third to hold on my 16-month olds hat, so was even OK that one immediately broke.  It might work for the hat becuase it&#x27;s behind his head, but still so bulky it would poke him when he sits in his car seat.  The clips are so large they keep the mittens from staying on his hands becuase they are butted up against one another between the mitten edge and the coat edge.  And the elastic is thick and nonforgiving. Total waste of money, useless product.</li>
    <li> We put them on my sons jacket before school this morning and one if them broke by lunchtime. Poor quality and returning. Will be looking for a difference mitten clip.</li>
    <li> Mitten clips work/fit as expected! So hard to find these in the local stores any more! A must-have essential for toddlers!!!</li>
    <li> 4 stars only bcuz they are black. Remember these as a kid. Sure beats using string thru the sleeves of a winter coat! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These work great on my kids gloves.  They have firm grips and are a good price.  Buy now before you regret after the gloves or mittens that match the coats are lost.</li>
    <li> The clips do the job, My grandson can not get the mittens off, but the clips are a little too big, they leave marks on his wrist, and he complains about it.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 2yr old son because he is constantly losing his gloves/mittens.  They are ok. For some reason I thought they would be a little longer.  Right now he can just put the mittens on but not for long.  And they don&#x27;t stay as good as I hoped.  He can pull them off no problem.  I thought since they it would be clear they are meant for winter coats they clips would be nice and tight but they don&#x27;t seem to be.  He is strong boy but he shouldn&#x27;t be able to pull them off especially when just putting on the mittens.  Thankfully he is still at the age where he listens and we have told him not to pull the clips off so he doesn&#x27;t do it every time.  They are good for the most part but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars when it is so easy to pull the clips off.</li>
    <li> Although they stay on the coat very well themselves, my two-year old knows how to easily remove them (which kinda makes them pointless). I would suggest getting elastic sewn onto the coat instead of clips. (unless your child is too young to remove them, or old enough to know not to). But they are not really great for toddlers.</li>
    <li> These work great as boot clips!</li>
    <li> I bought these for a toddler but they are very large.  They look like they should be for an adult.</li>
    <li> Clips stay on tightly.  Shipped reasonably fast.  Packaged appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase these again and will recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I actually ordered these for myself as my gloves kept falling out of my pocket. They work great and I have not lost my gloves since.</li>
    <li> I used this to hold my pants down to wear in boots.  It&#x27;s not long enough and it hurts your feet.</li>
    <li> I got these to clip to the bottoms of my skinny jeans so they don&#x27;t ride up when I&#x27;m wearing boots.  They work perfectly for that!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use these for mittens. I use these to keep the sheets on the bed.&lt;br /&gt;I clip them on the corners, it keeps them from sliding and coming off the mattress.</li>
    <li> These are very durable clips but they are huge!  When I opened the package I thought I must have misread the item description and ordered adult mitten clips.  They won&#x27;t work for our toddler.</li>
    <li> Perfect. My granddaughter will always have mittens.  No more mismatched mittens.</li>
    <li> Quality product...affordable price...works well for what I intended it for...</li>
    <li> I have some long steampunk skirts I wanted to hike up and make look unusual and these did the trick. They are not made from this but they totally work for what i was thinking.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my  nephew (though it&#x27;s probably a better gift for the parents!) along with a nice pair of mittens.  He had been losing his mittens constantly and these work very well.  Given the kind of winter we have had they have been given a lot of use and are still functioning well even with the abuse of a 3 year old.</li>
    <li> I got what I expected, I needed those to give to a friend who is expecting a baby boy. Good quality product.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  The strong clips have kept the gloves on all winter so far, no problems.  The kids like them too.</li>
    <li> I use these to keep my jeans in my boots and they work perfectly for that. I hardly ever feel them either.</li>
    <li> Currently wearing them! I appreciate what they do but don&#x27;t think they should be $10. You could probably find these in a store for $3. I would give these 4 (maybe even 5!) stars if the price reflected the quality.</li>
