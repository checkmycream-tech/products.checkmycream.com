      <li>This has two closures so make sure to use both so your not flashing anyone.</li>
      <li>Wish they had bright, fun colors, too.</li>
      <li>because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be see-through.  </li>
      <li>The Canyon Rose Waffle Weave is very comfortable and the sage color is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>This is great since I live in an area where it&#x27;s over 90 degrees for 9 months a year.</li>
      <li>and then I feel more comfortable in hotel rooms</li>
      <li>Easy to put on and to launder.</li>
      <li>Easy on and off with the Velcro.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I gave it as a gift and the color was fine with my mom</li>
      <li>This is light weight, drying time is very quick.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable,</li>
      <li>Cheaply made also.</li>
      <li>light weight... Could also be used as swimsuit cover-up.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this wrap, but the more I use it, the more the positioning of the velcro annoys me.</li>
      <li>The Wrap stays closed perfectly and after my first laundering it came out good as new.  </li>
      <li>The elastic around the top makes it fit nicely but there is not enough fabric overlap for my liking.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered many wraps from various manufacturers and canyon rose...</li>
      <li>I really love the soft texture and how easy they are to put on and remove.</li>
      <li>Decent price, seems to be well made, and from what she says, it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
      <li>The wrap arrived quickly; it&#x27;s lightweight and made well.  </li>
      <li>The waffle material is pretty but doesn&#x27;t look like it would be comfortable in a sauna.  </li>
      <li>Finally, a spa wrap that I love!</li>
      <li>It was light weight and didn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bag.  </li>
      <li>Durable and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I wear Women&#x27;s XL tops and this wrap fits me just right.  </li>
      <li>The downside is that it opens up right in the crotch area.</li>
      <li>This wrap and the brown wrap are very large in the circumferance.  </li>
      <li>I am a full figured woman, and it fits very well.</li>
      <li>The material is soft, and the Velcro is also on the side of the wrap, much nicer then ones I have seen in stores for more money.</li>
      <li>The recipient loves this pretty wrap.  </li>
      <li>Some only have it at the top.</li>
      <li>Funny thing is, I could not find the material content anywhere on the packaging or the garment tags and had to go to www.canyonroseapparel.com to learn that it is a Poly/Cotton blend.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>The color is exact w sturdy Velcro.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light weight, and soft and</li>
      <li>And the material is comfortable &amp; soft - not itchy.</li>
      <li>so provides much more coverage than the regular gym towels.  </li>
      <li>Most wraps are too short.</li>
      <li>So, with this on, I&#x27;m happily able to finish my routine with the door open and plenty of air flow.</li>
      <li>this would not be my first choice</li>
      <li>Handy in the extreme as well as pretty.</li>
      <li>right there is way too high.</li>
      <li>This offers privacy for clients, it&#x27;s full coverage and high quality!</li>
      <li>I ordered the smallest size but it was still way too large.  </li>
      <li>size 10 to 20 really well.</li>
      <li>Thank you so ,much.</li>
      <li>I wanted this for travel and it really fits the bill.</li>
      <li>Have been searching for such an item a long time because it was needed so I could apply my makeup without getting it onto my nice robes.  </li>
      <li>I bought a new one as a gift for my mother and she loves it!</li>
      <li>Way too high.</li>
      <li>your looking for one of high quality for home</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, my female clients like the fact that the velcro sticks &#x27;closed&#x27; and that it&#x27;s not see-through so their &#x27;private&#x27; parts stay &#x27;private!&#x27;</li>
      <li>This is supposed to be one size fits all, but it&#x27;s actually way too stretchy and loose around the top elastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
      <li>The only thing I noticed was that the color faded after the first washing.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I had to do was put two more velcro tabs to hold it in place down the front/side area.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Feels nice. I use it in the sauna as a wrap. It&#x27;s not a heavy wrap. It&#x27;s very soft. The Velcro can be irritating but I just fold it over.</li>
    <li> I just purchased two more because this is the perfect spa wrap for me. Funny thing is, I could not find the material content anywhere on the packaging or the garment tags and had to go to www.canyonroseapparel.com to learn that it is a Poly/Cotton blend. The tags do say to Machine Wash Cold/Tumble Dry Low but I have no issue with that.  I wear Women&#x27;s XL tops and this wrap fits me just right.  I need it when staying at Mom&#x27;s because she keeps her home way too warm for me and it is very irritating to perspire right after showering.  So, with this on, I&#x27;m happily able to finish my routine with the door open and plenty of air flow.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this is lightweight and not at all heavy like terrycloth. This is great since I live in an area where it&#x27;s over 90 degrees for 9 months a year. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and it comes to my knees.  I am also plus size and it fits all the way around with no problem.  The downside is that it opens up right in the crotch area. The velcro that is meant to keep it closed right there is way too high. I can imagine for taller women it would be even worse. I plan on moving the velcro down farther. So far I&#x27;ve washed it in the washing machine and had no issues. It appears to be well made and will last.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of no straps and the weight of the fabric is nice.  I didn&#x27;t want a heavy terry.  The elastic around the top makes it fit nicely but there is not enough fabric overlap for my liking.  And, since the Velcro closure is only a small square it is not at all adjustable.  I wear it in the morning to run around the house or fix breakfast for my family and I want to be modestly covered.  This is not a great option for modesty.</li>
    <li> Lite, nice for summer</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be one size fits all, but it&#x27;s actually way too stretchy and loose around the top elastic. The velcro front closure is in a ridiculous spot, way too high to be useful. However, it does work well enough for my purpose, back and forth to the shower at the gym.</li>
    <li> I purchased this so I could have a wrap between the showers and the locker at my gym. It worked well.  It was light weight and didn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bag.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it as a towel or to dry off.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Canyon Rose Waffle Spa Wrap.  Have been searching for such an item a long time because it was needed so I could apply my makeup without getting it onto my nice robes.  The Wrap stays closed perfectly and after my first laundering it came out good as new.  The fit is perfect for me -- 5&#x27;6&#x27; size 12.  Would definitely order another, if needed.  Also, would recommend the Wrap to a friend.</li>
    <li> Have worked out nicely.  The only thing I noticed was that the color faded after the first washing.  Other than that they have held up very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a plus 16 &amp; this fits great! The color is exact w sturdy Velcro. This elastic doesn&#x27;t roll or pinch.  Washes well with no shrinkage.</li>
    <li> Good length and I like the waffle material. Only reason that it&#x27;s not 5 star is that the elastic is a little weak and slips down easier than I&#x27;d like</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she was thrilled.  I was very pleased to find it and really loved the sage color</li>
    <li> Runs a little large. Could use more Velcro. Otherwise, great wrap.</li>
    <li> I have three now. I really love the soft texture and how easy they are to put on and remove. Handy in the extreme as well as pretty.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed. It&#x27;s very lightweight and takes up little room in my gym bag. I am a full figured woman, and it fits very well. If you are a smaller size, it might run a bit big.</li>
    <li> Best wrap out there!  Wish they had bright, fun colors, too. Good quality and the fit is wonderful and they wash &amp; dry (machine) beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Fit size 10 to 20 really well.</li>
    <li> Finally, a spa wrap that I love! I have tried others. This one is perfectly lightweight and absorbent without being see through. Easy on and off with the Velcro. As far as the comments about the Velcro in the lower part not being in the correct spot, I just accommodate that by rotating the wrap a little farther to the left on my body. No big deal. Everything is now covered.</li>
    <li> This spa wrap is perfect...it&#x27;s light weight, and soft and the color is nice. Very nice quality and well worst the cost. I washed it but lined dried it and it did well!</li>
    <li> Very good quality material. Perfect fit. The material is soft, and the Velcro is also on the side of the wrap, much nicer then ones I have seen in stores for more money.</li>
    <li> I ordered the smallest size but it was still way too large.  I wear a size 4.  The waffle material is pretty but doesn&#x27;t look like it would be comfortable in a sauna.  I returned this item.</li>
    <li> Work well keeps the chill of your body while you put make on or just admire yourself in the mirror.</li>
    <li> I received today and was pleasantly surprised on how soft it was-  The Canyon Rose Waffle Weave is very comfortable and the sage color is very pretty.  I am a plus size and I didn&#x27;t know if it would fit me well, but its fits great.  Thank you so ,much.</li>
    <li> Prefer this due to the velcro in two places. Some only have it at the top. This offers privacy for clients, it&#x27;s full coverage and high quality! A+</li>
    <li> i  READ  ALL  REVIEWS  IN  THE  ADVERTISEMENT.  SO  I  THOUGHT!!!&lt;br /&gt;THEY  ARE  TOO,  TOO. TOO  SMALL......&lt;br /&gt;I  GAVE ALL  OF  THEM  TO  FRIEND!!!!!!  I  WAS  WAY  DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The bottom velcro patch is in the stupidest spot. Way too high. I really wanted to like this wrap, but the more I use it, the more the positioning of the velcro annoys me. I do like that it is lightweight and plenty long.</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for.  Something thin to wear into the sauna at the gym&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for one of high quality for home this would not be my first choice</li>
    <li> This was a present I had been looking for a friend who is disabled.  She loves it!  Easy to put on and to launder.</li>
    <li> I wanted this for travel and it really fits the bill. It folds really small and then I feel more comfortable in hotel rooms</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than it looks and the weave does not absorb enough water.</li>
    <li> This spa wrap is perfect for the gym.  I like to use it when I go in the sauna or steam room, as the towels the gym provides don&#x27;t quite cover all of me. This robe is lightweight and perfect for that use. Washes nicely, too.</li>
    <li> This wrap is a great length, closes in 2 places and is light weight but not skimpy.  The ONLY problem I have with it is with my order.  It is advertised as coming in a few colors, sage is the one I chose.  However, even though the packing slip also says sage....it came in white...the ONE color I did not want....because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be see-through.  When I called the company, I was informed that white is the only color they sell.  Asked why they advertise Sage and others, I was told that it is an Amazon mistake.  Hmmmm?  Anyway, I gave it as a gift and the color was fine with my mom and you can&#x27;t see thru it, she says.  I want one.....but I assume I can only get it in white.  Still, that is confusing when the ad shows colors, the confirmation shows a color and the packing slip says a color.  Maybe that can be addressed by Amazon and Canyon Rose????</li>
    <li> I love this wrap, and I use it all the time!  It is made well and I like the material.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fabric is soft, color is great! I ordered one several years ago and still have and wear it daily! I bought a new one as a gift for my mother and she loves it! Durable and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they had more color choices</li>
    <li> Not quite as soft as I expected.  It works.  The only thing I had to do was put two more velcro tabs to hold it in place down the front/side area.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, my female clients like the fact that the velcro sticks &#x27;closed&#x27; and that it&#x27;s not see-through so their &#x27;private&#x27; parts stay &#x27;private!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Looking for more towel like product. Others I viewed did not seem to ensure Velcro opening. Unfortunately I opened it or I would return it.</li>
    <li> Great to throw on after a shower...light weight... Could also be used as swimsuit cover-up. Fabric not absorbant... I would prefer terrycloth. Nice color.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;spa wrap&amp;#34;  was made with a very poor quality of material.  It made me feel itchy and felt cheap and just did not fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this wrap to anyone.</li>
    <li> The recipient loves this pretty wrap.  There are sparks in her eyes when she mentions the ease brought by this post shower help.</li>
    <li> the wrap is huge!!! I have ordered many wraps from various manufacturers and canyon rose...This wrap and the brown wrap are very large in the circumferance.  there should be adjustable snaps or two velcro closures so the client has options.&lt;br /&gt;it is nice and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Great.  Lasts wash after wash.  Too small for larger women though need bigger size.</li>
    <li> This is light weight, drying time is very quick. I am a larger size, 16-18 and this wrap fits great, covers and stays in place. I&#x27;m going to order a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Very comfortable, good quality. Looks nice and washes well.  Ordered 2, one for me and one as a gift.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the Velcro strip was longer. It should be 6 inches. I like the longer length. Most wraps are too short.</li>
    <li> Bought for the wife to use at the gym.  Wrap is long (down to the knees) so provides much more coverage than the regular gym towels.  And the material is comfortable &amp; soft - not itchy.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife, and she loves it.  Decent price, seems to be well made, and from what she says, it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
    <li> The wrap arrived quickly; it&#x27;s lightweight and made well.  The only thing I&#x27;d change is the length.  I&#x27;d prefer it to be knee-length, but I knew it would be longer when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality wrap, Use it at the gym all the time, no slippage. This has two closures so make sure to use both so your not flashing anyone. It is comfortable, machine washable n good with the dryer. It is just a good buy, I would recommend it, in fact I would buy another one to use at home. The pic shown is true to color for the green, not any brighter or darker than that and hits at the knee.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Got one for Mom and Sis too.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of my grandmothers old bedspread. A true piece of crap. Cheaply made also. I think the manufacturer has a lot of nerve!</li>
