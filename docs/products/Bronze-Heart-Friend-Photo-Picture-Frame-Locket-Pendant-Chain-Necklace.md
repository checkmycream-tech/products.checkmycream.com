      <li>This is a very pretty locket.</li>

      <li>so i taped a picture that wasnt exactly the correct size</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a perfect review is because while I am wearing it, the locket tends to open on me, but nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed in a second!</li>
      <li>When I recieved this I was so excited but the locket and chain were not already put together and they just simply won&#x27;t go together...</li>
      <li>The color is much dimmer than what the golden look of the picture may present</li>
      <li>It was larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not paying attention to the description.</li>
      <li>but i had some old chains around my house that i used.</li>
      <li>Bought it for our 3yr old granddaughter.</li>
      <li>The chain is not silver as seen in the photo, it is a bronzish colour and looks a bit old</li>
      <li>and I would say that I am still surprised that it is completely in tact, especially since I work with kids</li>
      <li>Apparently, you get what you pay for.</li>

    <li> Bought it for our 3yr old granddaughter. The heart is large and chain is short which is perfect for her. The heart is a little big but I believe it is as described, but she likes it and makes it easier to find a picture for it. It stays closed unlike another brand we bought at Walmart which we took back. Came from China and took a long time to get, but received before there due date.</li>
    <li> Great length and exactly what I was looking for. I was glad to sew that I could fit two pictures into this. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a perfect review is because while I am wearing it, the locket tends to open on me, but nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed in a second! I would overall say that it was a great buy for the price!  So I&#x27;ve now had this locket for about 5 months and I would say that I am still surprised that it is completely in tact, especially since I work with kids and they are pulling on it all the time to see my pictures! The color is much dimmer than what the golden look of the picture may present but it&#x27;s still nice looking in my opinion. It has gotten frustrating that every say 30 seconds the locket pops open even if I am not doing anything other than sitting on the couch.</li>
    <li> It came incredibly fast!!!!! Almost two or three weeks before it was supposed to, that&#x27;s always thumbs up in my book. As for the product, it&#x27;s exactly how it looks, and pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love it it makes a perfect gift for my mom</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this necklace! very pretty and detailed. the chain is long and it came separately. the only thing I was worried about was when my mail came it said they were earrings do I thought they mailed the wrong thing.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty locket. It was larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s my own fault for not paying attention to the description. The hinge is weak, and you couldn&#x27;t put the chain thru the locket hole. Pretty, but not good quality.</li>
    <li> Very good. Looks as shown. Just a bit bigger. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Cheap made China import &#x3D;perfect for a little girl playing dress up-</li>
    <li> locket did come unattached from the chain and the chain did not fit but i had some old chains around my house that i used. Then i realized there was no hole to put a picture in so i taped a picture that wasnt exactly the correct size but oh well</li>
    <li> Bigger then what i expected but it&#x27;s still nice</li>
    <li> When I recieved this I was so excited but the locket and chain were not already put together and they just simply won&#x27;t go together...it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all...sorry</li>
    <li> This locket is horrible! My daughter purchased this item, and was extremely excited when it arrived. When she opened the package, it was fine because the chain was just separated from the locket. But, when we tried the get the chain through the hole on the top of the locket, the jump-ring was to big! We had to take of the jump-ring, feed the chain through the hole, and put the jump-ring back on. Once again, everything seemed fine. Of course, the locket didn&#x27;t have an opening to put the edge of the picture under to keep the picture in, and give it a finished look! We tried tracing the locket, estimating, and using a heart template that we got of the internet, but nothing was working. Later, we noticed the locket looked nothing like in the picture! Apparently, you get what you pay for. These amazing reviews are all lies. NEVER buy this locket.</li>
    <li> The locket did not come attached to the chain - b/c the chain is WAY TOO LARGE to fit through the jump ring. This does not fulfill its purpose.</li>
    <li> the chain didn&#x27;t even fit in the heart&#x27;s ring. It also broke after four days.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I love it. The chain is a little long bUT nothing that can&#x27;t be fix. It also came way before it due date.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very big and a little awkward to wear...</li>
    <li> Was broken when I received it, it wouldn&#x27;t shut all the way.</li>
    <li> The chain is not silver as seen in the photo, it is a bronzish colour and looks a bit old but my daughter still likes it.</li>
    <li> Loved it my niece absolutely adored it</li>
