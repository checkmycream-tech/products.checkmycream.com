<li> This is not worth the $16.50.  </li>
<li> What I was not aware of is that some of the Conair replacement jewels DO NOT FIT in the Conair Hair Jeweler.  </li>

<li> Ridiculously expensive.</li>
<li> Wish the replacement gems were not so expensive, otherwise I would give it a 5-star rating.</li>
<li> Once I opened the package and saw the product inside I was very disappointed for money spent and what was received.  </li>
<li> While there is nothing wrong with them, they seemed very expensive for the number of &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; received.</li>
<li> What a disappointment from Conair.</li>
<li> My bad.   </li>
<li> But when I looked at the number of &#x27;jewels&#x27; I too felt disappointed.</li>

    <li> Not sure this is a good product when the jewels are easier to put in you hair by hand than with the tool. Professional hair dresser friend had trouble with it.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  Once I opened the package and saw the product inside I was very disappointed for money spent and what was received.  This is not worth the $16.50.  I should have paid more attention to what the product description was before purchasing.  Item is nice but suffering from buyer&#x27;s remorse.</li>
    <li> pretty colors and shapes. I have not used them yet but seems to work nice and easy. I thank you</li>
    <li> Ridiculously expensive. This product is cute but 24 little hair pieces for ~$20 is just silliness. The product is way too costly for what you get.</li>
    <li> The girls have already used many of the gems and they look so cute.  Wish the replacement gems were not so expensive, otherwise I would give it a 5-star rating.</li>
    <li> A young girl can never have enough pretty bling for thier hair, just what I wanted. Thanks so very much</li>
    <li> I got these for my granddaughters they were thrilled they loved them. It is a great product for a great price with a very speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my granddaughter and Goddaughter for Christmas.  They both were thrilled with the product.  I would recommend it to anyone who is slightly creative likes a little bling in their life!</li>
    <li> This item will be a Christmas gift, so I haven&#x27;t been able to try it out. But all seemed to be as described, and also arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what my daughter will say about it but I think she&#x27;ll love it It is easy to put it on the hair and take it off.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but I thought that they were snap on.  I don&#x27;t know how to attach them with the machine</li>
    <li> Good deal. Reusable. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> These do not work in the Conair machine! They are too big and jam it up.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the regular, smaller, replacements. I ended up buying two machines.</li>
    <li> These gems are too big for the quick gems machine. They jammed it. I wasted $13! My daughter loved the gems, but she can&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes these and use them often.  The springs are easy to bend when you pull them out of your hair.</li>
    <li> The replacement pack for the Conair machine was a little pricey and didn&#x27;t contain very many \\&quot;jewels\\&quot;.  They look of a decent quality, though.</li>
    <li> This just arrived via UPS today. Fast shipping.   But when I looked at the number of &#x27;jewels&#x27; I too felt disappointed. Only 24 little plastic items (made in China of course) for $16.50! Had I known, I would have looked at local drug store/dollar store for similar item(s). My bad.   The size of the &#x27;jewels&#x27; is about 1/4 the size shown on the photo.</li>
    <li> A bit Pricey for what you get........wish there was something more substantial available in the way of replacements for this product....</li>
    <li> Comes with just as many beads as the entire unit originally came with.... and costs 2.5 times as much. Better off just buying the whole unit with beads each time you need more.</li>
    <li> She took such good care of the original pack and application tool that I gave her a refill for Christmas when she was upset she&#x27;d lost a few.</li>
    <li> Great replacement jewels for the Quick Gem Hair Jeweler.</li>
    <li> The gems that come with the conair hair beader are smaller.  These get stuck in the machine - It doesn&#x27;t make sense since these were recommended as an add on when I purchased the machine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this refill pack knowing full well that there were only 24 pieces in the package.  What I was not aware of is that some of the Conair replacement jewels DO NOT FIT in the Conair Hair Jeweler.  The Heart and the Flower shapes get stuck during application and you have to bang on the hair jeweler unit to get them out, which sometimes happens after the gem is already applied to the hair - OUCH!  So, plan to use only about half of the package if you do decide to purchase.  What a disappointment from Conair.</li>
    <li> Well worth the colors and number of gems you receive. My niece loved this as part of her Christmas gift. Works with the Conair HJ3BC Quick Gems Hair Jeweler.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4PL22/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_2</li>
    <li> My 8 and 10 year old girls recieved the jewels and hair jeweler for Christmas. It works great! The jewels stay in. My daughters have thin fine hair and everything slides out but these jewels stay in. We are having a lot of fun with it.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my grandaughter. While there is nothing wrong with them, they seemed very expensive for the number of &amp;#34;jewels&amp;#34; received. I would not order these again.</li>
    <li> My daughter plays with this all the time.  I love that it is so easy to use.  We even tried it on the dog.  Beautiful.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool if those were Swarovski crystals? I ordered these to try out and they are great. If they were crystals, I&#x27;ll wear them to parties.</li>
