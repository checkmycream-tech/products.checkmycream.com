      <li>The U shaped Gel toe separators work great, and the variety of sizes help to use between which ever toes rub.</li>
      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>but the product it&#x27;s not so great.</li>
      <li>A very nice, inexpensive solution to my problem.</li>
      <li>I am very appreciative that I got them.</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable and my toes are in heaven!  </li>
      <li>I found them very comfortable, which for someone who doesn&#x27;t like things between my toes, was surprising.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product and</li>
      <li>I was expecting it to be ok but never to be this good</li>
      <li>I wash them and reuse them and they appear to be holding up nicely.</li>
      <li>These do an amazing job of staying in place during the day, and feel very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>You have to squeeze your toes together and then put on a sock to hold them in place.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re kind of bulky too.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re ok, just not for me.</li>
      <li>The shape of the gel separators are very comfortable no matter which shoes you choose to wear.</li>
      <li>, it is very comfortable to use these separators.</li>
      <li>very comfortable, can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there</li>
      <li>From the picture and description, I thought for sure this was a pair of pieces, each with four separators attached.</li>
      <li>I have been able to wear my highest heels with no discomfort.</li>
      <li>Better then those found in stores.</li>
      <li>and I agree with those people it did feel better like that,</li>
      <li>I still love them.</li>
      <li>The best part is that you can wash these and re-use them as long as you like.</li>
      <li>I am now able to enjoy my heels</li>
      <li>These separators do separate my toes, as I desired, but are easily dislodged and I have to wear socks to keep them in place.</li>
      <li>If you just sit around, they&#x27;ll be fine, but these are not made for movement.</li>
      <li>Great relief for corns, I use one on each foot almost daily in combination with a toe spacer for bunions.</li>
      <li>The picture is a good visual for the product.</li>
      <li>This is a great answer for those looking for relief from crowded or misshapen toes, bunions, or other foot problems.</li>
      <li>This product probably works ok if your toes are built exactly a certain way and very, very close together.  </li>
      <li>Even if your toes press together hard (which is the condition this product would ideally treat), it will just squish out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most importantly they stay in place throughout my regular day walking around.</li>
      <li>flat feet and my toes point outward, I thought these would make walking more comfortable</li>
      <li>Thanks for this relief and the excellence and ease of ordering and receiving product from Amazon!</li>
      <li>it works exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>These toe separators are very skinny and don&#x27;t really separate my toes much.</li>
      <li>Some people said you should buy two sets so you where one whole set on each foot, but I say screw that.</li>
      <li>These work very well and were just what I needed.</li>
      <li>It is helping my husband keeping his toes straight.  </li>
      <li>Did not fill in toe spaces very well at all and often fell out of place.</li>
      <li>These have really helped with the \\&quot;kissing calluses\\&quot; between my toes.</li>
      <li>I did not get much relief for mortons neuroma.</li>
      <li>I was concerned they would be too thin to make enough difference, but they turned out to work perfectly.</li>
      <li>More trouble than they are worth</li>
      <li>They are very comfortable and help my bony toes to be able to &amp;#34;deal with each other.&amp;#34; They are also much cheaper on line than the ones I have in the past purchased at a medical supply store.</li>
      <li>They are easy to put in place, and they stay in place for as long as I have my sock on.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the product, they actually exceeded what I expected!  </li>
      <li>would give it another shot if there is a new idea thrown into it!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>However,  my toes have spaces between them - like most toes - and these little things never stayed put despite my repeat attempts.  </li>
      <li>On a case by case  basis they fit within closed toe shoes without causing pinching but could cause tightness.  </li>
      <li>These are just the right size for the smaller toes.</li>
      <li>I drive 90 mins to work one way, and the pain in my right foot seems to stem alot from being in a shoe and in the same position for 90 mins.  </li>
      <li>Well, that and decent, flat shoes with a wide toe-box, but all of that is better than surgery, IMO.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not perfect either (sometimes my toe aches by the end of the day), but they&#x27;re more comfortable and don&#x27;t rub.</li>
      <li>I developed a corn (ugh!).  </li>
      <li>She tried these and said they are very comfortable and you hardly know they are there.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re really shaped to be worn one way only.</li>
      <li>At first they solved my problem perfectly, but over time (a few weeks), the spacer warped and by the end of the day was very uncomfortable because it sort of slid under part of the toe and rubbed.</li>
      <li>; I thought these gel ones wouldn&#x27;t be wide enough to cushion adequately but they seem to be working, which is nice because they are thin and comfortable, last longer and are easier to wash and dry.</li>
      <li>My toe is now back to normal (yay!), and it does not hurt to walk around wearing my dress shoes.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure why they do not stay in place for because mine are secure all day with no issues.</li>
      <li>I tried these with bare feet, with socks, and with shoes and socks, but they don&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
      <li>They were not the way I expected them to be, but they are very helpful.</li>
      <li>I wear them between my toes even with sandals because they are a slightly opaque (cloudy) but mostly clear silicone material, so, unless someone is really looking they don&#x27;t notice them.  </li>
      <li>Also they are too thin to do much good; they seem to shrink as you wear them and are almost flat after a few hours.</li>

<li> I been looking for a long time to get these item, finally I found it</li>
<li> I spent $65 to get Correct Toes instead, which stay in place better (but not perfectly).</li>
<li> If your toes naturally touch tightly together, then maybe they would.</li>
<li> They stayed in place well and provided comfort all day long.  </li>
<li> Instead, what you get is 8 individual flaps, not very u-shaped at all, and with no way to keep them between your toes.</li>
<li> Between the two products, I should be set for a long time.</li>
<li> I was having a problem with my little toes curling under the next toe after doing a 26 mile hike through the desert.  </li>
<li> Not what I expected at all....</li>
<li> Not what I expected, but I like them.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It sort of provides relief if I carefully hold the pads in place, but that in itself is stressful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> My small toe was really hurting from wearing narrow, close-toe dress shoes in the winter -- the side of my toe was pressing too hard against the toe next to it.  </li>
<li> usually rate for some detail, and it may not effect the actual &amp;#34;rate product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It did not work for me, as noted by other reviewers suffering from mortons neuroma.</li>
<li> This product is not a very del manufactured and just melt down</li>
<li> Not really useful for me.</li>
<li> I tried wearing it upside down</li>
<li> They&#x27;re well made, but they still hurt my existing friction bumps (it hurts less without them.)</li>
<li> I am not saying these will cure everyones problems but for less than $10, my pain has been allieviated.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
<li> So I used two of the little separators for a few weeks.  </li>
<li> However, even the two large ones only reached about 2/3 of the way from the base of my toes.  </li>
<li> but these things won&#x27;t stay in place so don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
<li> Too much trouble to use these</li>
<li> It was a waste of money.  </li>
<li> After a few minutes I would forget they were even there.  </li>
<li> Even wearing socks, after a few steps the toe separators did not stay in place.  </li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> and it did the trick, no more sore toes at the end of the day.</li>
<li> The smaller ones are completely useless for me.  </li>
<li> By end of day, they had all migrated to other places in my socks, causing an irritating need to remove shoes, socks and then remove them.  </li>
<li> like the idea, although its hard to keep the TPE gel stay between-toes.</li>
<li> dont stay in place does not really keep my toes from turning the wrong way , guess i am getting Arthur in them</li>
<li> from my experience this product is not effective.</li>
<li> Too bad I can only do one foot at a time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I been looking for a long time to get these item, finally I found it but the product it&#x27;s not so great.</li>
    <li> I need one of these toe separators to cushion a Morton&#x27;s neuroma on my left foot--amazingly, that&#x27;s all it takes for me to walk without pain from the neuroma. Well, that and decent, flat shoes with a wide toe-box, but all of that is better than surgery, IMO. I was using the three-layer foam separators, and I have purchased some of those as well; I thought these gel ones wouldn&#x27;t be wide enough to cushion adequately but they seem to be working, which is nice because they are thin and comfortable, last longer and are easier to wash and dry. Between the two products, I should be set for a long time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and it works exactly as promised.  I was expecting it to be ok but never to be this good, it is very comfortable to use these separators. It is helping my husband keeping his toes straight.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> These do an amazing job of staying in place during the day, and feel very comfortable.  The big toe one could be shorter for me, but I may just cut it a bit.  I wear them between my toes even with sandals because they are a slightly opaque (cloudy) but mostly clear silicone material, so, unless someone is really looking they don&#x27;t notice them.  On a case by case  basis they fit within closed toe shoes without causing pinching but could cause tightness.  I wash them and reuse them and they appear to be holding up nicely.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t remove corns, but they make walking possible.  I use it for a corn between the two smallest toes on one of my feet. They are easy to put in place, and they stay in place for as long as I have my sock on. I bought it on the advise of my podiatrist.</li>
    <li> These are just the right size for the smaller toes. I am using them all the time for my Mortons Neuroma. I am very appreciative that I got them. They were not the way I expected them to be, but they are very helpful.</li>
    <li> The U shaped Gel toe separators work great, and the variety of sizes help to use between which ever toes rub. Better then those found in stores.</li>
    <li> This product probably works ok if your toes are built exactly a certain way and very, very close together.  However,  my toes have spaces between them - like most toes - and these little things never stayed put despite my repeat attempts.  By end of day, they had all migrated to other places in my socks, causing an irritating need to remove shoes, socks and then remove them.  I wish they had worked for me, but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> flat feet and my toes point outward, I thought these would make walking more comfortable and they do...when you double them up. Anyway, I bought them and noticed as soon as I got them that when you remove your sock they are everywhere except between your toes.Some people said you should buy two sets so you where one whole set on each foot, but I say screw that. I purchased one set and I agree with those people it did feel better like that, but these things won&#x27;t stay in place so don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
    <li> These toe separators are very skinny and don&#x27;t really separate my toes much. Also, impossible to keep them in place and they end up in your socks or on the floor. Not really useful for me.</li>
    <li> from my experience this product is not effective. it is keep in position between your toes. the gel is too thin and it is not practical</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the difference wearing the  separators made in my foot comfort..  They stayed in place well and provided comfort all day long.  A great product.</li>
    <li> Did not fill in toe spaces very well at all and often fell out of place. I prefer the 3 layer toe separators.</li>
    <li> very comfortable, can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there and it did the trick, no more sore toes at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I wear size 13 shoes.  I have an issue with in grown toenails including on my big toe.  I thought something like these might keep the toes from rubbing together resulting in further irritation.  However, even the two large ones only reached about 2/3 of the way from the base of my toes.  And they are relatively thin so would not stay in between my toes.  Even wearing socks, after a few steps the toe separators did not stay in place.  The smaller ones are completely useless for me.  They might work for someone with tiny feet.</li>
    <li> From the picture and description, I thought for sure this was a pair of pieces, each with four separators attached. Hence \\&quot;U-shaped.\\&quot; Instead, what you get is 8 individual flaps, not very u-shaped at all, and with no way to keep them between your toes. They are very thin. Even if your toes press together hard (which is the condition this product would ideally treat), it will just squish out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sort of provides relief if I carefully hold the pads in place, but that in itself is stressful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried doubling up (using all 8 pads on one foot) and it is working well. Too bad I can only do one foot at a time. If I have to buy an extra set to accomplish what one should do, it still gets one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that the product page has been updated to reflect that there are 8 pieces... But looking at the order I placed, it did not say that at the time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but these won&#x27;t stay put at all.  Makes them completely useless.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe my toes aren&#x27;t close enough together?</li>
    <li> They fall out walking, running, playing tennis, etc.  They just don&#x27;t work.  If you just sit around, they&#x27;ll be fine, but these are not made for movement.</li>
    <li> I thought that these separators would be uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;being worn with my shoes on, but as it turns out, I&lt;br /&gt;forget that I have them on. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great relief for corns, I use one on each foot almost daily in combination with a toe spacer for bunions. I prefer the medium on my size 11 foot.</li>
    <li> These did not work for me -- they don&#x27;t stay in place, even under socks. Also they are too thin to do much good; they seem to shrink as you wear them and are almost flat after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I did not get much relief for mortons neuroma. They stay in place but the pain did not go away. It did not work for me, as noted by other reviewers suffering from mortons neuroma.</li>
    <li> These toe separators fit well between the toes and are thin enough to wear inside shoes. I can even wear them with closed-toe sandals. The picture is a good visual for the product.</li>
    <li> Only lasted 2 times and was a total deterioration after that. This product is not a very del manufactured and just melt down</li>
    <li> I have the problem of walking on my pinky toes, this has solved that and makes my feet feel like I have been too a spa.  I don&#x27;t notice that I am wearing them except for the fact that I feel great.  Most importantly they stay in place throughout my regular day walking around.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re well made, but they still hurt my existing friction bumps (it hurts less without them.) You have to squeeze your toes together and then put on a sock to hold them in place.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re kind of bulky too.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re ok, just not for me.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product, they actually exceeded what I expected!  They are very comfortable and my toes are in heaven!  Thanks for this relief and the excellence and ease of ordering and receiving product from Amazon!</li>
    <li> dont stay in place does not really keep my toes from turning the wrong way , guess i am getting Arthur in them</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that stops me from getting corns between my toes.  Also, it stays in place well.</li>
    <li> I got these toe spacers because I had to wear a compressive bandage for plantar fasciitis, which is not great if you have a neuroma (nerve impingement between two toes). At first they solved my problem perfectly, but over time (a few weeks), the spacer warped and by the end of the day was very uncomfortable because it sort of slid under part of the toe and rubbed. I tried wearing it upside down but they&#x27;re really shaped to be worn one way only. I don&#x27;t know if this would not have been an issue if I had a larger foot (I&#x27;m a woman&#x27;s 6.5-7), but I basically had to switch to another product: Footsmart Hourglass Gel Toe separators. They&#x27;re not perfect either (sometimes my toe aches by the end of the day), but they&#x27;re more comfortable and don&#x27;t rub.</li>
    <li> My small toe was really hurting from wearing narrow, close-toe dress shoes in the winter -- the side of my toe was pressing too hard against the toe next to it.  I developed a corn (ugh!).  These gel separators totally do the trick!  Once you put on your sock or tights (or whatever you are wearing on your foot), it will stay in place.  My toe is now back to normal (yay!), and it does not hurt to walk around wearing my dress shoes.  A very nice, inexpensive solution to my problem.</li>
    <li> Salam (Peace),&lt;br /&gt;I usually rate for some detail, and it may not effect the actual &amp;#34;rate product&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details of the product : 4/5&lt;br /&gt;Price of product : 3/5&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and Handling : 5/5&lt;br /&gt;4 Weeks after use : 2/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea, although its hard to keep the TPE gel stay between-toes. Even when wearing a sock that fits perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I would like to wear it when ever I&#x27;m walking, but its imposable if you are wearing a sandals.&lt;br /&gt;It might help a lot if its bigger; or maybe a string that can keep the TPE gel stick between-toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it another shot if there is a new idea thrown into it!</li>
    <li> Had a problem with toes rubbing together. Didn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t stay in place. Waste of money! Wish I had never bought it. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Too thin, did not stay in place.  I wound up after trying several different products, putting cotton between toes, securing with gauze.</li>
    <li> I was having a problem with my little toes curling under the next toe after doing a 26 mile hike through the desert.  So I used two of the little separators for a few weeks.  I found them very comfortable, which for someone who doesn&#x27;t like things between my toes, was surprising.  After a few minutes I would forget they were even there.  I always wore socks so I had no problem with them falling out of place.  These work very well and were just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great answer for those looking for relief from crowded or misshapen toes, bunions, or other foot problems. I was concerned they would be too thin to make enough difference, but they turned out to work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Too much trouble to use these,  They also put pressure on the corners of your toenails and can cause ingrown toenails.  would not stay in place. More trouble than they are worth</li>
    <li> These separators do separate my toes, as I desired, but are easily dislodged and I have to wear socks to keep them in place.</li>
    <li> The shape of the gel separators are very comfortable no matter which shoes you choose to wear. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, but I like them.  I believe that this helps your overall health by separating your toes.</li>
    <li> I tried these with bare feet, with socks, and with shoes and socks, but they don&#x27;t stay in place. If your toes naturally touch tightly together, then maybe they would. I spent $65 to get Correct Toes instead, which stay in place better (but not perfectly).</li>
    <li> I bought these gel separators out of shear morton neuroma pain.  Ive been getting cortizone shots in my foot for several years, and although it relieves the pain, it always comes back.  I drive 90 mins to work one way, and the pain in my right foot seems to stem alot from being in a shoe and in the same position for 90 mins.  I only use 2 of the gels pads between my 2-3 toe and 3-4 toe.  I have had no pain since I started using them.  The gap between 1-2 toe is too big and they wont stay in - but obviously I dont need one there. I also started with one between toe 4-5 too, but soon found that was unnecessary.  I am not saying these will cure everyones problems but for less than $10, my pain has been allieviated.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to everyone else who wrote a review - that helped me determine to buy these.</li>
    <li> These have really helped with the \\&quot;kissing calluses\\&quot; between my toes. I am now able to enjoy my heels again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.24.2013:  Just an update on this product. I still love them. I have been able to wear my highest heels with no discomfort. The best part is that you can wash these and re-use them as long as you like. I am not sure why they do not stay in place for because mine are secure all day with no issues.</li>
    <li> They are very comfortable and help my bony toes to be able to &amp;#34;deal with each other.&amp;#34; They are also much cheaper on line than the ones I have in the past purchased at a medical supply store.</li>
    <li> They do not stay in place.  Not what I expected at all.... It was a waste of money.  Try something else.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my cousin because she has bunions.  She tried these and said they are very comfortable and you hardly know they are there.</li>
