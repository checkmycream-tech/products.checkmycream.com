<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this backpack for my daughter for school. it was less than two weeks before the zipper broke. One of the shoulder straps has now torn completely from the top of the backpack and the other is starting to tear as well. The vinyl straps(didn&#x27;t expect leather for $ 17.99) have a strong inner strap, but only about a 1/4&amp;#34; of the end was sewn in to the back pack seam. My daughter is not rough with her belongings at all. I could have purchased a better quality backpack at WalMart for less money.</li>
    <li> While the bag is cute and it is perfect for my laptop for work after 2 months the straps have broken off the backpack making this a piece for the dumpster. Great price but for someone who will never use the item.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t carry two high school textbooks and folders without one of the straps breaking! First day of school the bags back straps couldn&#x27;t handle it and one broke! Totally embarrassing my daughter on her first day as a Junior in high school!</li>
    <li> Received the book bag way earlier than the ETA.&lt;br /&gt;I think some of these reviews are just people being picky.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s $11, you can&#x27;t expect perfect quality.&lt;br /&gt;The straps are made of the kindof cheap&lt;br /&gt;leather feel material. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this book bag&lt;br /&gt;for carrying heavy loads.But for looks and light weight loads, i think&lt;br /&gt;its great for its price.</li>
    <li> This bag has an awful fishy smell even after being washed. Hopefully the smell will go away...I have it airing out on the porch.The straps are made of a cheap tacky looking pleather also. It&#x27;s an okay bag, but nothing to brag about.</li>
    <li> Good. Came way before the expected day. It seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> It is nice  I love it it is big everything could fit in it I love it.</li>
    <li> Backpack is smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> This looks great for school, but 2 weeks after I used it, my strap broke, bottom ripped, and zippers broke. And there were no textbooks! Not good quality don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good back pack. Didn&#x27;t take to long to receive it. I&#x27;ve had it since August and the strap is starting to rip a little.</li>
    <li> Zippers broke off almost immediately and the actual zipper track would burst open.</li>
    <li> Horribly quality, it broke in a week on me using it</li>
    <li> When I saw this bag I loved it, good condition, im 13 I use it for a school back pack, lots of room! YOU WONT REGRET IT TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!! ;)</li>
    <li> The back strap ripped on my daughter&#x27;s SECOND day of school, so now we have a $20 bill from the cobbler to repair it.  Already the top hook strap also has ripped.  Really cheaply made.  Save yourself time and money by choosing a different backpack - I wish we had!</li>
    <li> Its nice looking leather nice but looks like the material might rip pretty color and design its good quality if ur not gna put to much in it</li>
    <li> loved it but broke in roughl 1 month or less, and i keep my books at home so i didnt have much in there for it to break</li>
    <li> If I could give this thing ZERO stars, I would. My daughter is completely embarrassed of this thing. The strap seams started coming apart after TWO DAYS, then one of the straps COMPLETELY BROKE the next day. DO NOT buy this thing!! There are other websites that have floral backpacks like this that are SURELY better quality!</li>
    <li> Worst backpack ever. Broke within the first 5 min of use. The straps are mad of chiep plastic with if u put even one book in it the amount of wieght will rip the plastic straps right out from the stitching. Dont buy cheap backpacks. I usually buy l.l.bean ones i guess im going to have to start useing them again</li>
    <li> If I could give this backpack no stars, I would. For starters, this backpack didn&#x27;t even last one day without visible signs of the strap stitching loosening. Buy the third day, the plastic cheap strap came off. The material is plastic, the straps are the cheapest faux leather they could find and just a total disappointment. The only good thing about this bag was the design was cute but the material is horrible. I&#x27;m a college student and I didn&#x27;t even put anything heavy in it, just  a binder, a couple of pens and pencils and a folder with a couple of sheets of paper. Never again.</li>
    <li> straps broke off after one week of light use.</li>
    <li> Crap. After two weeks at school the zippers have fallen off, the straps are tearing and schools books are making holes in the \\&quot;leather\\&quot; bottom.</li>
    <li> Its really cute and beautiful, a perfect size for me  but after the first wash a very strange black dust appears inside so I had to broke the intern part to clean it... and the handles are very weak they started to break after the first week....</li>
    <li> Poor quality, only , lasted 2 weeks for school.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! When I got the backpack the straps were already ripped. Yes it&#x27;s a cheap price but so is the backpack! By the second day I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my high schooler, beautiful, but fell apart the first day she used it.  Zippers broke, straps broke and seams ripped apart.  She had a small binder and one text book in it when the strap broke.  Beautiful bag, but poorly constructed.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have recieved compliments on how pretty this backpack is and I have to agree. The design is beautiful and i&#x27;m positive that it will not be destroyed by my binder and notebooks. -Monica.</li>
    <li> The  strap ripped on the first day of use.</li>
    <li> Bought it and used it for one day and the straps broke. The material is really cheap. Yes it&#x27;s nice looking but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Prettier in person than in picture. Real nice bag. TIp...spray your bag with cloth and leather protector to keep it dirt and stain free</li>
    <li> If I could give this thing no stars I would. The rating says it all. I think the only thing this pack is good for would be for a one time use movie prop! The straps broke in a few days with no text books of any kind. Shipping it back this week.</li>
