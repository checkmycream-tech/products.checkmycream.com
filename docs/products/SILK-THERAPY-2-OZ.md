    <li> Since hair solutions&#x27; effectiveness vary on the hair types, for an Asian Chinese who have thick black-brown hair, this serum works excellent on my hair. The way I use this is, after shampoo and conditioning, followed up with towel dry, I would apply a penny size drop to spread this over my hair scalp. At times, I will then either blow dry or (natural) air dry my hair. I find this keeps my hair moist and tender. You can tell the differences. I like this silk therapy hair solution.</li>
    <li> helps my hair stay shiny and smooth love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair serum and smells wonderful, I like the smaller size because you don&#x27;t use a lot and lasts forever!</li>

    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product -  Not heavy -  very light but does the job and smells great!!  Also priced well!!</li>
    <li> I wrap my hair every evening and i use a very very small amount of this. I apply it on the ends of my hair prior to wrapping it and i noticed my ends are more moisturized than they were before.</li>
    <li> I agree with one of the posts.  This is watered down.  I know for a fact that the one I purchased from the store a couple of months ago was not at all like this watered down product.  Save your money and do not purchase this!</li>
    <li> The size I was expecting to get I didn&#x27;t. However I guess because they couldn&#x27;t bother to help me to sell me the actual size I wanted so they told me to keep the one I already have and they would refund my money which they did .</li>
    <li> Great for everything, hair skin...</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this product works well for my hair. It calms frizz, makes my hair shinny, and makes it smell really good. You need to shake it well before you use it so you can get a thicker consistency.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and some for my g-daughters. Keeps hair from being fly-away but does not feel heavy. I rarely use hair products but a friend introduced me to this. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I apply this in the morning when my hair is dry from washing my hair the previous night. I usually have frizzy hair but this definitely tames it and make it feel more smooth. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This is a reorder for me. I had a 5 ounce bottle that has lasted me a couple years so I purchased a smaller bottle so I could take it with me when I travel.  My hair loves this product - makes it smooth and silky (I have very thick long course starting to grey hair)</li>
    <li> Use a tiny drop of this every day when I blow dry my  hair. You must be very careful not to use too much cause your hair WILL end up looking like an oil slick. Just a drop and you&#x27;re good to go. I use it on dry hair as well when my hair is a bit frizzy. It has a pleasant smell and makes my hair look healthy</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells great and you can wear as a body lotion or rub a little on your hands and put in your hair to keep down frizzies.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully to smooth hair down and smells great</li>
    <li> I have used Biosilk for years and I love it for my hair, but I ordered a bottle from this seller several weeks ago and it never arrived.  I just now noticed all of the reviews saying that it is not the real stuff or that it is watered down.  I guess they ran out, because I did not receive anything.  Amazon refunded my money and I ordered from somewhere else.</li>
