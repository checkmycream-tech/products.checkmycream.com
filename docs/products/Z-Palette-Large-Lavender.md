      <li>Love my palette.....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big and holds my Makeup Geek blushes perfectly!</li>
      <li>Most products already are magnetized though.</li>
      <li>I love that the shadows don&#x27;t move and I can arrange them</li>
      <li>That means I should be able to insert 4 rows of 7 across.</li>
      <li>Love my Z Palette.  </li>
      <li>Overall very happy with purchase.</li>
      <li>I love how I can rearrange colors as needed and as they are used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this beauty instead.</li>
      <li>This palette is spacious and will hold many of my shadows.</li>
      <li>Over all I love it and will buy more. :)</li>
      <li>Love it came right on time!!</li>
      <li>I got so excited when it was in my mail box!</li>
      <li>So excited to use this!</li>
      <li>the large size palette and the lavender color is gorgeous.</li>
      <li>:) it&#x27;s a light lavender color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m cheap, and didn&#x27;t want to spend the 20$ PLUS 6$ something shipping on the Makeup Geek website..</li>
      <li>I can fit inside.</li>
      <li>I use the warm setting for about 4 minutes then slide a knife in and try to gently pry the product out.</li>
      <li>Not that the cardboard has given me any issues so, to be fair, it hasn&#x27;t cause a problem so far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and the magnets that come with the palette are very useful.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t fit as many as I thought I could, but makes finding my color so much easier!</li>
      <li>Also, the higher alcohol content the better, so I purchased a 91% rubbing alcohol solution which has been working well for me.  </li>
      <li>But I was so excited to find this</li>
      <li>Im loving my new lavender Z pallet</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always amazing at how many MAC, Makeup Geek, and Urban Decay eye shadows</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light but very durable.</li>
      <li>I would have liked a few more color/pattern choices, but I am extremely pleased with my large Z palette in lavender!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a depotting machine, so I fill these up rather quickly.</li>
      <li>Im ready to depot everything!!</li>
      <li>Love being able to put all my single shadows in one palette.</li>
      <li>I love Z palettes in general.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Design/make isn&#x27;t too shabby, is actually pretty well done.</li>
      <li>Cracks will happen from time to time and can be fixed by applying rubbing alcohol (I use an ear dropper) and light pressure with your finger.</li>
      <li>Packaged really well, arrived on time!</li>
      <li>Thought it would be flimsy but pretty durable.</li>
      <li>So I recommend doing that first with each one you need to apply a magnet to.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is my second Z pallete purchase and I love it.</li>
      <li>Also, saves so much space being able to forego the individual packaging.  </li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t come out easily, I put it back in for a couple minutes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I was ready to toss them all and just purchase a palette.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>The point is to melt or degrade the adhesive so the product comes out without much force at all.</li>
      <li>Really like this palette.</li>
      <li>I also have depotted some wet and wild in their own z palette.  </li>
      <li>I love z-pallets they hold all my shadows and other products that don&#x27;t have a container.</li>
      <li>It has plenty of room for many different size products round, rectanlge &amp; square, the magnets it comes with for some reason don&#x27;t stick well to the products I have placed them on, unless I clean the bottoms off first.</li>
      <li>Super late review, since I bought it over last Christmas break, but I love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to organize my make up for so long, my cosmetic box was so full of eye shadows in every color.</li>
      <li>The three colored palettes are a size large, the plain black one is an xlarge, and the striped one is the xlarge domed palette, which is meant to fit baked products that require more depth.</li>
      <li>While I can easily get 7 across, no amount of fiddling or pressing or forcing allowed me to get 4 down for each row.</li>
      <li>No complaints, I would definitely re-purchase, thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly like the picture and arrived a day or two later, just before Christmas!</li>
      <li>:) Just wish it was a little bigger though, but I made do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this size z-palette it&#x27;s the perfect size for keeping all your favorite shadows in one place!</li>
    <li> i just love love love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This purchase was my 5th Z Palette. I find them to be an incredible means of space saving and organization. I depot all of my pressed and baked powders into these. I love the window and the choice of colors. The one downside is that the material used is cardboard; I would prefer a thick plastic frame. Not that the cardboard has given me any issues so, to be fair, it hasn&#x27;t cause a problem so far.  Also, the magnet could be stronger.  I find these are not as foolproof to travel with as I would wish.  My preferred method for depotting is the oven or, in my case, a convection oven. I use the warm setting for about 4 minutes then slide a knife in and try to gently pry the product out. If it doesn&#x27;t come out easily, I put it back in for a couple minutes. The point is to melt or degrade the adhesive so the product comes out without much force at all. Cracks will happen from time to time and can be fixed by applying rubbing alcohol (I use an ear dropper) and light pressure with your finger. Also, the higher alcohol content the better, so I purchased a 91% rubbing alcohol solution which has been working well for me.  You can see my finished pallettes in the provided pictures. The three colored palettes are a size large, the plain black one is an xlarge, and the striped one is the xlarge domed palette, which is meant to fit baked products that require more depth.</li>
    <li> I love it! I got so excited when it was in my mail box! Already de-potting all my makeup!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected. Super fast shipping. Can&#x27;t wait to fill it up!</li>
    <li> Love it came right on time!!</li>
    <li> I have all MY MORPHEBRUSHES $2 Eyeshadows in mine &amp; I will b getting the double next!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, wonderful item.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I love these z palettes have bought 3 of them now.  They work great for my depotted mac products.  I also have depotted some wet and wild in their own z palette.  They work great.  You can see what you have in them and they travel well.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Z Palette and I just love them! I&#x27;m a depotting machine, so I fill these up rather quickly. This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen the large size palette and the lavender color is gorgeous. I&#x27;m always amazing at how many MAC, Makeup Geek, and Urban Decay eye shadows I can fit inside. I have three for just eye shadows, then one with four Tarte blushes (3 full size, one half size), my Becca Highlight, a BareMinerals Ready foundation, a Nyx powder, a brow powder, and five various eye shadows too! These are just the best. Stock up!</li>
    <li> Love my palette..... Now if only Amazon sold make up geek pan eyeshadowss to fill the Damn thing!! Lol. Im ready to depot everything!!</li>
    <li> Super late review, since I bought it over last Christmas break, but I love it! Exactly like the picture and arrived a day or two later, just before Christmas! X3 simple cardboard box with inside magnates and I believed it came with sticky metal bottoms for non metal pans. Overall very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Love my Z Palettes! This was so handy for depoting my makeup and putting them all together in one place!</li>
    <li> I love z-pallets they hold all my shadows and other products that don&#x27;t have a container. I love that it&#x27;s magnetic too!</li>
    <li> Love this for my makeupgeek eyeshadows!!</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Im loving my new lavender Z pallet</li>
    <li> Fits my ABH and MAC eyeshadows perfectly. :)</li>
    <li> this one is a little too big for travel but it&#x27;s perfectly sized for my makeup desk. Holds a lot lot lot of products.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and was looking for to hold my makeup geek shadows</li>
    <li> I love my z palette! Sat down right away when I got it and organized my makeup! Thought it would be flimsy but pretty durable. Not that I&#x27;ve really put it at the worst.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this Z Palette!! There is no comparison between the Z Palette and other brands. Packing was great and shipping was FAST!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!! I&#x27;m cheap, and didn&#x27;t want to spend the 20$ PLUS 6$ something shipping on the Makeup Geek website.. and the fact that it only comes in black and hot pink. Ew. I&#x27;m so glad I found this beauty instead. There are tons of different colors on here as well. PS: I bought this with my own money. Would definitely re-purchase once I run out of space on this one!! x</li>
    <li> This Z Palette arrived gouged and puckered on the surface. It is still functional, but not presentable. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this pallet!! It&#x27;s big and holds my Makeup Geek blushes perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great z pallette. I would have liked a few more color/pattern choices, but I am extremely pleased with my large Z palette in lavender!</li>
    <li> Love the color and great quality. Cheaper than the official website.</li>
    <li> Love my Z Palette.  Keeps my eye shadows, blushes and powders handy.  I love that the shadows don&#x27;t move and I can arrange them however I want.  Also, saves so much space being able to forego the individual packaging.  Brillian idea!</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect size for my abh eyeshadows! ❤️</li>
    <li> Fast shipping :) it&#x27;s a light lavender color. Design/make isn&#x27;t too shabby, is actually pretty well done. It&#x27;s light weight and the magnets that come with the palette are very useful. Would I buy again? Yes I definitely will.</li>
    <li> Packaged really well, arrived on time! No complaints, I would definitely re-purchase, thanks!</li>
    <li> Love being able to put all my single shadows in one palette. It&#x27;s very light but very durable.</li>
    <li> I love Z palettes in general. My only con is that the magnetic stickers come off the pans I attach them to. I wish the stickers were more durabe, but they work regardless.</li>
    <li> So excited to use this! Good quality and cute color</li>
    <li> I like this Z-Palette, as it holds all of my pan shadows, blushes, and bronzers that I take on vacation. Comes with magnetic stickers for your items. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is my second Z pallete purchase and I love it. The size (Large) is perfect. It has plenty of room for many different size products round, rectanlge &amp; square, the magnets it comes with for some reason don&#x27;t stick well to the products I have placed them on, unless I clean the bottoms off first. They don&amp;#34;t appear dirty but everytime i use one and haven&#x27;t cleaned it off first they fall off eventually. So I recommend doing that first with each one you need to apply a magnet to. Most products already are magnetized though. Over all I love it and will buy more. :)</li>
    <li> It holds my Makeup Geek eye shadows perfectly! Only &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is it&#x27;s bigger than I thought so there&#x27;s lots of empty space. Oh well, guess I&#x27;ll just have to shop for more shadows to fill it!</li>
    <li> Really like this palette. My favorite color now holds my fave eye shadow colors! :) Just wish it was a little bigger though, but I made do.</li>
    <li> This is pretty awesome, hold all of my elf single shadows perfectly !</li>
    <li> This palette is spacious and will hold many of my shadows. Can&#x27;t wait to start the customization of my shadows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to organize my make up for so long, my cosmetic box was so full of eye shadows in every color. I was ready to toss them all and just purchase a palette. But I was so excited to find this and it&#x27;s amazing! I didn&#x27;t fit as many as I thought I could, but makes finding my color so much easier! The de potting was a little messy, I didn&#x27;t use heat just a metal pointy nail file which I broke towards the end. A few slips cracked some and made a little mess, but purchased a second for my BFF for her Xmas gift. I can&#x27;t wait to get another for my lipsticks!</li>
    <li> Love this! Condensed all my eye shadows beautifully. Do not always need the magnetic stickers if the eye shadow metal pan is thick(?) enough. Some stick on their own which is great. I love how I can rearrange colors as needed and as they are used. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> came with a little tiny dent in the corner but still love it.</li>
    <li> On the Z Palette website, the large size is advertized as holding 28 standard-sized round pans (26mm for MAC). That means I should be able to insert 4 rows of 7 across. While I can easily get 7 across, no amount of fiddling or pressing or forcing allowed me to get 4 down for each row. The palette I received holds 27. Caveat emptor to anyone hoping to store 28 standard MAC-sized pans.</li>
    <li> Love it holds everything in place!</li>
</ol>
