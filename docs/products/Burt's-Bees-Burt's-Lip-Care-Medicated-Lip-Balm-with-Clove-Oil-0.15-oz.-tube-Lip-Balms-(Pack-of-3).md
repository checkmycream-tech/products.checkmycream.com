      <li>I and my whole family love this flavor of berts bees especiall during the holiday months, but would like to have it as an option all year</li>

      <li>Bit I&#x27;m not sure I would spend this much for this special flavor on myself.</li>
      <li>It keeps my lips looking great, esp during the cold months</li>
      <li>I was completely devastated when it started disappearing from stores</li>
      <li>Have been searching high and low for any/all Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm with clove oil since the company discontinued it.</li>
      <li>Leaves your lips smooth and gives a little tingly sensation leaving your lips totally kissable.  </li>
      <li>The balm smells amazing, works quickly for severely chapped lips, and is neither too thick nor too thin.</li>
      <li>I feel I spent w-a-y too much for this.  </li>

    <li> The only lip balm I use!</li>
    <li> I wish I could buy this and stock up!</li>
    <li> Why Burt&#x27;s? This is my favorite lip balm and Burt&#x27;s discontinues it. Now I have to pay outlandish prices if I want to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I and my whole family love this flavor of berts bees especiall during the holiday months, but would like to have it as an option all year</li>
    <li> Have been searching high and low for any/all Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm with clove oil since the company discontinued it. Stumbled on these 3 packs being sold for a pricey amount, but if you love the original clove oil Burt&#x27;s Bees - it&#x27;s totally worth it! I ordered 2 - for 6 lip balms and I&#x27;m now set for a LONG time! All tubes came still sealed, in a padded envelope and SUPER FAST! Highly recommend! I cracked one open immediately and am I happy camper!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm but the smell and effect of the Clove Oil product is the best.  Not sure if Burt&#x27;s Bees stopped making it since I can no longer find it in any pharmacy, only at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivery on time</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone who LOVES this product so it&#x27;s all about the gift. I tried it and found it to be a very nice product. Bit I&#x27;m not sure I would spend this much for this special flavor on myself. I found it kind of drying.</li>
    <li> Best chap stick I&#x27;ve found in years.... Leaves your lips smooth and gives a little tingly sensation leaving your lips totally kissable.  No idea why they&#x27;d take it off the market!</li>
    <li> I love this Burts Bees and now this is discontinued.  Very sad and disappointing.  it really works well.  Hopefully they will bring it back.</li>
    <li> Why don&#x27;t they still make this. All I see on the store shelves is the tootie fruity flavors. I work in the sun all winter long  8-12000&lt;br /&gt;feet in the mountains of Colorado and this stuff really does the job for me!</li>
    <li> This chapstick is the ABSOLUTE best chapstick I have ever found and I do consider myself to be somewhat of a expert. I was completely devastated when it started disappearing from stores and I could only find extremely priced expired tubes on eBay. I even started learning how to make my own chapstick with peppermint and clove oil to try and reproduce a chapstick with similar effects. Has Burt&#x27;s Bees starting remaking this item, as the price has dropped significantly?</li>
    <li> Very soothing and healing. I contacted the company to see if this formula would be reintroduced, but the company does not plan to bring it back. Too bad! It is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
    <li> I cant believe this clove lip balm is being sold for 10 dollars a tube! You can get any other flavor at the drug store for about a dollar. This costs TEN TIMES THE PRICE!!! The clove oil lip balm, which used to be my favorite, is just not so good any more.</li>
    <li> Great product and really fast service</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband bc this was his favorite lip balm but had been discontinued. Although the price was very expensive compared to what it would have been offered for in a store, I accepted the price increase as it is discontinued. It came unopened and is exactly what he had been looking for (I really hope that Burt&#x27;s bees bring the clove back!)</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my lips. It keeps my lips looking great, esp during the cold months</li>
    <li> For some reason Burt&#x27;s Bees decided to remove this item from their product line.  The balm smells amazing, works quickly for severely chapped lips, and is neither too thick nor too thin.</li>
    <li> nothing like it..... wish the company still carried this item.  works well, taste and smell is great.  I was disappointed when it got discontinued.  BUT...WAY too expensive buying it here... feel seller is taking advantage of us that like the product but can&#x27;t get it anywhere else.  I feel I spent w-a-y too much for this.  I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.  Seller should offer it at a lower price.  I understand wanting to make a profit but it is WAY too expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> Clove flavor rocks, too bad they discontinued it!</li>
    <li> LOVED this product. Sadly it is no longer being produced.  Customer service at Burt&#x27;s Bees were pleasant, and quickly responsive when I wrote to inquire about this product&#x27;s availability-- and while their other lip balms are fine, this one was excellent for softening and healing extremely chapped-winter dry, lips.  It will be missed.</li>
