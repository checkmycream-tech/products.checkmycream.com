      <li>It is a great lotion to use in newborns and older kids, we start using this product 2 years ago.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite lotions, but the advanced care eucerin is better</li>
      <li>Because its fragrant free, I can wear my favorite perfumes, colognes &amp; oils.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great for sensitive skin, it leaves you hydrated and feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>The mineral oil in the Original Formula Eucerin seems to work better for my problem which is skin tears.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This is important if you have sensitivities to fragrances.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and absorbs quickly so</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and soaks in quickly.  </li>
      <li>its well worth the price just be aware you are purchasing more than one bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve converted several friends and family members from their brands - it&#x27;s just really good lotion.</li>
      <li>This lotion does a great job moisturizing my whole body and seems to last about six- eight hours.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s very light, soaks in right away, and keeps my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Very quickly absorbed, I can put my clothes on right after application.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs instantly and my skin generally looks great.</li>
      <li>We have been using this lotion for my daughter and son as they have dry skin and Eczema and so far working great.</li>
      <li>It works great, but the bottle was too small.  </li>
      <li>I am 70 years old and my skin tears easily.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin - Daily Replenishing Lotion is light &amp; soothing &amp; leaves me comfortable all day.</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday use and control of ezcema and all over dry skin without a greasy feeling that Eucerin calming cream has.</li>
      <li>This lotion sinks in quickly but is a little sticky (maybe from the petroleum) and doesn&#x27;t leave the smooth feeling of the original which seems to protect more.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a better, greasy, slick, and protective feeling, there&#x27;s always the original Eucerin cream or their petroleum based Aquaphor.</li>
      <li>Has been very helpful during her chemotherapy.</li>
      <li>This is more for the working man with rough hands, chapped, etc.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is also gentle on skin.  </li>
      <li>Seems kind of expensive, but I buy it on subscribe &amp; save, making the price a bit more tolerable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy the original formula in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave Eucerin, in general, and Daily Replenishing, in particular, another try because now I really like it.  </li>
      <li>Better for daily use than the Eucerin Intensive Repair, which contains alpha hydroxy -- too strong for everyday.  </li>
      <li>Very cheap to use since a little amount mousturizes a large area of my body.</li>
      <li>Its my new standard for lotion, which is important for me since I have to deal with eczema.</li>
      <li>I live in a very arid climate and winter time is particularly drying to my skin.  </li>
      <li>I struggled with fancier, more luscious smelling brands before picking Eucerin Daily Replenishing up in the grocery store one day, and I have not looked back.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this lotion for people with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t require a really heavy-duty moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I have normal to oil skin.</li>
      <li>The bottle was sent as a normal USPS letter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on you for long after applying this lotion.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite lotions - very lightweight, absorbs quickly, not sticky and no lasting scent.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Keeps my wife skin very soft and moist, but is not oily or gummy.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone including those with very sensitive skin like myself.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
      <li>leaves skin feeling so soft, just like a baby&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I keep mine near the computer and use it for elbows, hand cream and after showers when I am staying in for the evening.  </li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s kind of thin</li>
      <li>As you get older and suffer from ailments that can cause dry skin, it is refreshing to find a product like Eucerin to soften you up and make you think your skin is a little bit younger after you rub it on.  </li>
      <li>However, it does work out pretty well on my dry skin in general.</li>
      <li>If I had to live on a deserted island for a year with only one comfort item...</li>
      <li>Not fun, but a function of aging and it is necessary to keep my skin smooth, especially on my hands and arms where I get tears.</li>
      <li>I do generally have to wipe my hands after an application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years for my dry skin, which is only getting dryer as I get older.</li>
      <li>I live in a very dry climate and have normal to dry skin and this lotion is moisturizing enough for me during the summer and it doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky after applying it.  </li>
      <li>I have very dry &amp; very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin or sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This lotion works well and although it does have a slightly greasy feel to it, it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>

<li> This lotion works well and although it does have a slightly greasy feel to it, it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
<li> No good smell coming from it mind you, but no bad smells either...</li>
<li> Non-greasy but long lasting.  </li>
<li> I have a case of really, really dry hands that flake, itch, burn, sting, open up and inflame.</li>
<li> This is the only product that works on my chronic dry skin.</li>
<li> and not very old either.</li>
<li> I use the Daily Replenishing as well as the Intensive formula; the Daily is less greasy and absorbs faster, while the Intensive is a repair miracle...</li>
<li> I use it every day to offset our dry climate.</li>
<li> dry skin  </li>
<li> I use this every day after my shower &amp; it has virtually eliminated my winter dry skin issues.  </li>
<li> I had a issue with dry skin</li>
<li> It&#x27;s even repaired my dry and cracked heels of my feet.   </li>
<li> I will be ordering the larger 16oz the next round.</li>
<li> so it only takes a little to spread around on your skin.  </li>
<li> : I&#x27;m one who always compares to save a little money, and often I opt for generic.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t write such long sentences.  </li>
<li> I would like to note that I also tried the other Eucerin offerings, but they, for some reason, didn&#x27;t do the trick</li>
<li> it works where the other well known lotions stop working.   </li>
<li> I started using it when my daughter was just born because all the other lotions that I had purchased seem to cause a slight rash on her body.  </li>
<li> It has very little scent and keeps my dry skin in check over the winter.  </li>
<li> Little sticky.</li>
<li> I RELY on this lotion so heavily that I cannot go a day without.  </li>
<li> This lotion does help, but in comparison to the original petroleum jelly/cream base, it just doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
<li> but I sometimes detect a very slight \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; odor.  </li>
<li> softens my skin without the heavy icky feeling.</li>
<li> Not too thick or thin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Eucerin and have been using it for years.  I recommend this product to anyone including those with very sensitive skin like myself.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for sensitive skin, it leaves you hydrated and feeling refreshed.My doctor recommended it and i will never use another lotion</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this because she has psorisis and it works out well for her. I get it on subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t run out. It is a good price.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite lotions - very lightweight, absorbs quickly, not sticky and no lasting scent.  This lotion is also gentle on skin.  I can use it on freshly-shaved legs without burning or stinging, and I&#x27;ve even used it on my face in a pinch without any adverse effects.  I like that it&#x27;s kind of thin so it only takes a little to spread around on your skin.  I live in a very dry climate and have normal to dry skin and this lotion is moisturizing enough for me during the summer and it doesn&#x27;t leave me sticky after applying it.  As for the scent, I use sunflower oil for cooking and the smell of this lotion is reminiscent of that.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant and the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on you for long after applying this lotion.  I would recommend this lotion for people with sensitive skin who don&#x27;t require a really heavy-duty moisturizer.</li>
    <li> i always order this and it a good cream and it comes in perfect condition, well packaged. and not very old either.</li>
    <li> Better for daily use than the Eucerin Intensive Repair, which contains alpha hydroxy -- too strong for everyday.  Non-greasy but long lasting.  Its my new standard for lotion, which is important for me since I have to deal with eczema.</li>

If you are looking for a better, greasy, slick, and protective feeling, there&#x27;s always the original Eucerin cream or their petroleum based Aquaphor.</li>
    <li> it works where the other well known lotions stop working.   Great for:  dry skin  legs with circulation problems  good for body massage  it does not leave residues.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Keeps my wife skin very soft and moist, but is not oily or gummy.  Has been very helpful during her chemotherapy.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite lotions, but the advanced care eucerin is better</li>
    <li> I use this every day after my shower &amp; it has virtually eliminated my winter dry skin issues.  Seems kind of expensive, but I buy it on subscribe &amp; save, making the price a bit more tolerable.</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic.  It has very little scent and keeps my dry skin in check over the winter.  Easy to apply and soaks in quickly.  Not too thick or thin.  Recommended by cosmeticscop.com.  Love it and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Personally, I like scented moisturizers - example KAI.  This is more for the working man with rough hands, chapped, etc.  The price is good but remember it is basicly a cheap moisturizer.  I keep mine near the computer and use it for elbows, hand cream and after showers when I am staying in for the evening.  You don&#x27;t even know you have it on.  Men should like this stuff.  Give me aroma, scent and perfume.</li>
    <li> this lotion rocks. its well worth the price just be aware you are purchasing more than one bottle. Go for it!</li>
    <li> This lotion works well and although it does have a slightly greasy feel to it, it didn&#x27;t bother me too much. I do generally have to wipe my hands after an application. What kills it for me is the smell. To me, it reeks like cat urine. I&#x27;ve asked others around the office and most aren&#x27;t bothered by it. I assume this is because this product is fragrance-free - I won&#x27;t be looking for this feature in my next lotion.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s something that I never knew before:  This product is \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; which means it has no fragrance.  Some products are labeled, \\&quot;scent free\\&quot; which means they have fragrances but you cannot smell them.  This is important if you have sensitivities to fragrances. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for several weeks now.  WOW!  It is really a good product that goes on without that greasy feeling.  It&#x27;s even repaired my dry and cracked heels of my feet.   I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of lotions for this and none have worked until I tried the Eucerin Daily Replenishing lotion.</li>
    <li> As you get older and suffer from ailments that can cause dry skin, it is refreshing to find a product like Eucerin to soften you up and make you think your skin is a little bit younger after you rub it on.  Whew!  I usually don&#x27;t write such long sentences.  But I got the momentum going.  Must be the Eucerin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Eucerin lotion for my baby girl for almost two years now.  I started using it when my daughter was just born because all the other lotions that I had purchased seem to cause a slight rash on her body.  My pediatrician recommended that I switch to Eucerin and we have been using it since!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I use the Daily Replenishing as well as the Intensive formula; the Daily is less greasy and absorbs faster, while the Intensive is a repair miracle... so for me they both have good applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I&#x27;m one who always compares to save a little money, and often I opt for generic. But not when it comes to Eucerin. I&#x27;ve converted several friends and family members from their brands - it&#x27;s just really good lotion.</li>
    <li> It is a great lotion to use in newborns and older kids, we start using this product 2 years ago.</li>
    <li> I live in a very arid climate and winter time is particularly drying to my skin.  This lotion does a great job moisturizing my whole body and seems to last about six- eight hours.  Very quickly absorbed, I can put my clothes on right after application.  Is it only me?  -- but I sometimes detect a very slight \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; odor.  Not enough to make me look for another lotion, however.  This does the job.</li>
    <li> softens my skin without the heavy icky feeling. No scent just the way I like it. Very cheap to use since a little amount mousturizes a large area of my body. Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has sunflower seed oil and petroleum instead of mineral oil.  The mineral oil in the Original Formula Eucerin seems to work better for my problem which is skin tears.  I am 70 years old and my skin tears easily.  Not fun, but a function of aging and it is necessary to keep my skin smooth, especially on my hands and arms where I get tears. This lotion sinks in quickly but is a little sticky (maybe from the petroleum) and doesn&#x27;t leave the smooth feeling of the original which seems to protect more. I&#x27;ll buy the original formula in the future.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I like it because it&#x27;s very light, soaks in right away, and keeps my skin soft. There&#x27;s no fragrance, thank goodness.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this has been the only moisturizer that has worked for me. Also doctor recommended to me.</li>
    <li> I use it every day to offset our dry climate.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it was a pack of 3 bottles, as mentioned in the title and description. I only received 1 bottle, for $27. The bottle was sent as a normal USPS letter.</li>
    <li> I know that the purpose of this version is that it&#x27;s not greasy but I find it to be way too thin and watery feeling.  It takes me three pumps just to cover my legs and feel moisturized.  I&#x27;d rather one pump of the heavier version, which I&#x27;m switching to.</li>
    <li> I have normal to oil skin. This lotion suits me well. Little sticky. No fragrance at all. Obviously, lanolin is included.</li>
    <li> We have been using this lotion for my daughter and son as they have dry skin and Eczema and so far working great.I will recommond this product.</li>
    <li> When undergoing radiation, my doctors recommended Eucerin healing ointment for my burned skin and I have used this product since then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave Eucerin, in general, and Daily Replenishing, in particular, another try because now I really like it.  My skin is moisturized yet not greasy.  Because its fragrant free, I can wear my favorite perfumes, colognes &amp; oils.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion on the market and I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin or sensitive skin. I bought this online cause it was 4 bucks cheaper than Walmart. Thx Amazon</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works on my chronic dry skin. It is not heavy or greasy. I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> For general day to day lotion for skin this is great! This is the one my Dermatologist recommends and the one I like as well. Goes on easily and absorbs quickly so don&#x27;t use a lot of it when applying it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for everyday use and control of ezcema and all over dry skin without a greasy feeling that Eucerin calming cream has.</li>
    <li> I had a issue with dry skin and this is the perfect product.  It works great, but the bottle was too small.  I will be ordering the larger 16oz the next round.</li>
    <li> I have very dry &amp; very sensitive skin. When I get out of the shower, my skin is calling out for moisture &amp; Eucerin is the ONLY lotion I can use that offers comfort with absolutely no irritation. Eucerin - Daily Replenishing Lotion is light &amp; soothing &amp; leaves me comfortable all day. If I had to live on a deserted island for a year with only one comfort item... this is what I&#x27;d chose to take with me.</li>
    <li> Items like this are the reason I could never be a contender on a show like Survivor.  I RELY on this lotion so heavily that I cannot go a day without.  I struggled with fancier, more luscious smelling brands before picking Eucerin Daily Replenishing up in the grocery store one day, and I have not looked back.  I would like to note that I also tried the other Eucerin offerings, but they, for some reason, didn&#x27;t do the trick and I would always end up with itchy spots on my legs.  I am a daily shaver so I need something dependable and non-greasy, and this lotion fits that bill.  No good smell coming from it mind you, but no bad smells either... :)  If you&#x27;re looking for a great day-in-and-day-out lotion, this could be the one for you!</li>
    <li> leaves skin feeling so soft, just like a baby&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist...multiple packages at one time saves time and money.</li>
    <li> As advertised, great price &amp; quick delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years for my dry skin, which is only getting dryer as I get older. It absorbs instantly and my skin generally looks great.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years, and am now 80!!!</li>
