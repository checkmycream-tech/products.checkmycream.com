      <li>I have been using this product for since it was first advertised on Tv and think it is the best for under eye dark circles</li>
      <li>The cream is normally bright white</li>
      <li>She first confirmed it should be a cream, then after she heard my concerns (should this product be a cream or a wax), she said,</li>
      <li>one of my fav eye creams for dark circles, goes on nicely under makeup isnt cakey all all, very smooth...</li>
      <li>This product us very good, I had black circles And bags under my eyes,making  me look old and tied</li>
      <li>Very unreputable seller--so unlike anything on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Love how smooth eyes are and for the dark circles it helps too, I would recommend this eye cream to my friends.</li>
      <li>First product to have made any difference.  </li>
      <li>First time in my life, the advertised product really does what it says.</li>
      <li>I just hope more people come clean, give their reviews of how this products a ripoff, after the way they treated me with a money-back guarentee that was never given, because-oops they never received it-I only wanted a refund on the last bottle that had not been used-</li>
      <li>So I tried this product, ladies, this product really works, use it every day and every night  </li>
      <li>I am very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>Really like this.</li>
      <li>star is too much for them.the company charges your bank account with out</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this through the manufacturer for the past several years and it really does a great job at lightening the under-eye circles.  </li>
      <li>This Hydrolyze stuff is no more or less effective than much more economical products I have tried before, so there&#x27;s no reason to spend the extra money.  </li>
      <li>I sure didn&#x27;t have this type of cash to waste on a product that is make believe.</li>
      <li>When I noted the color/consistency differences, I requested a refund and was denied because he insists they only use fresh product.  </li>
      <li>I opened up this product and it was filled with some other substance that was brown.  </li>
      <li>This is a new product line\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, \\&quot;wax like cream\\&quot;?</li>
      <li>it keeps my eyes  very young &#x3D;  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 77  year old woman  &#x3D; never taken for my age&#x3D;  </li>
      <li>I am 48 years old</li>
      <li>Also, although the pictures of the actual product show a white, fluffy looking cream, the stuff is actually a pasty yellow, which kind of put me off.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this worked, but after a few months it was hopeful thinking.  </li>

<li> ,the first time I put this one on it burned a little, which is not normal.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this Hydrolyze is real or not.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is very hard to spread on the skin, especially the skin right under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Was hard when received, used to try it was allergic, they do not except return, very unsatisfactory</li>
<li> Only using Hydrolyze once a day still keeps the dark circles away,&amp; makes it last</li>
<li> Product is not as described- dry &amp; clumps on the skin when applied.  </li>
<li> and I do not have a single wrinkle under my eyes.</li>
<li> This is the one product that actually helps my black circles.</li>
<li> Have only been using a few weeks but see some improvement.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a scam and a big waste of money.</li>
<li> This product is usually an off white color.  </li>

<li> So if you&#x27;re concern is dark circles,this may be the answer for you,too.</li>
<li> It took awhile but after a couple of weeks I noticed the dark circles under my eyes were less noticeable.</li>
<li> Product was dried up in jar....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased it in the store in the past - the color is a little lighter and it comes in a box along with details/directions.  </li>
<li> Again, I was so ashame of my eyes, I would not look in people&#x27;s face, that&#x27;s how bad my eyes look, but now, I feel pretty again, try it</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t work, I feel so sorry for those who have wasted their money on it.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I found it did nothing</li>
<li> something was wrong with this product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s over-rated, over exaggerated, and from viewing the ingredient list there isn&#x27;t anything in it that shows it works.</li>
<li> Boy am I stupid, Just because they paid some dermatologists to say it works with some fake results isn&#x27;t proof, it&#x27;s when an unbiased group tests it out that it&#x27;s proven.</li>
<li> This is a horrible product, and everyone who is raving about it is&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Every time I use this treatment, it makes my eyes ache and fill like they have sand in them. I can&#x27;t use this cream because of that.</li>
    <li> Product is not as described- dry &amp; clumps on the skin when applied.  If I saved the packaging for this product, I would return it.</li>
    <li> I see improvement already</li>
    <li> This product us very good, I had black circles And bags under my eyes,making  me look old and tied, people use to look at me and talk about me And the way my eyes were looking. So I tried this product, ladies, this product really works, use it every day and every night  you will see the difference in a month time, it makes your eyes look youthful again. You will start looking pretty again and feeling very good about yourself Again, I was so ashame of my eyes, I would not look in people&#x27;s face, that&#x27;s how bad my eyes look, but now, I feel pretty again, try it guys It works.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all. I am very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> It took awhile but after a couple of weeks I noticed the dark circles under my eyes were less noticeable. good product.</li>
    <li> This Hydrolyze stuff is no more or less effective than much more economical products I have tried before, so there&#x27;s no reason to spend the extra money.  Also, although the pictures of the actual product show a white, fluffy looking cream, the stuff is actually a pasty yellow, which kind of put me off.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product, and everyone who is raving about it is&lt;br /&gt;A. Works for the company. Yes, they are lying. B. Having wishful thinking, there isn&#x27;t any improvement, they want it to works, so they see it&#x27;s working, but it&#x27;s not. C. They think just b&lt;br /&gt; I used this for three months, so did my wife, with NO results. It&#x27;s a scam and a big waste of money. It&#x27;s over-rated, over exaggerated, and from viewing the ingredient list there isn&#x27;t anything in it that shows it works. They got me to purchase it with clinical results, so I believed it. Boy am I stupid, Just because they paid some dermatologists to say it works with some fake results isn&#x27;t proof, it&#x27;s when an unbiased group tests it out that it&#x27;s proven. This doesn&#x27;t work, I feel so sorry for those who have wasted their money on it. I sure didn&#x27;t have this type of cash to waste on a product that is make believe. I just hope more people come clean, give their reviews of how this products a ripoff, after the way they treated me with a money-back guarentee that was never given, because-oops they never received it-I only wanted a refund on the last bottle that had not been used-I HAD  A TRACKING NUMBER-PROOF THEY RECEIVED IT!- well, after this I truly hope the company get&#x27;s what it deserves and goes bankrupt, because this product DOESN&#x27;T WORK, IT ONLY CLOGS PORES AND IRRITATE SKIN.</li>
    <li> one of my fav eye creams for dark circles, goes on nicely under makeup isnt cakey all all, very smooth...</li>
    <li> The cream itself is almost a solid--hard to use on the tender under eye area.  I would not order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this through the manufacturer for the past several years and it really does a great job at lightening the under-eye circles.  However, I bought it through &amp;#34;smart steve&amp;#34; and it was a different color, consistency and just doesn&#x27;t work well.  When I noted the color/consistency differences, I requested a refund and was denied because he insists they only use fresh product.  The manufacturer disagrees and there isn&#x27;t an exp. date, so I was STUCK!!!  Very unreputable seller--so unlike anything on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Have only been using a few weeks but see some improvement.  First product to have made any difference.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I opened up this product and it was filled with some other substance that was brown.  This product is usually an off white color.  Do NOT buy from this company.  The material was a solid.  This is supposed to be cream.</li>
    <li> the product is terrible .one star is too much for them.the company charges your bank account with out your permission.&lt;br /&gt;their customer services are so impolite and rude.&lt;br /&gt;it is not what they say on their TV show. I got charged for $75 two times whit out letting me know!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I have been buying it for years and would not buy anything else. First time in my life, the advertised product really does what it says. I am 48 years old and I do not have a single wrinkle under my eyes. I would defenetly recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> I originally used a trial version of this product and loved the results, so I bought the full size. Unfortunately, I found it did nothing and I stopped using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this Hydrolyze is real or not.  I&#x27;ve purchased it in the store in the past - the color is a little lighter and it comes in a box along with details/directions.  This one came alone in an envelope, i.e. no box, directions, contents etc.,the first time I put this one on it burned a little, which is not normal.</li>
    <li> Was hard when received, used to try it was allergic, they do not except return, very unsatisfactory</li>
    <li> I brought this eye cream at local BJ&#x27;s yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Last night when I opened it, the cream is not cream, it is a wax like yellowish thing.&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to spread on the skin, especially the skin right under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;I called Hydrolyze customer service tonight. She first confirmed it should be a cream, then after she heard my concerns (should this product be a cream or a wax), she said, \\&quot;oh, this product should be a wax like cream. This is a new product line\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, \\&quot;wax like cream\\&quot;? Who ever heard such word for eye cream?&lt;br /&gt;The she asked me what I want to do - \\&quot;do you want to return the product or continue use it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;With the customer service like this, I will ever use this eye cream any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, plus I do NOT believe a \\&quot;wax like eye cream\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-p.s. it irritated the skin under my eye. I have red and bumpy skin this morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for since it was first advertised on Tv and think it is the best for under eye dark circles</li>
    <li> The lid didn&#x27;t even match the product and it was improperly sealed.  The cream is normally bright white this was tooth decay yellow.  I should have gone by what another customer posted before I purchased this product.  I did get my money back but I had to pay for a box to send it back.  I should have realized by the reduced price something was wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Love how smooth eyes are and for the dark circles it helps too, I would recommend this eye cream to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 77  year old woman  &#x3D; never taken for my age&#x3D;  it keeps my eyes  very young &#x3D;  no lines &#x3D;no circles  nothing  &#x3D;very happy with hydroxatone  &#x3D;</li>
    <li> At first I thought this worked, but after a few months it was hopeful thinking.  I ordered both under eye types, but both did not seem to have an effect.</li>
    <li> Really like this. Not greasy and covers wrinkles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hydrolyze for years now,once a day,before bed.I have inherited very dark circles,&amp; spent a fortune trying other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t even need concealer! I only gave it four stars because I don&#x27;t find it does anything for bags or lines.I use Clinique All About Eyes Riche in the a.m. This does help the bags/lines,&amp; it has caffeine in it,which tightens the skin around the eyes.Only using Hydrolyze once a day still keeps the dark circles away,&amp; makes it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So if you&#x27;re concern is dark circles,this may be the answer for you,too.It does have a yellow,waxyish consistency,but IT WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ***TIP*** I googled Hydrolyze,&amp; found it elsewhere for $25.99!!</li>
    <li> I seen nothing change..very dissapointed.would not recomend. It claimed to help bags under eyes .What a joke.I didn&#x27;t even want to put one star.</li>
    <li> Product price great shipped at once happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Product was dried up in jar....</li>
    <li> This is the one product that actually helps my black circles. They are noticeably reduced.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and have not noticed any noticeable improvements. Would not spend the money on this product again.</li>
