### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent Product!  </li>
      <li>This is another excellent shaver.</li>
      <li>Panasonic is the best in the world at electric shavers.</li>
      <li>The recharger itself is an excellent design.</li>
      <li>Impressive smoothness and build quality</li>
      <li>After using Remington shavers almost exclusively, I tried Panasonic and am very impressed.</li>
      <li>Years ago a friend told me that Panasonic makes the best electric shavers and I have used them ever since.</li>
      <li>This seems to work best for me.</li>
      <li>After learning the \\&quot;patterns\\&quot; to use, I get an excellent shave with no razor burn or redness.  </li>
      <li>After using it now for about a month, I find it does the job beautifully and for the price, can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t use the head to trim my mustache very good.</li>
      <li>It cuts really good!</li>
      <li>lasts 9 shaves and does great job.  </li>
      <li>but it does great on that day-after-shaving beard and the trimmer</li>
      <li>A great value for the price of it</li>
      <li>Great buy for the money.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>is a great value.  </li>
      <li>For the price, I have been happy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product with a great deal on shipping.</li>
      <li>The shaver is great for the price.  </li>
      <li>Not something you&#x27;d want to use for full-time shaving, but great for touch-ups and travel.  </li>
      <li>I found this to be a very nice shaver for the price.</li>
      <li>The beard trimmer is also good for \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This newer curved one seems to be just as good.</li>
      <li>I loved it.</li>
      <li>The trimmer is good on that unit</li>
      <li>I gave four stars because I had to own 2 shavers to be happy.</li>
      <li>this is good for the price.</li>
      <li>We have never had any problems with it, and it is a good shaver at a good price.</li>
      <li>Again, not the best, but for $29 and waterproof, a pretty good deal.</li>
      <li>For the price I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Is really great in the shower and works quite well with many name brand shaving cremes and soaps.    </li>
      <li>/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaver is nice size and shape; fits well in your hand.</li>
      <li>It is a nice shaver.</li>
      <li>and I find it quite nice for the price.</li>
      <li>so I own 2 panasonic shavers.</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s a good value for people like me who are too cheap to spend a lot on a shaver.</li>
      <li>gives a good comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Having used a variety of shavers from Remmington, Norelco and Braun, the Panasonic ES4025SC is by far the best yet.  </li>
      <li>trick to getting a close shave is to use a very light touch and experiment with vertical and horizontal strokes to match the grain of the beard.  </li>
      <li>Hey this is a quick good shave.  </li>
      <li>Gets a bit problematic if you let it go for more than two days.</li>
      <li>battery life is ok..</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband about six months ago, and he has been pleased.  </li>
      <li>take my word for it, that can&#x27;t be said for most of the others.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more like a Don Johnson 5&#x27;o clock shadow maker.... &lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>sure how this can be called a shaver.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with my order.</li>
      <li>but I mostly use this to trim my mustache.</li>
      <li>If you want all the bells and whistles, go ahead and pay much more.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this shaver thinking that I could buy it for slightly more than I would have paid for a replacement screen and shaving head.  </li>
      <li>This might be because it takes so many passes over your face to shave it</li>
      <li>The 2 head is better  for this.</li>
      <li>In conclusion: this shaver deserves more than 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>But when I do shave, I expect more than 50% of my neck hairs to get clipped.</li>
      <li>It is especially effective on the body hair, but also works well on facial and head hair thicknesses.  </li>
      <li>i have to go over my face so many times, i walk away redder than a  &lt;br /&gt;redneck</li>
      <li>and I have tried $85+ shavers that did not work any better than this..</li>
      <li>This latest purchase is my 4th on the 8000 series.</li>
      <li>one like most straight-head shavers is not the best around the neckline and you may need to learn a few tricks on ur own to get a close shave around that area.  </li>
      <li>, it is very light (that&#x27;s good) since it is very plastic.  </li>
      <li>Very good if you shave daily.      </li>
      <li>At $30.00 RIGHT ON Panasonic!!  </li>
      <li>This is a very adequate shaver for the money.  </li>
      <li>EASY TO USE,CHARGE,CLEAN,ETC.REASONABLY</li>
      <li>I liked the older one hour charge models better.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s the advantage?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is fine.  </li>
      <li>The one fault is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to work that well (the Braun trimmer did a much better job), but luckily I don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
      <li>The foil does not cover as large an area as some shavers so it takes a couple of minutes longer to shave, but it does a really nice job</li>
      <li>I like close, smooth shaves.  </li>
      <li>Easy clean features under running water.</li>
      <li>I tried this Panasonic after it received a good rating in Consumer Reports this spring (well, not THIS model, but one nearly like it).</li>
      <li>Good battery life, but, again, my beard is not particularly heavy.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>This one is kind of small but cuts great.  </li>
      <li>Works great dry</li>
      <li>I never had to change the blades, just had to keep it clean and charged.     </li>
      <li>It is extremely easy to clean and I like this feature very much.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good shave at a moderate price, I would opt for this shaver.</li>
      <li>This Panasonic does have a less-than-full blade and groomer across the body of the razor, so more time needed to do the whole job....</li>
      <li>But it gives a satisfying, close shave that really does rival a blade and cost me $30.  </li>
      <li>It worked fairly well with shaving cream, but never quite shaved me close enough.</li>
      <li>There are tricks to using an electric, you have to pull the face, to stretch it, to get a good shave as the blade and foil run across, but that becomes second nature.....</li>
      <li>you know the main advantage of this razor compared to most?</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It does an adequate job</li>
      <li>I use it when I have to do a quick shave to take off the five o-clock shadow.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have to describe it as barely adequate and frankly, as soon as I get what I consider to be my \\&quot;money&#x27;s worth\\&quot; out of it</li>
      <li>It recharges relatively quickly too.</li>
      <li>It is used for total body shaving on a daily basis and is the best electric razor I have found in twenty years.  </li>
      <li>Normally within 2-3 weeks most people can adapt to it.  </li>
      <li>This is pretty cheap electrical shave</li>
      <li>(It gives me five good shaves between charges, but I take long shaves.)</li>
      <li>The new one does look better, though.</li>
      <li>After a couple of years of use I find it more practical to buy a new one than buy replacement blades/foils or batteries.  </li>
      <li>Yet the feature is good for those who suffer from a rash or itch with a dry shave.</li>
      <li>This is a great little shaver.  </li>
      <li>It provides a very close comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>no electric is worth that.</li>
      <li>It cuts as well or better than my old Remington.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent Product!  If you have a heavy beard, give it a shot.  Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Just a thin coat of Cetaphil, and Voila! The softest closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  The Wet Dry keeps the face in great shape.  Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great for the price.  It provides a very close comfortable shave.  No problems.  I have not checked the battery life yet, but will soon.</li>
    <li> man i bought this thing by reading good reviews, i was convince by reviews but later all when i used this thing, it did not clean cut my shave infact my cheeks where all reddish and at some areas were bleeding...    SO ALL IN ALL... IT SUCKED to me!!!</li>
    <li> it does the job definitely, not as close as a normal shaver but very close...nice</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have had all the brand name razors plus ones you only get at the no-name stores. this is good for the price. When I go to the membership/club stores, they carry ONE razor for $139.00.....no electric is worth that. This Panasonic does have a less-than-full blade and groomer across the body of the razor, so more time needed to do the whole job....you know the main advantage of this razor compared to most? You can trim \\&quot;personal body parts\\&quot; with it and you won&#x27;t bleed....take my word for it, that can&#x27;t be said for most of the others. And if your skin is slightly wet, it won&#x27;t kill the razor.....take it to the gym, etc.   There are tricks to using an electric, you have to pull the face, to stretch it, to get a good shave as the blade and foil run across, but that becomes second nature.....too bad this brand is difficult to find in the retail stores, but with Amazon, who cares?</li>
    <li> This is the second electric razor of this model I have purchased.  It is used for total body shaving on a daily basis and is the best electric razor I have found in twenty years.  The shave is smooth without biting, even on the sensitive areas.  The blades stay sharp even with tough arm and chest hair removal.  The previous razor lasted about five years before the battery became inconsistent with the charge.</li>
    <li> Years ago a friend told me that Panasonic makes the best electric shavers and I have used them ever since. After a while they start to get noisy so I just order a new one and start fresh. This happens before the battery ever goes bad or before it needs a new foil or blade. Even there least expensive ones like this work fine. I use it in the shower each morning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver mainly for the wet/dry pop-up trimer but found it weak for the task.  I had to upgrade to the panasonic 8000 wet/dry shavers.  These are pricey but function for 10 mo0nths on average.  This latest purchase is my 4th on the 8000 series.</li>
    <li> After using Remington shavers almost exclusively, I tried Panasonic and am very impressed. It shaves as well as the Remington in dry mode and surpasses the Remington when using the wet mode. Impressive smoothness and build quality</li>
    <li> Ever get sticker shock when you go to replace those foils and cutter blocks on electric shavers? Yep . . . \\&quot;ben air dun gnat\\&quot; as the old country boys say. As long as Panasonic makes little inexpensive shavers like this one .... I&#x27;ll never go through that again. I&#x27;ll just buy a whole new razor. I picked this little gem up for $[...] on Amazon.com It cuts really good! You can shave wet or dry. It has a double foil. The foil does not cover as large an area as some shavers so it takes a couple of minutes longer to shave, but it does a really nice job and I have a pretty thick beard. The ability to shave wet and with shaving cream reduces neck irritation.    Comes with a small, unique charger base that plugs into an outlet and the shaver sits nice and tidy out of the way.    Want to save some money? Pick up one of these today. Panasonic is the best in the world at electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a very nice shaver for the price. Easy to handle, Does a nice job of shaving on my average beard, and Holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband about six months ago, and he has been pleased.  It was his first electric shaver, so it took about a week or so to get used to it.  He also had better luck when he used it daily, rather than alternating between it and a blade.    Pros&#x3D; long-lasting battery, close shave   Cons&#x3D; has trouble with some facial contours, esp. neck</li>
    <li> I received it only in a week and this machine really performance good, but one thing I had to complain is the charging time is a little bit long.</li>
    <li> I have been a razor guy my whole life. I have been wanting to try an electric razor, especially a wet/dry one, for years now. I tried this Panasonic after it received a good rating in Consumer Reports this spring (well, not THIS model, but one nearly like it). I gave it 3 weeks hoping that my face would eventually get used to it. It worked fairly well with shaving cream, but never quite shaved me close enough. My beard grows flat on my face, making it hard for the razor to pick up and shave. Several times I would look in the mirror and see a single hair that didn&#x27;t get cut at all. In the end I wound up putting it in the drawer and pulling out the old trusty razor.  On the one hand I don&#x27;t feel bad because it was not too expensive to experiment with, but somehow I think that if I had bought a more expensive brand I would have had better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many an expensive electric razor and for some reason this cheapo has outlasted them all.  No, it won&#x27;t mow your lawn but it does great on that day-after-shaving beard and the trimmer works well on that mane of backhair you have.  It recharges relatively quickly too.</li>
    <li> Bad shaver dry or wet. I spend twice the time I used to with a hand shaver. I would not recommend to any one to buy this item.</li>
    <li> Hey this is a quick good shave.  If you are in a hurry or just running behind I would recommend this shaver to get the job done.  You can use it in the shower also.</li>
    <li> Having used a variety of shavers from Remmington, Norelco and Braun, the Panasonic ES4025SC is by far the best yet.  The most obvious improvement is how quiet the unit operates.  Others sound like a buzz-saw, but you barely hear this one.  It is especially effective on the body hair, but also works well on facial and head hair thicknesses.  The Panasonic also never bites, as often occurs with other shavers.  Unless they discontinue this model, I will never buy a different shaver again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good, inexpensive back up electric razor to replace an aged Norelco. Well, this unit was inexpensive, but alas, you do get what you pay for. In this case, not a very good shave. I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, I don&#x27;t have a problem beard. I don&#x27;t even need to shave everyday to look presentable. But when I do shave, I expect more than 50% of my neck hairs to get clipped. This razor can&#x27;t do that. I was more uncomfortable after shaving with it, than before I shaved. I have used both rotary and conventional blade electrics in the past, and this unit was the worst. Also, it didn&#x27;t matter whether I shaved wet or dry. Still no good. After trying for a week, I sent it back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers now for almost 40 years: Norelco double and triple headers, and Braun foil recharge-ables and battery-powered ones.  These are my observations: rotary shavers shave faster but not as close as foil shavers, especially around the chin/neck area, where they have difficulty with close access, but the heads last fairly long (years).   Although foil shavers -including the battery ones - shave more closely, they EAT foils: my last Braun ate 3 foils in 3 years (at $25/foil - OUCH!) - and I try hard to minimize pressure.  Hence I just bought this Panasonic.  No electric shavers do it for my neck hair or any hair that&#x27;s not stiff and straight and preferably fairly short: use a blade for this.   The Panasonic ES4025 (Amazon: $29.95 - free shipping) shaves fast and very close (I&#x27;ve only ever used my shavers dry), as close or better than the Brauns, and better than any rotary.  It does very well at the chin/neck area, especially because of the angle when you turn  it over. The foil seems stronger with smaller holes than the Brauns, and so it will probably last longer - new foils cost $15.95 at Amazon (but the shaver only costs $30.00!) - but it sometimes leaves some slightly longer hairs behind when not shaving daily (I use a dry blade or tweezer for these, no big deal). The pop-up trimmer, though a little narrower than Braun or Norelco, works very precisely and is sharper than the others, so it actually works better, in my opinion.  All my other Panasonic products have been of exceptional quality and this shaver seems no different; and I expect years of quality service.  At $30.00 RIGHT ON Panasonic!!  Who wants to subsidize the marketing costs of the other guys?  In conclusion: this shaver deserves more than 5 stars.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but better - especially considering the price and operating costs - than any of the other guys.  \\&quot;Thank you very much\\&quot; to all the other reviewers here  who helped influence me and brought me to buy this wonderfulshaver!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my son who normally uses a rotary.  He, like some other reviewers, had a poor experience with it and it left a lot of stubble behind.  I gave it a try and have been using it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to getting a close shave is to use a very light touch and experiment with vertical and horizontal strokes to match the grain of the beard.  After learning the \\&quot;patterns\\&quot; to use, I get an excellent shave with no razor burn or redness.  I find that it works quite well dry.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00008NG64 Panasonic ES4025SC Pro Curve Double Head Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Blue]] Works like a charm.  lasts 9 shaves and does great job.  Easy clean features under running water.</li>
    <li> This is the second Panasonic I have bought. The first was for my son and he tossed his Braun shaver away,this one I purchased is a gift for Xmas for my brother because he saw my sons and told me he would get one also because, you can use it in the shower and you can buy new blades if you need to! Definetly THUMBS UP!!!</li>
    <li> got this shaver for 2 days....used it twice and now it&#x27;s in my trash can.  the thing is that i dropped it and it broke...however, i have dropped my last shaver numerous time and it was still intact.  this shave is just too fragile....all the parts are made out of weak plastic.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for years. I like Panasonic products and this item is no exception. At a bargain price you get a shaver that is quiet (as quiet as an electric razor CAN be) and gives a close, comfortable shave. For me it works very well as a dry shaver. I do not often use it as a wet shaver, but it certainly does well at that too. A wet shave sort of defeats the purpose of using an electric shaver for me though. I use it when I have to do a quick shave to take off the five o-clock shadow. I have to admit, for the tough, first-thing-in-the-morning beard, electric shavers, any electric shavers, are a little  rough compared to the good old blade and gel. This one is typical in that respect.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaver is nice size and shape; fits well in your hand. Pop up trimmer works acceptably well and was a factor in my purchase.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is a reasonably close, comfortable dry shave with option of a comfortable wet shave if you want it. Charge only lasts about 1 week (6-7 shaves). For the price I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It works well, and I like that it&#x27;s a wet/dry. It&#x27;s the second one I bought, mainly because the screens get holes and it&#x27;s only a little more money to buy a whole new shaver instead of a new screen.  &lt;br /&gt;It does an adequate job and it&#x27;s not expensive, I think it&#x27;s a good value for people like me who are too cheap to spend a lot on a shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a second Panasonic shaver I bought. My last one is broken, but it last longer from each recharge and stronger than this one. The new one does look better, though. Overall, I like the panasonic products.</li>
    <li> I have owned multiple Panasonic Wet/Dry Shavers over the last 12 years. This is another excellent shaver. I have a tough beard that blades barely will cut through and find shaving in the shower with the Panasonic gives a good comfortable shave. A problem I have with all electric razors is that it is impossible to get a good clean shave around certain parts of the face. I use a blade to touch up after the electric.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for his first razor as he needed to start shaving, aproximately once, now twice per week.  When my Brauns battery ran low I borrowed his to shave.  I like his so much due to the closeness and speed of hte shave, that I bought myself one as well.  for $30 including shipping it is practically the same price as buying replacment blades and foil.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I had the Panasonic single foil wet/dry shaver and it turned my neck into mincemeat!  That one went back to Panasonic an I asked to try this one out.  I still get some neck irritation sometimes when using wet, but not like the other \\&quot;Hatchet\\&quot; .  I still get a faster shave with a good blade and my neck area is hard for any electric to get so all in all this is a great value.  It shaves pretty close and rivals much more expensive models/brands and I have tried $85+ shavers that did not work any better than this.. For the price nothing can touch it..</li>
    <li> I like close, smooth shaves.  When I was younger I preferred shaving with a razor blade of one sort or another.  But at age 45 I got tired of dealing with bleeding on an almost daily basis.  Then my wife gave me a Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I loved it. I used it with regular shaving cream and it actually shaved as close as any blade ever had. When its battery gave out I tried a $50 Panasonic, which was washable but not designed for wet use.  (Could have gotten a $90 wet/dry but Panasonic doesn&#x27;t make a $50 wet/dry.) It lasted eighteen months.  That&#x27;s when I learned washable shavers are not usable wet - their blades and motors are not designed for it.  So I bought another wet/dry.  It doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator.  It doesn&#x27;t last through as many shaves as more expensive shavers. (It gives me five good shaves between charges, but I take long shaves.) But it gives a satisfying, close shave that really does rival a blade and cost me $30.  If it fails in 18 months I&#x27;ll get another one just like it and be just as happy.  Buy one, use it with water and shaving gel and beat the blades.</li>
    <li> Solid purchase for the price.  Not spectacular in any respect, but gets the job done.  No glaring deficiencies or problems that I&#x27;ve run across yet.</li>
    <li> does not cut. even a little bit for me. i tried pressing really hard and nothing.  i bought another brand for 30 dollars at wallmart and its the round blade type and it cuts but it hurts and feels like it pulls my hair out. and it really doesn&#x27;t cut that well at all, it leaves spots. i don&#x27;t know if my bad experence is because i have only tried cheap automatic shavers or what, but they suck :)</li>
    <li> Some 12 years ago I bought my first Panasonic wet / dry rechargeable. When I replaced it (again after 12 years) it was still charging enough to last 2 or 3 shaves and the cutting head, that had never been replaced, was doing a very satisfactory job. I retired it only because I moved and was in the mood for something new. Plus, I&#x27;m going on a long vacation and new my 12 year old could not last. There was no doubt in my mind that the replacement had to be another Panasonic.  This new one is doing just fine. It has a little better feel to it. Works great dry but I often take it to the shower where it seem to love a little soap and water. Thank You Panasonic. I look for your name first with nearly every purchase.</li>
    <li> I had the older version of this model that I bought back in late 2001 which had lasted me all the way up until last month. I never had to change the blades, just had to keep it clean and charged.     This newer curved one seems to be just as good. It takes quite a bit of power to trim my beard as it is thick and a nightmare to cut with a blade razor, but this one gets it done. The only thing I would change about it would be to make the trimmer on the back a little wider.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever opened up an electric shaver, you know there are no bargains.  I suspect even the absurdly expensive ones come out of China at about five bucks.  So the idea is to find one you can replace every so often without spending a lot.  Forget replacing the expensive screen/blades. Think how you&#x27;d feel if you did that and the shaver stopped working out of warranty.      For a wet and dry, the Panasonic is only a moderate ripoff.  I use a disposable razor to shave where cuts are unlikely, then use the Panasonic to finish up.  So both the disposables and the electric shaver last a lot longer.    The trimmer works well, which isn&#x27;t always the case with electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver.  2nd one I&#x27;ve had (first one lasted 4 years so I can&#x27;t complain).  Not something you&#x27;d want to use for full-time shaving, but great for touch-ups and travel.  I actually blade-shave first in the shower and buzz over with this to get the spots I missed.  The beard trimmer is also good for \\&quot;man-scaping\\&quot; (works well on trimming women too!).  Again, not the best, but for $29 and waterproof, a pretty good deal.</li>
    <li> For the price, I have been happy.  Fairly quiet, feels solidly built.  Shaves like the much more expensive Braun I had.  The one fault is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to work that well (the Braun trimmer did a much better job), but luckily I don&#x27;t use it for that. I use it to cut back the stubble so that my razor shave is easier, less hurtful, and because it minimizes the chance I will cut myself.  No electric shaver cuts the hair on my neck, so I have to use both kinds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dan</li>
    <li> I will leave the debate about if it shaves well or not to those who have tried it.     I decided to return it immediately after I opened the box. The charger works with only 110v (100-125 to be exact) power source. Very stupid design on something people will travel with.</li>
    <li> This is pretty cheap electrical shave and I am satistifed with it considering its price.</li>
    <li> Misses about 20% of the hairs on my face.... &lt;br /&gt;Not sure how this can be called a shaver. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more like a Don Johnson 5&#x27;o clock shadow maker.... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been so frustrated by this .. &lt;br /&gt;Hoping to satisfy those TSA mugs who won&#x27;t &lt;br /&gt;allow me to carry shaving cream these days, I bought this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The battery life is ok.. about 7 shaves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But i have to go over my face so many times, i walk away redder than a  &lt;br /&gt;redneck responding to Atticus Finch&#x27;s questions. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have had more ingrown hairs in the last 4 weeks &lt;br /&gt;than I have had all my life of shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, there are parts that just dont get shaved! and  &lt;br /&gt;since I am chinese, I can say ... hairs have grown under my neck and ears &lt;br /&gt;that rival \\&quot;fu man chu\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If i could I&#x27;d return it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t ... so I will use it to shave the fuzz off my sweaters. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It is a nice shaver. I like how it is usable wet and dry. The only problem is that the trimming razor is a little weak.</li>
    <li> I never used a better electric shaver before this one ,and I have used a Braun &amp; Norelco previously. A great value for the price of it</li>
    <li> Strengths: Cheap; sleek design; wet shave; retains charge for a long time &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses: Does not come with international voltage charger; not very good for hair along neckline &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Summary: At its price its a really neat thing.  &lt;br /&gt;As Braun points out, shaving a wet skin does not give a close shave because the skin swells when wet. So I dont prefer the wet shave. Yet the feature is good for those who suffer from a rash or itch with a dry shave. It does take a bit of getting-used-to for a dry shave. Normally within 2-3 weeks most people can adapt to it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one like most straight-head shavers is not the best around the neckline and you may need to learn a few tricks on ur own to get a close shave around that area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It retains its charge for upto 5/6 shaves provided you shave at least once in 2 days and of course depending on the rate of ur beard growth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesnt come with any fancy accessories like a stand and brush like Braun does. But hey... u r paying half the price!</li>
    <li> I was recently in need of replacing the shaving head and screen on an old shaver.  After seeing the price for replacing those items, I decided to look at a new shaver.  I purchased this shaver thinking that I could buy it for slightly more than I would have paid for a replacement screen and shaving head.  I must say that I am pleasantly surprised!  This is a very adequate shaver for the money.  It cuts as well or better than my old Remington.  Besides that, it can be used in the shower, causing no shaving irritation.  This is a great little shaver.  If you want all the bells and whistles, go ahead and pay much more.  If you are looking for a good shave at a moderate price, I would opt for this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have had other brands and this one is better than prevoius one. I can use it for a week on single charge! but like all other has the problem with neck area, I end up using a razer for last touches</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic electric shaver.  After a couple of years of use I find it more practical to buy a new one than buy replacement blades/foils or batteries.  This one is kind of small but cuts great.  The charge lasts one week as stated in the manual.  It actually works better than the more expensive model I had previously.  I use it in the shower everyday and lather up with just a bar of soap.  I shave with this first then follow up with a disposable twin blade.  This seems to work best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver for 2 days or more and I find it quite nice for the price. It shaves close however, the wet shave feature makes it stand out. So far, so good. (5-19-08) After using it now for about a month, I find it does the job beautifully and for the price, can&#x27;t be beat! It is extremely easy to clean and I like this feature very much.</li>
    <li> DECENT JOB FOR THE MONEY. EASY TO USE,CHARGE,CLEAN,ETC.REASONABLY GOOD SHAVE, BETTER WHEN USING A SMALL AMONUT OF FOAM SHAVING CREAN THAN DRY, BUT IT WILL DO A DECENT JOB DRY . I LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> It takes a few uses before it cuts whiskers like i need them cut.    Is really great in the shower and works quite well with many name brand shaving cremes and soaps.    Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband some time ago, and he is still using it.  We have never had any problems with it, and it is a good shaver at a good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for the great price, and it works; just as it says, wet and dry. I&#x27;ve used in the shower and everything, but I can&#x27;t get my beard done with this, it leaves spots of hair that I have to finish with my blade. I still use it to get rid of my mustache when it has 2 or 3 days of grow, after that I gotta use the blade instead.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price.  Will probably buy the smaller travel version as well.</li>
    <li> I have always thought that a man&#x27;s shaver would work on woman&#x27;s beard.  This one does not.</li>
    <li> I like this but I mostly use this to trim my mustache. I use both the trimmer and the 2 blade to trim my mustache. I own a panasonic 3 blade with the flat blade in the middle. The trimmer is good on that unit but I can&#x27;t use the head to trim my mustache very good. The 2 head is better  for this. I prefer the more expensive linear motor for regular shaving so I own 2 panasonic shavers. The light on this unit doesn&#x27;t tell you or blink when its ready like the older models, it just glows until you unplug it 8 hrs later I guess. I liked the older one hour charge models better. I still do like panasonic. I have never tried wet shaving with any panasonic. I only dry shave and finish with schick twin. I gave four stars because I had to own 2 shavers to be happy. No cord, you put shaver on base and plug directly in wall outlet.</li>
    <li> For this price, this shaver does the trick for me.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so maybe the complaints about this product are from guys with some serious whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any inexpensive electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned (two Brauns and a Norelco rotary): I have to check for missed hairs and go after them with some degree of focus and I can&#x27;t expect it to tackle a three-day growth.  But for the \\&quot;I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor today\\&quot; morning, this shaver is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is very light (that&#x27;s good) since it is very plastic.  However, that does not mean it is fragile.  I mean, hey, I dropped a Braun once and it broke.  My advice is don&#x27;t drop any shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a dry shaver.  When I tried out the wet process, I had a red irritations under my jaw line all day.  I suppose at some point I could use it wet for a few days or weeks and let my face get accustomed to it (as advised in other reviews), but I haven&#x27;t done that yet.  (Is a wet shave closer?  What&#x27;s the advantage?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer is fine.  No worse than other inexpensive shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it all five stars, not because it works as well as a $300 \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot;, but because it does exactly what I expect a shaver to do at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: one year later, I&#x27;m still pleased with it.  Good battery life, but, again, my beard is not particularly heavy.  I still use a razor at least one a week to get the few whiskers this product misses.</li>
    <li> There is only one thing keeping me from giving this shaver a 5 star rating.  The closeness of the shave is not quite like my last Panasonic shaver.    The charge lasts for about three different 7 minute shaves before needing a recharge.    The recharger itself is an excellent design.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with my order. I had previously bought same item. The recent two I bought were for Christmas gifts. I received them in a matter of days. It&#x27;s a great product with a great deal on shipping. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic as a replacement for a better model whose replacement cutblock and screen cost almost as much as a new decent razor ($60!).    Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s cheap and performs as such. At least it has a pop-up trimmer and works wet/dry. The motor is weak even at full charge and only lasts 4 shaves at best. This might be because it takes so many passes over your face to shave it actually takes longer than other razors.    It lacks the ability to use 240V so it&#x27;s no good for overseas either.    I&#x27;d have to describe it as barely adequate and frankly, as soon as I get what I consider to be my \\&quot;money&#x27;s worth\\&quot; out of it, I&#x27;m chucking it and buying a mid-range model ($50) somewhere between this one and my old one, but I&#x27;ll still probably go with Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Very good if you shave daily.      Gets a bit problematic if you let it go for more than two days. Struggles a wee bit to catch longer hairs on the neck.</li>
