      <li>&amp; The Bottle-Design is nothing short of Awesome!!</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>but, I like the original curve better.  </li>
      <li>This is a bit strong, so use sparingly.  </li>
      <li>Too strong didnt like the smell.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very fresh.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>and since i love the smell of this i really dont mind.  </li>

      <li>Smells good &amp;  was bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>like I&#x27;ve experienced previously.</li>
      <li>If you want every single chick you come across to say &amp;#34; you smell so good &amp;#34; then this is the cologne for you</li>
      <li>hahahaha!!</li>
      <li>The can it comes in is a nice touch although the angled bottle is a bit different.</li>
      <li>Worth the buy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say in a review of a cologne, other than that it smells good.</li>
      <li>This was a christmas gift for my husband and he uses it daily and has barely made a dent, not to mention its great oz to $ ratio.  </li>

    <li> I had read good reviews and bought this at a local store. I put some on and went out shopping. Was walking down an isle and noticed a woman walking with a guy down the isle going to pass me. She looked good. After we passed I heard a woman&#x27;s voice say &amp;#34;You smell delightful!!&amp;#34;. Turned around and she was walking backwards with a big smile on her face while the guy next to her looked at her with a smirk. Thought &amp;#34;Wow, that won&#x27;t happen again.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day I went to a birthday party for a coworker and again was wearing my new cologne. Came out back where the beer and BBQ was and said my hello&#x27;s. Came up to her and she said &amp;#34;Come here&amp;#34;. Went over and was immediately grabbed by my polo shirt and pulled into her while she said &amp;#34;You smell,, goooood...&amp;#34;. There was a sparkle in her eyes. Lol..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wore it for my girlfriend. Pretty much same response. She pulled me in close while her green eyes sparkled and she started slow dancing against me while saying &amp;#34;You smell really good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, lol, holy cow...</li>
    <li> This was a fathers day gift for my boyfriend. The fragrance in amazing. He loves it and so do I! remember ladies: when you buy him cologne make sure you like  it too!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say in a review of a cologne, other than that it smells good. Despite the bottle&#x27;s wacky design, it stands upright in the cabinet, and yeah...</li>
    <li> I go through cologn like water,  purchased this at least a year and a half ago,  and still got it :-/</li>
    <li> My wife and kids love the smell and I too like it a lot.  The fragrance is very fresh.  But the spray was not coming out evenly, the first spray comes out nice but next presses doesn&#x27;t seem to have pressure.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT FOR A GREAT PRICE</li>

    <li> Was a father&#x27;s day gift ordered a few days before father&#x27;s day n it got here on time. He loves it.. Smells good &amp;  was bigger than I thought it would be. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great packaging and bottle design.  Great value for the price.  Boyfriend loves it so I had to buy another one.</li>
