<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This razor is actually pretty good, I love how the bar lathers up and I don&#x27;t have to use my shaving cream or anything like I normally would do. My hair has stayed away on my legs for a couple of weeks now. It&#x27;s just easier using this razor for me. I will say after a few shaves you will need a new razor and a pack of three is like $11-14 I believe... (I got mine from Family Dollar)</li>
    <li> I always been using intuition.  It is very convenient and comfotable to use.  This pomogrenate scene is new and I love it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  I am not a huge fan of the Shick Intuition Plus.  I bought this with the hope that a smooth and soft shave would be obtained.  While I do notice my legs are much softer, the closeness of the shave is not close at all.  I had to shave the same spot at least 4 times to get an \\&quot;almost\\&quot; normal shave. The next day I had to shave again - what girl has time to shave her legs everyday?!.  I noticed also that after one use the soap/moisturizer was halfway gone - I don&#x27;t want to have to buy a new refill every other use.  The cost of the razor is also a bit high.  While this razor works for others it just hasn&#x27;t worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said I will say that the product does leave your skin \\&quot;softer\\&quot;.  Since moving to Tucson, AZ my skin has gotten dramatically drier.  I do notice that my legs are softer.  Also, the Pomegranate Scent was very nice.  Unfortunately, I have decided to not use this and to continue looking for another &#x27;perfect&#x27; razor.</li>
    <li> Just rec&#x27;d package, based on picture I thought the razor came with 2 refills.  Nope, just one.  So important to read the fine print and not go by the deceiving pictures provided.  Would have purchased from a different seller.  Based on the advertising I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> I have gone from regular disposable shavers with the cuts and bleeding to braun silkepil which i call a torture machine and waxing with the high costs and pain. I love these, they are easy, reasonable price, don&#x27;t cut you and leave your legs smooth as if you just put lotion on them.</li>
    <li> Pro: My legs are softer and feel smooth after shaving without needing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;  It does smell nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I can&#x27;t tell where I&#x27;ve shaved, because there&#x27;s no shaving cream tracks to see where I&#x27;ve been already. So when I thought I was finished I ended up having to shave again to get all the places I missed.&lt;br /&gt;  The razor is big and clunky, awkward to hold and easy to drop.&lt;br /&gt;  I can&#x27;t get a close shave on my ankles or knees because of the way it&#x27;s designed. The cake of shaving \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; around the blades prevents that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Great razor and excellent fragrance.  Smooth shave without the added mess of shaving cream.  This is wonderful.  Fits any of the refills.</li>
    <li> These razors are my guilty indulgence.  The refills are too expensive but they convenience of having the shave cream right on the razor is fantastic.  It also leaves my legs very smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift.  Didn&#x27;t hear any complaints.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for her first shave. She has way more control with this than a regular razor and has had very few cuts, and she doesn&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. Even better!</li>
    <li> I hate shaving cream. I literally despise it. It makes a huge mess, and it always smells kind of funny. These are perfect because they are so smooth on your skin. In the 4+ years of using these I have never cut myself (which was my original reason of first purchasing). I am a loyal intuition user, and the price for these on here is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver cause it is very convenient to use in the shower.  I seldom get any nicks with it and it seems to shave really smooth.  Sometimes they are a little pricey especially for the refills but you can usually find good deals on Amazon.  I have tried other shavers and always go back to this one.  It is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for awhile. It is nice for traveling and also great for your hospital bag if you have a baby on the way. The only problem I had is I was allergic to this particular scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the intuition for years solely for the fact that Iwon&#x27;t need to buy shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect razor for those whom doesn&#x27;t like to spend time and energy into shaving. The built in cream gives a rich lather.  This is the EASIEST razor to use. NO SHAVING CREAM NEEDED! Money saved! The cream usually last 10 shaves before it&#x27;s out. By then the razor is near dull and I use a new blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The hollow handle catches water and hair. It makes it hard to rinse and clean. Eventually I noticed the moisture and hair trapped in the handle will get icky and mold will grow with use.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shaver to anyone . I hate shaving but the only time I do is when I have the intuition.The only problem is that the soap bar wears down very quickly.</li>
    <li> My daughter is just learning to shave her legs and I was afraid she would cut herself so I bought this razor for her, thinking she may have some &#x27;added protection&#x27; with the moisturizing bars surrounding the blade. . .she loves it!  She said its super easy to use and isn&#x27;t afraid of using it like she would have been the other razors.  Happy it&#x27;s working out!</li>
    <li> I will not use anything else.  I started purchasing these years ago.  Yes, they are expensive.  That is the ONLY downside.  Yes, the soap tends to melt away when you rinse it our, however it is still well worth the money.  You do not have to purchase separate shave cream or gel and razors.  It is all in one.  I will NEVER use another razor again.  I will just scrimp and save and continue to buy these.  I have every color also and try and get the refills here as they seem like a better deal.  Expensive but well worth the prize.  Never going back!!</li>
    <li> very pleased with product</li>
    <li> By far my favorite razor out there. I have extremely sensitive skin and this razor and razor heads allow me to shave arm pits, legs, and lady parts daily without any issues with irritation etc.</li>
    <li> The concept of this was great however I find the bar gets in the way of the razor so you don&#x27;t get a very close shave. Plus the bar wears down faster then the razor does. I didn&#x27;t even bother using the refill that came with it, I threw the whole thing away.</li>
    <li> Worst shaver ever invented. Do not purchase this.</li>
    <li> This razor is good for tweens new to shaving.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, the bar does wear down quickly.  But worse than that, for me, is I nick myself really badly with them.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s user error, but I have no success for a bloodless close shave with them.</li>
    <li> These are great for travel because you don&#x27;t have to carry shaving cream with you and they are good for quick touch ups when on the run.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! I love it!!!!</li>
