      <li>What a beautiful pink!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this pink tone.</li>
      <li>Favorite color so far- funny bone goes on smooth and even.</li>
      <li>Really pretty for spring!</li>
      <li>Very pretty bright,  but baby pink color.  </li>
      <li>It is just as good as more expensive gel polishes, at a much more affordable price.  </li>
      <li>My favorite IBD color thus far.</li>
      <li>right now I&#x27;m using a hardener and nail polish with hardeners.</li>
      <li>I have this on my tips right now</li>
      <li>This is also a full sized bottle 0.5 fl oz as opposed to many of the store brands (Sephora, Red Carpet, etc.).</li>
      <li>I got funny bone, which is a very cute bubble gum pink color.  </li>
      <li>If I could describe it:&lt;br /&gt;Medium opaque tone.&lt;br /&gt;Bright, more vibrant than pastel, but not neon.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, not harsh...</li>
      <li>If you are considering gel nail polish, I would really recommend it!</li>
      <li>This was my first bottle of IBD gel polish.  </li>
      <li>The color is a cream, no shimmer or sparkle; but, I added IBD Moroccan Spice and it really glammed it up!</li>
      <li>I have cafe con leche (think hot latte with whole milk, not skim</li>
      <li>Kind of reminds me of bubble gum, but slightly duller.</li>
      <li>(more like skin tone) pink that I have now.  </li>
      <li>I really like</li>
      <li>i wish it was a brighter, more pastel tone of pink.  </li>
      <li>I love this shade of pink.</li>
      <li>Very girly.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Retro, tasteful candy, polka dot, &#x27;mod&#x27;</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;A must have if you love pink...</li>
      <li>I painted her nails for her birthday party with it and naturally it lasted for about 2 weeks!!</li>
      <li>On my monitor, the polish color is pretty much the same as the color of the bottle label.  </li>
      <li>The color is just a little more intense than I had hoped, but it is a very pretty shade of pink.  </li>
      <li>In future Ill buy again more from this seller :)</li>
      <li>coat cover for me.&lt;br /&gt;Shows light, metallic, dark and color nail stamps or art</li>
      <li>Such a pretty color.  </li>
      <li>This delivers that pink color and is more of a cotton candy pink.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, not neon at all.  </li>
      <li>this color is not as cute, at least not on my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I love the pink color of this polish and it last very long just as shellac should!</li>
      <li>Two thin coats with gel top coat looks feminine and on point.  </li>
      <li>I generally use Gelish, Daisy gel, OPI, Sephora, and Red Carpet (Ulta)</li>
      <li>Gave myself the ultimate gel polish mani with IBD base coat, polish and top coat with uv curing light.</li>
      <li>much much darker and less shine than the pic.</li>

    <li> I love the IBD gel nail polish!  It is just as good as more expensive gel polishes, at a much more affordable price.  I got funny bone, which is a very cute bubble gum pink color.  I have fewer chipped nail tips with the gel nail polish than with regular polish, even when I would retouch my topcoat everyday.  If you are considering gel nail polish, I would really recommend it!</li>

I am soooo disapointed i wish i would of never purchashed from these ppl i didnt even get my money back wtf!!! Totally got scammed!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this color but I read the what everyone wrote and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I did....its a beautiful shade of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten a lot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have if you love pink...just remember to do thin coats and it blends easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I like this color as I was looking for something darker than the pale pink (more like skin tone) pink that I have now.  This delivers that pink color and is more of a cotton candy pink.  Really pretty for spring!</li>
    <li> This is nice realy nice I use de color for a week and it work so good. And about prise what can I say . The color is beauty but You have to put three coats</li>
    <li> Excellent creme candy pink! I received many compliments on Funny Bone. If I could describe it:&lt;br /&gt;Medium opaque tone.&lt;br /&gt;Bright, more vibrant than pastel, but not neon.&lt;br /&gt;Soft, not harsh...&lt;br /&gt;Retro, tasteful candy, polka dot, &#x27;mod&#x27; pink.&lt;br /&gt;Creme color, no shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Two coat cover for me.&lt;br /&gt;Shows light, metallic, dark and color nail stamps or art very well.&lt;br /&gt;I find it coordinates well with nail rhinestone and fashion color palettes out this year like Pantone Summer 2012.&lt;br /&gt;Photo:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this pink tone.</li>
    <li> Great color goes on nicely! I really like these IBD Gel Nail Polishes send the price is great! Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I love the pink color of this polish and it last very long just as shellac should! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Waited 2 1/2 weeks for polish &amp; a top coat polish. Upon very late arrival, color was pepto bismol like and not \\&quot;funny bone\\&quot;. Gave myself the ultimate gel polish mani with IBD base coat, polish and top coat with uv curing light. The s*** chipped and completely peeled off in less than 18 hours. I&#x27;m so disappointed, what a waist of my hard earned money!!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first bottle of IBD gel polish.  I generally use Gelish, Daisy gel, OPI, Sephora, and Red Carpet (Ulta) but I&#x27;ve found this polish to wear just as well.  It has great coverage and nice deep color.  This is also a full sized bottle 0.5 fl oz as opposed to many of the store brands (Sephora, Red Carpet, etc.).</li>
    <li> Favorite color so far- funny bone goes on smooth and even. Cannot believe how great ibd is at is ultra low cost!</li>
    <li> This a great summer color, or if you want to brighten up your day in the dreary NY winter.  It looks just like the bottle and hoes on great.</li>
    <li> This is a great baby pink color and my daughter LOVED it! I painted her nails for her birthday party with it and naturally it lasted for about 2 weeks!! I will never go back to regular polish!</li>
    <li> Great product!  This works just as well for me as the more expensive gel polishes.  I cannot tell any difference in wear when applied properly.</li>
    <li> color too dark for my like. much much darker and less shine than the pic.</li>
    <li> Such a pretty color.  I love love love it!!!  My favorite IBD color thus far.</li>
    <li> Nice color.  I love the IDB Gel polishes.</li>
    <li> This lasted beautifully for a full two weeks before I removed it.  What a pleasant surprise. The color is just a little more intense than I had hoped, but it is a very pretty shade of pink.  On my monitor, the polish color is pretty much the same as the color of the bottle label.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying another bottle of IBD brand polish if I can only decide which color!</li>
    <li> If that is the color you are looking for, this is the color you should get. Very girly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Super cute summer color!</li>
    <li> excellent product and love the color Would recommend to everyone.  I will repurchase it again.  Absoulutely love it. LLLLLLL LLL</li>
    <li> Great color,on time,i&#x60;m happy :) In future Ill buy again more from this seller :)</li>
    <li> Arrived today.  Love the price point.  Per bottle it is about 1/2 the price of more poplar brands.  Very pretty bright,  but baby pink color.  NOT peptopink but a cute Baby magic baby lotus bottle color with high pigmentand shine(nno shimmer...  Nice texture. Two thin coats with gel top coat looks feminine and on point.  I was getting anxious during arrival that it would be NEON and while waiting a long time I almost ordered Gelish Pink Smoothie  (which I know from experience fades to a lighter color).  Glad I exercised patience and waited.  This did not wrinkle or shrinkage during application or curling.  And it was the perfect bright yet baby NON - NEON pink.  Very well packaged and priced!!!!</li>
    <li> What a beautiful pink! It&#x27;s soft, not neon at all.  I have cafe con leche (think hot latte with whole milk, not skim, that&#x27;s too dark) colored skin and this pink polish makes my skin appear lighter.  Truly elegant.  The color is a cream, no shimmer or sparkle; but, I added IBD Moroccan Spice and it really glammed it up! I simply adore IBD colors! They are inexpensive yes; however, they apply very well if you use thin coats.  You will need 3 coats to achieve maximum coverage.</li>
    <li> I am into neon colors like Neon Pink Orange Red and Purple. And this is definitely a Neon Pink. I have not used it yet because I&#x27;m waiting for my nails to get a little stronger I have to keep them really short because they are peeling. right now I&#x27;m using a hardener and nail polish with hardeners.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of pink. I have gotten a lot of compliments. I would definitley buy this color again!</li>
    <li> this color is not as cute, at least not on my skin tone.  i wish it was a brighter, more pastel tone of pink.  Kind of reminds me of bubble gum, but slightly duller.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I thought it would be &amp; they don&#x27;t accept returns so I&#x27;m stuck with it</li>
    <li> bubblegum pink!  gorgeous...</li>
    <li> I have this on my tips right now and I love it. It is a perfect pepto pink with no glitter or shimmer. Very nice for spring/summer.</li>
