<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Covers some of the redness without going on too thick.</li>
    <li> Love the mineral foundation</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered. The product is silky and is applied easily. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a finished look</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,  it&#x27;s the only mineral powder I&#x27;ve liked. Others don&#x27;t blend as well,  look too powdery. Lasts a while.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite coverage. It&#x27;s light like a powder and provides all over warm coverage however it is not heavy or likely to run or have a color line like foundation does. The coverage though is stunning it really covers up what you want and it does it with a smooth finish. I highly recommend. Buy a few they sometimes are difficult to get a hold of!</li>
    <li> Thank You, I bought the wrong one. I usually use Beige 2 my mistake</li>
    <li> I love powder foundation.  Powder foundations usually feels lighter than other foundations.  Easier to get even coverage as well.  Mary Kay products in general are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Always the BEST in mineral powder and wow what a great price for the real product and not old!</li>
    <li> Fantastic customer service and fast and great product</li>
    <li> I have been using this Mary Kay product for over 1 year.  I like the coverage and feel.  This is the only mineral foundation I have ever used so can not compare to others.  It goes on smooth and feels light on my skin. It wears nicely during the day. I like the color for my skin. It is hard to find seller in my area all the time so was happy to find on Amazon.  Prodcut was as described, new in box, delivered very fast.  Would purchase again. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay is the best foundation I&#x27;ve found after years of trying everything from the drug store brands to Urban decay. It has long lasting coverage and feels great.</li>
    <li> I love this, especially with MK timewise liquid foundation. I have full coverage, all day. MK has great products and great prices. Great delivery time and excellent product. I love MK.</li>
    <li> Great product as always!</li>
    <li> I buy all kinds of mineral make-up, whatever is cheaper. I&#x27;m going to mix it all up in a small tin anyway and somehow all the various colors and types work out. This one was great because of its price at the time and had more volume than any other mineral make-up did, you just get more for the money.</li>
    <li> While the price is reasonable and the service was prompt, this does not appear to be a true Mary Kay product. The numbers are punched out on the back and if you compare it to one bought directly from Mary Kay on the label this one sends it says it is a substitution. there are also other difference on the product explanation. I put it on and my skin started itching. I looked into it after that. The coverage is also not the same. I am very disappointed. The advertiser appears to be selling the same product but I just do not believe it is. The powder also did not come in a box.</li>
    <li> nice product. too expensive. compared it to clinique and i think it was about double the price. good if you have a friend in teh buz</li>
    <li> I LOVE this foundation. I&#x27;ve used it for about 8 years now and nothing works better for my oily, sensitive skin. HOWEVER, the listing said &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;--definitely inaccurate. When you purchase MK mineral powder foundation, there should ALWAYS be a plastic seal covering the holes on the inside. There was no plastic seal on this, which made it obvious that someone had probably tried this once and didn&#x27;t like it. If it had been eye makeup I would&#x27;ve demanded a refund, but since it otherwise looked clean, I wasn&#x27;t that upset. But still. Be careful, sellers! Make sure you&#x27;re selling what you advertise! Other than that, this was a great order.</li>
    <li> Cudos to Pretty Owl for addressing a shipping issue, but I would recommend using a better option than USPS if the local office is that incompetent.  The product is exactly what I would get from a local MK dealer.  Everything arrived fine, it just took a month to get here.  I was told the local USPS lost some of her packages prior to Thanksgiving and were not found until afterward.  They did check with them after I emailed but they had been found and shipped by then, 3 weeks after they had been dropped off.  I will give them another chance, because this is cheaper than I can get it locally, even paying shipping.  I will also email sooner when it does not arrive as expected.  The ship time was ridiculous.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to think the quality on this is very good. She is usually a tough sell but says she would reocmmend.</li>
    <li> Love love love this powder. I have tried so many kinds of powder foundation and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Everyone is different, of course, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Just wish it would come in bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now. I will not use anything else. This powder makes my skin look even and the best part is you cant even tell I have any product on.. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this powder. I had used Bare Minerals in the past but it did not last all day on my oily skin. I think switched to a Clarins Ever matte liquid foundation which I liked but was quite heavy coverage. I was looking for a foundation powder that would be on the lighter end of coverage but would still cover my imperfections and redness. This did all of those things. The color wells well with my cool fair skin and it covers well. I used two layers in problem spots and then use my bobbi brown concealer to supplement as need. I apply this with the Flat Top Kabuki Brush from Beauty Junkees which is amazing!!!!! Also from a sensitive skin standpoint this works well. I have had problem (acne) skin my whole life so every new product I use I am worried whether it will cause more problems and more acne. For the first day using this I had a few more acne spots pop up. After 2 days all of my acne cleared up and my skin evened out. I love it. I also got this in Beige 1 for my summer color.</li>
    <li> When I first received it a 4-digit number was scratched off on the bottom. I thought maybe it was an item number, but then thought maybe expiry date (20x9)? Below there was 03 15, which I thought could be either March 15 or March 2015. It had a strange specific smell. I gave it up thinking maybe everything is OK and started using it. I liked the way the powder made my skin look matte and comparably smooth. It could be a coincidence but I have a terrible skin rash the day I use it. I was using this powder everyday on my clean and hydrated skin as I do not like liquid foundations and much cosmetics. If the expiry date was 2009 it is not strange that I have a skin rash now. Even if it was an item number or so I don&#x27;t think it was right to scratch it off before selling as it looks suspicious. Not a good experience overall.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, looks as if you&#x27;re not wearing make-up at all while covering all your blemishes and uneven skin tones. Great value for this price. It does tend to require reapplying at least once throughout the day though.</li>
    <li> I like this powder because you can use a little for light coverage or continue applying more layers for more coverage. I apply with a kabuki brush for best results. Stays on well with a nice Matt finish. I have a medium tan in the summer and Ivory 2 is the perfect shade. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  This is the only mineral powder foundation I use.  I have been using mary kay products for years and am extremely happy!!</li>
    <li> The product is nice my only complaint was the long 3-4 week shipping time with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. Love how it goes on-helps with my combination oily skin as the day goes on!</li>
    <li> I love my mary kay powder. I used to go cheap in the stores but this stuff actually blends into your skin and feels good. And my pots usually last right around a year with on and off wearing. It is a great product and I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> This is a must have! Convenient, easy to use and fast. You can use it after you put on your liquid foundation or just put it on if you are running out of time. Color is great and it doesn&#x27;t fade as much. Great product to have in your home.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay mineral powder!</li>
    <li> another good mary kay  product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and really enjoy the mineral powder foundation. Its great and I am happy to finally receive it</li>
    <li> Love the mineral powder foundation SO MUCH more than pressed.  Once you change to the mineral you&#x27;ll never want pressed again!</li>
    <li> Description states that the foundation was sealed fresh. When I received the product, there was no seal in place. It was clearly opened prior to my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, I love Mary Kay cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite powder foundation ever. I&#x27;ve worn it for many years. Great coverage and this one container will last forever.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation.  It goes on smoothly.  I need to take a little time evening it out, but less than many liquid foundations.  It does not cake into pores...it actually minimizes pores.  Every time I get talked into trying another brand, I am very sorry and go back to this one. It seems a little powdery at first, but  it looks very natural after it sets. It does not run in hot climates.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay mineral powder foundation for a few years and love it.  I have tried some of the &amp;#34;in-store&amp;#34; brands, but the results are not the same.</li>
    <li> This powder covers so well! It also lasts me around a month!!! The matching concealer goes all so well with this powder!!! Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Ivory 2 Mineral Powder Foundation by Mary Kay is my all time go-to foundation. I like how it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup at all. This gives a more natural feel and look in my opinion. I do not typically wear liquid foundation under the mineral powder, I apply it directly to my face using the Mary Kay foundation brush. One container of the mineral powder foundation lasts me about 4-6 months with daily use. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love this powder.. I wear it alone no foundation is needed and it covers just right.. Perfect for day time and for days you don&#x27;t want to look too over done..</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have very sensitive skin and Mary Kay products work very well for me.</li>
    <li> It is a natural powder and it doesn&#x27;t give you and acne...  I love it so much I almost have to buy another container of this beautiful foundation...</li>
    <li> Not sure I like the new dispensing system with this powder.  It does come out quickly &amp; can be a bit messy.  Hopefully I can get use to regulating it.</li>
    <li> My WIFE loves this. LOL</li>
    <li> This is the best mineral powder foundation I&#x27;ve found.  I use it daily as my only face makeup.  It covers very well and feels light all day long.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.  The price was about the same as I have paid directly to Mary Kay for the same product without the hassle or hard sell to buy more from the consultant.</li>
    <li> I love this mineral powder for my face.  It covers very well and you need little product.  Covers up blemishes too.</li>
    <li> Great mineral powder foundation.  Stays on until you take it off.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it consently , great product</li>
    <li> This powder foundation gives a natural finish and with lasting effects. Other powder foundations I&#x27;ve tired either didn&#x27;t have enough coverage or wore off quickly and left my face oily. This is  a great product, especially when paired with any primer.</li>
    <li> Our favorite face powder foundation.  Good coverage and easy to apply with brush.  Recommend this product to anyone wanting a mat finish</li>
    <li> With Mary Kay products such as this, I don&#x27;t feel like I have much make up on but yet it does it&#x27;s job.  I first use alittle Mary Kay liquid foundation underneath (recommended by a Mary Kay Specialtist), then I apply the mineral foundadtion powder.  I find the two together work good for me.  I have tried the mineral powder alone, like in a hurry, and it does an acceptable job too.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  I can&#x27;t believe after paying top dollar after all these years, how cheap I could buy my products through Amazon. I wish I knew about Amazon earlier.</li>
    <li> Such an easy way to order Mary Kay!</li>
    <li> This is the only mineral powder that I like. It covers well and you can both cake it on for those blemishes or wear a light layer. Plus, I had no idea I could find it outside of MK, and its cheaper!</li>
    <li> I have also used this product for several years and really like it, the delivery to my house is great thank you</li>
    <li> Love the product.  I will just need to remember to reorder allowing plenty of time for shipping</li>
    <li> Was not sealed. Box was also crumpled.</li>
    <li> Love this product from Mary Kay.  I have been using it now for several years.  It is light and has grerat coverage.  I also like being able to get it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product lasts all day and is great on oily skin.  I have tried most brands, even the most expensive lines don&#x27;t last as long or wear as well as this powder.&lt;br /&gt;Service from the seller was great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This make-up goes on smooth and evenly. it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out as I have acne prone skin. It also does not sink into my pores. The down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on all day. After about 3-4 hrs I have to touch it up again. It also doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes 100% it only covers them somewhat, so I have to put a little something on underneath it. But this foundation is the perfect finish!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only foundation I use. I bow. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ive used Mary Kay products for years now. It was a great surprise to find it here on Amazon. I love the product, but I hate the pressure most Mary Kay sellers use. They just don&#x27;t stop at I just want the product, nothing else.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Shipping was prompt.</li>
    <li> I love this mineral powder. It&#x27;s a good color for me. I ordered 2, so I have an extra one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MK user and was happy to find it at a lower price on Amazon. I ordered my mineral powder for $8 less and it arrived just as it does from my MK rep. in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I saw that the product was listed as &#x27;sealed&#x27; and when it arrived, it was only sealed by Mary Kay&#x27;s new twist closure inside the product. Apparently that&#x27;s standard now and I didn&#x27;t know it but Cosmetics Blizzard offered to let me return it anyway. I think I&#x27;ll keep the product since I have ordered the same product from a different vendor with the same description and it arrived the same way. Thanks Cosmetics Blizzard for your fantastic customer service! I love this Mary Kay product so I hope you continue selling it.</li>
    <li> THis is  a great product thanks a bunch will be oredering again soon thanks alot...i would tell everyone about this</li>
    <li> Great product. Took over 3 weeks for it to arrive.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase for me.  I always use this product</li>
    <li> This is a superior powder foundation!  I love it!  I have used many and this is my favorite.  It has great coverage and is not so obvious that others would notice.  I do not use the Mary Kay foundation brush.  It left black hairs all over my face with all the shedding.  I use the live Beauty fully brush number 206 by Ulta.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it (on her), and I love it on her too!  I don&#x27;t plan to use it myself though.</li>
    <li> Mineral Powder Foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Mary Kay product for years.  Whether its face washes a moisturizers, to all different types of makeup, and I have always loved them. Using the Mineral Powder Foundation I had the same expectations and I was right. This product is amazing. It&#x27;s a perfect match to my skin, and covers up all my blemishes leaving me confident and happy.&lt;br /&gt;The Mineral Powder Foundations makes you feel and look younger. It&#x27;s a light powder so it lets your skin breathe unlike liquid foundation, which can be hard to blend and leave you with an oily finish. The Mineral powder actually helps oily skin, making it less noticeable. You just apply the powder to a makeup brush and wipe it over you face and upper neck. It goes on quick, but be sure to make it an even coat. The powder is long lasting so you don&#x27;t have to reapply throughout the day. Making it easier to save your money. You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of powder, remember the saying a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;There are shades to match any skin tone, and it looks great on everyone. It makes your skin all one shade, smoothing red marks, acne scars, or blemishes. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, and was dermatologist tested. Since it&#x27;s so light it lets your skin breathe, making it easier for your pores to stay clear. Helping prevent other blemishes from surfacing. The Mineral Powder is also fragrance free, so it&#x27;s a better alternative for people with allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the Mineral Powder Foundation is the natural look it gives you. It never smears, so you never have to worry about it rubbing off or running with your other makeup Being that it&#x27;s a powder and not a liquid it doesn&#x27;t ruin your clothing either. It’s gentle for your skin and for your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend this product to anyone. Especially for first time makeup users. It&#x27;s a great buy, being that it&#x27;s cheap and you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> This powder gets rid of the shine &amp; evens out my skin color. It doesn&#x27;t completely hide blemishes but lightens them. I&#x27;ve been using this powder for years now. I tried another one and hated it &amp; came back to this one.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product and shipping. I bought this previously through a Mary Kay sales-woman but no longer have easy access to them. this was a great option.</li>
    <li> Purchase as expected.</li>
    <li> I feel good about my occasional use of this mineral powder. i&#x27;ve used it for years now and am very happy with it and always come back to purchase more when the current pot runs out.</li>
    <li> This powder is light yet offers excellent coverage for all skin types.  Much easier to apply, with a brush (purchased separately), than liquid foundation products.  Can&#x27;t beat the quality of Mary Kay products!</li>
    <li> I have not started using this yet, I hope I like the mineral powder over regular face powder, and it does not increase wrinkle apperance.</li>
    <li> Not that their liquid foundation wasn&#x27;t good, but I will never go back once I started using their mineral powder foundation.  It is divine.  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I like the mineral powder very much but was very disappointed that it took awhile for  me to get my product.</li>
    <li> The container is different from the one I was used to, and took some learning to use correctly, but the product was exactly what I&#x27;ve been using, and I was very pleased with the fact that it arrived soon, before I ran out of the powder I needed.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Mary Kay she has used it since her university days. She gets an over all coverage with the mineral powder and it is light and doesn&#x27;t feel like cake is all over her face. She can uses this on humid days, has an evenly covered face and looks refreshing all day. She will be buying this product the rest of her life.</li>
    <li> Been using Mary Kay for almost 40 years,  This is a nice color for  blonde complexions.  Looks nice all day.</li>
    <li> This is the best mineral powder that I have found and used.  It has awesome coverage and I purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> shipped in time and the color is what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great mineral  powder. It isn&#x27;t too heavy. It leaves a nice, natural finish.</li>
    <li> Only brand that fits my color. Its got a yellowish tint to it compared to others that are so orangy. Feels nice on my skin and I don&#x27;t break out at all.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife waned.</li>
    <li> I love this powder and so glad that I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried other types of mineral foundations and haven&#x27;t been impressed. I decided to switch back to using the Mary Kay mineral powder, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any turning back! It goes on smooth and provides the right amount of coverage without looking pasty or heavy.</li>
