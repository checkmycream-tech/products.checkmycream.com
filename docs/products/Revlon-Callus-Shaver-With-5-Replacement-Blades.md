### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful customer service</li>
      <li>I am happy I ordered this calisthenics shaver.</li>
      <li>It works great if it is used correctly.</li>
      <li>It works great</li>
      <li>Good price too.</li>
      <li>Would be nice if the instructions were clearer but good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I wish salons could all use these, but the next best thing is handling your business at home.</li>
      <li>and I love the product.</li>
      <li>I wrote Revlon, received unapologetic instructions to return in a padded, insured envelope if I wanted more than an auto-reply saying there&#x27;s nothing they intend to do.  </li>
      <li>Save your money and buy a better product.</li>
      <li>and but more each time.</li>
      <li>Works really well and the replacement blades are great</li>
      <li>The one I bought elsewhere before was so much better.</li>
      <li>I am not at all sure how to install the blade and use this product.</li>
      <li>my best guess is that it might be meant for some other beings but not for humans.</li>
      <li>I bring in my own callus shaver to the salon and sometimes they are willing to use that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just be sure to soak your feet first</li>
      <li>I simply took the blade and popped it into my old shaver and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t even have to put a lot of pressure on the skin to get a clean result.</li>
      <li>You could maybe use it as a bottle opener if your lucky.</li>
      <li>I think even a \\&quot;one\\&quot; Star rating may be to high :)</li>
      <li>Get any other foot shaver out there, I can promise you it will be more effective than the revlon one.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and does not require much pressure.  </li>
      <li>I think the product itself is fine but really</li>
      <li>With my cracked heals this Works Great for shaving the dead skin.</li>
      <li>all of the items I purchased met my standards and were totally worth buying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it once so far not as easy as I thought it should be to use.</li>
      <li>What more can I possibly say about it?</li>
      <li>I recommend it, but I would use foot balm on calluses first, then use the shaver after the skin is softened.</li>
      <li>This will work only if your heels have more than 1/4 inch raised calluses on an 45 degree angle or so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Plus the shaver gets clogged pretty fast.</li>
      <li>found the book to be very helpful with the course I am taking</li>
      <li>The blades do absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Not only does it NOT come with instructions, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any instructions or user guide available on the Internet?  </li>
      <li>It is very sturdy.</li>
      <li>The blade doesn&#x27;t even stay in place or fit properly.</li>
      <li>It does not get a close enough cut like the cheap one I bought from a corner store years ago.</li>
      <li>Just do not shave too much off.</li>
      <li>I had an older model of the Revlon shaver and it really worked well.</li>
      <li>and I am using it with the new replacement blades.</li>
      <li>Because of the brand name I decided to replace the whole thing, thinking Revlon makes only quality products.</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes but the blade kept coming out when I pressed it against my foot or heal.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>The blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be out far enough for it to do its job properly.</li>
      <li>find these blades last a long time, but I actually use an older handle with them.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them to other people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> Well, I was wrong, luckily I have my old one, an unknown brand</li>

<li> /&gt;Product is not worth a cent in my eyes because it simply does not work.</li>
<li> Maybe I got a lemon, but the product I received was built loosely</li>

<li> Am I the only one who has noticed over the years that Revlon products are absolutely USELESS unless they stick to their core -- lipstick/nailpolish,etc.</li>
<li> I find this disgusting because they don&#x27;t use an autoclave to clean them.</li>
<li> But on a serious note the product is unsatisfactory in every way.</li>
<li> I used this last night and cut my heel really badly.</li>
<li> This product was poorly designed.</li>
<li> the blades are at insufficient angle, so it is sort of difficult to get rid of rigorous callus and takes tons of time to have your pedicure done.</li>
<li> Revlon failed to even apologize for this thing.  </li>
<li> The shaver is useless - does not remove any of the callus.</li>
<li> Totally useless at this point and possibly dangerous.</li>
<li> Remember: those calouses are there for a reason, and if you go too crazy, your feet will be sore.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t go crazy with it though.</li>
<li> The blade always pops off and makes it dangerous.</li>
<li> Really very dangerous.</li>
<li> Very disappointed</li>
<li> This thing is dangerous!!!</li>
<li> This foot shaver is THE WORST I have ever encountered in my life.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it once so far not as easy as I thought it should be to use.</li>
    <li> This little tool is a must. Just be sure to soak your feet first or else you&#x27;ll have little chunks of skin taken out. Don&#x27;t go crazy with it though. Remember: those calouses are there for a reason, and if you go too crazy, your feet will be sore.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a lemon, but the product I received was built loosely so it refused to hold the blade. I simply took the blade and popped it into my old shaver and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> The one I purchased also fell apart, did nothing in the one configuration where it did not fall apart.  It is incomprehensible how this is supposed to work.    I wrote Revlon, received unapologetic instructions to return in a padded, insured envelope if I wanted more than an auto-reply saying there&#x27;s nothing they intend to do.  In other words, suck it up.  It was only $5. The problem with that is it was $5 intended to buy a product, not $5 intended as a donation to Revlon.      As I&#x27;m not going to that length, all I can do is recommend you try another brand. Revlon failed to even apologize for this thing.  And it deserves an apology.</li>
    <li> This product was poorly designed. The blade doesn&#x27;t even stay in place or fit properly. I \\&quot;used\\&quot; it once and then threw it away.     Save your money and buy a better product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how this is supposed to work. the blade falls out at the slightest. There are no clear instructions on the package. A small set of instructional diagrams would go a long way.  Totally useless at this point and possibly dangerous. I am not at all sure how to install the blade and use this product. Help Revlon!  [[ASIN:B0009EXOB4 Revlon Callus Shaver With 5 Replacement Blades]]</li>
    <li> The blade would not stay in place and we couldn&#x27;t figure out how it is intended to be used?  Not only does it NOT come with instructions, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any instructions or user guide available on the Internet?  I think even a \\&quot;one\\&quot; Star rating may be to high :)</li>
    <li> Nail salons have switched to the cheese grater method of removing callouses from your feet. I find this disgusting because they don&#x27;t use an autoclave to clean them. I bring in my own callus shaver to the salon and sometimes they are willing to use that.&lt;br /&gt;I find these blades last a long time, but I actually use an older handle with them. This handle, because it&#x27;s rounded, seems to be slippery to me. I wish salons could all use these, but the next best thing is handling your business at home.</li>
    <li> Would be nice if the instructions were clearer but good product. Good price too. Recommend it to any body who needs one.</li>
    <li> wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. If anybody can tell me how to put the blade in, that might help.</li>
    <li> The shaver is useless - does not remove any of the callus. What more can I possibly say about it?</li>
    <li> Does not stay together. The blade always pops off and makes it dangerous. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> If you need any callus remover and the only one you can find is this, get a brick and save your money! This will work only if your heels have more than 1/4 inch raised calluses on an 45 degree angle or so; unlikely any human will have that callus oddity, so my best guess is that it might be meant for some other beings but not for humans.</li>
    <li> Salon Scrape at home.  It is easy to use and does not require much pressure.  Just do not shave too much off.</li>
    <li> didnt work as well as i thought it would</li>
    <li> I ended up throwing this thing out after one use.  It basically won&#x27;t stay together and doesn&#x27;t actually take off skin well except in chunks.  Really very dangerous.</li>
    <li> the blades are at insufficient angle, so it is sort of difficult to get rid of rigorous callus and takes tons of time to have your pedicure done. Plus the shaver gets clogged pretty fast.</li>
    <li> all of the items I purchased met my standards and were totally worth buying. I would highly recommend them to other people.&lt;br /&gt;I found the book to be very helpful with the course I am taking and I know I will be needing all the information in this book, so I&lt;br /&gt;will not be selling it back.</li>
    <li> I had an older model of the Revlon shaver and it really worked well. After a move, I somehow misplaced it. I bought this model thinking it would work as well; it does not work at all. I would give it a zero if it were on the scale.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product. It&#x27;s exactly as advertised. It works great if it is used correctly. I recommend it, but I would use foot balm on calluses first, then use the shaver after the skin is softened.</li>
    <li> The blade doesn&#x27;t seem to be out far enough for it to do its job properly. I feel like I have to press down a lot harder than I should have to. The one I bought elsewhere before was so much better. I had to be careful not to cut myself on that one.</li>
    <li> I was looking to purchase replacement blades only, but then I found this shaver by Revlon. Because of the brand name I decided to replace the whole thing, thinking Revlon makes only quality products. Well, I was wrong, luckily I have my old one, an unknown brand and I am using it with the new replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I am going to keep this review short and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is not worth a cent in my eyes because it simply does not work. You could maybe use it as a bottle opener if your lucky. But on a serious note the product is unsatisfactory in every way.</li>
    <li> With my cracked heals this Works Great for shaving the dead skin. I am happy I ordered this calisthenics shaver.</li>
    <li> Wonderful customer service and I love the product. Works really well and the replacement blades are great so I can replace them as I need without having to go out and but more each time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it also did not hold the blade and it does nothing. I had such high hopes but the blade kept coming out when I pressed it against my foot or heal.  Would not recommended or purchased again.</li>
    <li> I used this last night and cut my heel really badly. Have to wear a sock with healing balm now. Hurts to walk. Bled all over. This thing is dangerous!!! Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> I think the product itself is fine but really not what I needed. It is exactly what I expected. It is very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who has noticed over the years that Revlon products are absolutely USELESS unless they stick to their core -- lipstick/nailpolish,etc. This foot shaver is THE WORST I have ever encountered in my life. The blades do absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s a total scam. Revlon should be ashamed. Get any other foot shaver out there, I can promise you it will be more effective than the revlon one.</li>
    <li> It does not get a close enough cut like the cheap one I bought from a corner store years ago.</li>
    <li> I would definately recommend this product.  It works great and you don&#x27;t even have to put a lot of pressure on the skin to get a clean result.</li>
