<li> I have taken this along with my Nature&#x27;s Sunshine (NS) Fenugreek and Thyme, for a knockout punch for a serious headache and runny/stuffy nose situation.  </li>
<li> For instance, this spring, there were only two days that the pollen was so bad that I needed to take ALJ.  </li>
<li> We have found that the recommended dosage of 4 capsules three times a day is the starting dosage, or the dosage to use when pollen is particularly bad.  </li>

    <li> I have used this product for myself and my family for the last 15 years.  It has helped me avoid allergy shots and it has helped my family manage their seasonal allergy symptoms without need for over-the-counter or prescription drugs.  We have found that the recommended dosage of 4 capsules three times a day is the starting dosage, or the dosage to use when pollen is particularly bad.  However, we do not need this many capsules most of the time.  Over the years, I feel that ALJ has helped my system develop a more appropriate response to allergens and I handle allergies much better.  For instance, this spring, there were only two days that the pollen was so bad that I needed to take ALJ.  The rest of the season, I was basically unaffected by the pollen.</li>
    <li> This was recommend by a friend and it really works. I was only using it as needed but with the humidity lately I have been taking it regularly and within a week I could feel a difference. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I loved ! everything is perfect</li>
    <li> Faster delivery than stated! Great packaging! This product is great for my sinuses &amp; chest congestion. It&#x27;s always been a useful tool in my home. Just glad to find it cheaper &amp; in 2 pack at that! Even better! ( for $5 more than store cost of 1 I got 2!) A++!!</li>
    <li> Fifteen years ago I was diagnosed with asthma. A friend recommended I give ALJ a try. I was immediately able to stop using an inhaler and within a year was able to stop regular use of ALJ. This summer my symptoms returned with no clear cause. While I again have a prescription inhaler, I am using it less than once a week and hope that ALJ will once again be a total solution.</li>
    <li> I will never go without this product again. It has literally changed my life. I suffered from allergies which lead to breathing troubles. I would never have believed the claim on how quickly it works...but then I tried it...AND IT DID! IMMEDIATELY! Honestly I don&#x27;t think there ever been a more beneficial product to the quality of my life.</li>
    <li> I have asthma and this helps keep my lungs strong.</li>
    <li> This supplement is great. My son has asthma and this is a great way to naturally keep ahead of it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could live without ALJ. Anytime I my sinuses start to block up, I take one and 20 minutes later I am breathing. It is so wonderful to take a natural product that works and doesn&#x27;t give you that uncomfortable body feeing that OTC and prescription product give you.</li>
    <li> This is the natural way of curing my allergies.  It is a great product and I am happy to be healthier because of the herbs and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> perfect for clearing out my Lungs.</li>
    <li> great product will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good product!  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Keeps my sinus clear all year. This is a great purchase for people with sinus problems or any other lung or allergen problem</li>
    <li> Switched to the veg. Caps</li>
    <li> Years ago I was having many airborne allergies with loss of voice. I went into a Nature&#x27;s Sunshine store and the owner advised me to take one capsule a day after my initial problems decreased. She said in one year my allergies would be much better. They were. I continued to use the product for a number of years. Slowly over the years as allergies bothered me less and less, I allowed myself to discontinue the use. This year the cedar pollen in central Texas was severe and I really had a problem. So, I am back to taking one capsule a day...will see how next cedar pollen season affect me.</li>
    <li> Prefer the veggitabs, but good product from Naturessunshine with good price</li>
    <li> Great for respiratory congestion.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if it&#x27;s doing what dr thinks it will. May take several weeks like most natural supplements.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to take a lot of medications when my allergies and sinuses need help.  This does the trick.  It really works.</li>
    <li> Really helps my husband with his upper congestion. He has problems with allergies and this product helps keep him breathing freely.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have asthma.  However, sometimes when there is a lot of stuff in the air (I live in the desert) or I have ANY minor breathing issues, I take a couple ALJs and it really works.&lt;br /&gt; My wife has asthma and she uses ALJ for minor flare-ups.  This doesn&#x27;t replace her medicine or inhalers.  But, instead of MORE medicine, she occasionally uses ALJ and is symptom-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.  And not expensive.</li>
    <li> I have asthma. Been on this for months and my doctor cannot believe how my lungs stay clear throughout the allergy season! It works! I take two pills every day no matter what!</li>
    <li> i love being able to take this and help with all that is wrong. its great to get rid of my runny noise and help with my seasonal&lt;br /&gt; stuff</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products to have on hand whenever my lungs feel tight.</li>
    <li> really helped me. taking 2 with each meal. however I bought it a lot cheaper on Greatest Herbs on Earth.  the shipping on 3 bottles was the same as 1 bottle. (7.50) probably could have gotten 4 in that box, I just didnt know how well it would work. since my kids really vouch for it for their allergies, I gave it a try. It took a couple days, but what a relief. my son uses it only twice a day.</li>
    <li> Add this to your herb arsenal, to address upper respiratory distress during allergy season.  I have taken this along with my Nature&#x27;s Sunshine (NS) Fenugreek and Thyme, for a knockout punch for a serious headache and runny/stuffy nose situation.  At the time, my headache was almost &#x27;migraine-level,&#x27; and my head and nose felt clogged; I needed immediate relief!  The combination of herbs worked within the hour.  I&#x27;ve been a Nature&#x27;s Sunshine fan for many years, and AMAZON had a competitive price (as compared to the NS website).  Easy to swallow capsules, no after-taste - an the dark plastic container, keeps the light away to protect the integrity of the herbs.  Everyone I recommend it to -- gives me great feedback as an &#x27;allergy season&#x27; solution!</li>
    <li> I purchased these for a friend who has used it before and finds it very effective. Plan to order again as needed.</li>
    <li> According to manufacture this product cannot be sold in Amazon. I return it.</li>
    <li> thank you for the product.</li>
    <li> so true.  I prefer the herbals to any inhalers.  Not as many side effects.  Service was good, I will reorder again.</li>
