      <li>nice headbands, stay put &amp; doesn&#x27;t damage hair&lt;</li>
      <li>If you have a normal size head, these are probably perfect.</li>

      <li>So very comfortable and lovely colours.</li>
      <li>These are okay</li>

      <li>Better off getting the ones with the no slip grip.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>they break easy</li>

      <li>They came exactly as pictured!</li>
      <li>These headwraps are nice for holding my hair back when applying make-up or washing my face.  </li>
      <li>They are nicely made, but do not work too well on my short hair.  </li>
      <li>I love that they come in such a variety of colors; I&#x27;m always going to have one to match whatever I&#x27;m wearing, and the brown one blends right into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These serve their purpose pretty well</li>
      <li>I use these as headbands for my different hairstyles and they fit really well.</li>
      <li>It was very lose around my head</li>
      <li>The headwraps are still usable in this condition but will probably break much sooner than they should.</li>
      <li>The garters stretch too fast...</li>
      <li>Order these every year for a few orphanages in Guyana.&lt;br /&gt;Girls love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>these not only are they durable but also doesn&#x27;t require more thn one to get a heavy ponytail in the right position and keep it there.</li>
      <li>That being said, I have a huge head and have trouble wearing all kinds of headbands, not just these, so its probably just my problem.</li>
      <li>Made for a child not an adult.</li>
      <li>review was written by my 15 year old daughter under my username.)</li>
      <li>NOT FLAT.</li>

    <li> The garters stretch too fast... Each band can be used less than 20x perhaps... Then they become really loose.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re head bands and she liked them...</li>
    <li> Order these every year for a few orphanages in Guyana.&lt;br /&gt;Girls love this stuff.  Staff are happy for these accessories for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;Price is great too.</li>
    <li> I have thick long and heavy hair usually the regular size &amp;#34;bobos&amp;#34; ( elastic hair thingy ) pop after a few uses or even rip my hair out do to the fact I attempt to put my hair in a pony tail and because it can&#x27;t be wrapped around a few times I am forced to put ore thn one.&lt;br /&gt;With these not only are they durable but also doesn&#x27;t require more thn one to get a heavy ponytail in the right position and keep it there.</li>
    <li> I love these. My hair is very fine and tends to slip out of pony tails. These are just what I need to keep it all back.</li>
    <li> Love them well worth the add on price</li>
    <li> Better off getting the ones with the no slip grip. These serve their purpose pretty well but I am constantly having to adjust them.</li>
    <li> These are okay some are coming out through the medal part..Im still using them until they break apart or i figure out a way to keep these together for a bit longer</li>
    <li> I use these as headbands for my different hairstyles and they fit really well. Not too tight or too loose.</li>
    <li> These are just like the hair bands you can buy at the store, only they cost less money. They came exactly as pictured!</li>
    <li> NOT FLAT. I bought these  to attach pre schooler&#x27;s ID badges to their backpacks. Because they are not flat, they won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The rubber inside of every single headwrap seperated from the metal connector after one day of use, leaving a thin area of fabrc before the rubber band section starts. The headwraps are still usable in this condition but will probably break much sooner than they should.</li>
    <li> nice headbands, stay put &amp; doesn&#x27;t damage hair&lt;br /&gt;nice colors too</li>
    <li> Got these for my boyfriend. He loves them but you get what you pay for... they break easy</li>
    <li> These headwraps are nice for holding my hair back when applying make-up or washing my face.  I have also used them just as a headband to keep my hair out of my face.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Mostly my fault for not paying attention to the type of headband I was buying, but I don&#x27;t really like these. I prefer the type/size of headband that is wider and flatter. I also do not like the metal clip that seals the ends of the elastic because it catches baby hair in the back. I kept them because they were an add-on, but I wouldn&#x27;t repeat the purchase.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe these stay in place...never had to re-position it or anything!</li>
    <li> So very comfortable and lovely colours. Perfect for my Texas heat !</li>
    <li> Made for a child not an adult.</li>
    <li> Items were as described.  Neutral color variet.</li>
    <li> They are nicely made, but do not work too well on my short hair.  I wanted them to hold back my short bob when I wash my face.  Unfortunately, with my hair cut close at my nape, the headwraps want to creep up.  I will give them to a friend with long hair.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time when I wear these headbands with my hair rolled up and tucked into them. Everyone always wonders how I do it. These bands are the answer! I love that they come in such a variety of colors; I&#x27;m always going to have one to match whatever I&#x27;m wearing, and the brown one blends right into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that these are a little small on me, and if I don&#x27;t adjust where it lies at the front of my head a few times during the day, I get a huge headache and a dent in my scalp from the pressure. That being said, I have a huge head and have trouble wearing all kinds of headbands, not just these, so its probably just my problem. If you have a normal size head, these are probably perfect.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t have a lot of &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; - making them slide off.  I wanted them handy in my convertible, but they don&#x27;t stay put very well.&lt;br /&gt;Granted, my hair is quite fine and a little thin, which may contribute to the issue.</li>
    <li> Well they are head bands and they are doing their job. Now they were a bit larger but that&#x27;s not their fault I happen to have a very small head and I have problems with finding headbands that won&#x27;t slip off.</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality, and shipped exactly as described. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Most headbands slip off your head or fray and snap altogether.  I have had these for a while now and they are all still in perfect condition, which is pretty impressive considering I wear one of them every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review was written by my 15 year old daughter under my username.)</li>
    <li> I is really good. Just a little big. Wish the bad was smaller and then could stretch to a bigger size. It was very lose around my head</li>
    <li> Finally I found proper item for my son long hair !! Hooray , it&#x27;s works for him !!</li>
    <li> Just what our daughter-in-law needed for when she worked out.  Quality appeared great.  Will updated if I hear anything negative from her.</li>
