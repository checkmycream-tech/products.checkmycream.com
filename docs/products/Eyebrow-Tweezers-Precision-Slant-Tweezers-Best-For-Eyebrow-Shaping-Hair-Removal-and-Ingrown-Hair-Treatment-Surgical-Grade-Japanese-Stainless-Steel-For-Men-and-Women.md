      <li>The right tweezers are important to me and these are superb!</li>
      <li>These are, by far, the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
      <li>They work great and are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now a very happy customer, thanks to an attentive and caring seller.</li>
      <li>Received a replacement tweezer today and it is exactly as described and works great too.</li>
      <li>quality and very precise.</li>
      <li>I love love love these tweezers</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years now and love them.</li>
      <li>It was 1,000 times easier to pluck my eyebrows, so precise!</li>
      <li>I may get more to give as gifts.</li>
      <li>The tweezers are okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Love these tweezers.</li>
      <li>I was able to quickly and painlessly tweeze my eyebrows!</li>
      <li>Very good quality, solid material, and seemingly reliable.  </li>
      <li>Not any better than cheap store bought tweezers.</li>
      <li>and so I can easily find them in my make-up bag.  </li>
      <li>Then, the very next day, I get an e-mail checking to make sure I am happy with the product.</li>
      <li>These tweezers are every bit as awesome at grabbing all types of hairs as a pair of Tweezerman tweezers - and they cost significantly less.</li>
      <li>so they are easy and comfortable to handle, but the ultra-precise tip gives great grip on even tiny</li>
      <li>These are so precise</li>
      <li>Not anything special to warrant the $12.95 price tag.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re high quality, easy to hold and easy to pluck.</li>
      <li>You will have to work at getting them to grab the hair adequately to extract it.</li>
      <li>zipper bag protects the tips, so they will stay in good condition for a long while.</li>
      <li>I actually did buy it again, love this product!</li>
      <li>They really work!!</li>
      <li>A lot may have to do with how light they are and the fact that manufacturers cannot make a quality product at a reasonable price for the consumer in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My lifelong search for the perfect tweezer is over at last.</li>
      <li>The seller saw my negative review and promptly contacted me with the suggestion that I may have received a defective product AND sent me a new one that is just as wonderful as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I can get all the little stray hairs on my eyebrows with good grip.</li>
      <li>Got each hair out on the first attempt.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
      <li>They have nice wide handles</li>
      <li>Great tweezer for use in crafts to handle and place very small items.  </li>
      <li>The little travel case is cute too!</li>
      <li>Contacted the seller who resolved the issue professionally and quickly.</li>
      <li>The tweezers work great - much better than my old ones that were driving me crazy.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it was.</li>
      <li>I really like the quality of these.</li>
      <li>I really needed them.</li>
      <li>Good tweezers, I give them 3 stars only because my last pair was 40 years old, and I don&#x27;t like change.</li>
      <li>It is a good product and has performed better than more expensive ones I have purchased prior to this one, will definitely buy again!</li>
      <li>Not bad but certainly no better than the Revlon tweezers I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
      <li>In addition, I highly recommend the quality of customer service offered by  the seller as well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>Love the little zipper tweezer bag.</li>
      <li>Love the little bag they came</li>
      <li>And I love the little canvas bag.</li>
      <li>When I purchased them, I thought it was silly that a pair of tweezers would come with their own zippered bag, but after using them last night and realizing just how much better they are than the $3 tweezers you can get anywhere else, I promptly zipped them into their little bag to keep them safe.  </li>
      <li>I keep my new tweezers in it both</li>
      <li>and come in a cute little storage bag!</li>
      <li>In the past I have purchased so many tweezers, expensive and not expensive and these are by far going to be my favorite!</li>
      <li>I lost my old Revlon tweezer</li>

    <li> Love these tweezers. They really get the short hard to pull hairs.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for several weeks and decided to wait and see if it performed as well after using it for a while. It has! It is a good product and has performed better than more expensive ones I have purchased prior to this one, will definitely buy again! I actually did buy it again, love this product!</li>
    <li> I never thought about tweezers. Aren&#x27;t the all the same? Wow, was I wrong. These tweezers are great! It was 1,000 times easier to pluck my eyebrows, so precise!</li>
    <li> These are, by far, the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  When I purchased them, I thought it was silly that a pair of tweezers would come with their own zippered bag, but after using them last night and realizing just how much better they are than the $3 tweezers you can get anywhere else, I promptly zipped them into their little bag to keep them safe.  I think I might also hide them, so my kids don&#x27;t run off with them when they think they have slivers.</li>
    <li> I really love these tweezees! This is my second pair, because I wanted to ensure I&#x27;d have a backup set just in case I lost mine or in the event my husband sneaks them into his toiletry case. I may get more to give as gifts. These are so precise and I like that the handle is long. The little travel case is cute too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not anything special to warrant the $12.95 price tag.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are perfect.  They are sharp enough and do what I need them to do.  The pouch is nice.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Tweezees on Wednesday and they arrived on Thursday!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it was. Then, the very next day, I get an e-mail checking to make sure I am happy with the product. I am REALLY happy, both with the tweezers and the amazing customer service. The tweezers work great - much better than my old ones that were driving me crazy. And I love the little canvas bag. I keep my new tweezers in it both so they stay sharp and so I can easily find them in my make-up bag.  I&#x27;ll be recommending this product and this company to all my friends.</li>
    <li> These are some phenomenal tweezers! I was able to quickly and painlessly tweeze my eyebrows! Which isn&#x27;t always the case with lead slant tip tweezers out there.</li>
    <li> Just received and tested them.  Very good quality, solid material, and seemingly reliable.  I also like the sleek looking design.</li>
    <li> Great tweezer for use in crafts to handle and place very small items.  Very impressed with quality of item and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> They work! They really work!! My lifelong search for the perfect tweezer is over at last. My original order arrived and I was disappointed to find it was just another dud tweezer.

I&#x27;m now a very happy customer, thanks to an attentive and caring seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years now and love them. They&#x27;re high quality, easy to hold and easy to pluck. I&#x27;ve had the same set for several years now and bought these for my mom. She loves them too. They work great and are easy to clean. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good set of tweezers.</li>
    <li> Well built. Fits in hand like glove.</li>
    <li> The best tweezers I have ever bought. Actually, my husband bought them for me because he knew I was tired of poor quality tweezers. These are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacquelin Samuels</li>
    <li> Good quality works well, it feels very solid in my hand.</li>
    <li> very good product.girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> Fab tweezers! I am a bit of a tweezer enthusiast. I really like the quality of these. I have thick eye brows and can even get the little hairs as easily as the thick ones. Love!</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had.  I kept buying tweezers only to find that they just don&#x27;t work for small splinters and hairs.  These are awesome and work great!  I like them so well, I&#x27;m going to buy another set or two.  Also, the seller kept me informed as to the status of my order.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I have used. Effortless in grabbing and removing hair. Got each hair out on the first attempt.&lt;br /&gt;High quality and very precise. Love the little bag they came in.&lt;br /&gt;The seller Bardeau Essentials has great customer service!</li>
    <li> They have nice wide handles so they are easy and comfortable to handle, but the ultra-precise tip gives great grip on even tiny hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The zipper bag protects the tips, so they will stay in good condition for a long while.</li>

    <li> Not any better than cheap store bought tweezers.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are awesome! I can get all the little stray hairs on my eyebrows with good grip.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are okay. You will have to work at getting them to grab the hair adequately to extract it. I lost my old Revlon tweezer I had for over 20 years that worked exceptionally well and I was hopeful this tweezer would work as well, but it did not. A lot may have to do with how light they are and the fact that manufacturers cannot make a quality product at a reasonable price for the consumer in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t had a great tweezer previsouly, I would not have had anything to compare it with and may have given these a four rating.</li>
    <li> The right tweezers are important to me and these are superb! I love love love these tweezers</li>
    <li> Great product with precision points.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Do a perfect job.  Made me realize how bad my old ones were at gripping and removing hair. Love the little zipper tweezer bag. Very satisfied and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are every bit as awesome at grabbing all types of hairs as a pair of Tweezerman tweezers - and they cost significantly less. Sold!</li>
    <li> Slant tweezers are great.  I really needed them.</li>
    <li> Just received these today and had to try them out immediately and so glad I did, these tweezers are amazing! I love them! In the past I have purchased so many tweezers, expensive and not expensive and these are by far going to be my favorite! I&#x27;ll have to hide them from my daughter or on second thought I&#x27;ll just buy her a pair. I&#x27;m very pleased! and come in a cute little storage bag!</li>
    <li> Received a replacement tweezer today and it is exactly as described and works great too. Contacted the seller who resolved the issue professionally and quickly. Highly recommend the product. In addition, I highly recommend the quality of customer service offered by  the seller as well.</li>
