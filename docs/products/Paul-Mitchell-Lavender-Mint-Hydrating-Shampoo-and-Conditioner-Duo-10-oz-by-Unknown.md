      <li>Works great, smells terrific.</li>
      <li>The cruelty free part is also a plus.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel soft and smells really good.</li>
      <li>I heard many great things about Paul Mitchell though and the brand is widely known in salons</li>
      <li>It also has a strong lavender fragrance....not my favorite, but I mainly bought it because I needed a clarifying shampoo and conditioner with strong moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for dry, naturally curly and processed hair!!</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t think ahead to buy trial-size shampoo &amp; conditioner for a camping trip, so I had to lug these full size bottles there.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased that it left my hair feeling so soft and healthy!</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so soft, and easy to style!</li>
      <li>I love the smell and it leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>

      <li>Felt like I had to wash my hair more frequently</li>
      <li>Later I found out the prices in a salon and somewhat laughed to myself that someone would spend that much on shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way with this awesome product!</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t bother me once on the whole trip!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Very Moisturizing!  </li>
      <li>I first tried this shampoo and conditioner when I was working for a veterinary hospital; one of the clients worked at a salon &amp; gave all of us trial/gift sizes for the holidays.</li>
      <li>so well is keeping my hair smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>- it was so hot &amp; humid</li>
      <li>so I tried the 10 oz size first.</li>
      <li>The product is great but the price is ridiculous considering the size of the bottles.</li>
      <li>with this shampoo, my hair is so soft and clean and I have no dandruff anymore.</li>
      <li>This line makes my scalp feel clean and my hair soft and silky without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE the product but was very upset when it arrived open and spilled in the box!</li>
      <li>I use this my hair use to be dry now it has a flare I love this stuff I&#x27;m going to keep using it</li>
      <li>and my hair is soft and a nice shade of grey.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, and really I feel that the product is more concentrated that other shampoo/conditioners out there, so you use less of it</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Often is with oily hair may avoid moisturizing products but this stuff is luxurious and really just the bees knees.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>Also it is so much easier to comb after using Loreal for damaged hair.</li>
      <li>so 10oz isn&#x27;t so much of a problem for me considering I don&#x27;t need a lot of product but just keep that in mind when buying.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I am going to invest in the big size next time.</li>
      <li>Con: I wish the product tingled a little more.</li>
      <li>The difference in price from your standard run-of-the-mill shampoos &amp; conditioners is well worth the results.</li>
      <li>&amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 favorite shampoo and conditioner although they were smaller than I expected</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t get the 1 liter bottles like I was going to do, instead I bought the small ones.</li>
      <li>its clearly marked 2 for 20.  </li>
      <li>I was so surprised considering it has Tea Tree Oil in it.  </li>
      <li>It does make my hair soft, however so does Loreal.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny without making it greasy and gross.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go back to my old one of lanza.</li>

    <li> Perfect as described. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> the smell is heavenly</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Not so enamored with the results for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Smells like dog shampoo, but at least it isn&#x27;t causing my scalp to break out like everything else I&#x27;ve tried over the last few months.</li>
    <li> Made my hair much softer and smell great throughout the whole day! love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and perfect size</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy, curly, out of control hair and i LOVE this shampoo. Plus my hair smells just wonderful for up to 3 days - I cant&#x27; wash it every day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, 10oz is a lot smaller than you might think. I heard many great things about Paul Mitchell though and the brand is widely known in salons so I gave it a try. I have short hair so 10oz isn&#x27;t so much of a problem for me considering I don&#x27;t need a lot of product but just keep that in mind when buying. I do love this shampoo&amp;conditioner. I love tea tree oil and these have that in there which is a plus. It has a nice aroma but it isn&#x27;t too strong so that&#x27;s a plus as well. It makes my hair soft, silky, and shiny without making it greasy and gross. I guess the only con is the size but for this brand 20 bucks isn&#x27;t a bad price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this my hair use to be dry now it has a flare I love this stuff I&#x27;m going to keep using it I would give it 1000 star review</li>
    <li> Love the smell. it real does have you feeling wonderful after using it. you hair looks great. but they re ripping you off on the rice. its clearly marked 2 for 20.  you should not be allowed to do that.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it is great for my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells like hemp oil not rosemary and mint. It&#x27;s not a good clarifying shampoo and an average conditioner. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner, it smells awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> It smell like old spice and dries hair I had better success with Paul&#x27;s speacial shampoo set .</li>
    <li> Just not my favorite. Felt like I had to wash my hair more frequently and I smelled the tea tree oil but not the lavender</li>
    <li> Works great, smells terrific.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Makes my hair feel soft and smells really good.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. every shampoo I was using before was leaving build up on my hair and I had the worst dandruff. with this shampoo, my hair is so soft and clean and I have no dandruff anymore. It is expensive so I tried the 10 oz size first. I love it so much that I am going to invest in the big size next time. I have had the 10 oz for a month already and im only half way through with it. A little bit goes a long way with this awesome product! I love it!</li>
    <li> The product is great. Con: I wish the product tingled a little more.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I love how it works on my hair, love the scent. I don&#x27;t have a negative comment one.</li>
    <li> LOVE the product but was very upset when it arrived open and spilled in the box! I would buy from someone else.</li>
    <li> This product gave me dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for dry, naturally curly and processed hair!! Makes my hair so soft, and easy to style! I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is too perfumy for me.  Very small amount for the price.  Shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Love how my hair looks after using this shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
    <li> I first tried this shampoo and conditioner when I was working for a veterinary hospital; one of the clients worked at a salon &amp; gave all of us trial/gift sizes for the holidays. Later I found out the prices in a salon and somewhat laughed to myself that someone would spend that much on shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I found this on Amazon and bought it - and I am so glad that I did. Never has my hair been more manageable or shiny. The difference in price from your standard run-of-the-mill shampoos &amp; conditioners is well worth the results. It smells amazing, and really I feel that the product is more concentrated that other shampoo/conditioners out there, so you use less of it thus it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, I didn&#x27;t think ahead to buy trial-size shampoo &amp; conditioner for a camping trip, so I had to lug these full size bottles there. I was so glad that I did - it was so hot &amp; humid there were bugs everywhere, and other women noticed that I had not been plagued by bugs around my head like they were. Then it hit me - the mint. Bugs hate mint. They didn&#x27;t bother me once on the whole trip!</li>
    <li> I thought I was receiving the mint version and did not..Probably my error..I do not like the Lavender as I did the mint..</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner., however it was way too small for the price.</li>
    <li> good shampoo conditioner</li>
    <li> Every shampoo that I tried tried caused my scalp to itch. The tea tree shampoo stopped that and my hair is soft and a nice shade of grey.</li>
    <li> They are extremely small. Love the set though.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for so for those who complain about the price buy sauve or whatever but it will not as good as this shampoo and conditioner. Great moisturizer and great for dry scalp. My whole family uses it.</li>
    <li> Really nice feel and smell.  I noticed I have almost no dandruff when I use this.</li>
    <li> The nozzle on the conditioner does not work. The stuff smells good though. Makes my hair a little dry.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for my wavy hair. I wouldn&#x27;t go back to my old one of lanza. The cruelty free part is also a plus.</li>
    <li> Great manly scent. This is probably the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the price is ridiculous considering the size of the bottles.</li>
    <li> Love the product and at a great price</li>
    <li> Very Moisturizing!  I was so surprised considering it has Tea Tree Oil in it.  It also has a strong lavender fragrance....not my favorite, but I mainly bought it because I needed a clarifying shampoo and conditioner with strong moisturizers.  I am very pleased that it left my hair feeling so soft and healthy!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!&lt;br /&gt;Great essence and good for my hair ( I already ordered more )</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  My hair feels amazing!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because of the scent combination but got a pleasant surprise at how soft and shiny my hair became also.  It is now one of my top favorite shampoos, ever</li>
    <li> It does make my hair soft, however so does Loreal. Also it is so much easier to comb after using Loreal for damaged hair. The worst part about this stuff is it smells so horrible! I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t get the 1 liter bottles like I was going to do, instead I bought the small ones. I will finish using them up, but not without spraying perfume all over my hair! THIS STUFF STINKS! Smells like medicated dog shampoo.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 favorite shampoo and conditioner although they were smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> Both shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful light fragrance of Lavender and mint. My hair looks and feels great after using this combo. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product although some leaked out in packaging.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner that I have found for dry scalp problem.</li>
    <li> The smell is soothing and this works so well is keeping my hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> love the scent!!!! great product</li>
    <li> Best scent ever, and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> This is one of my go-to shampoos. I have oily hair but can get away with not washing daily when using a dry shampoo. This line makes my scalp feel clean and my hair soft and silky without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often is with oily hair may avoid moisturizing products but this stuff is luxurious and really just the bees knees.</li>
