      <li>this product even more.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>They should keep this color but add a lighter, more taupe shade.  </li>
      <li>w/b that after every fifth/sixth use, I make sure to clean the handy dandy app brush on a tissue</li>
      <li>but then I finally used it and now I&#x27;m in love !!!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants perfect brows.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply,stays on well,and does not irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have very dark brunette hair and the taupe is perfect.  . .</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and they were willing to work with me which a lot of companies wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
      <li>The brush is handy and that is the only thing that made this purchase an okay purchase for me.</li>
      <li>(And yes, I clean the brush during and after application.)</li>
      <li>First time Ive been able to make nice natural look brows</li>
      <li>good product for me - would and have recommended it to others - stays on for several days unless I remove it.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works if you have wirey brows and need to fill in gaps as most do...  </li>
      <li>Nice product  seems to stay in place and looks natural</li>
      <li>I need to use my own smaller tapered brush...</li>
      <li>Very natural and easy application.</li>
      <li>I am a light blonde and the taupe is the right shade if you apply it with a light hand.  </li>
      <li>I think I could get the hang of applying it with a little practice and it looks good after brushing</li>
      <li>I looked at it first and was like dang</li>
      <li>first, but after my first use, saw the difference...</li>
      <li>I watched a couple of tutorials on YouTube for a few pointers which increased my happiness</li>
      <li>I think my usual cheap brow powder from Walmart actually is better than this.</li>
      <li>It lasts much longer than all of the pencil brow enhancers that I have tried.  </li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t make it through the whole work day for me.  </li>
      <li>But it lasts much longer than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>It actually works exactly like they say !!</li>
      <li>So much so, I&#x27;ve purchased a few more items in product line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I lOve this over any other brand now!!</li>
      <li>I will state first of all that I am in my 50&#x27;s and it has taken me this long to find an eyebrow filler that really does what is says.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product highly to anyone who needs to define brows NATURALLY.  </li>
      <li>my eyebrows (mine are thin &amp; very sparse after the arch) remained gorgeous &amp; NATURAL looking all day long.  </li>
      <li>At 67 years old my brows are almost gone but with the Too</li>
      <li>It just blends in and looks professional . . . ..  </li>
      <li>Bulletproof brows looks natural and is creamy, yet stays on all day..  . . .</li>
      <li>Wow just wow</li>
      <li>It is worth the $30.00 i spent on it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I have bought the most expensive to the cheapest and all really do a very nice job but not a perfect job.</li>
      <li>Too dark for light blond or grey.  </li>
      <li>Product really looks natural, and fills in my missing 67 year old brows PERFECTLY...lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I PAINT on nearly 2/3rds of my brows daily.</li>

<li> Perhaps I will try it again in Winter and see if it does better in the cold.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product.  It lasts much longer than all of the pencil brow enhancers that I have tried.  I am a light blonde and the taupe is the right shade if you apply it with a light hand.  It is a little cheaper on Amazon and I buy most everything from Amazon.  This was for my wife.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The best I have ever used.  Will always have it on hand. I will buy again and again from this seller.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a winner. After years of having brow pencil rub off part way through the day, finally a product that stays until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a brow make up that is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I will continue to use this product.  At 67 years old my brows are almost gone but with the Too Faced Bulletproof brows I they are filled in perfectly and look great.  Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> Product flakes as it is applied. (And yes, I clean the brush during and after application.) Compared to other premium eye brow cosmetics that I have used, Too Faced Bulletproof Brows comes in last, and is a disappointment.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will state first of all that I am in my 50&#x27;s and it has taken me this long to find an eyebrow filler that really does what is says. I have bought the most expensive to the cheapest and all really do a very nice job but not a perfect job. Finally an eyebrow product that does what it states . . . . ..  .it took long enough! I have very dark brunette hair and the taupe is perfect.  . . .. but I am going to buy the brunette also and mix it with the taupe. It is by far the best product on the market. The brush is a wonderful defining brush.  . . .which makes the application glide on beautifully. Bulletproof brows looks natural and is creamy, yet stays on all day..  . . . .it seems to be waterproof. It stays on all day which is a plus, no touch ups!  It doesn&#x27;t make you look fake. It just blends in and looks professional . . . ..  .as if I had a makeup artist do my brows. OMG, I am sold on this product, I will be buying it for life.</li>
    <li> Thank you !!! Wow amazing item !! Soo happy very inpresed !! It actually works exactly like they say !! Wow just wow</li>
    <li> I recommend this product highly to anyone who needs to define brows NATURALLY.  It stays on all day beautifully.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> For those of us with thin eyebrows, this product is a blessing.  It&#x27;s simple to use and delivers excellent results.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants perfect brows.</li>
    <li> good product for me - would and have recommended it to others - stays on for several days unless I remove it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!! this product is horrible. If you want a product that will stay on forever and take out your hair when you try to take it off this product is the one to buy! They made me put a star.But the customer service is excellent. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied and they were willing to work with me which a lot of companies wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I love this product. First time Ive been able to make nice natural look brows</li>
    <li> Had seen this brand on tv, checked out reviews &amp; prices, found it on Amazon a bit cheaper &amp; w/my Prime Membership, saved a little bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used the mineral makeup for years, was happy with their eye brow kit, but wanted something longer lasting...&amp; found it in this amazing, seriously easy kit!!  The product has a waxy consistency which was kinda weird @ first, but after my first use, saw the difference...my eyebrows (mine are thin &amp; very sparse after the arch) remained gorgeous &amp; NATURAL looking all day long.  Easy to apply. I watched a couple of tutorials on YouTube for a few pointers which increased my happiness w/this product even more. So much so, I&#x27;ve purchased a few more items in product line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat w/b that after every fifth/sixth use, I make sure to clean the handy dandy app brush on a tissue cos the product can &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,very happy with my bullet proof eyebrow kit.</li>
    <li> Nice product  seems to stay in place and looks natural</li>
    <li> This brow makeup does what it says.  I like it, and I use it nearly daily.  I assumed from the the &amp;#34;bulletproof&amp;#34; title that it would be exceptionally long lasting.  However, it doesn&#x27;t make it through the whole work day for me.  I have to touch up in the afternoon. But it lasts much longer than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I like the spoolie tool too.</li>
    <li> Takes a bit to learn how to apply...I need to use my own smaller tapered brush...brush provided is too wide for my taste.Product really looks natural, and fills in my missing 67 year old brows PERFECTLY...lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The worst part of the makeup routine is putting on eyebrows.  Bulletproof Brows has cut the amount of time it takes and they last all day!!  This is the best eyebrow makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works if you have wirey brows and need to fill in gaps as most do...  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> too dark even though I ordered the lightest color</li>
    <li> Love the packaging.. It won&#x27;t dry out. The only issue is that Taupe is really dark brown.IIt&#x27;s too dark for me. I&#x27;ll give it to my sister.</li>
    <li> Perfect color!!! I looked at it first and was like dang it ,it&#x27;s to warm :( but then I finally used it and now I&#x27;m in love !!!</li>
    <li> I finally found an eyebrow gel,powder,pencil and setting wax all in one. The cashmere clay formula is the BEST! I use to use tarte architect brow pencil and over it iI use maybelline brow drama. I lOve this over any other brand now!! This is what my brows have been needing. It is easy to apply,stays on well,and does not irritate my skin. The brow/spoolie double ended brush is perfect. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this. It is worth the $30.00 i spent on it at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows naturally do not grow the way they should yet I hate the fake eyebrow look and this doesn&#x27;t give that look whatsoever.  Very natural and easy application.</li>
    <li> Does NOT match up to any hair color and the product was not easy to work with.Never worked for me.</li>
    <li> The two stars are because of the color.  Too dark for light blond or grey.  Love the feathering brush.  I think I could get the hang of applying it with a little practice and it looks good after brushing but it&#x27;s too dark.  Wipe off any excess on the applicator side so you don&#x27;t get clumps of color.  They should keep this color but add a lighter, more taupe shade.  Not everyone can wear dark eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I have little in the way of eyebrows because I have thyroid disease. I PAINT on nearly 2/3rds of my brows daily. I wanted something water proof and I bought this, while it did have some waterproof capability, it was not smudge proof and when it was hot this summer it was no better than any other product of its type and on top of that it was expensive! I think my usual cheap brow powder from Walmart actually is better than this. The brush is handy and that is the only thing that made this purchase an okay purchase for me. Try it, you might like it, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed. Perhaps I will try it again in Winter and see if it does better in the cold.</li>
