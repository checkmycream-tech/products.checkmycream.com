      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I also have a great “scent,” and not have to constantly think anymore</li>
      <li>it has kind of a flowery smell to it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was just what I wanted! Love the smell !</li>
    <li> I remember as if it were yesterday, AXE came out with their Men Line of Products, I picked up a batch for each of the men in my household, I wanted them to try this new product.  I was happy that they loved the product so much, and graduated to the deodorant gel, aerosol spray, body spray, shampoos, and everything else AXE had to offer. As they prepared daily for outdoor activities, work, leisure, etc., I would have to “suffer” through this wonderful manly invigorating, seductive, and stimulating scent that came only in a line of Men’s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, AXE for Women, I was impressed, excited, and could not wait to try the product, unfortunately, it was not available in my neighborhood retail stores, unless I drove into the City, yet the Men’s line of AXE products were available everywhere in the neighborhood. I wanted to finish some of my other body sprays, deodorants, and decided to purchase the AXE Bodyspray Female, Anarchy 4 0z, which I would tried for the first time. I wanted to see if I would like the “scent.” I was confident that if they manufactured such great “scents,” in the Men’s line, they should not be too far off in the “scents,” for Women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the AXE Bodyspray Female  Anarchy, I was very impressed with the “scent,” for two reasons, I have allergies, a “scent,” can smell great, but will make me sneeze continuously, or it could smell horrible, and I would also sneeze. Another factor if it would breakout my skin.  After spraying the AXE Bodyspray Female Anarchy, I waited a few minutes, no allergic reactions; to my skin or nose, body break-outs, and the smell is “awesome.” I put it up to my nose to see if I could figure out what “scents,” have been combined to give such a wonderful smelling “scent,” I could smell a hint of rose, but could not figure out the rest of the scents.  I am impressed.  AXE has a great formula in this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I also have a great “scent,” and not have to constantly think anymore, why can’t they make a Women’s product line? Now the men in my household have their AXE Products, and I have my AXE products, GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Men’s line carried body spray, shampoo, deodorant stick, deodorant roll-on, antiperspirant aerosol spray, and antiperspirants stick they had a great selection of scents. Hopefully, the Women’s line will be just as expansive. The Axe Anarchy For Her II has the scent of apple/mandarin with a hint of jasmine petals, vanilla and sandalwood. I am enjoying the Axe Anarchy For Her with the scent of blackcurrant, jasmine, rose with coconut and rich wood scents. I love the scent of Anarchy For Her. I am sure the products for Women will become as expansive as the Men’s product line has been for years.  I recently ordered the AXE Anarchy II for Women in the shower gel. When I have tried it, I will give another review for comparison, of which one I prefer, or maybe I would love them both. The Seller has described this product accurately, packaging very impressive, and delivery faster than I anticipated. Thanks Amazon and Seller for great customer service regarding this order. I would definitely recommend this product to others, including Amazon Customers.y think anymore, why can’t they make a Women’s product line?

    <li> Upon opening when u received this in the mail it was broke but just the cap that keeps it from spaying out. I use this after the shower and it&#x27;s great for an all over clean smell and feel. It just doesn&#x27;t stick very long!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most perfume. This doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and it smells like sweet clean. Nom nom</li>
    <li> I like that it is a light flowery scent. It really does smell good and last for a pretty good amount of time without overkill spraying it. The spray isn&#x27;t huge either so you can keep it in your purse or center console if you ever need a quick spray.  The price is great. Even the design is feminine. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The smell kinda reminds me of an air freshener scent. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells good and lasts a long time, but something about it reminds me of an air freshener I used to have.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my order today. I ordered two of these sprays one for my mom and one for my self... i must stay it smells wayyyyy better then i expected. Its also way bigger in person!it has a light floral smell but not too light, strong enough to smell when someone walks by you. I lovee it! It will be my go to summer scent. :) I definetly recommend buying this.. plus you cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> I like this body spray but i think i cheated myself because i didnt realize that they sell these at the store and i could get it cheaper because i wouldnt have to pay shipping fees.</li>
    <li> This smells so awesome! 😍</li>
    <li> so I smelled this when one of my many roommates was wearing this around our place, I wasn&#x27;t sure who it was since at the time we had 9 roomies, until one morning I saw her using it and realized it was this product. I rushed and ordered this cause it smelled amazing. I received it in no time and I LOVE IT! surprised axe could pull off such a great scent for women. *clapping*. Ive gotten a lot of compliments and really the most important is that I love it and boo thing does too! lol.</li>
    <li> I love axe but one thing I have to say about it is it really does run out quick but otherwise I love it</li>
    <li> Was so pleased to receive this pkg.It goes on so easy and last for hrs compared to other body sprays out there.It  has a very good scent.and last for hours.Mman really likes this stuff.I hope u can come out with more scents for axe for chics.besides pink and white can and the white and orange..At most stores there body spray is way to strong or too weak and not too many good scents.i love this i use everday.</li>
    <li> First of the bottle was much bigger than I expected. If your a girl and you love the way Axe smells but of course you don&#x27;t want to smell like a man. This is perfect. It has a fresh flowery scent to it. Great to put on right after you take a shower. Spray some on yourself and trust me you will get compliments on it. I ordered two of them and I&#x27;m going to order more!</li>
    <li> This is my very first time trying an Axe women&#x27;s deodorant and I must say they have got it right.. Its has a great fruity flowery fragrance and it lasts all day long..&lt;br /&gt;To me there is nothing better than smelling great all day!</li>
    <li> I love this body spray. Its so easy and convenient to use and has a great scent to it. Also amazon is way cheaper than purchasing in store.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome.  Best spay lite smell. My honey loved it. And he doesn&#x27;t like perfume</li>
    <li> But this for my daughter, cause she begged for it! Once it arrived and I got a chance to smell it, I too was hooked! It is a soft fruity scent, not loud and it stays with you all day.</li>
    <li> Im very picky on my sprays but women this is a VERY good body spray. Smells great! I plan on buying another one in a few days. You have got to try this spray out.</li>
    <li> Smells great ! I loved it after the shower !</li>
    <li> i dint like the smell at all i thought i would people were saying it smelled good but it smells like celery i never use it</li>
    <li> Use this for the gym....great scent,strong, and long lasting.  This is definitely going to be a staple in my gym bag from now on.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves the smell. I cant find it in stores so I buy it off here. I like it</li>
    <li> I love this! After buying it I was really excited to spray it on myself, it smell&#x27;s wonderful! Personally I love the scent of the axe guy&#x27;s use, and would use them on myself, but when I found this, I fell even more in love. It makes me smell more feminine, and last&#x27;s a long time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I found out over Christmas that this was not so much if a deal. I thought I was getting a great price but this item can be bought at Walgreens  for the same price.</li>
    <li> Great product. My girlfriend loves it. So I am happy. What else can you possibly want? Seriously? Maybe a different word limit for the reviews...</li>
    <li> This smells so good!  I cannot find it in stores anymore, so I bought 4 cans.  Also got one for my mom because she has been searching for it with no luck.</li>
    <li> too strong for me.  The container is kinda cool and it&#x27;s a super spray, but when I use it, I use the smallest spray I can allow, not a bad smell just super strong.  Wear very little!</li>
    <li> I love Axe Bodyspray Female, Anarchy!!  The scent is sweet, yet not overpowering.  It comes in an easy to spray can. I do recommend this!!  The delivery was also quick.</li>
    <li> good quality. nice smell. like it)</li>
    <li> I know Axe for men really has a very nice scent.  When I saw Axe for women I know I had to try it.  Axe Bodyspray Female  Anarchy has a wonderful nice scent and I love it. I will most likely  buy another one or two. I gave it five stars.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I like the original scents better - Phoenix and Essence do the trick and can be worn by a man or a woman.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice. Though it sort of just gets all in the air and makes me cough. I still love it though. I just go outside and put it on or at least stay in a large room to apply.</li>
    <li> Just as described. LOVE THIS SCENT! Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Not overpowering, pleasant smell.  Lasts well under pressure but not as long as I&#x27;d like.  When active for longer then six hours I would recommend another &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; of spray.</li>
    <li> Great fresh smell, feminine enough to be pretty but not delicate enough to be perfume. The packaging is super continent and perfect for a gym bag</li>
    <li> It appears that axe has a limited amount of items for women, but this one I found was very pleasant to the senses.  Will consider again in the future.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice, but they sent me anarchy 2 instead of 1.</li>
    <li> My Middle School Daughter Loves This! I Do Too! Wonderful Scent! Great Price Too for The Value... Hoping That The Deodorant Comes Out Next In This Scent of Women&#x27;s Axe In The Near Future...! Also, A Gift Set Of Spray, Shower Gel &amp; Deodorant Would Be Fabulous If Available!!!</li>
    <li> This spray is AMAZING!! I was iffy about buying a spray online because I&#x27;ve never smelt it, but I trusted the reviews and I&#x27;m SO GLAD I did!! I wish it came in bigger bottles because I can tell I will be using it a lot :) I want to order more just to have as backup!</li>
    <li> I expected the scent of the body spray to be attractive since I&#x27;ve always liked the Axe products for men.  It is a bit on the overpowering side, and must be used sparingly, but I do like the fragrance and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this Axe body spray since I first saw the commercial and until I saw it on Amazon while searching for something else did I decide to finally purchase it.  I found it for a great price, much better than at a retail store.  It arrived very quickly and smells fabulous! I sprayed this on just about everything when I received it and use it everyday.  The scent lingers for a while so you don&#x27;t have to use a ton to keep the fragrance.  Definitely going to be ordering again.</li>
    <li> this to me smells like DKNY be delicious. I love how it continuously sprays its great for an allover great smelling spray. bout time they came out with axe for women!!</li>
    <li> Very good scent. I always been fan of axe bodyspray. This one is a new spice and I like it.</li>
    <li> My daughter use this to help her get a little fresh after playing in P.E. and she said she love it.It really does smell great.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my gym bag.  I love the smell.  Very fresh and sweet smelling.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> Eeew, eeew, gross!  I bought it because it was so cheap and I figured \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; since I like the men&#x27;s scents.  This stuff smells like those cheap-o knock off brand perfume things you can buy at the dollar store.  It&#x27;s just so bad.  The one thing I DO actually like about this product is the design of the bottle and the twist/pop/ spray top on it.  It&#x27;s handy dandy!  I&#x27;d rather let someone fart on me and wear that scent than ever spray this again though.</li>
    <li> Exactly how it was described, excellent shipment, exactly what I wanted. Great smell and the squirt push button works perfectly. EXCELLENT product.</li>
    <li> DO NOT spray this on your Mrs. Butterworth OR your Aunt Jemima. Keep it away from all your breakfast foods (and ladyparts). In truth, it does smell unmistakably of Female Anarchy, which is to say it smells of gasoline, tears and Arbor Mist.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this it was coz of the all the good reviews and this one definitely is as good as those reviews say it is!</li>
    <li> Yum! I LOVE THIS SMELL!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time and smells more fresh and clean than perfumey, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. This is my new favorite smell, it replaces my old favorite (and much more expensive) scent, as I have gotten SO MANY compliments in the short time I have been wearing it. My nephew even said I &amp;#34;smell better than I used to because I don&#x27;t smell like flowers and junk no more.&amp;#34; If a little kid notices and says something about it, you KNOW it must be awesome!&lt;br /&gt;The seller got my body spray to me very quickly, appropritely packaged, and in perfect condition. I will be ordering this product from this seller again and I would not hesitate to reccomend either of them to anyone. If you like to smell just fesh and clean without smelling flowery or perfumey, you have GOT to try this body spray!</li>
    <li> great scent.  Light and sweet.</li>
    <li> Not my fav scent but not bad. Does the job. Makes me smell nice after a work out till I can shower. All I wanted it for. Seems go be lasting. I&#x27;d recommend and order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m active military I bought this product too smell better than outside air since I&#x27;m always outside. Product smells great and is just what I wanted the size is much larger and I&#x27;m glad because I bought 3 and they will last longer. Very happy customer of Axe female body spray.</li>
    <li> smells great i always get compliments from people and it&#x27;s cheap. And i come out cheaper buying it online then in the store.</li>
    <li> i love the smell, will be buying again</li>
    <li> great scent that lasts long</li>
    <li> I saw the ad for this and said \\&quot;I have to try that\\&quot; luckily enough I found it on here, not in stores. Bought two bottles so far and will most likely stock up because I LOVE this stuff. It has a nice and fresh scent with a little boost of what seems to be a citrus and mixed with a small hint of floral. That&#x27;s my take on it, anyway. It&#x27;s fresh and light. I love spraying this on. Always loved the way men&#x27;s axe came in the bottle and was sold at a decent price and I sure hope that Axe makes some more women&#x27;s products. Try it out :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too fond of strong perfumes.  I&#x27;ve never used an aresol body mist before, but I absolutely love this stuff.  Will be buying it again for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Nice feminine smell, kinda light a light flowery scent. Lasts pretty long throughout the day, which is a good thing! Great product! :)</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Axe and I love this scent. It doesn&#x27;t last long though; I still need to wear perfume too.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent. No sure if I like the type of spray it is. It can get cold when you spray it on.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone it is awesome smells great well worth the price.  It was shipped fast my daughter loved the smell also.</li>
    <li> smell wasn&#x27;t great. Glad it was inexpensive. Might use it for bathroom freshening spray.... definitely not for use on my body</li>
    <li> The only thing i was concerned about was how this smelled since I bought it on a whim. smells really good though.</li>
    <li> Smells good without being too flowery.</li>
    <li> This review is based purely on personal tastes/preferences - I did not like the smell very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the smell (even though I did not like it) did linger all day long. In a very nice subtle way.</li>
    <li> somehow its tooooo flowery .. not my kind.. but again its just my opinion , everyone has diff choice.. its just not mine..</li>
    <li> this is absolutely the best smelling body spay for females. I have been using this for a while now and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like spray-on, non-anti-perspirant deo and this was great. I have always loved Axe, and this is just perfect.</li>
    <li> it has kind of a flowery smell to it i have tried other spray for woman but all and all i love it i would buy it again i would rate this a ten if they had enough stars lol</li>
    <li> First, the picture doesn&#x27;t look like the bottle i got, I got the correct scent, but my bottle is shorter and round, you twist the top, and it pops up and you just spray, it is a continuous spray. I don&#x27;t like the scent, I don&#x27;t know why but it reminds me of like febreeze, or glad spray, at first it&#x27;s really strong, then in about 10 min. It&#x27;s gone, I can&#x27;t smell it at all. Since I don&#x27;t like putting it on me, I spray it around the house in the air lol.. I like how it smells for a spray like febreeze but not for my body, like i wouldn&#x27;t spray febreeze on my body cause it doesn&#x27;t smell like you put it on your body and of course your not suppose to lol.. Of course everyone is different, and it seems a lot of people like it, I would give it a try, it&#x27;s the only way to see if you will like it or not, or go to the store and just spray some.</li>
    <li> Got the gift set last year for Christmas, and I got addicted!&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing. It&#x27;s about damn they made an AXE fragrance for female&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;I used this everyday got compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you&#x27;re an AXE fan. Don&#x27;t recommend this if you&#x27;re sensitive to floral scents.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this scent it last with me and everyone notices when I have it on. Great product look forward to more from this line of women products.</li>
    <li> Has a great scent that lasts all day</li>
    <li> i bought this since the mens fragrance smells so great. i got it and took me a minute to get use to the &amp;#34;loudness&amp;#34; of it but now i wear it everyday, does not linger though..</li>
    <li> Using this since it came out. Great!!!!Sometimes har to find and this is one of the lowest prices I have found it.</li>
    <li> I am an avid lover of Axe products, inspite of being a female! I always wondered as to why Axe doesn&#x27;t produce women body spray! and here it comes. The amazingly long lasting fragrance of this body spray keeps me feeling refreshed till the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love that they finally have Axe body spray here for women.&lt;br /&gt;I been using it everyday since I bought them &amp; will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, I usually put it on after the gym.</li>
    <li> I bought this online based on others reviews of how yummy it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did! Smells so fresh and airy, also leaves a great trace of fragrance in the room u spray it on in.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute too.&lt;br /&gt;Not a single person who has smelled it had anything negative to say about the smell. Many even went out to buy it as well!&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off bc I felt the scent didn&#x27;t last long enough on the body.</li>
    <li> Love how easy it is to use for full body coverage.</li>
    <li> The small can is great travel size and the smell is great-but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I would try other scents from AXE.</li>
    <li> I have not personally bought this product but I can say it has a clean and fresh smell. I work in an ER and needless to say it can get smelly, and I don&#x27;t mean in a good way. Several of my coworkers use this and it smells like shampoo, and has a nice clean smell to it. It is really nice to freshen up with or even refresh your surroundings</li>
    <li> Axe is NEVER a letdown! I love their products and I&#x27;m glad to finally have something to call mine that has a feminine scent!</li>
    <li> It is not long lasting.  I like the product  design.  I will not be a repeat buyer.  I need three more words.</li>
    <li> Axe has a way of stopping me in my tracks in the grocery isle. Everything else kind of disappears and I&#x27;m suddenly inhaling this exquisite, tantalizing scent. Suddenly, my brain doesn&#x27;t work very good.&lt;br /&gt;So, obviously, when Axe came out with a girl&#x27;s version of body spray (Anarchy), I ran to Walmart, bought one, and then bought a bunch online too, because it was a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I. Love. Anarchy. Axe. Body. Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT ONCE worn it, and NOT gotten a compliment. &amp;#34;Ooo you smell AMAZING!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Ohmygoodness, what are you wearing?!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Wow, you smell awesome.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s nice. Not that I wear it to get attention. I wear it because when I&#x27;m spending a day alone at home, it makes me really happy to constantly walk around smelling awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;Yay for Axe! I hope they never get rid of it. I will have to resort to Bath and Body Works again.</li>
    <li> Great product love the smell not to strong last a while and it was cheaper then some stores would cost</li>
    <li> I figured I would give it a try with the 1.00 coupon and the cheap price from amazon.  I am really not crazy about the smell.  It&#x27;s like one of those smells either you love or you hate.  Every time I spray it on me I try to figure out what it smells like and I can&#x27;t.  Honestly, I really don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  It convinced me yesterday when I was sitting next to my son and he said I smelled like sweat.  This was after I took a shower and sprayed it on.  I am a fan of the men&#x27;s but this has got to go.</li>
    <li> Liked the fragrance...why not five stars because it is bit similar to watermelon :p</li>
    <li> smells great - love it for a freshen up during the day</li>
    <li> I wont be getting this again,  I wont critique it, maybe its just not for me...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always associated axe with being overpowering and too strong smelling. This was neither. It is a very clean light almost floral scent that sticks with you all day. Super happy I took a chance on it. It has become a staple in my glovebox for on the go. Great price as this will last me forever!</li>
    <li> Great product but the shipper added a $10 shipping charge I didn&#x27;t see until it already had shipped. Not worth it for such a small product that claimed to ship for free. Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> My wife picked this for my daughter for a stocking stuffer. She was happy to get it &amp; I was happy to know what Anarchy really would smell like.</li>
    <li> I was jealous of my husbands Anarchy for men he has everything, spray, wash, shaving cream, deodorant... everything!&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this I had to grab it, I didnt even know what it smelt like I just had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good, I sprayed it after shower last night and he yelled you&#x27;re not using my spray are you! (I use his sometimes just to get the aroma in the bathroom) I got to yell back &amp;#34;I got my own Anarchy!&amp;#34; hahahahaha! He said what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say he loved it too!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt last long on the body but if you spray your hair with it, you can smell it a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for bodywash!!! Patiently!</li>
    <li> I bought this to through in my work bag. It smells fresh and sexy.. Boy friend loves it. I&#x27;m buying more for back up.</li>
