      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty and useful!</li>
      <li>When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!</li>
      <li>Powerful hair dryer--adding volume to your hair.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is amazing, it cuts my hair drying time to half, with smooth shining hair as result.</li>

      <li>I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S.</li>
      <li>When I click the button to switch the mode, it just skip the skin mode and move to Hot mode.</li>
      <li>The delivery is fast!</li>
      <li>very good item, just too expensive</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Leave a soft, straight and shiny hair out for a whole day.</li>
      <li>For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  </li>
      <li>Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  </li>

      <li>I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  </li>

      <li>(That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>My hair is soft when I use it.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  </li>
      <li>So I usually did not dry my hair because it will damage my damaged hair more.</li>
      <li>Dry fast in the workday morning.</li>
      <li>That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  </li>
      <li>It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> This store either selling fake product or defective product.  I spent over $150 USD purchased this and it was not head resistant!! The plastic shell changed shaped due to heat and cracked open within 3 month of purchase.  When I contact Seller for refund, they refuse to issue 100% refund due to over 30 day period.  But who would buy a piece of junk that will only last for 2 month for $150?</li>
    <li> very good item, just too expensive</li>
    <li> Powerful hair dryer--adding volume to your hair. The hot mode could be super hot so you get to be careful.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Technology&lt;br /&gt;Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Results&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you use:&lt;br /&gt;You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!

    <li> This hair dryer is amazing, it cuts my hair drying time to half, with smooth shining hair as result. Shipping was from Japan, took about 10 days to arrive in US with registered mail.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited when I receive this item, and can&#x27;t wait to try it. The product was shipped from Japan and took about 20 days to be delivered.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful, I ordered a white one, I really like this color!  The size is good and it has really nice design. I got it on time. I love it so much. It is easy to take!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever! My hair needs to dye every month. So I usually did not dry my hair because it will damage my damaged hair more. I read all the review on this one and decided to give it a try. So happy I purchased it! Dry fast in the workday morning. Leave a soft, straight and shiny hair out for a whole day. I&#x27;ve already bought another two for my mom and mother-in-law.^^</li>
    <li> It works and makes her happy: 5 stars.</li>
    <li> love love love good for my hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really pretty and useful! The delivery is fast! Thanks</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s good! We liked!</li>
    <li> Good product. My hair is soft when I use it.</li>
    <li> The skin mode doesn&#x27;t work. When I click the button to switch the mode, it just skip the skin mode and move to Hot mode. I felt disappointed at this point. But, my hair is smoothier than before.</li>
