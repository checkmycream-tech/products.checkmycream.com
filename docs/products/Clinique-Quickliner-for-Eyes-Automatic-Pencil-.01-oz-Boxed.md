<li> DRY DRY DRY!!!  </li>
<li> definitely stays put all day, but I feel like it&#x27;s a little clumpy when you apply.</li>
<li> Just what I was looking for with blender on other end.</li>
<li> The picture shows that the eyeliner comes in a tube with a smudge tool at the other end of it.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t use anything other than Clinique.  </li>
<li> I have resumed purchasing this product new, in the store and never experienced another problem.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me to ever again risk my eyes for the sake of saving money.  </li>
<li> Not worth the price at all.</li>
<li> It caused my eyes to itch increasingly over the course of a few days.</li>
<li> Very disappointed as I now have to keep my old empty tube and my new one in order to have both tools I need.</li>
<li> this eyeliner smudged right away - very disappointing -</li>
<li> The amount is so small that probably you have to throw/trash it after just one or three applications.</li>
<li> It goes on too thick.  </li>
<li> No more irritated eyes!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know what the reviews mean when they say this doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened ever, because yes it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> These eyeliners are bad on the waterline even after multiple swipes the color does not go on well and does not stay.</li>
<li> unhappy with empty container.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I received the wrong product.</li>
<li> This product is crap and not of the quality you buy in the Department Store.</li>

    <li> My go to eyeliner. It lasts all day. I love that the color is more brown than black. I&#x27;m thrilled I can buy it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY different eyeliners and Clinique is the only one that does not cause irritation to my eyes.  It is quite easy to apply - lasts a reasonably long time - and the color is true to the description.  I will not be wasting money on any other brand, especially since the price on Amazon is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> Super Duper price for this eye pencil</li>
    <li> If you use it on the top lash it does OK. These eyeliners are bad on the waterline even after multiple swipes the color does not go on well and does not stay.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye liner. It stays on for a long time and I love the color. I would recommend this anyone.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS eyeliner!! I have used Clinique for 25 years and had never tried their eyeliner. This was a great deal so I decided to give it a shot. It glides on so smoothly and it stays on!!!</li>
    <li> goes on smooth, smudge brush works well. great color and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch like some eyeliners do. will def buy again. thanks,.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner smudged right away - very disappointing - i think the liquid eyellner may be the only way to go.</li>
    <li> I love  Clinique products and I don&#x27;t use anything other than Clinique.  The liner came pretty quick and I would recommend it to anyone.  The color goes well with any complexion.</li>
    <li> I wish I could return this product - it is like a Clinque knock off of some sort.  This product is crap and not of the quality you buy in the Department Store.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my friend. She loves the product. Said it was cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I chose a 5 star rating because they did not have a 10 star choice option.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft but goes on smooth so Clinique Quickliner for Eyes is great for any age.&lt;br /&gt;It is non-alergenic and never wears off. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else both my girls ages 30 and 18 have been using Qlinique&lt;br /&gt;sense 6th grade. Starting with &amp;#34;Air Kiss&amp;#34; lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Product shipped on time, very good value.  I normally use black/brown, but the dark chocolate works well and applies easily.  I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This liner is perfect.</li>
    <li> Cannot use it because it is hard and will not go on easily.  I&#x27;ve asked for a refund but haven&#x27;t heard back from vendoe.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the reviews mean when they say this doesn&#x27;t need to be sharpened ever, because yes it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it doesn&#x27;t stay on unless you use some kind of eyelid primer.  I&#x27;d go waterproof next time.</li>
    <li> great product...i like clinique anyways...no irritation from their products.  It is a good color and i apply it about 2-3 times a day...easy to wash off .</li>
    <li> DRY DRY DRY!!!  I usually love these, but they&#x27;re old!!!</li>
    <li> was empty when received i love clinique products. unhappy with empty container. Will be more careful ordering in the future</li>
    <li> Easy glide on.  Just what I was looking for with blender on other end.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye liner by Clinique, I was so excited when I found it on Amazon. It goes on smooth as silk and stays in place all day.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the recommendation from a friend that it stayed put. It doesn&#x27;t. By the end of the day, the corners of my eye are smeared because of the oil in my skin.</li>
    <li> NICE COLOR, GLIDES EASILY,</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as another color I have.  Don&#x27;t know why the difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried to buy cheaper eyeliners, but nothing compares to this.  It goes on smoothly and you can smudge it with the sponge at the other end.  I&#x27;m kind of different in that I like to put my eyeliner on the inside of my lower lash, and this is the only liner that works well for me.  I have bluish-green eyes and got the peacock, and it&#x27;s a perfect color.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another eyeliner. It lasts from day until night without smearing or caking. Even through working out and sweating. It&#x27;s awesome. The dark chocolate is my favorite.</li>
    <li> definitely stays put all day, but I feel like it&#x27;s a little clumpy when you apply. if you put on another layer, it seems to just rub off the first layer rather than making it darker.</li>
    <li> the tip broke off immediately, and now I have a jagged edge.  It goes on too thick.  Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price at all. The amount is so small that probably you have to throw/trash it after just one or three applications.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of buying the product described as &amp;#34;new, unboxed&amp;#34;.  It caused my eyes to itch increasingly over the course of a few days.It finally dawned on me that it was likely the eye liner had been contaminated, so I just threw it away. No more irritated eyes! It&#x27;s not worth it to me to ever again risk my eyes for the sake of saving money.  I have resumed purchasing this product new, in the store and never experienced another problem.</li>
    <li> The picture shows that the eyeliner comes in a tube with a smudge tool at the other end of it. It does NOT have a smudge tool. Very disappointed as I now have to keep my old empty tube and my new one in order to have both tools I need.</li>
    <li> Love Clinique products. Nice eyeliner - great brown and applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I received the wrong product. It does not have the smudge tool on the opposite end.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner.  It lasts all day and I use one for about 6 months, so it&#x27;s well worth the expense.  No smear, no irritation.</li>
