    <li> Just wanted to say hi to everyone who wrote here who ALSO has loved this lipstick and worn it for years. The trusty Wild Plum 640.

It was frozen when I opened it and when it thawed it turned real soft and I can&#x27;t even use it.  I love the lipstick but not when it has been frozen.</li>
