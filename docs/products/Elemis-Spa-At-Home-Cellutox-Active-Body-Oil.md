      <li>The product has a good smell and feels good on the skin.make sure to drink enough water!</li>
      <li>While I loved it, the onboard price was just too much.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell - citrusy and clean.  </li>
      <li>I first used Elemis products aboard a cruise (as most people seem to) and fell in love with them.  </li>
      <li>you will love it so if you are thinking of buying its worth it</li>
      <li>It goes on like a light oil, but stays.  </li>
      <li>I do know, though, that this is a fabulous oil.  </li>
      <li>I have psoriasis, and this really helps keep my skin nice.  </li>
      <li>buy yourself a cheap body brush and do that every morning followed with the oil.  </li>
      <li>but it does feel good on my neck and back.  </li>
      <li>I saw difference acter the firs week, but remember that resulta have always to be accompanied with a good diet and regular excersice!!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m willing to keep trying!</li>
      <li>I can really see the bumpy blotches of skin smooth out.</li>
      <li>smells great, not sure how well it works though...</li>
      <li>Delivery was very fast.</li>
      <li>I didnt exactly see any results becaus ei ordered alone</li>
      <li>I could only buy one Elemis oil, this or the monoi, I&#x27;d buy the monoi as it is even more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>but my mother actually stumbled on to the fact that this stuff was magic in a bottle, now everyone in my family has a bottle in their medicine cabinet.</li>
      <li>I first bought this product while on a cruise in the carribean.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I love this product after I shower and use a body brush, it helps keep my skin smooth and less \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; looking.</li>
      <li>I keep it in a large glass which I fill with hot water when I jump in the bath.  </li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell if it is working.</li>
      <li>Steiner should really take a lesson and lower the prices to the Amazon prices.  </li>
      <li>This is really moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>

      <li>It is pricey but seems to really work.</li>
      <li>My favorite use for this little beauty is my migraines.</li>
      <li>If you are on the detox program, and dry skin is not a big problem, the cellutox oil may be a better option.  </li>
      <li>I want to buy some of the other Elemis products available.</li>
      <li>I am not as bloated either, and BONUS, I use it on my face for the Sea Buckthorn benefits, and my hyper-pigmentation freckles and blotches (I am post menopausal) have almost completely disappeared!  </li>
      <li>The first time I put it on I got a headache about 30 minutes later!</li>
      <li>Leave skin so soft.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>it make your skin soft  </li>
      <li>It is still to early to tell if this product works completely.</li>
      <li>The stopper type lid only allows me to put a few drops on at a time, which is just the right amount and keeps me from wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> smells great, not sure how well it works though...but it does feel good on my neck and back.  thank you</li>
    <li> I have never used products for cellulite but decides to give it a try. I liked the smell and always tried to let it absorb as mich as I could. I saw difference acter the firs week, but remember that resulta have always to be accompanied with a good diet and regular excersice!!</li>
    <li> I love this product after I shower and use a body brush, it helps keep my skin smooth and less \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; looking.</li>
    <li> I like this product as it keeps my skin feeling supple all day. What I don&#x27;t like is the small cap used on the bottle.  It is a little difficult to open and close.</li>
    <li> it feels great, smells great, and gets absorbed and skin stays soft. I have dry skin and I always look for a solution. This is wonderful.</li>
    <li> A co-worker told me about this oil as she found out about it while on a cruise. I just received it about a week ago so I can&#x27;t really tell if it is working. But it feels so good on the skin and it has this amazing lemon smell to it. Very refreshing after a shower. I love it and I hope works. Will keep you posted..</li>
    <li> I know this product is for cellulite but my mother actually stumbled on to the fact that this stuff was magic in a bottle, now everyone in my family has a bottle in their medicine cabinet. I can&#x27;t speak to the cellulite ridding properties of this oil, but I can tell you that it is great for aches and pains. My favorite use for this little beauty is my migraines. The minute my head starts hurting I just massage some of this oil on my neck and temples and sit back and let it do it&#x27;s stuff. No more aches for us!</li>
    <li> Nice scent! Showing little results but I&#x27;ve only been using it a month now. I want to buy some of the other Elemis products available. This along with the bath beads for Cellutox takes about 8 months to detox your body. It is still to early to tell if this product works completely. Learned about it on a cruise and bought it on Amazon to sve some money. Elemis makes quality products.</li>
    <li> I also bought on a cruise, but I am in love with it as well as all of the products I have purchased on the two cruises I have been on.  Love the results with the Ionithermie system I am using as well!</li>
    <li> I really liked this oil plus it had a very pleasant lemon scent. I didnt exactly see any results becaus ei ordered alone and I guess your suppose dto use it with another elemis product</li>
    <li> I just really love this oil! This is my 2nd bottle. This oil has a nice smell to it. Leave skin so soft.</li>
    <li> The product has a good smell and feels good on the skin.make sure to drink enough water! The first time I put it on I got a headache about 30 minutes later! I think it really does help release toxins and that&#x27;s where the headache came from ..I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it enough to say whether the cellulite claims work or not but I&#x27;m willing to keep trying! Also try the frangipani, it smells great, like gardenias, and works wonders on the hair</li>
    <li> I like the way the oil goes on and absorbs into the skin on my legs. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my cellulite. I dry brush before using the oil but no change in cellulite appearance.</li>
    <li> This oil feels wonderful.  It smells good (like lemon grass) and you want to use it all over.  However, it is somewhat expensive and the bottle is small.  Great product though.</li>
    <li> buy yourself a cheap body brush and do that every morning followed with the oil.  my skin is tighter and it smells incredible,  It was expensive but cheaper than on the cruise!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and refreshed. I use it 4x week, with the de-tox program, to moisturize and enrich my skin!  Like it very much!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The  product is working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Does not stain, non greasy, no odor loke other products in the market&lt;br /&gt;It seems helping reducing my ache and pain.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 5 stars</li>
    <li> I love the smell the softness and suppleness of the skin.  It&#x27;s actually also a detox that helps eliminating the toxins you accumulate.  But the skin feels the best.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product while on a cruise in the carribean.&lt;br /&gt;Now I order it from Amazon because it really works. I can really see the bumpy blotches of skin smooth out.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s  a good product. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you if it works, but the few time i have used it, in the morning my skin feels very soft.</li>
    <li> This was used during my massage on a cruise ship.  While I loved it, the onboard price was just too much.  When I found the much better price on Amazon when I got home, I grabbed it.  This is really moisturizing without being greasy.  I have psoriasis, and this really helps keep my skin nice.  I&#x27;ve been doing the Elemis Bath Detox and was told on the ship that this was a good accompaniment for after the baths.  I&#x27;m not sure how all of the detox is doing, but in fairness, they said it would take awhile.  I do know, though, that this is a fabulous oil.  I love the smell - citrusy and clean.

    <li> It smells great  it make your skin soft  you will love it so if you are thinking of buying its worth it</li>
    <li> I bought this oil on a cruise, and have only been using it daily for two weeks, and already I see a big improvement in the fat/ cellulite ( I use it on my stomach area) appearance there. I am not as bloated either, and BONUS, I use it on my face for the Sea Buckthorn benefits, and my hyper-pigmentation freckles and blotches (I am post menopausal) have almost completely disappeared!  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of fade creams and other expensive products that have never made any difference in the past... Do your own research his oil has ingredients/properties in it that work for issues other than cellulite.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far, and has a nice light fresh smell too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivery was very fast.</li>
    <li> See my message below about mixing this with Elemis Gel for a wonderful soothing massage that you will really enjoy.</li>
    <li> Feels great.  I have seen some reduction in appearance of cellulite.  Smells great.  I would recommend  it to a friend</li>
