      <li>I love this scent, but it lasts about five minutes.</li>
      <li>My wife has used this fragrance for many years and I have come to associate it with her.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it</li>
      <li>Anyone would love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Buy it and trust me, you will love it...  </li>
      <li>I still love the scent.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very clean scent and there&#x27;s nothing fruity about it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i wish there was a more potent formula available, as i would snap that up in a moment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn 4711 since I was a little girl, and to this day love it because it&#x27;s so fresh-scented and perfect for those (like me) who are allergic to most perfumes.</li>
      <li>The scent, when it does stay on, has a nice fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it not smell very good but the fragrance wears off very quickly.</li>
      <li>i have also purchased the colognettes and quite enjoy having this scent available in a refreshing way while out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This a good price for a classic product.</li>
      <li>Has all the properties of a nice clean fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a good fresh daytime perfume and have been using it for almost 60 years since I first bought it in Germany</li>
      <li>As for 4711 itself, the best thing from my perspective is that it is never overwhelming the way so many of today&#x27;s designer fragrances are.</li>
      <li>Super refreshing.  </li>
      <li>This is a combination of citrus and light florals  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t plan to wear it, but I enjoy the memories the fragrance gives me.</li>
      <li>I use it after a shower, as a light spritz on before bed, and on occasion, as a room spray.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes a great overall body spritz without people around you having to resort to the use of respirators, breaking out in hives, or throwing up.</li>
      <li>Not too strong and smells exceptionally clean.</li>
      <li>i found this by accident and do so enjoy the smell , i like the Cologne and the EDT</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the original cologne, by the way, made in Cologne, Germany, and named for the address where it was manufactured: 4711.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and lite!  </li>
      <li>If you are a person who does hard or outdoor work and just want something light, this is a perfect match.  </li>
      <li>it has a super clean lemony or citrusy smell, somewhere in there</li>
      <li>It is fresh and light and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Not too sweet, musky or floral.</li>
      <li>This stuff is simply the best, 4711 is by far and away and most certainly in my opinion, the best smelling fragrance on the planet...  not overly strong, but subtle and a very classy smell that leaves you saying to yourself &amp;#34;hmmm</li>
      <li>It smells clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>So refreshing for summer, since I do not like perfumes this is just different, and its been around a very long time, but still as good refreshing as ever.</li>
      <li>Comes in a very pretty bottle and the box isn&#x27;t too shabby</li>
      <li>which just smells fresh to my nose.</li>
      <li>something fresh.</li>
      <li>it has notes of a field of flowers and fresh foliage by a mountain stream in the Bavarian Alps in the spring.</li>
      <li>Not long lasting, but light, refreshing, and not in any way overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Classic, original scent.  </li>
      <li>I first heard of 4711 from Smallflower.com.  </li>
      <li>This smells exactly like creed&#x27;s neroli sauvage except 80% of it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a timeless fragrance that can be used on a daily basis without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I first enjoyed this eau de cologne as a teen.  </li>
      <li>It is a crisp, refreshing scent that is purposely ephemeral, meaning that it fades away after a short time, allowing you to use another scent, or none at all, for the remainder of the evening.  </li>
      <li>something crisp, but not too crisp.</li>
      <li>Believe me, she smells better than anything you could possibly wear.  </li>
      <li>4711 is a classic, clean and elegant scent for young and old alike.  </li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t like really strong florals such as gardenia.</li>
      <li>I like the citrus smelling products and this is certainly one of those.  </li>
      <li>I like the price and the quantity is pretty decent as well.</li>
      <li>Arrived fast.  </li>
      <li>She was absolutely trilled.</li>
      <li>Love this spray, I use thes 4711 product from last 50 years, which is still young in my memory.</li>
      <li>Clean with floral middle notes.  </li>
      <li>As noted by others it doesn&#x27;t last a tremendously long time so refreshing it throughout the day is necessary but the cost allows for this easily.</li>
      <li>Go Classic, and stick with it.  </li>
      <li>It got stuck in the cap, and I could not get it out, which meant the top of the bottle was left open.</li>
      <li>so I end up squirting a little more.</li>
      <li>It smells just a little more citrisy.</li>

    <li> i, like many others, have been on the search for the perfume holy grail for over a decade. something fresh. something crisp, but not too crisp. something exotic, but not too exotic. something that can be worn during the day and evening. something that will always work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4711 is that scent! this reminds me of various travels i have taken, and spritzing this on feels like i have been transported somewhere amazing (sounds ridiculous, but is actually true).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have read several articles stating what makes up this scent (which has apparently has been a closely guarded secret for a couple centuries), but the most common elements present are the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;citrus&lt;br /&gt;rosemary&lt;br /&gt;sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;light floral rose&lt;br /&gt;lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only gripe is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all. i can spray it on now, and in a couple of hours no scent remains. i thought perhaps i received a \\&quot;faulty\\&quot; bottle, so i ordered a smaller size (for travel), and the same issue persists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe this sells them more cologne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish there was a more potent formula available, as i would snap that up in a moment. in the mean time, i am incredibly pleased to have found this scent at all. i have also purchased the colognettes and quite enjoy having this scent available in a refreshing way while out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i found this by accident and do so enjoy the smell , i like the Cologne and the EDT as well , i use both .</li>
    <li> Great cologne. Not too strong and smells exceptionally clean. It&#x27;s a timeless fragrance that can be used on a daily basis without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I first heard of 4711 from Smallflower.com.  The Q brothers gave a great video review that convinced me to try this out.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this fragrance.  I don&#x27;t love it and I don&#x27;t hate it.  But I do miss it.  That sounds weird, but it&#x27;s true.  The scent, when it does stay on, has a nice fresh scent.  It&#x27;s a very clean scent and there&#x27;s nothing fruity about it.  For me, it has an almost herbaceous (and perhaps slightly citrus) and green scent.  I use it after a shower, as a light spritz on before bed, and on occasion, as a room spray.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of the original cologne this is the perfect spray bottle. Well made, precise, excellent spray pattern. As for 4711 itself, the best thing from my perspective is that it is never overwhelming the way so many of today&#x27;s designer fragrances are. It&#x27;s there when you need it, and won&#x27;t get you banned from places where &amp;#34;perfume sensitivity&amp;#34; is an issue.</li>
    <li> We used to bring this product back from Germany for all our friends and relatives when I was a kid. Now I see that my wife enjoys it too. It&#x27;s a great scent.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cologne since childhood, my mother still uses it at 90, my grandmother used it all her life, do I need to say more!</li>
    <li> Super refreshing.  Has all the properties of a nice clean fresh scent.  As noted by others it doesn&#x27;t last a tremendously long time so refreshing it throughout the day is necessary but the cost allows for this easily.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as more recently developed formulas.  My daughter took one whiff and told me that I had found the scent that she had been looking for, the one my mother brought back from Germany and didn&#x27;t know the name. I had to hide it from her until she went back to school.  A bottle will be in her Christmas stocking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn 4711 since I was a little girl, and to this day love it because it&#x27;s so fresh-scented and perfect for those (like me) who are allergic to most perfumes. So glad it&#x27;s still being made! Hard to find in fragrance stores, but thankfully, it can be ordered through Amazon.com. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> All others smell over processed and acrid.  If you want to wear a scent that is only apparent in an intimate situation, this is your scent.  It&#x27;s masculine and understated.  It smells clean and fresh.  4711 defines you as alluring and intelligent as opposed to  smelly and arrogant. I&#x27;ve been through the rest and they all smell like room deodorizers or toilet bowl cleaners, compared to 4711. People can&#x27;t name 4711, but they never forget the moment in time.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s a good fresh daytime perfume and have been using it for almost 60 years since I first bought it in Germany</li>
    <li> I used to use this in my 20&#x27;s and then had forgotten about it in the interim. Thirty years later I read about it by chance and decided to buy some again. I still love the scent. It is fresh and light and not overpowering. It actually doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power, but that works well for me because I just want the initial fresh feeling when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the original cologne, by the way, made in Cologne, Germany, and named for the address where it was manufactured: 4711. It&#x27;s a rather more complicated story and worth checking out on Wikipedia if you like such things.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype of &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; fragrances from every brand.  Go Classic, and stick with it.  This is a classic and light scent meant for everyday use.  Use generiously.  I like the price and the quantity is pretty decent as well.</li>
    <li> The scent reminds me of a lemon scented bathroom freshener spray. Not only does it not smell very good but the fragrance wears off very quickly. I put 5 sprays on my chest and neck area (5 sprays of any cologne should leave an overpowering scent) and  90 minutes later I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all, so I asked my girlfriend and she also said she couldn&#x27;t smell anything. I purchased this because I wanted a light and subtle scented cologne, but this falls very short of even being considered subtle.</li>
    <li> This scent has been around for ages.  I have been using it since the 1960&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The entire point of this scent is that it is for Your refreshment and enjoyment, not for others.  Use it after a bath or shower, as a pick-me-up. It is a crisp, refreshing scent that is purposely ephemeral, meaning that it fades away after a short time, allowing you to use another scent, or none at all, for the remainder of the evening.  A good idea if you don&#x27;t want to clash with your lady&#x27;s perfume.  Believe me, she smells better than anything you could possibly wear.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Not long lasting, but light, refreshing, and not in any way overwhelming. Really great for refreshing after a work out or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was that I actually broke the actuator right off the bottle. It got stuck in the cap, and I could not get it out, which meant the top of the bottle was left open. I had to take plyers and get the actuator out of the cap (destroying the cap in the process), but then I was able to put the actuator back onto the bottle and use the fragrance.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this fragrance for many years and I have come to associate it with her. Should I ever get a whiff of this I would immediately see her face, so it was sad when her bottle ran out.  But great news is that I was able to find it on Amazon. Great shipment, arrived intact and on time. So I get to continue to experience my permanent girlfriend in a lovely way each and every time she applies this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this, and love the spray bottle. So refreshing for summer, since I do not like perfumes this is just different, and its been around a very long time, but still as good refreshing as ever. Actually you have to experience the smell, it is not sweet like other perfumes, personally, I love this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have been using it for several years and give it as gifts to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for the elderly German lady who used it in her youth. She was absolutely trilled.</li>
    <li> 4711 is an item I purchased for an elderly person who feels that this refreshes her even though she can&#x27;t get up and down into a bathtub any longer.  She loves it and it smells alright for another person sitting next to her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved it. Wikipedia says that Holly Golightly in the novel wore it. John Kennedy wore it, too. Love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not what I remembered it to smell like.  My mother always wore this, that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I have used unisex scents before but this is the best scent I have had for the price.  If you are a person who does hard or outdoor work and just want something light, this is a perfect match.  I also would recommend this scent for individuals who work in an office and don&#x27;t want to be too perfumy.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product for a date or for a night out but for day to day use, this is a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> The fragrance from Germany is light and pleasant, but the German spray bottle is a real bonus---a wonderful souvenir of a great trip. Our guide told us of its interesting history and internet search gave more information.  Really fascinating!</li>
    <li> This a good price for a classic product.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful surprise to discover that my favorite scent of 30 years ago was still available.  The cologne was delivered in less than a week and has kept me smiling since it arrived.</li>
    <li> On time. Item as described. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations 100%.</li>
    <li> Remembered this brand from my Dad, who used it. I bought the spray cologne. I think I&#x27;ll stick with the aftershave. It smells just a little more citrisy.</li>
    <li> I like the citrus smelling products and this is certainly one of those.  It does not last long so I end up squirting a little more. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast.  I didn&#x27;t realize when purchasing, but this bottle is REFILLABLE.  It is spray, but you can actually open it and use it as splash, if you want, or refill when empty.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my mother used to wear it. I don&#x27;t plan to wear it, but I enjoy the memories the fragrance gives me. I remember the label on her bottle wasn&#x27;t so plastic looking.  The original label the colors were mat and the gold was bright. This label is all shiny.</li>
    <li> Classic, original scent.  A treasure.  Clean with floral middle notes.  The jasmine in the middle stuck out a little too much for me and so I will not wear it because I am sensitive to jasmine.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Excellent perfume. Reminds of a time that never will fade. Past present and future all in one scent.</li>
    <li> Good for girls i gave it to my sister</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply the best, 4711 is by far and away and most certainly in my opinion, the best smelling fragrance on the planet...  not overly strong, but subtle and a very classy smell that leaves you saying to yourself &amp;#34;hmmm this stuff has a nice smell&amp;#34;... Buy it and trust me, you will love it...  it has a super clean lemony or citrusy smell, somewhere in there it has notes of a field of flowers and fresh foliage by a mountain stream in the Bavarian Alps in the spring. Anyone would love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but it lasts about five minutes. Maybe it&#x27;s too alcohol-y or very old and past its expiration date?</li>
    <li> This smells exactly like creed&#x27;s neroli sauvage except 80% of it price. Ill buy this every time !  A must try from me.</li>
    <li> Love this spray, I use thes 4711 product from last 50 years, which is still young in my memory. Long Live.</li>
    <li> Bottle is refillable; you can use a syringe to refill the bottle. Good size and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Classic, circus aroma--I only wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> 4711 is a classic, clean and elegant scent for young and old alike.  I first enjoyed this eau de cologne as a teen.  Now 40 years later I happened across it on Amazon.  Voilà! I&#x27;m young again...</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful at first and is especially refreshing in the summertime because of the citrus in it but it only lasts a few minutes on me.  I wear perfume for myself and I like a scent that I can detect and enjoy on myself, not just one that only other people can smell.  Maybe it would last longer on someone else but I never had a scent like this that I can only smell on me for ten minutes or so and then is gone.  It loses two stars only because of that fact.</li>
    <li> Smells the same to me today as it did decades ago. Not too sweet, musky or floral. I hate musk and sweet smelling fragrances. They make me ill. I also don&#x27;t like really strong florals such as gardenia. This is a combination of citrus and light florals  which just smells fresh to my nose. It doesn&#x27;t last long but lasts as long as expected since it&#x27;s a cologne and not a perfume which is more concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a great overall body spritz without people around you having to resort to the use of respirators, breaking out in hives, or throwing up. I purchased the soap along with it. Comes in a very pretty bottle and the box isn&#x27;t too shabby either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, good price which I&#x27;m glad they still make. I would like to try some of the newer fragances as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using 4711 for over 40 years and I never get tired of it! I have an extremely sensitive nose and this is the only Eau De Cologne that I can use!  It is fresh and lite!  My husband loves it too!!</li>
