### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And those are the good points.</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact they are so good</li>
      <li>Whoever is incharge of inspection on outgoing mail did not do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My roommate loved these, she couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else.</li>
      <li>Stay away and spend money to get a good brand.</li>
      <li>One for me and one for my precious hubby!</li>
      <li>This is all I could find- even the really nice ones always have pointed or angled tips.</li>
      <li>My wife really liked them</li>
      <li>Nice plucker, does the job, easy to use, good grip no problem with the size of rings on handle.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to try then out.</li>
      <li>It operates as a scissors, but it holds the hair perfectly and it is worth a try as it is different.</li>
      <li>Too slippery to be used as a tweezer for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Turns out they work just fine.</li>
      <li>Not only are they very similar to the ones I had,but these are a great product at a great price.</li>
      <li>ITS NOT EVEN WORTH IT TO RETURN IT!</li>
      <li>This was a gift for my special someone.</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and get one good pair.</li>
      <li>And yes I am rather particular about my tweezers, so this is a compliment from me!!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>IM VERY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
      <li>Scissor type tweezers that really work!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>have my second pair now, and they are very useful!</li>
      <li>Thanks Seller and Thanks Amazon, will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
      <li>and hang on unlike many that have jaws that seem to only meet in one tiny spot</li>
      <li>This is cheap and super stiff!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t open the tweezers easily and have reverted back to my trusty pair that I&#x27;ve had 15 years</li>
      <li>I had an old pair of Tweezers that were beginning to fall apart.</li>
      <li>My wife sent me on a mission to find Scissor-Handled Tweezers with a straight, flat tip.  </li>
      <li>First they are too tight and can&#x27;t open</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A little stiff. Had to put oil on it but does the job.</li>
    <li> My wife really liked them</li>
    <li> I had an old pair of Tweezers that were beginning to fall apart. I thought they could never be replaced until I found these. Not only are they very similar to the ones I had,but these are a great product at a great price. As a matter of fact they are so good I&#x27;m going to be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Scissor type tweezers that really work!  They grab that hair, splinter, etc. and hang on unlike many that have jaws that seem to only meet in one tiny spot</li>
    <li> The tweezers do not grab onto the hairs and are therefore dull and useless.  I was very disappointed in them.</li>
    <li> My wife sent me on a mission to find Scissor-Handled Tweezers with a straight, flat tip.  This is all I could find- even the really nice ones always have pointed or angled tips. So I got these. Turns out they work just fine. I bought a bunch. My wife uses them to tweeze stray hairs here and there, and I use them to hold teeny things in the workshop.</li>
    <li> This is different from the ordinary tweezer. It operates as a scissors, but it holds the hair perfectly and it is worth a try as it is different.</li>
    <li> worse i&#x27;ve seen. doesn&#x27;t grab anything. they work like a pair of rusty scissors.&lt;br /&gt;really really bad. you&#x27;ll be wasting your money if you purchase these. DON&#x27;T</li>
    <li> This is cheap and super stiff! I can&#x27;t open the tweezers easily and have reverted back to my trusty pair that I&#x27;ve had 15 years</li>
    <li> WORST TWEEZER EVER! ITS SO HARD TO USE IT, AND MISSHAPED ITS NOT EVEN WORTH IT TO RETURN IT! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS CRAP. IM VERY DISSAPOINTED!</li>
    <li> I only use scissor tweezers and these are the worse I ever bought.  First they are too tight and can&#x27;t open and then they don&#x27;t grab the hairs.  A big disappointment, had to throw them out.</li>
    <li> One pair works okay and the other pair is not aligned correctly so it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Do not buy..  Difficult to work and the ends do not meet properly so they do not grasp the hairs..  Stay away and spend money to get a good brand.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Getting 2 for the price of one isn&#x27;t a bargain if the materials and construction is sub par. Spend a little more and get one good pair.</li>
    <li> Horrible, stiff and unusable. And those are the good points.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to try then out.</li>
    <li> My roommate loved these, she couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Did not work well. Too slippery to be used as a tweezer for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Nice plucker, does the job, easy to use, good grip no problem with the size of rings on handle. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These tweezers work well in the tedious job of removing unwanted facial hair in eyebrow area and chin regions. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my special someone.</li>
    <li> The tweezers I received appear substantial HOWEVER, there is supposed to be a PACK of 2 and there was only one. Whoever is incharge of inspection on outgoing mail did not do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I have my second pair now, and they are very useful! One for me and one for my precious hubby! Just what I wanted. Thanks Seller and Thanks Amazon, will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> Works with no complaints!!.. And yes I am rather particular about my tweezers, so this is a compliment from me!!</li>
