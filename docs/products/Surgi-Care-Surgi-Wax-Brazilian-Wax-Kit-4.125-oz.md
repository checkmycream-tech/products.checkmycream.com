      <li>Still can be a question about how good it is and what are it&#x27;s features.  </li>

      <li>Honestly don&#x27;t know how this product have gotten so many good reviews!</li>
      <li>Most wax types that I have tried don&#x27;t work so well when it comes to Brazilian waxing, but this one is great.</li>
      <li>So I decided to go to amazon to see what was best selling under waxing kits and this is the first thing that came up.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this!</li>
      <li>I first needed to figure out, how to use is efficiently, but after a while it gave excellent results!   </li>
      <li>I love this wax!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>It says i cant pit it in a stove top or oven !</li>
      <li>so I decided to try doing my own waxing.</li>
      <li>Okay, so the wax is good</li>
      <li>If it is so-so kind of worm - it will leave your hairs on their places.</li>
      <li>You warm the wax, you put it in the area you want to wax</li>
      <li>Customer service was nice, but the product didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>I understand that it is my own risk then -</li>
      <li>Works great to clean up the bikini area.</li>
      <li>I bought 3 different wax kits - all good ones, with excellent reviews.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>because, let&#x27;s be honest, it is better to go to a spa.</li>
      <li>My first waxing experience ever, and I chose this because of the great reviews.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product for first time waxers - pro waxing machines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but i learned a couple VERY important lessons throughout my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Here are some tips or techniques for better waxing.     </li>
      <li>But using Surgi Wax makes it some much more tolerable.</li>
      <li>AND no nasty after residue.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve bought a couple more of them already.  </li>
      <li>greater hair density per square inch.</li>
      <li>But love the results.  </li>
      <li>I love this waxing kit</li>
      <li>I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not the most convenient.</li>
      <li>Love this wax.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>you want to make sure</li>
      <li>I already order more..</li>
      <li>I use it and now my husband uses it too:-)</li>
      <li>Simply comparing - this one is the best!   </li>
      <li>I was concerned that I would not be able to pull the wax and it would get all over the place</li>
      <li>, now that we&#x27;ve gotten that out of the way, let me tell you more about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so you have to keep heating it up to be able to finish the job.</li>
      <li>Bought this particular wax after reading consistently great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, it worked really well and even became sort of engrossing!</li>
      <li>It did a pretty good job of removing tje hair.</li>
      <li>easy to use for the most part.</li>
      <li>Love it, super easy to use!</li>
      <li>Spend money more wisely it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
      <li>And for the price it&#x27;s a good deal and really works.</li>
      <li>For me is way too anti hygienic to reuse that used wax full of hair!</li>
      <li>this is the first wax I ever have, and I love it!</li>
      <li>gets the job done but not as easy as it seems i re heated it three or four times while using it</li>
      <li>it came in on time and it is was not damaged it appears to be easy to use</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s so easy to do yourself.</li>
      <li>but I tried this product it was easy</li>
      <li>This is pretty effective.</li>
      <li>My husband does the job of waxing my bikini line for me and I was little nervous using this, but it was great!</li>
      <li>and I wanted it smooth.</li>
      <li>While the product works great, the 4 oz supply is barely enough to do 2 waxings.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am really happy with this product</li>
      <li>This wax was good as far as peeled off well</li>
      <li>It is not that much of a pain,  It really takes hair away effectively,  Bikini area? - easily!   </li>
      <li>Quick and easy way to rid yourself of unwanted hair...</li>
      <li>(first wax ever, never got it done professionally) but I am really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>always, the hardest area to wax is around the top above the clitoral area, it takes a good two-three passes, but once that spot is done, its all smooth sailing (Literally) so i suggest getting that area done FIRST, Because it DOES hurt like a crow, but its fine after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works as it says but was very harsh on my skin.I have sensitive skin but it really hurts bad</li>
    <li> Loved it for 5 mins. You will need a plastic spatula-maybe from a nads pack if you don&#x27;t want to go through 100 sticks at a time. Might have worked out better if I wasn&#x27;t reheating every 10 minutes and if the product that sticks to the side of the jar actually heats as well and isn&#x27;t wasted. Least painful I have used- if used properly with instructions, oil, trimming the long ones etc.</li>
    <li> Not too painful compared to the cloth strips. My skin bled but the next day my skin looked good as new! I have very sensitive skin and this never happens. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, after researching various waxes on the market.  I did a patch test - it was fine, but when I tried to actually remove hair in intended area - total mess.  It took MUCH longer to microwave it (one minute and it was stil hard, like it was just off the shelf).  It stunk, no maple honey smell at all. I even watched videos on waxing techniques.  Couldn&#x27;t do them - this stuff went on completely uneven.  Tried multiple times.  And it did stick to my skin, in spite of using included oil before hand.  Followed directions to a T.  Maybe I got a bad batch but I would never use this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone to a salon once for a wax, and I&#x27;ve tried two other types of wax (pre-waxed strips and soft wax) and this is my first attempt at hard wax and it was so easy and worked really well, especially compared to soft gooey waxes. I highly recommend this product. It didn&#x27;t even hurt that much (but honestly, ripping hair out is always going to hurt a little). And for the price it&#x27;s a good deal and really works. Most wax types that I have tried don&#x27;t work so well when it comes to Brazilian waxing, but this one is great.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent I was to paying $65.00 a visit at the salon but I tried this product it was easy I followed the direction (Do Not over heat and use plenty of oil) it&#x27;s about the same amount of pain I had at the salon it&#x27;s not messy it&#x27;s really easy, but what made this product rate has high as I did was the quick arrival of the company that sent it. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this product worked. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that much when you use it, and I had no bumps or redness afterward either. I usually get professional waxes, and now I don&#x27;t have any reason to. This product works really well and is affordable. I highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly suprised when I used this product. It is always hard to do the waxing yourself but this product works pretty well. I was concerned that I would not be able to pull the wax and it would get all over the place but this was not the case.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  I will be saving $$$ since I no longer need waxing services</li>
    <li> I can honestly say this would have been a great product if i knew what i was doing. It was very painful and i was so confused i have patches of hair that i didnt get everywhere. Donot let your hair grow out very long, i believe mine was to long and it made it harder to get most of it and it was very painful. You might also want a boyfriend there for support because i can tell you its harder doing it alone. Next time i will surely go see a professional and then try this at home again.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax ever. I was sad to see it off the shelves at CVS.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this kit and it definitely met those (less pain, really great applicators, gets 96% of hairs).  However I definitely needed more wax and more applicators.  Also as a microwave formula you have keep running back to reheat.  I will be returning to my GiGi Brazilian Body kit, BC ITS SO BOMB.  But if you are a beginner with waxing/hard waxing I would recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I wanted to save some money so I decided to try doing my own waxing. I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff. I was so scared at first, but it was so easy. It was less painful than going to the spa! Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s so easy to do yourself. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This had been my first time using the wax and I&#x27;m in love. It works perfect. I already order more..</li>
    <li> I like the result. Clean smooth skin for a whole week. Never used wax before. I wanted to use something effective and professional for my first time.I used it for my bikini line and armpits.  This is pretty effective. I follow all the directions. Applied the oil included. Not too much, just enough to protect the skin from the wax sticking to it. No need to worry the oil will keep the hair to stick to the wax. It really is trap by it. I was afraid to burn my skin so I did not warmed up the wax as much as it is needed. Getting the wax as liquid as possible results in getting it closer to the skin and getting a better hold of the hair. By the way, if you can have you microwave close to you, do it. Be ready to reheat  many times. Talking about pain. I was really ready to suffer, but I was surprised that if the wax is liquid enough it works much better. Apply in the direction of the hair growth, wait a bit and pull as close to the skin as possible. Apply pressure - which did not made so much sense to me before... but some how calms the skin. Then I applied oil tea to the area and every night a solution to prevent ingrown hair. This is needed just as if you were shaving....I am expecting that if I keep using it the waxing will last longer.</li>
    <li> gets the job done but not as easy as it seems i re heated it three or four times while using it</li>
    <li> I bought 3 different wax kits - all good ones, with excellent reviews. Simply comparing - this one is the best!   Well, \\&quot;best\\&quot; - is a comparative grade. Still can be a question about how good it is and what are it&#x27;s features.  The answer is - it is actually very awesome!   I first needed to figure out, how to use is efficiently, but after a while it gave excellent results!   It is not that much of a pain,  It really takes hair away effectively,  Bikini area? - easily!   I always find that underarms area is much more complicated - more pain, greater hair density per square inch. And with this wax I could finish it up! It was very wild, after a long shaving period, so it really took me about 2 hours, and I had to be patient. But I went through and found it easier, somewhat faster and even less painful, than if I would use electronic epilator.   After that success, I tried it on my face. Can&#x27;t tell how surprised I was! It takes away all that little hairs! Not that much of a pain - you just need to work on small area each time.  I feel now that I finally found a solution for keeping all parts of my body free from that ugly annoying hairs! Wish I tried it earlier. Now buying a second jar!    Here are some tips or techniques for better waxing.     It should be hot and really liquid when you apply it - then it will take a lot of hairs. If it is so-so kind of worm - it will leave your hairs on their places. Here is the precaution not to get burns, so be careful. But I never got one, so far. Sometimes I have to microwave it longer than the time they suggest. I understand that it is my own risk then - but I feel like it is pretty easy to control and not to burn the skin.    I found it best using wax with these strips - (Gigi Muslin Strips Small). I cut them according to the area to cover at one time, put some wax on it fast with applicator and apply to the skin immediately, not letting it cool down. Then I take it off, when fixed. Is solves 2 problems at once - area/shape control and dirts! I first started using it without strips and had it all on my fingers and a lot left on skin, which is hard to get rid of. With strips you mostly touch only the stripe, not the wax itself and it comes off clearly, all of it! The rule here is to apply it first on stripe then the stripe put on skin, and do it all fast - when still hot and liquid. Not vice versa, if you first apply on leg, then cover with stripe - the stripe will come off without wax. Wax-stripe connection will be not tight enough.  Also it is less pain with strips - because it is easier to take off with one jerk.</li>
    <li> This was a good product with great results. I would not recommend doing it yourself, though. Get a friend to do the waxing for you.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. I followed the directions by heating it up in the microwave for a few minutes, but it barely pulled any hair out. It might have been the strips I bought to use it. It was extremely messy as well. I had to order twice because it hadn&#x27;t arrived the first time. Customer service was nice, but the product didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> This was my second time using wax. First I tried one from Sally Hansen and it was the worst experience ever: messy, painful, lots of hair left and if I would not have baby oil at home I would never remove wax from my skin!!!! This is completely different. Surgi wax get rid off hair fast, easy (I am a beginner) and it&#x27;s not messy at all. Pain in scale 0 to 10 I would say 3.5. Awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> I waited for this for days! once it finally came I was very excited. It didn&#x27;t work what-so-ever and all it did was hurt like crazy and I read and went along with the instructions never worked waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> OUCH. This was NOT a good experience. Painful, sticky, slow. NOT worth the agonizing pain. Sounds dramatic, I know, but good Lord this was NOT a good product. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason. Go to a professional or spring for a better kit maybe, but I would steer clear of this product. Once I FINALLY (and painfully) got the wax off, there was still a ton of &amp;#34;leftovers&amp;#34; and I followed the directions very carefully. I was left very disappointed (and red.)</li>
    <li> I have been getting my bikini waxed for a couple of years now and finally decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost after moving to a small town very lacking in the spa department, so, I finally got brave enough to do it myself. Surprisingly I found that it wasn&#x27;t painful at all when I did it myself with this wax, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I was busy focusing or if something about this wax just makes it less painful than the hard waxes I&#x27;ve encountered at spas. Make sure to use the oil or you will have all kinds of odd little pieces stuck to you. I will definitely continue to wax myself with this product in the future.</li>
    <li> easy to use for the most part. does not melt as well the second time using it.</li>
    <li> The wax is breaking when we put it away + doesn&#x27;t remove hair completely (I am dark hair)</li>
    <li> it came in on time and it is was not damaged it appears to be easy to use I dont anticipate any issues</li>
    <li> This is a great item for men&#x27;s Brazilian waxing! It helps very much for what your needs are to get the job done!</li>
    <li> It is a very messy product. It does not come with waxing strips which is why I think it gets messy. I prefer the waxing strips. All in all though, it isn&#x27;t a bad product. Not for first time waxers.</li>
    <li> Boy do I HATE waxing!!!! UGH!!! But using Surgi Wax makes it some much more tolerable. Other waxes stick to the skin. This wax comes off cleanly and for some reason, doesn&#x27;t hurt as much! It removes almost all of the hair in one swipe. No need to rewax the same area with this wax. (And you know what rewaxing does.. removes skin. OUCH!) I order this product from Amazon because I can&#x27; find it on the shelf at local stores. (That or I&#x27;m the only hairy woman in Ohio) I love this product!</li>
    <li> O-M-G. This is the best! I have never gotten a wax professionally because 1) its to expensive and two it looks painful (even sugaring looks painful). First I tried the Parissa wax strips and that was to painful when ripping of. Next I tried a DIY project with sugaring wax and that was soooo messy and sticky so I did not try it again (I tried it on my legs- but I would never sugar my bikini area). So I decided to go to amazon to see what was best selling under waxing kits and this is the first thing that came up.When I saw \\&quot;no strips needed\\&quot; and i decided to try it . Best thing ever!! Basically read and follow all the directions and then look up youtube videos on \\&quot;brazilian hard wax\\&quot; to figure out how to work it. It hurts a little but i think its worth it. I intially wrote a loooong review but i think these youtube videos helps best on explaining how to best use the wax. I hope they continue to make this product and I hope it does make the hair grow less and finer. Even after watching these videos its still hard to do yourself but I think they are really helpful. Squatting helped for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]could be good for 3 to 4 uses which is good for the price.I nevvver write reviews but I did for this and I have soooo much to say I might make a youtube video about it. Its definetly hard to get all the hairs. It was easier to get longer hairs. In conclusion Im basically gonna wax instead of shaving certain areas and I hope this product is always around for me to use.</li>
    <li> Pre-epilation oil bottle came in empty and spilled everywhere</li>
    <li> I love this wax! I use it and now my husband uses it too:-) Careful not to over microwave because it gets extremely hot and runny. I have been using it for 7 years now.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this. It worked very good. You have got to use the bottle that comes with it before you start. It worked better than any other wax I had ever used. You can also buy plumb numb to use before you apply this. I really wish i had known about this sooner.</li>
    <li> Would never buy this product again it says its a microwaveable product but WHEN I PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE IT ALMOST CAUGHT ON FIRE N ITS CUZ IT HAS ALUMINIUM IN THE WAX how am i suppose to use it then?!! It says i cant pit it in a stove top or oven ! If its a microwaveable wax why put aluminium in it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather pay somebody to do the wax for me... switched to laser hair removal instead. This was messy and tricky but I got some good laughs out of it.</li>
    <li> First time waxer here, and i love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, now that we&#x27;ve gotten that out of the way, let me tell you more about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for first time waxers - pro waxing machines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back that i found quite annoying, is that if your going to give yourself a full brazillian wax, and your not accustomed to doing it (or doing it quickly at least) then this is going to be a problem because this wax (as i&#x27;m sure ALL wax) gets cold/cool quick; and since its microwavable (to those who didnt know) that makes it a certain pain in the ass! You have to constatnly heat it up, which means getting uncomfortable, and running to the microwave, standing there to keep an eye on it, only to return to said position and wait for it too cool a bit, then apply a few times...repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend it because its a good way to see if you actually want to go through and full out with the waxing process/life (before you buy all the kits etc. I would recommend the gigi kit (careful they have a few some with muslin strips&amp;some without...) or the satin smooth kits (can be pricey, but worth it from what I&#x27;ve heard, although some people have posted they had allergic reactions to satin smooth so if you have sensitive skin--- beware) Just helpful information, so no one get upset! I&#x27;m not bashing any product, i think they are both great-- just trying to help someone who might be lost (like i was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck on your waxing journey!</li>
    <li> This product is great. If you use the oil it never sticks to skin. This product works better because it hardens beter than other waxes. There are hardly any hairs left. I only wax my pits it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I used this on my eyebrows and my underarms so far.  It takes a little getting used to. I think the trick is to get it at just the right consistency because when it is, it&#x27;s not too drippy to work with, not too messy to manage, and not too hot on your skin.  The problem with that is that it only stays at that temperature for a short amount of time--and I live in a warm climate.  BUT, when it is right, it goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t hurt coming off at all.  I spend over $100 every month waxing head to toe in a salon. This will definitely save me some money and allows me to do touch ups in between at home and I SWEAR it doesn&#x27;t hurt! Having it done professionally hurts some depending on the areas waxed, of course. I didn&#x27;t even feel this at all.  It was crazy. And it was very effective.  I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen over-the-counter wax strips which HURT immensely and were terribly ineffective. I was amazed at how this pulled hair straight up from the root (I could see the ball at the tip!) and there was very little or no tweezing necessary afterward. If there was, it was because I missed the spot. Awesome product...highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> As the title says, i&#x27;ve NEVER waxed before, so i was a little scared once my wax got here, but everything went moderately smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, the wax itself is a pale green color, and right out of the box its hard like cold wax, and has a light perfume-y smell, it comes with a tiny little vial of the pre-epilation oil, and two wooden spatulas (like tongue depressers, but shorter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when you microwave it, it doesnt change color, i expected it to get a clearish hue to it, but it didnt, and when the jar says it heats from the middle, it REALLY does, i didn&#x27;t bother mixing it like the directions say (Oops) and i ended up microwaving it for two minutes, thinking it wasnt working, and when i turned the jar, all of it almost dumped out... Lesson learned kids, heed the directions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when i got situated in the bathroom, i spilled the oil too, but i managed to save most of it, and use whatever was left on the counter to apply to my... area. (Didn&#x27;t bother to clean the area, had showered that morning, and i forgot to wash my hands)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so i applied a good bit of wax, it spread easily enough, and despite being over heated, it wasn&#x27;t too hot (more like very warm) and let it set for a few seconds. and YANKED it off. and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very slight pain, and this is coming from a waxing virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i ended up using a bit more than half a jar, and got my &#x27;downstairs&#x27; area mostly hair free (some hairs broke off instead of coming out, but i tweezed those) but i learned a couple VERY important lessons throughout my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. pull the skin TAUNT. as taunt as you can get it, it dramatically minimizes pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. use the oil sparingly, i&#x27;m talking like a drop or two all over, you can re-apply every time you get up to microwave the wax (i had to about six to ten times all together, was waxing for almost two hours) but wipe the area down with a wet, cool cloth a few times. to keep the buildup down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. the wax NEEDS to be THIN, not like water, but a little thinner than &#x27;a honey consistency&#x27; for it to grab all of the hairs, any less and it starts to leave some behind. which is a waste of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. always, the hardest area to wax is around the top above the clitoral area, it takes a good two-three passes, but once that spot is done, its all smooth sailing (Literally) so i suggest getting that area done FIRST, Because it DOES hurt like a crow, but its fine after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess thats my review, sorry for it being so long, but i had to share my story. i recommend this wax completely, and i think everyone whos looking for a nice, bare nether region should order this! (or maybe the 3-pack, the jar goes quickly)little thinner than &#x27;a honey consistency&#x27; for it to grab all of the hairs, any less and it starts to leave some behind. which is a waste of wax.    and finally.    4. always, the hardest area to wax is around the top above the clitoral area, it takes a good two-three passes, but once that spot is done, its all smooth sailing (Literally) so i suggest getting that area done FIRST, Because it DOES hurt like a crow, but its fine after that.    I guess thats my review, sorry for it being so long, but i had to share my story. i recommend this wax completely, and i think everyone whos looking for a nice, bare nether region should order this! (or maybe the 3-pack, the jar goes quickly)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never done home waxing before but good reviews made me try this product. I&#x27;d been waxed at a salon. I&#x27;m not one for no-hair-down-there but I have a hairy ass frankly and I wanted it smooth. I read the instructions carefully, sat on the floor on a towel with a mirror propped up against the wall, and went for it. Well, it worked really well and even became sort of engrossing! I used the whole jar and now have a smooth backside. I even adventured a little further. My inner thigh hair is thick and dark- now that didn&#x27;t turn out as well as the backside, which has (thanks for small favors) less thick hair. However, the wax did pull some thigh hairs out, just not all. No matter- I&#x27;ll use this again and again till I get it all. I used the whole darn jar tonight. Worth it! Give this a try!</li>
    <li> Yikes! Be careful when you use this. You&#x27;ll have to follow instructions very carefully because if the wax dries up (and it dries up so fast) on the hair you are  trying to remove, it can be very difficult (and painful) to peel the wax and the hair. So be warned.</li>
    <li> THIS IS GREAT. My first waxing experience ever, and I chose this because of the great reviews. It is actually great. I took a short shower first to calm my skin, trimmed the hair with a scissor, and followed instructions. I was biting my lips and preparing myself for the pain because I heard so much bad things about waxing. But when I actually peeled it off, I was like, &amp;#34;Hmm......&amp;#34;. REALLY DIDN&#x27;T HURT. Let me say this one more time,,, this is my first waxing, and it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Still prefer the really hard salon-style wax, but works good.</li>
    <li> Love it, super easy to use! Even for me who has never waxed before!</li>
    <li> I did as directed. Im going for laser treatment. Waxing is not for me. This wax was good as far as peeled off well but im a baby and it was too painful. worked well if use as directed.</li>
    <li> I was browesing through reviews before I got it and 1 thing people said was it wouldnt hurt that much but mines did. So I want to know what I could have done wrong and the wax dried too quick. Is that suppose to happen after itcis very hot to get hard imediatley?</li>
    <li> I have tried several different waxing products over the years and this stuff is, by far, the best.</li>
    <li> My husband does the job of waxing my bikini line for me and I was little nervous using this, but it was great! We have been using NADS for a long time, but I was tired of smearing the sticky stuff on the strips..and there definitely was a residue ALL day with NADS. This stuff went on a little messy, but boy did it do the job. AND no nasty after residue. I think we spread it a little thick, so we&#x27;ll try it a little thinner next time to save product, but I definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
    <li> Packaging was good. But, I opened up the little Surgi box and the lid was half closed, kind of ajar. Did this happen to anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really nervous about waxing myself, since this is my first time. I read the directions over twice. So, there are no strips or anything to remove the wax with. I&#x27;m assuming we yank the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try it now, and will come back with an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omg, I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing. The lip of my jar is covered in dry, hard wax, the wax drys fast and I think I pull the wax off too early because it doesn&#x27;t take off all of my hair.</li>
    <li> This is very messy and takes some time to do , but beats the cost of going to a hair removal place and paying for a ten min. session.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I only use this for my underarms. It was my first time waxing and I am happy this worked as expected. Gets the job done with very little pain and easy to clean up if you drip on the sink as long as you wait for it to dry before peeling it off. Though you really HAVE to use the pre-epilation oil, without it this stuff is a little harder to work with and definitely makes it more painful.</li>
    <li> This works way better than the wax that needs strips and is less painful, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I think this product does its job. First time I used it, it worked really well leaving no mess. The second time got a little messy but still did its job. Works great to clean up the bikini area. If it didn&#x27;t get the hair out the first time, then the second time did</li>
    <li> Honestly don&#x27;t know how this product have gotten so many good reviews! Maybe this people haven&#x27;t tried before other microwable brands! First of all: my microwave almost exploded when I put it directly in it. I had to put the jar in a glass container with water in order to heat it up because my microwave was making bad noises and smelled burned. Second I ended up anyway using a cloth to get it out of my skin because it kept braking when trying to pull it several times, so I just gave up and used a cloth. Third it dry up very fast so you have to keep heating it up to be able to finish the job. Fourth and last complain: I just use it for the bikini area and now is below half jar, so if you want to use it for legs be prepare to buy several jars! For me is way too anti hygienic to reuse that used wax full of hair! The only good thing: the hair really attach better than my normal brand so I will just use it for very thin facial hair. For other uses it doesn&#x27;t worth the hassle or the money!</li>
    <li> Removes even the toughest hair! Just don&#x27;t let it dry too much. Do small sections at a time. I won&#x27;t any product but this!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this product. But as I soon found out it hurt super bad. It did a pretty good job of removing tje hair. But tue pqin was just to much. I felt like steve carell in 40 year old vergin. When he gets his chest waxed. After about 4 applictaions I had to quit. Maybe I will try it again some day.but.for now I&#x27;m sticking to shaving.</li>
    <li> Good,  does the job, prefer sugar waxing For private parts, using this one for upper lip and sideburns... It does the job easy no strips needed!!</li>
    <li> Works great! No mess!</li>
    <li> as described and just as painful as I thought it would be lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m gonna keep it short, it hurts like hell but it works. A couple of times I forgot to put the pre- epilating oil on first. Don&#x27;t do that. It took about two months for the hair to grow back, but it&#x27;s a lot less than it was before. I&#x27;m a beginner with waxing, and I&#x27;d recommend it for beginners. Will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this wax. No strips needed and it works very well. Have used it for years. You do have to be careful not to apply the wax when its too hot and it can take a while to melt.</li>
    <li> It did the job which is to wax private part. but it&#x27;s a complete mess trying to stir the product and I find it highly unsanitary running to the kitchen to heat it up again and then back to the bathroom. It did the job and no irritation which was a plus but it&#x27;s not the most convenient.</li>
    <li> Great product! I followed the instructions and got great results. It&#x27;s a little time consuming if your hair grows in different directions, but still does what&#x27;s suppose to do without ripping your skin up with the hair. Make sure you apply the oil first.</li>
    <li> It works good. Just good luck with the mess.</li>
    <li> I love this waxing kit and I hope SurgiWax never discontinues it (I&#x27;d rather wax in private). And you don&#x27;t have to be a wax expert either...but practice does make perfect. I&#x27;ve used plenty of other at home waxing kits and this one is FAR more effective and FAR less painful. I refuse to use anything else. Only draw back? You don&#x27;t get that much. The jar is little and depending on the areas/how often you wax, it can go pretty fast. Other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t smell funky, not messy like other waxing kits, and I love that you don&#x27;t need strips. I highly recommend for at home waxing!</li>
    <li> this is so NOT painless! this shit hurts hella bad.</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY, DONT WASTE TIME AND BUY IT. You warm the wax, you put it in the area you want to wax leave it for 30 seconds pull and you are done.</li>
    <li> Okay, so the wax is good but you have to put it on the microwave a few times... like 6 times 15 secs before you see it melt completely. Also, it gets cold really fast so you have to use it fast or else microwave it again. I didn&#x27;t use it for brazilian because, let&#x27;s be honest, it is better to go to a spa. But this is good for the belly and underarms!</li>
    <li> If you have an afternoon to spare and a lot of patience this works. It takes time since the wax isn&#x27;t as strong as commercial wax used in salons. Bottle is tiny and difficult to manipulate.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy way to rid yourself of unwanted hair... a great product at a great price.... I have tried other brands but, this product works best.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and it worked perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I recoomend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always suspicious of good reviews but this one is legit. It&#x27;s the first waxing product I&#x27;ve ever used (first wax ever, never got it done professionally) but I am really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing to know is that this product works and I&#x27;d go as far as to say that it works very well. If it&#x27;s your first time waxing or first self wax I would keep reading the rest of this, someone who knows about waxing could skip to the end but I&#x27;d recommend they read the microwave directions I have down below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you should know about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microwave:  This wax melts very fast and you will have to reheat it multiple times.  What I did and recommend, is to use this product somewhere where you are near a microwave so you don&#x27;t have to run back and forth between rooms to heat it back up. The microwave directions are a very general guideline, you will have to start on small settings and figure out what works best for your microwave. It melts from the middle so it might feel hard at the top but you have to keep poking at it and eventually it will cave in an melt into the rest of it.  You want to melt the whole bottle, which will help it from harding as quickly, but be aware it melts from the middle and you can also push down the sides as you use it up so they don&#x27;t harden and mess with the overall consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique: I made some mistakes  as it was my first time and they were painful so you want to head these warnings, especially if it is your first time self waxing.  1)Pay attention to the direction of hair growth and when you pull off you want to pull directly in the opposite direction of hair growth. Pulling up is very painful and can cause bleeding in sensitive areas. 2)Work in small areas, especially in the sensitive areas with thick/coarse hair. 3)Map out what hair is getting removed and break it up into smaller workable sections and then do those sections one by one.  You can avoid some irritation by doing areas that aren&#x27;t right next to where you just waxed and if you go in there with no plan you will just get lost in the maze of hair like I did the first time and it will take longer. Helps to stretch the skin a lot and press down lightly on an area after you rip the strip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prepration: Research all the preperation and aftercare you&#x27;ll need to do.  It is a little more involved than I originally thought so you want to make sure you know what you&#x27;re getting into and how to do it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the main stuff you need to know.  Overall, I am really happy with this product and I&#x27;ve bought a couple more of them already.  After my first wax the hair took about 3 weeks to grow back and it came in much thinner (which I was pretty excited about because I have always shaved and everytime it feels like it comes back thicker and thicker). The second wax was much less painful, probably partially to do with improved technique and, unlike shaving where it starts growing back about as soon as you finish, everything is wonderfully smooth and stays smooth.  I was looking for an alternative to shaving and found it.  The price is great, it is a quality product.  It grabs all the hairs and the only real concern I have is that, in the really sensitive areas, it has been healing a little funny for me but I can&#x27;t really attribute it to the wax for sure. I would just be really careful in the sensitive areas, work in small areas and stuff.  I have really thick coarse hair in really sensitive areas built up from years of shaving so if it works for me it will work for anyone. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> While the product works great, the 4 oz supply is barely enough to do 2 waxings. If you are doing your thighs than forget about 2. Get the larger supply. It is a great product, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as other wax that I have used. But it is less painful than the sticky wax with the strips</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ve had Brazilian waxes occasionally over the years.  So painful.  But love the results.  What I did was had a Brazilian 3 weeks ago.  Bought this particular wax after reading consistently great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product.  Simple directions.  Watch YouTube video first, and it&#x27;ll be really clear how to apply.  Make sure, since the wax melts from the middle of jar first, to stir it to honey-like consistency.  Apply just very small areas, one by one so it&#x27;s not too painful.  I applied about 2 1/2\\&quot; x 1\\&quot; strips on face (first time every doing face - just have some peach fuzz...).  GREAT results - left no redness which surprised me.  Looks so clean and fresh now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RE:  Brazilian... it&#x27;s SO much easier, less painful if you have a professional one done first, and then keep up on it at home with this brand of wax (seller great -super fast shipping and the 2 jars I ordered were packaged tightly and perfectly).  If you&#x27;re using your home waxing to simply keep up/maintain after a professional Brazilian, it&#x27;s super cost-effective and so much less pain because the hair is softer and more sparse -  and as long as you take care of it every few weeks, it&#x27;s inexpensive, simple and works beautifully!  Saves a ton of money and not difficult at all - it&#x27;s really a lot of simple common sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this particular product from here on out.  I&#x27;m done with $65 waxing jobs.  So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> this is the first wax I ever have, and I love it! easy apply, you only need it and the applicator and a microwave. I used it for my eyebrow, lower legs....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only con is that the portion is really small&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even finish my lower legs it is gone. you need to buy a bigger jar for a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in general, i do recommend this. it makes hair removal a pleasant</li>
    <li> Much better then traditional wax with muslin paper!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely messy and in the end it didn&#x27;t even work! Bad product! Spend money more wisely it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.</li>
