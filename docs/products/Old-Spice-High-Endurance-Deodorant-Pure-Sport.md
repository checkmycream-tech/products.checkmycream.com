      <li>I don&#x27;t like spending a lot on popular brands like Axe, so</li>
      <li>It smells nice and so do I.</li>
      <li>Does its job, nice smell, not overly cloying.</li>
      <li>Make me smell nice...</li>

      <li>Works fine, good value for the money.</li>

      <li>Boy does this Old Spice Sport smell GREAT!</li>
      <li>The deodorant smells great, when I first put it on, but within 3 hours of putting it on, it starts to smell like I&#x27;m warming sausages under my arms.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply the best scent of all.  </li>
      <li>You may like it more than what you are using at this time.  </li>
      <li>My husbands favorite.</li>
      <li>Satisfied customer.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>also these are shorter sticks than the 2 pack in most retail places.</li>
      <li>love this deodorant, its not an antiperspirant - so it wont clog up your underarms</li>
      <li>After seven hours or more, the smell starts to decay into something quite foul smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I love the smell.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this scent and you get a value deal.</li>
      <li>lasts me most of the day unless I&#x27;m working out.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deodorant</li>
      <li>so I bought him a twin pack because I don&#x27;t want to go one day without smelling that sexy scent.</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant for both my husband and my sons.</li>
      <li>people don&#x27;t hold their noses or turn and run away when I use it so it mush work; the overly musky odor is not my favorite</li>

      <li>Never use another brand and so many Ladies say they like my cologne and the look on their faces when I say its my deodorant.  </li>
      <li>But look for something better if you sweat for a living.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price for Old Spice and nice to add to Subscribe and save so I always have it around.</li>
    <li> This was almost a dollar cheaper in the store which is rare for Amazon... also these are shorter sticks than the 2 pack in most retail places.</li>
    <li> I stunk before, and now I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for those big black muscles to pop in like the commercials!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he won&#x27;t wear it unless he has to because he doesn&#x27;t like the smell.  I fear it will be in the cupboard a long time. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.  He says it works its just personal preference.</li>
    <li> Never use another brand and so many Ladies say they like my cologne and the look on their faces when I say its my deodorant.  Thanks for the bulk rate</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I ever use. Keeps me fresh and doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothes. My wife says the scent is pleasant without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a great value for a deodorant. One stick will last me about 2 - 3 months with daily use in the morning. The performance is great and lasts all day. While the scent wears down a bit as the day passes, you can still smell it in the evening if it’s been applied during the day. This is from the perspective of someone who has an office job. If you are in a more active type of job, you may need to reapply in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I’m not a doctor, some say that antiperspirants are potentially unhealthy. From my understanding, they use an aluminum-based salt, which performs by actually going into your pores and clogging them. Because of this, aluminum may be absorbed by your body. Also, some claim it’s fundamentally unhealthy to clog your pores because your body intends for them to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this particular product is a deodorant, NOT an antiperspirant. You will still sweat! (it will just smell better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Good value&lt;br /&gt;* Performs all day&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn’t clog up your pores&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* None really (though this doesn’t stop sweating if that’s what you’re looking for)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant for years now. It has a fresh, clean scent that is not overpowering but strong enough that it lasts through the day. What drew me to this particular scent originally and has kept me using it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a typical deodorant, but much better instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used it, you&#x27;ve got to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I decided to try give my normal deodorant a break and try some Old Spice High Endurance- the one thing I can say about it is it definitely makes me smell like a man.  A man who has been doing manual labor all day and has some horrible B.O.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one, but this deodorant does not work at all.  The deodorant smells great, when I first put it on, but within 3 hours of putting it on, it starts to smell like I&#x27;m warming sausages under my arms.  By the end of a grueling 8 hour day of sitting at a desk, my armpits stink so much I&#x27;m surprised I don&#x27;t have flies all around them.  If I actually do something active-- forget about it- my armpit stink could kill a person.  I have to reapply more deodorant multiple times throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t end up smelling like a sasquatch that hasn&#x27;t bathed in months.  This is the worst I have ever smelled- I will have to go back to my old deodorant, which actually did keep me smelling fresh all day.  So if you do really want to smell like a man--like a mountain man-- this deodorant will do the trick.  However, if you don&#x27;t want people to run away from your stench, do not use this deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant and I don&#x27;t buy other deodorant unless I can&#x27;t get the old spice.&lt;br /&gt;One time at band camp I borrowed my friends off brand deoderant (kinda gross, I didn&#x27;t like doing it) and it burned my armpits.</li>
    <li> Nice deodorant. I like it</li>
    <li> Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> The scent on these is perfect and not overwhelming.  They also are very effective at keeping sweat away.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite.</li>
    <li> Been using this product since it came out on the market. The scent is great and seems to last my 12 hour shifts even with heavy jacket. Over all just a great product.</li>
    <li> In the past, when I thought of Old Spice, I imagined a funky, spicy, suffocating old man stench (don&#x27;t ask me why because I don&#x27;t know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day I joined my husband on the couch, put my head on his chest &amp; smelled the most amazing scent! I know, how could armpits smell so good, right?! I asked myself the same question as I put my nose right in his armpit &amp; asked him, \\&quot;what are you wearing? It smells sooooo GOOD!\\&quot; He smirked and answered, \\&quot;Old Spice Sport.\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t believe it &amp; made him show me the bottle. It was true, it was Old Spice Sport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Boy does this Old Spice Sport smell GREAT! No wonder there was a baby boom in the 50s, those men were getting laid thanks to Old Spice! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was running out so I bought him a twin pack because I don&#x27;t want to go one day without smelling that sexy scent. MMMMMMMMM! 😍</li>
    <li> Great price, great scent, longlasting, no streaking, what more could you want?!</li>
    <li> This deoderant is amazing. it is very strong and for someone who sweats a lot and plays a lot of basketball it smells really good. It also lasts the whole day if I don&#x27;t play sports but when I do i need to reapply it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, lasts all day long and no aluminium zirconium! I&#x27;m not a disease-phobe per say but there&#x27;s enough evidence and concern out there that I stay away from it, not to mention it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;No aluminum chlorohydrate or similar content.</li>
    <li> I noticed in stores that old spice is moving away from this style of deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant, its not an antiperspirant - so it wont clog up your underarms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent is nice and not obtrusive, and the value pack is a great deal.</li>
    <li> pit stick!  Now available on Prime Pantry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop stinking dirt bags!  Use some of this on pits of your choosing and smell like a man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to brand. I would upload an image of my armpit to show you how it works but I am at work and no one will assist me in taking a picture. (I asked)</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of these deodorants, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like these deodorants. I thought they were a great deal so I bought them, but he doesn&#x27;t like it. so I will definitely not repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this deodorant since the 90s.  Has a great smell and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had women ask me what type of cologne I&#x27;m wearing when I use this.  It was a little strange at first, since I don&#x27;t normally wear cologne, but they told me they loved it.  I&#x27;ll probably keep using it until I die.</li>
    <li> I bought this product but I realized that it smells different from the old spice pure sport I had last time with the previous apρearance. Did anyone know the smell of the previous pure sport? If yes, which its name now??</li>
    <li> Great!! I hate thick gels and for sure powder marks. Not I have been using Degree Extreme Sport and liked it for a while but would sometimes leave some skid marks on my shirts. This Old Spice is more of a solid gel stick. It doesn&#x27;t run or breakup at all. It has a very subtle sent not like the crazy nostril burners that are out there.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 10+ years, sense before it was popular and what not, and I have always liked the smell and performance and am unlikely to ever change to anything else just so long as they keep making it the same as they always have.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday. Holds for about 6 hours.</li>
    <li> Pure sport smells amazing and it lasts a long time. Just don&#x27;t hit subscribe by accident if you don&#x27;t want to!</li>
    <li> lasts me most of the day unless I&#x27;m working out. why are you still reading? buy this stuff it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> My cat hates this smell. We rub it on areas we don&#x27;t want her to touch. I learned this because my son used this brand (he does smell good!).</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant for both my husband and my sons. It&#x27;s a great smell and it is aluminum free which is hard to find in deodorants. I appreciate that it&#x27;s not antiperspirant which I don&#x27;t like my son to wear. Great value as well since we order on subscribe and save, cheaper than Walmart.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best deodorant i&#x27;ve ever used. It smells manly and lasts all day. Even after I go out for a run, or play basketball, or after a soccer game, I can still smell it instead of smelling the stinky sweat. If you smell bad, buy this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pure Sport for a few years now. As a boxer I like to stay smelling fresh and clean and not have foul body odor. This definitely does the job! Does not leave nasty residue either! Great product!</li>
    <li> Seems like a good deal, but these are a full oz smaller than what I buy in the local supermarket. No wonder they&#x27;re cheaper</li>
    <li> Not sure what to say... smells good, works well.  If you buy this at the store, it&#x27;s nice to receive it automatically with the subscribe and save option.</li>
    <li> great smelling &amp; long lasting...stays fresh &amp; dry all day long...would ecommend to any one &amp; a great value pack</li>
    <li> Cheaper than in the store and just as good</li>
    <li> Great scent! Works as expected!&lt;br /&gt;(Girls, if you want to use this, its not too manly of a scent)</li>
    <li> So happy to find this on Amazon as most deodorants are &amp;#34;antiperspirants&amp;#34; which stain and contain aluminium zirconium.  It&#x27;s hard to find just &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34;.  Have been using Old Spice for years as it is one brand that is &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34;.  It smells great and works without staining.</li>
    <li> Old Spice always puts out great products with great scents. This is another one of them.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer, the product delivers as advertised</li>
    <li> Its the best price I&#x27;ve seen yet and makes me feel and smell manly, what more could a guy want!?</li>
    <li> But not great.&lt;br /&gt;It says High Endurance on the name, but don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking it acts like antiperspirant. In fact, it will only hold up for about two to three hours in high temperatures. Then it creates a new funk that makes you wonder if you should&#x27;ve gone without. For an office type environment, it should be great. But look for something better if you sweat for a living.</li>
    <li> I like Old Spice Deoderant, have been using it for years.  Signed up for this with a subscription so it comes every few months.  Cost is good and I like thge scent and how long it lasts</li>
    <li> Came just as said in ad&lt;br /&gt;Super fast !!! Would buy again 5 stars</li>
    <li> This deodorant works all day long. It glides on easy and stays working. It does not stain clothes, and it has a clean fresh scent. Does not irritate skin and it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Been using this deodorant for years now.  It&#x27;s the only kind I like.  Works well and keeps me stink free all day.</li>
    <li> Saw 1 at the store for the same price as both of these , good product</li>
    <li> They finally got the product right! No sharp ridges on a new one. Smooth and actually lasts till the end of the container! Great job Old Spice. Keep those commercials coming!</li>
    <li> This deodorant has always worked well for me. I apply it only once every 24 hours after showering and it lasts.</li>
    <li> Smells good, lasts long, doesn&#x27;t stain your shirts -- does exactly want you want it to</li>
    <li> Product is great!  However, listing is misleading.  This product comes as two 2.25oz units, which works out to be $1.09/oz, not the $.54/oz that is advertised.</li>
    <li> Satisfied customer.  Bought them for my son. He likes them, has no complaints and neither do I.</li>
    <li> Burned a thin layer of skin from my arm-pits.  Tried this after using Mitchum brand deodorant.  Will never use Old Spice again... way too strong or way too many chemicals.. not sure which.</li>
    <li> My first experience with the smell of Old Spice was watching my father splash the cologne on his face and neck each time he left the house to go to work or out for an evening with friends/family members.  As time passed, Old Spice created various products in soaps, cologne, splash cologne, Men&#x27;s deodorants, body wash, and other interesting products.  The men in my household love this scent, I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price that Amazon offers for this deodorant and size is great.  Packaging, delivery was as expected on this order.  A company that has not changed its formula yet has improved their products.  If you grew up smelling this great aroma then you are already interested, for those that have never tried this deodorant -- give it a try!  You may like it more than what you are using at this time.  I am happy with the price, quality, and quantity and Seller is true to advertising of this product.  All the men in my household are happy, so that makes me HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Make me smell nice...</li>
    <li> My hubby has sensitive skin and loves this.  He is very active everyday all day as he is a college football and track coach.  Great value and perfect for his skin.</li>
    <li> So glad that OS has continued this great scent, even with all of its new crazy concoctions.  It&#x27;s simply the best scent of all.  Makes my woman go nuts.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a cologne, but it smells better than a cologne ... if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> Tried this deodorant for the first time about a year ago, and liked the scent and also that is does not go on wet or sticky.  Also seems to last a good long time, which is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This twin pack price with Add-on shipping makes this a bargain - much better than in our local market and I also like the \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scented ones too ([[ASIN:B008CC3UFA Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant Twin Pack 4.5 Oz]]). Like this size for traveling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am not a fan of anti-perspirants and am always on the lookout for good deodorants that do not have anti-perspirant chemicals, and this is a good one. If you are looking for something similar, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the white stick, but it is the blue stick (which burns my husband&#x27;s armpits), so can&#x27;t use them at all :(</li>
    <li> This deodorant works. It&#x27;s cheap and does the job. It smells decent too. I don&#x27;t like spending a lot on popular brands like Axe, so this is great if you can get it for around $2.00 per stick.</li>
    <li> Only 2.25oz per stick.. sneaky sneaky downsizing things.  Not really that great of a value when you calculate price per oz... Still, 3 stars because it works..</li>
    <li> Perfect, I love being on subscribe and save for these items so I never have to encounter wally world lol.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and so do I.</li>
    <li> Typically, I purchase an all natural deodorant like Jason or something from Wholefoods.  However they don&#x27;t always get the job done.  They are fine for driving around, lounging at home or other light use.  But if you are going to play the field, be it soccer. football or the dating field, you need something stronger and with lasting power.  In my experience the Old Spice high endurance lives up to its name.  In the event of an impromptu beer after the game, or an impromptu sleep over, you will be glad you had the added protection of Old Spice High endurance.</li>
    <li> My 25 yr old son likes this brand so I got this for a stocking stuffer. I couldn&#x27;t pass this deal up 2 full size for the price of one!</li>
    <li> my brand for over 15 years</li>
    <li> Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Deodorant is the best , been using it for years and glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good, and spurts out a rainbow of kittens every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Averse to antiperspirant when I dont have to, this item is used daily and it smells good and doesnt mix in a way that suggests concealment. I prefer not aluminum or other metals unless I am going out, dressed, or important function. For around the beach and home this item above is fine. It smells good, lasts a long time, and I am a loyal customer for this item.</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong with Old Spice, the 2 for one deal on Amazon is better than any other deal in my local stores.</li>
    <li> great product I use it almost every day LOL ok every day!</li>
    <li> Good price, great smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff is quite strong; I have done hours of yard work and failed to outstink it. Kudos to Old Spice.</li>
    <li> Smells good on my man!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodorant and its a good deal</li>
    <li> Pits can&#x27;t go without it. This is the best deodorant I have used. Clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave residue. Great smell and applies on smooth as butter.</li>
    <li> I like straight deodorant. I like to sweat when that&#x27;s what my body wants to do. And I don&#x27;t like yellow stains left my antiperspirants. This stuff is classic and smells great.</li>
    <li> Old Spice is always great. Long lasting, and great smell.  I also like the fact of the 2.25 size, as I travel a lot.</li>
    <li> Love the clean scent, its more of a clean laundry smell.  The antiperspirant /  Deodorant combo on the label lets me know that it will last all day and does not punk out.  When I buy just the deodorant buy itself it doesnt last as long.</li>
    <li> great product but it could last just a little longer before re applying.</li>
    <li> My son like old spice</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant my boyfriend will use! It smells amazing it keeps his underarms dry, and he perspires alot! i would recommend this to all men!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually opened these from this order but I have been using Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport for many years. Works for me and my wife has no complaints. I do not use antiperspirant, don&#x27;t like it and it gives me a rash on hot days but this deodorant gets me through just about any day.</li>
    <li> Been using Old Spice pure sport for as long as I can remember. The main reason being..it won&#x27;t stain your shirts and smells great.</li>
    <li> When my wife saw me bring home the Old Spice, she just roller her eyes. But I asked her to be patient, to smell the new scent, and told her she would like it, as I did, and that it was not my father&#x27;s Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My haste to get a deal proved to be a waste. I work out in the early AM, then go to work for 10 to 12 hours. So that morning shower and deodorant application has to last. With my previous and soon to be primary deodorant I could apply after the gym in the morning and if need be, I&#x27;d make it through the night and even back to the gym in the morning, still smelling relatively fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say the same about this Old Spice. I pretty much bought this deodorant based on the smell. I got one unit at the local drug store, liked the smell and then immediately bought two twin packs from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is my usual routine, I did my workout at 0500, showered and hit work by 0730, smelling dandy with my new Old Spice deodorant. After a 14 hour day, I made it home to decompress and get ready for the morning, when I noticed a rancid smell coming from.....ME! I presumed it was from one of the dark and dirty record rooms I visited during the day, tossed the clothes in the hamper and went about my evening shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, same gym and same routine. This time a 10 hour day, went home to change for dinner and the SAME rancid smell was coming off of my clothes. After several more days of this mystery, I realized it was the Old Spice deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is great when first applied, but it just does not last. By the end of any day, a quick whiff revealed the smell turned from sweet to rancid. I confirmed by switching back to my old brand, then back to Old Spice, then back again, at least five times since purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, if you plan to be out more than five hours, this deodorant will not last. After seven hours or more, the smell starts to decay into something quite foul smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surelythis can be my body chemistry, and I accept that, which is why I&#x27;m back to my old brand. Just be sure to buy a single unit and testing before committing to a longer term purchase. It&#x27;s just deodorant, but every dollar counts these days.</li>
    <li> Had to use my ban powder scent roll on when it ran out.  Pretty horrified.  I added this to subscribe and save so he&#x27;d never endure the trauma again.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 20+ years.  It reduces sweating without completely blocking it up.  Great for playing sports or doing a strenuous activity, where you need a bit of flow without any stink.</li>
    <li> So glad the subscription options is available for this product!!</li>
    <li> My husband smells good, the price is right, and it does the job. What more could you ask for?!</li>
    <li> Great scent and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too great but it does the job. Blocks odor and lasts around 24 hrs. Average deodorant. Good for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I receive serious irritations and rashes from this specific deodorant type. Also it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands or prevent odor for the whole day. I can however recommend using the original old spice type which is the white stick.</li>
    <li> This deodorant was great at controlling my armpit stench during my morning runs. It also was a great antiperspirant for normal activity throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells great, and washes easily from clothes (using Liquid Tide w/ Bleach Alt). No stains yet over 5+ years using it. I&#x27;d guess I have somewhat sensitive skin, as I&#x27;ve found that I need to wait a good 20 minutes or so after a shower (ESPECIALLY after a workout) before putting this on, otherwise it does give me a very mild chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used in terms of scent and odor-stopping ability.</li>
    <li> Smells good and it works, but find it for a cheaper price. I got it for $2.40 for both of them on Amazon at the time, but it&#x27;s $5.11 right now for the twin pack. It&#x27;s cheaper just buying it in the store.</li>
    <li> people don&#x27;t hold their noses or turn and run away when I use it so it mush work; the overly musky odor is not my favorite but why complain when something works</li>
    <li> This deodorant caused chemical burn getting gradually worse with use.</li>
    <li> How can anyone beat this price? They can&#x27;t. I have to buy this everytime I spend over $25. Now I have a cabinet full of them, but never run out. Thanks Old Spice for always being there for me.</li>
    <li> broke my hubby out, I forgot and ordered it again, I like the scent of old spice and so does he, but all versions of gel deodorant and a few other types breaks him out, he gets welt like places under his arms</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the ingredients for the product has changed, because now it barely lasts half the day before I have to reapply it.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically as an add-on to get an order over the $25 Prime add-on shipping limit. I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Pure Sport for a long time, and this is by far the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen. I can&#x27;t really make recommendations for what type of deodorant one should buy as everyone has a specific scent (or lack thereof) that they prefer, but if you know you like this kind then it&#x27;s absolutely the best price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6 MAY 2013: When I purchased this as an add-on it was $2.40. At time of this update the price is $19.20 (8 TIMES AS MUCH!!!). I am a big fan of this product as it does an excellent job keeping my particularly sweaty self from smelling too bad, but it is absolutely not worth that much. I would compare as many of the old spice options as you can find to stay within a reasonable price range (always check the \\&quot;$/oz\\&quot; next to the price for quick comparisons):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008HQ8LQE Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant Twin Pack 6.5 Oz]] - Same thing as this, but each stick is 3.25 oz vs. 2.25 oz&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BL18J8W Old Spice High Endurance Men&#x27;s Deodorant, Pure Sport Scent, 3 Ounce (Pack of 4)]] - I can attest to all but \\&quot;Arctic Force\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve tried all three others &amp; I have liked all of them&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0017WNFXE Old Spice Classic Deodorant , Original Scent, 3.25-Ounces (Pack of 6)]] - I used to use this one, but it stopped being carried at the local grocery store. I can&#x27;t tell a difference between the classic &amp; high endurance, either in scent or performance&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008CC3ZIW Old Spice Red Zone Collection Swagger Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant Twin Pack 6 Oz]] - Not as big of a fan of the \\&quot;Swagger\\&quot; line, but if it&#x27;s the best price available I would choose it</li>
    <li> This is a great smell, my daily go to! No sticking and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and you get a value deal.These two sticks will last me four months.</li>
    <li> Smells good and lasts me all day long.</li>
    <li> smells great hubby loves it</li>
    <li> Does its job, nice smell, not overly cloying.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other deoderant - even if that means I must go days, weeks, months without applying. Old Spice created a winner!</li>
    <li> Dear P&amp;G: Please never stop making this stuff. It&#x27;s the only deodorant where when I sweat, I smell good. Women have mistaken it for cologne.</li>
    <li> Deodorant good price.  2Nd or 3rd time ordering.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Simply great. Of good quality, What you see is what you get. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the brand. You can go for it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like Old Spice deodorant. It really seems to work. Although the stick is colored blue, it goes on clear, and for me it lasts the whole day.  The issue I have with this particular deodorant is the scent. The [[ASIN:B008CC3UFA previous Old Spice deodorant]] I used had the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent, which smelled really awesomely great. In contrast, the &amp;#34;Pure Sport&amp;#34; scent is kind of boring, more like washing machine detergent. I wanted a second opinion, though, so I asked my sister to smell a brand new stick of the stuff, and she agreed that &amp;#34;Pure Sport&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as the &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; scent.  Maybe you would prefer the &amp;#34;Pure Sport&amp;#34; scent, though. So assuming you like it, keep in mind that the 2-pack comes with two individual 2.25 oz sticks, for a TOTAL of 4.5 oz. (The title can be a little confusing here.) Each stick lasts for about 16 months, depending on how much you use.  Also, according to the product page: &amp;#34;if you lit yourself on fire and stood in the blast radius of a nuclear bomb&amp;#34; the deodorant would still work. I haven&#x27;t tested that yet, but I&#x27;ll update the review when I have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this stuff since high school.  I was too lazy to go the 6 miles to a Target to get more.</li>
    <li> Works fine, good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same stuff you will purchase at the store.  The only difference is that it&#x27;s more than likely cheaper on Amazon, like it was for me.  Or even if it&#x27;s the same/similar price, still a great buy since it&#x27;s 1 less thing to have to purchase from the store.  Being a guy, we don&#x27;t always do all of our shopping in one trip.  Typically, we purchase a lot of things as needed, however, when I need something, like deoderant, I will typically purchase the double pack or several if they are on sale and it&#x27;s one less thing I have to worry about sooner than later.  Saving me a trip to the store saves me money either way.</li>
    <li> this is the same deodorant i always get, but it&#x27;s a slightly smaller size than what i normally find in stores.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodorant, it does the job.</li>
</ol>
