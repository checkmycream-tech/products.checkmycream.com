    <li> Relaxing and helps me slow down after a busy day.</li>
    <li> The cream felt wonderful on my skin, but WAY too much aroma for me.</li>
    <li> The text on the item container alludes to a benefit that using this body cream may help you to sleep! They call it Sleep Aromatheropy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have bet $100 that this was hype but I tried it upon my wife&#x27;s insistence months ago, and  have used it every night since.  I apply a bit under my nose as well as on my hands and face. I find the fragrance is a delight and helps me to nod off!  I know its mental, but the Lavender aroma takes me to a more serene time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, this product was a wonderful surprise.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a secret sister Christmas gift. She has problems sleeping, so this went in a care package for her. From personal use before, it smells amazing, isn&#x27;t greasy, and is great to put on before slumber.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff!</li>

    <li> I did not buy it to sleep so I have not tested it. However I love the smell and the feel.</li>
    <li> I must have received an old bottle of this lotion as it smells terrible.  It smells NOTHING like the trial size bottle I got from Bath &amp; Body Works.  Had to take a shower after putting it on because it smelled rancid.</li>
    <li> Simple excellent!  Makes you sleepy.</li>
