      <li>We believe it to be quite accurate also.</li>
      <li>This scale rules...very accurate readings.</li>
      <li>Accurate.</li>
      <li>It gave accurate readings for about two weeks and then went haywire, searching and searching for a weight.  </li>
      <li>Once it is working, the weight seems to be accurate.  </li>
      <li>Sound awfull</li>
      <li>This scale is a great product, especially for the price!  </li>
      <li>When standing on the scale, it felt grounded and secure.</li>
      <li>All I have to lightly touch it</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>just a light touch.</li>
      <li>I like to resolve this by lightly lifting it just a bit off the ground with my foot and letting it land, which starts the scale every time.</li>
      <li>The only problem I experienced was battery life.  </li>
      <li>So, good looking, sturdy (so far) and inexpensive.</li>

      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Good value for a basic, modern looking scale.  </li>

      <li>Design is modern, simple yet nice and sleek.</li>
      <li>Very accurate scale, has a switch on the back that lets you weigh yourself in lbs, stone, and kilos.</li>
      <li>Unit seems durable so far and gives accurate weight.  </li>
      <li>It also seems pretty acurate too.</li>
      <li>The weight reading is exact when compared to another scale.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty close</li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when I stepped onto this scale for the first time and it informed me that I had gained 20 lbs in 4 days.</li>
      <li>Remember to tap it first, you&#x27;ll see 8&#x27;s then O&#x27;s, get on.</li>
      <li>I work in a hospital and am able to check it against the medical scales there, and find it to be spot on.  </li>
      <li>, I notice that if I haven&#x27;t interacted with the scale in a couple days, when I step on it, the first reading is inaccurate.</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described and it works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>so can&#x27;t attest to longevity but so far so good, glad we ignored the negative reviews.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s about all you can really say about a scale, right?</li>

      <li>The accuracy is ok, but one have to remember this is not a professional scale.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This scale is really simple.  I keep it in my bathroom, and I use it pretty much everyday after showering.  You have to lift it up and let it drop a little to turn on, or you can tap it into the wall lightly.  It&#x27;s really accurate, I got on and off three times and got the same measurement each time.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Fully functional and very elegant looking scale. The reason why I gave it the four stars is because the readout is kind of hard to see because of the small screen and the screen does not light up.  Also something that is odd is that you must lift it with your toe to activate it. This isnt a big deal but it is just a bit odd of an action to do.   I believe the scale is accurate and its a great deal for the price. The design looks fancy and it impresses people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve weighed myself on three separate occasions over the last ten minutes, and I&#x27;ve stepped on and off about three or four times in each of those instances. The first time I read 127, second time? 127.4. Third time I weighed 127.2. Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> This scale is soooo unreliable!!!!!  I weigh about 120lbs, and the scale seemed very accurate during the first few weeks.  I was very happy and wanted to give it 5 stars.  Then it started to display random results.  I sometimes weighed below 110, sometimes over 130...  For the most ridiculous time, I weighed 112 at first. After 5 seconds, I weighed 127.  Another 5 seconds later, I became 130.  This scale is making me really disappointed now as the increasing random results that it displays.  If you want a scale that can works for a long time, this is definitely not a choice.</li>
    <li> I read the positive and negative reviews and still bought it considering they said it was a very accurate scale, even though they had intial problems getting it turned on. After waiting almost 2 1/2 weeks for it to arrive it was back ordered, and when it finally arrives it does not work. I am very upset and disappointed. So I am thinking the batteries are probably dead. I go to walmart buy batteries for $5 and still it does not work at all. I bang it after reading reviews of others having the similar problem, mine still doesn&#x27;t worked. So my mechanically inclined husband unscrews the screws on the back/bottom of it and there was the problem the negative and positive connector wires were broken off. My husband sodered them back on, and low and behold my Newline Well Balance Digital Glass Scale works perfectly. All I have to lightly touch it and it turns on, no banging or lifting like other review I read. just a light touch. It also seems pretty acurate too. I even put in the old batteries and works so it wasn&#x27;t the batteries its their poor internal wire construction. So that&#x27;s why I gave it a 2 stars. Hopefully this scale won&#x27;t kick the bucket soon. Time will tell. So now I am happy with my cool glass design scale.</li>
    <li> I love this bathroom scale!  It is not only accurate but very pretty.  I do have to lift the scale with my foot to get the battery started each time I use it, but that is not a problem.  An excellent price, also.</li>
    <li> I bought this scale over a year ago and it still works great!  Turning it on is a bit of a trick... I either lift up the upper right foot about a centimeter off the floor then drop the scale, or I push the scale sideways across the linoleum and the friction on the floor turns it on.  I&#x27;ve had no problem with the accuracy and it cleans very well.  I would recommend this scale to anyone looking for one!!</li>
    <li> The negative reviews are pretty misleading. This weighing machine is so easy to switch on. Just lift it with your toe, slightly drop it, it switches on. It isn&#x27;t tough at all. It looks wonderful, and I got this product after a lot of research, and I will say that this was the best price available for such a machine:- looks good, easy to use, has worked for me for 6months now, good pricing.</li>
    <li> The instructions actually tell you to lift the scale with your big toe and drop it get it going. But even this didn&#x27;t work that well. I&#x27;m not sure my downstairs neighbors will appreciate me dropping the scale every time I want to use it.</li>
    <li> Good value for a basic, modern looking scale.  Seems accurate, display is easy to read.  Good design and scale.  When you read the instructions you will start to worry that the thing is for non-American markets, as all examples are in kilos, but don&#x27;t worry, it is defaulted to pounds.  I do wish it held the weight on the screen for more than one second after you step off, because if your over six feet you have to bend down to read the LCD display in some lighting conditions, and it disapears almost instantly.</li>
    <li> This scale is very accurate and reliable. I work in a hospital and am able to check it against the medical scales there, and find it to be spot on.  It&#x27;s also a very nice looking addition to my bathroom. I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s about all you can really say about a scale, right?</li>
    <li> I bought this scale in January 2010 (a year ago) and it is still working great today.  As far as I can tell (based on comparisons with the scales at my gym and doctors office), it is accurate within at least a half pound, probably closer to a tenth of a pound.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you do have to sort of lift it up with your foot and then drop it lightly for it to turn on, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be a problem at all.  I bought this scale to help me keep track of my weight as I was losing it, and it is very sensitive. In my case this was good because, as I was weighing myself under the most consistent bodily conditions possible, I was able to see that I was steadily losing a little bit of weight each day and be encouraged by this result.  So yes.  This scale is a great product, especially for the price!  And, on the more superficial side of things, it looks pretty sharp, too!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a simple, nice looking scale to track my weight loss. I really enjoy that it measures your weight down to a fraction of a pound. Fantastic. Great Value.</li>
    <li> Very accurate scale, has a switch on the back that lets you weigh yourself in lbs, stone, and kilos. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This scale is certainly a great find for its looks, accuracy, size and price. Reviewers are correct that it is not quite sensitive enough to just tap and weigh. I like to resolve this by lightly lifting it just a bit off the ground with my foot and letting it land, which starts the scale every time. I&#x27;ve used it for months of frequent weighings and have yet to replace the battery.</li>
    <li> We received the scale in good condition and within 2 or 3 days of it being ordered (during the Christmas rush).  It takes a little getting used to to get it to come on, lifting it with your toe seems to be the best, but it performs just fine.</li>
    <li> My first digital scale and I found it to work great.  The detailed weighing of .2 lbs made it easy to see the fluctuations of my weight throughout the day.  I felt the responses of my diet and workouts and saw them on the scale.  Its great for motivating.  You normally tap the scale with your foot, let it set and then get on.  Occasionally the tap doesn&#x27;t work and you just lift it with your toe.     The only problem I experienced was battery life.  Though I was using it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is a good scale. The weight reading is exact when compared to another scale.  The only thing that is slightly annoying is that to turn it on, it says to tap the top with your foot.  Mine will not turn on, even if I bang the thing with my foot.  I have to lift the side of the scale off the ground with my foot and let it hit the ground to turn on. Which, really isn&#x27;t a big deal.  Great value!</li>
    <li> This scale looks great and works well.  It was packaged very well and its really easy to use.    I searched amazon for glass weight scales and almost all of them were really expensive.  This one was an exceptional buy.  Very affordable and it looks really nice.    Just a tap from the foot turns it on, and after being weighed it turns off automatically.    Definetly a good buy.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t believe what a great scale this item is.  Not only is it sold at a great price and the most visually attractive scale I have ever seen, it works perfectly too.  Each time we weigh twice to check the accuracy of the readout, it displays exactly the same reading.  We believe it to be quite accurate also.</li>
    <li> This scale rules...very accurate readings. You just have to lift it up slightly with your foot and set it back down to turn it on. Highly recommended.  Update after 4 years: the scale is still working as well as ever after 4 years of near-daily use by two pretty heavy people.  Update after 8+ years: same as above. Except we&#x27;re probably heavier now, because &#x27;Murica.</li>
    <li> The scale works fine.  However, it is supposed to turn on by tapping the center of the scale.  But, it doesn&#x27;t.  I have to shake the scale or move it around on the floor to get it to turn on.</li>
    <li> Unit seems durable so far and gives accurate weight.  Sometimes takes multiple tries to get it to activate.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and seems pretty consistent.  Not a complex product.  Tap the surface.  Wait for the 0.0 and then step on.  Easy to read output.  Fits  well with modern bathroom fixtures.</li>
    <li> Remember to tap it first, you&#x27;ll see 8&#x27;s then O&#x27;s, get on.It does the job, weighing quickly. I&#x27;d like to see an opaque top. But heck, you can&#x27;t get it all, can you?</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000I36QTI Newline Best Value Digital Bathroom Glass Scale]] am very pleased with this scale, its accuracy and ease of operation. Would recommend fully</li>
    <li> Imagine my surprise when I stepped onto this scale for the first time and it informed me that I had gained 20 lbs in 4 days. I trust the previous reading since it was at the beginning of my annual physical. So I tested it against four other scales, all which were within 4 pounds of the Doctor&#x27;s scalle. The final straw came when a guest used it and found, to her chagrin, that she had gained 22.5 lbs during her nine hour road trip from Flagstaff to Los Angeles.</li>
    <li> Design is modern, simple yet nice and sleek. Has Kg or pounds which my european wife likes. Accurate. Only had it for a week now so can&#x27;t attest to longevity but so far so good, glad we ignored the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed with the Newline Well Balance scale! I took it   out of the box, removed the tabs on the batteries, and it didn&#x27;t work. I   called the company for assistance and someone answer without identifying the company but said he was able to help. He suggested that I insert paper   under the battery cover to improve contact. It turned on ONCE but not again. Amazon only offers refunds for products from Wintime, the company that sells Newline, because their stock changes so often. That should tell you something! I haven&#x27;t found a replacement yet, but it certainly won&#x27;t be a Newline or Wintime product.</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this balance is that I need to lift one end from the ground and tap it to activate it. I do not succeed in activating it by stepping on it.</li>
    <li> This scale turns on and off with an internal movement sensor.  At times, I have to lift the scale up and place it back down for the sensors to activate.  Once it is working, the weight seems to be accurate.  The scale is a beautiful glass that looks beautiful in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> This Scale is perfect.. It looks so nice, Glass with silver accent and design and really looks rich. It weighs perfectly without a problem.  Some have mentioned that they found it hard to get to the 0.0 by tapping in middle with foot.. I find no problems at all. Just tap once or twice and you are good to go.    Again the look is so pretty and rich.. that I was so pleased when I opened the box, I showed everyone right away.. very very impressed!    I would buy this not only again for myself.. but as a gift.</li>
    <li> The accuracy is ok, but one have to remember this is not a professional scale. If you do 3 measurements in a row you won&#x27;t get the exact same weight but it&#x27;s pretty close and you can do an average. After all our body weight has small variations during the day, so an average will work. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the slight tap to start it..... it doesn&#x27;t work. Mine starts by lifting one side about 2 inches from the floor and let it drop. Sound awfull but... after 2 months still working. Let&#x27;s hope for the best. It&#x27;s still my money but it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Want a more accurate and gentle scale?... pay the price.   So, good looking, sturdy (so far) and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This scale has a number of favorable features:  Looks good with its see-through platform  Easy to see numbers from a stand up stance  Goes with any decor  Very easy to work and very accurate</li>
    <li> I got one. Big error. It just broke two months after buying it. Not only that, it never worked properly. Don&#x27;t lose your time. Get another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a scale, so ther&#x27;s not much to say about it. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years and it works well and the digital red-out is easy to read.</li>
    <li> This scale is accurate, pretty and easy to use. I weigh myself once a week early in the morning before heading to Weight Watchers, the reading on both scales are the same.  Turning on the scale once the batteries are on is a breeze, just move it with your foot wait for it to read zero then step on it.  I purchased this product in May of 2011 it is now November of 2011 and it has died. I changed the battery twice and no response. It has been in my bedroom so it has not been expose to water or humidity. I have tried to contact Newline to get an address to send it back but have not received a response.  Update: I did hear from customer service at Newline. They made arrangements for me to get a new scale all I had to do is pay for the shipping and handling. Therefore I will upgrade to three stars, hopefully this scale will last at least a one year.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a second scale for use at beach house.  Reads 1.4 lbs heavier than our original (booh!) but is attractive, easy to read.  Turning the scale on is harder than expected -- we do a little toe lift of the unit and it seems to work better than the tap called for in the directions.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This scale appeared to be a good buy, judging from the earlier reviews.  It gave accurate readings for about two weeks and then went haywire, searching and searching for a weight.  I tried to reset it by removing the batteries for a minute, but to no avail.  It currently displays the \\&quot;8\\&quot; character and sometimes the \\&quot;0.0\\&quot; as it is supposed to, and then turns off or shows a bogus weight (say, 215 for a 160-pound person).      I am returning this useless piece of garbage.  How can a manufacturer produce something like this?  Don&#x27;t they at least try to produce products that work?  Do they test them in a quality control procedure?  This is shameful.  How difficult is it to produce a bathroom scale?</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described and it works pretty well.  It took a little while for me to understand the tapping technique that would turn it on.  I actually think it works best to lift up under the scale with your foot and it always starts right up.</li>
    <li> This is a nice looking scale, the glass is thick and solid. It&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received these scales that they did not work.  Perhaps the battery was dead.  I returned them for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I purchased this scale just needing a simple bathroom scale, no bells and whistles necessary. And that&#x27;s pretty much what this scale is. It doesn&#x27;t do any other fancy calculations other than your body weight; it has no backlight. You don&#x27;t have to turn it on first or do anything extra before stepping onto it, just step up, and in about a second your weight is displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 measuring units that you can choose from by sliding a button on the BSc of the scale: pounds (lb), kilograms (kg), or stones (st). I do like that the button is manual, and there&#x27;s no inner programming needed to change this, you simply click the button into place where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass is very thick and sturdy feeling. When standing on the scale, it felt grounded and secure. No complaints about the material and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I notice that if I haven&#x27;t interacted with the scale in a couple days, when I step on it, the first reading is inaccurate. It is off by about 4 pounds. I have to step off of it and immediately back on it again to get an accurate read. Now, this isn&#x27;t a major hindrance, but it&#x27;s worth being noted. This is why I&#x27;m rating it a 3/5; afterall, that&#x27;s the main purpose of what you&#x27;re purchasing a scale for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a decent scale, at a decent price point, if you don&#x27;t mind stepping on it twice to get your correct weight.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective scale or something, but the one I got was terrible. The first reading it gave me was 10 pounds below my actual weight. The next day it was correct, but 5 minutes later it was 5 pounds lower. 20 minutes later, it went up 3 pounds. Returned this as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> This is a great scale. It looks great, and works well also,I have had no issues with it. My only concern is, if there is no way to recalibrate the scale if ever the need arise.</li>
    <li> Came on time, looks elegant and very accurate. thanks for the good buy</li>
    <li> Modern, sleek, lightweight, easy to read, nothing to clean . . . PERFECT!!</li>
    <li> Xmas gifts. They loved them.</li>
    <li> This scale is very accurate, works every time, is attractive, very easy to clean, and isn&#x27;t too bulky. It&#x27;s great.</li>
