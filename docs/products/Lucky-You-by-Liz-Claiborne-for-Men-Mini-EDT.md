    <li> Great price, and the dauber application keeps my scently enthusiastic husband from smelling like &#x27;Bad First(and only) Date&#x27; Good thing he is a great kisser....</li>
    <li> Bought this as a small bottle that I could leave in the truck.  Good combination of freshness, light musk, with a hint of floral powder.  Not super &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s ok since I spend all day outside so I don&#x27;t really need any help in that department.  Probably not something I would wear daily, but it&#x27;s a nice fragrance for dinner or drinks.  It won&#x27;t make women fall over you, but it will keep them around.</li>
    <li> Very good smell people like it</li>
    <li> This cologne will always be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for my guy friends. it is a total chick magnet and once you smell it it will draw you in. No woman will ever forget that smell. Lucky Brand bests selling forever. No matter how expensive a mans cologne selections is, this one will always get some LIKES. pheromone heaven:-)</li>
    <li> It was the correct size, came on time, and smells how I want it to. It is a very small bottle, but a great price if you just want to try it.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this cologne when I was a teen, but when I received this one it had a very strong alcohol smell. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a bad batch or what but it was quite repulsive.</li>
    <li> I love it I need more</li>
    <li> OK I would give it five stars but I had no idea it was going to be a tiny bottle. :/</li>
    <li> I just DON&#x60;T get all these good review ? this is worse scent ever ! smells like lemon peels ,if you&#x60;re picky just stay away from this perfume and save your money .</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this Cologne for a while, once it finally got here I ripped open the box, an got so excited to found out it was the one I was searching for!</li>
    <li> i hope i can find the big bottle of this one.</li>
    <li> This cologne, in my personal opinion has too much alcohol content. It is overpowering with an alcohol smell. I suggest trying this in a retail store before purchase.</li>
    <li> Ok I didn&#x27;t know which kind to buy.for my husband .  Bc I have the pink with the black rubber top. This one has a black top but plastic. And you use your finger to put it on. It has a clean scent smells nice. The reason y I picked such a small bottle is bc like I said. I don&#x27;t know what it would smell like. Perfect size for that.  If  he likes this then I&#x27;ll try another.&lt;br /&gt;The product came on time. And was not broke in anyway. That&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> better lucky casino Friday night  bath tub try body spray lucky jackpot big win 900.00 money</li>
    <li> Good scent, but not strong enough.</li>
    <li> The scent is really nice, not too strong, but strong enough for people close to you to notice. I have already had a few girls comment on it.  It has a slight flower/citrus hint, but still MAN haha.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband for Christmas. Smells so good, going to buy a bigger bottle for him for day wear.</li>
