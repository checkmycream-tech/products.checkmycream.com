      <li>I used to use another brand of fibers that were spectacular, but I can no longer find them for sale.</li>
      <li>adds nice volume and length.</li>
      <li>Now, I NEVER go out without them &amp; because my lashes are so nicely emphasized once the extenders are applied, I often then just apply lipstick &amp; nothing else.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Honestly can&#x27;t imagine NOT having this, forever......</li>
      <li>I liked the effect but as time goes by, the fibers start to fall off your lashes.</li>
      <li>this product has it&#x27;s issues  flakes and darkens the lid - though largely a wonderful product , really helps accentuate lashes</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product really is a good mascara.  It was a bit wet at first, but after using it a bit more, it seems to get better and better.  It makes my eye lashes look longer and wider. I like it very much. I used it with some added sparkle mixed in and it was very pretty. I think it works good as a topper mascara over other ones, too.  It really lengthens and thickens eye lashes</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I can&#x27;t believe how long my lashes got in seconds!!! Great buy and would definitely get it again.</li>
    <li> It accentuates my eyelashes more than just mascara&lt;br /&gt;before the jewish Sabbath, I use it since I do not apply mascara on the Sabbath.</li>
    <li> This product really works in conjunction with any mascara. Takes your lashes to a new level! Really enhances eye lashes. Adds a lot of length, and does not irritate eyes. Removes easily.</li>
    <li> It definitely does what it claims.  It gives my lashes the look of falsies in seconds.  Love this product  it is great...</li>
    <li> I bought the DivaDerme Lash extender on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised. It really does extend your lashes when applied correctly. Just as the directions say, I simply applied a quick coat of regular mascara, then applied the DermaLash and another coat of mascara. I have fairly long lashes to begin with, so this made my lashes extend up to my eyebrows! In my case, I wouldn&#x27;t wear it every day, but it is fun for special occasions. But a friend of mine saw it on me and bought her own, as she has VERY little lashes. Even with mascara, you could never see her lashes.  It worked GREAT on her, she finally has lashes you can see. She loves it and uses it everyday. The only thing is you have to follow the directions and tap the brush on the side of the tube as you extend the wand, or you will wind up with clumps of fibers on your face. And only apply it to the lashes at middle to tip of lashes, or it can clump and look like a spider on your eyes! Washes off easily with soap and water. I will keep this product on hand for those times I want my eyes to really stand out!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it ought. Love the natural look of super long lashes.</li>
    <li> This is all the rage other than lash extentions which I&#x27;ve had.. these have been duplicated by Tate and others,ect, Cherry Blossom..... this was worth the small amount of money. Play with it.  I find using a wet mascara gives best results or a waxy one. Go up and down working sidevto side as u do.. it separates ur lashes a bit too. It gives a thicker voluminous feel. And a but longer but not much.. I like it though.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I have tried. Used with mascara you can make your lashes look like fake ones, without the glue.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with tenille.  For those of you who have thin lashes this is a wonderful fix.  I happen to have very long lashes and find that using the lash extender produces a very dramatic affect.  I do plan to use it when I go out in the evening.  I&#x27;m just not that comfortable using it for daytime.  It is pretty easy to use and not quite as messy as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> goes on easy......stays put........looks great&lt;br /&gt;i would definetly recommend this product for huge sexy eyes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;i will definetly order again</li>
    <li> I like it! Seems to work like the dreamlash brand but it&#x27;s cheaper and you get more too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase! I&#x27;m loving my divaderme lash extender! It works like a miracle.... I did wear fake lashes for a long time but my own lashes were falling out and were very fragile.Divaderme is so natural looking! Happy customer :D!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Amazingly enhances eyelashes and makes your eyes look great. I wear contacts and applied after putting the contacts in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used another lash fiber, but it&#x27;s hard to find in the US, so I went with the DivaDerme.  The important thing to remember with using any lash fiber is to make sure your mascara is very \\&quot;wet\\&quot;, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with clumps.  I use Blinc Kiss Me mascara, which has a long drying time, so didn&#x27;t have too much of an issue with clumping.  The fibers will definitely drop down onto your cheeks, so with a little trial and error, I found that the fibers are easier to brush away if you apply a little loose powder under your eyes before you start.  It&#x27;s also helpful to tap the excess off of the fiber applicator brush before you apply the fibers.  It does work, my lashes look phenomenal!</li>
    <li> My sister told me about product, she uses it and loves it. I Love the product, fast shipping too, I will buy again. Added length and fullness to my lashes. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought DivaDerme Eyelash Extender because i do not like to use fake lashes, but i think this is too expensive, i actually find a very similar product on ebay from korea named Enlee which work the same, and cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to get used to it.  takes practice.............looks great!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually see any difference in the way this looks compared to regular mascara.  I wasn&#x27;t blessed with long lashes, and this doesn&#x27;t help me at all, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I purchased this with total skeptism. I figured, I&#x27;d try it out and probably end up giving it away like most of my ho-hum makeup purchases. Not this time! I have decent eyelashes, nothing horrible but nothing noteworthy either. I used this product as directed. Apply your normal mascara (I use Covergirl [[ASIN:B001BMLJU6 CoverGirl LashBlast Mascara, Very Black 800 1 ea]] and while it&#x27;s still wet, you apply the last extender. Then you reapply your normal mascara one more time. My eyelashes looked amazing aferward - I&#x27;d stay twice as full and maybe 30% longer. I highly recommend this product.   I also want to note the 3rd party seller shipped my product immediately and I received it in a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive mascaras &amp; primers like Dior, Clinique,  Urban Decay and several regular store brands and the results don&#x27;t even come close to Divaderm&#x27;s Lash Extender.  I&#x27;ve even tried false eyelashes but they take too much time and effort, they&#x27;re uncomfortable and don&#x27;t look natural.     I just got my Divaderme Lash Extender and tried it for the first time and I am just so thrilled at how my tiny UN-noticable lashes look. They&#x27;re so long, full and thick.  I wear mascara everyday so it wasn&#x27;t hard at all to put this stuff on. I would recommend trying this before you throw your money away like I have in trying to find something that actually works &amp; does what it says. I used it with a really wet mascara I found at Target -JK Mascara (Jemma Kidd).     I was watching an episode of Dr. Oz when I heard of liquid eyelash extenders. I was skeptical but my husband encouraged me to try this because he even knows the frustration I&#x27;ve had in not being able to find anything that works.</li>
    <li> this is the exact product I was looking for - the same one I had seen on Dr Oz - It works and you can use with your mascara(no matter what brand) will definitely tell others!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I went to a family reunion last month and had so many compliments on my lashes I must of gave your website information to twenty people. It&#x27;s quick and easy..love it</li>
    <li> Loved this product,  works great and looks fab. Would definitely recommend to someone else.  And alot cheaper than Younique,  although I have them both.  It works just the same. Just sure sure have a mirror and look down when using this product or you&#x27;ll be uncomfortable with fibers in your eye.</li>
    <li> I was not overly happy about the outcome of using this. It does seem that at first, the lashes will stick to your wet eyelashes and make them seem a bit fuller, not longer. After a couple of hours, most of them fell off and were laying on my cheeks. I am constantly paranoid and have to check in the mirror to make sure I don&#x27;t have lashes laying all over my face. I haven&#x27;t used them except for a couple of times since I bought them and I won&#x27;t buy them again either.</li>
    <li> Initially I had purchesed this from a cosmotologist at my hair dresser&#x27;s salon.  I loved it, but paid $40 for it.  I decided to research on line when I used it up and found it on Amazon.  Even though I have allergies and wear contacts, the product does not bother me at all.  Follow the instructions and you will be amazed at how thick your eyelashes look...Everyone comments on them.  The only down side is toward the end of the bottle, the hairs have a tendency to clump.  You can attempt to clean the brush with an old toothbrush or buy another bottle as you are almost finished anyway.[[ASIN:B001H0YT5Y DivaDerme Lash Extender with Brush - Black]]</li>
    <li> This product performs exactly as described.  Follow the instructions to get the hang of application.  It is easy and works.  I was concerned that \\&quot;crumbs\\&quot; would flake off over the course of the day and be irritating in my eyes. This has not happened.  The lashes look natural.  I am happy with this product and will buy it again.  I use it with my regular drugstore mascara and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I love my liquid lashes.  Even though I had to get use to the application, I finally got it down and it works great.I had used another form of the DivaDerme liquid lashes and the application was easier.  However, this product has more dramatic results.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This will be short, hmph, just like my lashes.  Con: It&#x27;s very dusty when applying; Must be applied more then once to get a little length; It does flak during wear; Clumpy not necessarily lengthy, takes practice.  Pro: works better then mascara alone.</li>
    <li> The idea is great, but the product was practically dusty the way it left little fibers on my face (they don&#x27;t brush away as easily as you might think)and flaked from my eyelashes.  I ended up trying to apply it while looking in a hand mirror that I had laid on the counter - still flaked but at least no fibers on my face!  I read the reviews before buying and they cover the entire range of stars - maybe the product goes bad quickly and some people got a \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; extender??  I have no clue really, but my allergy/water-prone eyes can&#x27;t handle the fuzz so I&#x27;m giving it a two.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because i am horrible at applying fake eyelashes. After reading reviews I was skeptical but took a chance. When it came i opened it and checked it and felt so discouraged.. It looked like a mess and like it wouldnt work at all. But i gave it a shot and i am shocked how good my lashes looked!! I do curl my natural eye lashes BEFORE i used this product, and you do have to use really wet mascara for it to work good! but if I could give this product 10 stars i would! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> its okay. I&#x27;m not a fan of how hard it can be to remove them from your lashes. but it&#x27;s ok for the price i paid</li>
    <li> It does lengthen but ends of lashes don&#x27;t look natural. I may not be using it correctly so when I change mascara I will try again</li>
    <li> I like the product but it is a little tough to wear with contact lenses. There are little fibers that float around and can get stuck on your contacts and that can be uncomfortable. Just be sure to use enough mascara first to really wet your lashes and really careful to tap or shake the excess off the brush before applying and use a magnifying mirror while applying so you can see what&#x27;s going on.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive because of the reviews, but wanted to try it because I can never get actual false lashes to stay put.  I have Suffalupagus lashes already, but wanted some more volume and drama...just because?  Anyway...this stuff adds more volume/ thickness to my lashes and while very subtle, adds the appearance of more length.  I did have an issue with clumping at first, but gave it a few more tries and haven&#x27;t had an issue since.  If there ever is a random clump, i just take a lash comb and separate that area.  I found it did flake originally, but then I re-read the instructions and realized it&#x27;s because my regular mascara was more cake-y than creamy, which causes this stuff to get dry and crusty.  I have not had flaking issues since getting a new mascara.  My biggest concern was hearing about the little fibers getting into the eye.  I found that when I applied it while looking down, as the instructions state, I have not really had an issue with this.  I&#x27;d recommend brushing away excess from your face and cheeks before moving or looking up, though, so you don&#x27;t blow anything into the eye.  I&#x27;ll probably get more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews I was excited about this product, which very quickly turned into confusion at first I thought maybe I wasnt using it right but after reading it looks like I was, what is in this tube looks similar to what i find in the sink when my boyfirend is done shaving tiny black man hairs, when I tried to apply them after getting ten tiny hairs in my eyeball I cleared them away only to find 100 tiny hairs on my face that are not easliy removed funny because they didnt stick to my eyelashes but they wouldnt come off my face I looked like I was sprouting facial hair... Its been two days and Im still finding tiny black hairs on my face...</li>
    <li> Wow! I was skeptical at first, mainly because of the price, but what it does is worth twice the price.  This really does what it says.  One coat instantly doubled my lashes in volume.  I used my own mascara.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love it. Gives extra lashes, but this product is for trained hand. You can make big mess on your face with these little lashes. I am makeup artist so it&#x27;s nothing new for me, but I think it&#x27;s not easy for regular customers. Try it</li>
    <li> These are the best eyelash fibers I have ever used. Maybe because they are black they seem to make my lashes much longer and thicker.</li>
    <li> Very nice! Easy to apply and take off. adds nice volume and length. easy to control how much. buildable and lasts. the fall out is a little difficult to keep track of sometimes.</li>
    <li> DivaDerme Lash Extender is the best mascara you will ever purchase! This mascara is crazy good, it coats your lashes with all these fibers and makes them so long and thick it is amazing. Make sure you tap the excess off first before applying, so you don&#x27;t get it into your eyes.</li>
    <li> I want to first thank everyone who gave such amazing reviews, it helped me pick the right product so thank you. I thought I&#x27;d review this as easily as possible for those who were like me, trying to find a simple direction for longer lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Application is as follows: Mascara. Divaderme. Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure mascara is wet, I only did one eye at a time to ensure this, then apply divaderme, then mascara again. Oh and apply to tips from middle of lashes to outer lashes and it looks more real. Good luck! It&#x27;s really easy and you shouldn&#x27;t get the flakes or fibers on your face if you just tap a few times before application.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my lashes look like I am wearing falsies. The only bad thing is the little fibers are messy and it never fails every time I use it I get at least one piece in my eye and it takes me all day to get it out.</li>
    <li> Omg. I never tried fake lashes but have used mascara with fibers in it and they work fine but this is amazing. I watched an interview on TV with a NJ makeup artist and she showed this so I gave it a try. All I can say is Amazing, you will love it! Just make sure you tap off the brush a bit before applying and apply halfway on lash from middle out to ends. take your time so you don&#x27;t make a mess or get in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Please make sure to reapply mascara to seal the lashes on.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for the best mascara to make my skimmpy lashes look fuller, and&lt;br /&gt;longer. I have tried and bought every brand make or model. I have used fake lashes,&lt;br /&gt;or individual lashes to try to get back what I once had. Then I came across this&lt;br /&gt;DivaDerme, what the heck I tried everything else, so why not. I read the reviews, went to youtube watched the video&#x27;s and then finally ordered it from my favorite place Amazon! After reading the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for what I thought was going to be a messy process. NOT SO! if you apply it properly it is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Youtube shows you how you MUST use your mascara first then the DivaDerme then mascara again to seal the tiny fibers. Wow! I couldn&#x27;t believe how well and beautiful it instantly gave me gorgeous lashes. I repeated the application twice&lt;br /&gt;since my lashes on my right side are almost non-exsistant and the lashes on my left&lt;br /&gt;side still had some length to them well the DivaDerme evened them out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does take a few minutes longer then just mascara alone but the result is well worth it. As far as mess it was nothing, any excess fibers came right off with&lt;br /&gt;a swipe of tissue or my makeup brush. They look so natural no one would think you&lt;br /&gt;had anything but mascara on. I am sold on this wonderful DivaDerme hook line and sinker for as long as they keep making it. (don&#x27;t you just hate when they discontinue your favorite makeup tool?) That is my biggest gripes of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that is considering useing DivaDerme, go for it apply it properly and you will have a new favorite thing in your makeup case.</li>
    <li> It is great when u mx it up with ur own maskara it will give u a great result !!!! Take it</li>
    <li> I have been using DivaDerme for about a month now. I really like it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is how the fibers fall and end up all over my face.</li>
    <li> It is very messy, but the overall concept is good...just not if you have curly lashes.  Really have to be an expert to use this stuff, but I will keep and maybe give it another Go before I toss it out.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time...love it... great price from Amazon ... very impressed a;so with quick delivery... keep up the great work!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I  decided to try this product because I failed at trying to put false eyelashes on myself and the one time I paid to have my lashes done at a salon, the lashes fell off in 2 days! Well, after following the easy directions on how to apply the lash extender my lashes looked great. They look as good as a pair of false lashes and more natural!!!  Honestly, I thought this product would just make my lashes alittle thicker but no.......they actually extend your lashes to the point that they are long and thick.  This is the best kept secret and eyelash beauty.  No more glue for me. I just ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
    <li> WHAT IS IN THE PICTURE IS A BRUSH AND A MASCARA AND WHAT I RECIEVED IS A BOTTLE FULL OF LASHES.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for every women! Cheap and very useful to have big lash! I will buy it again and again!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful, but you have to follow the directions or you will have issues. you will need a very wet mascara and do one eye at a time. Put the mascara on first the look down and bend over a little to put on the fiber if you dont it will get into your eye, then use the mascara again on the same eye. then go to the next eye. If you want them thicker and longer do it a gain. after you are done use a brush to brush away the loose fiber if you don&#x27;t it will fall down later that day may go into your eyes or face on your cheeks. I have found it best to use warm water to take it off...I have always taken mine off in the shower. i let the water run on my face then close my eye and place the wash cloth one the eye lashes and open my eyes leaving the fiber on the wash clothe or pinch my eye lashes between the was clothe and gently pull away. it will look smudged but when the water hit it you will see it is like small tubes from each eye lash. Wonderful product but it will take a few tries to get it right at least for me it did. Now i am a professional. if you have issues don&#x27;t give up it will take a few tries to be good at it be once you do...you will love this product.  I hope this help you out.</li>
    <li> Tiny fibers fell in my eyes all day making my eyes irritated and red. Then due to the irritation, I kept rubbing at my eyes and rubbed all my eye makeup off. Not the look I was going for :( Will stick to Pure Fiber Lash Extension Mascara made by Kiss New York.</li>
    <li> I bought these as an alternative to a higher priced brand. They work fabulously and make my tiny lashes so lush! You do get fibers all over your face so I recommend getting the brush with it or maybe placing something under your eye while you apply them</li>
    <li> Quick shipping...good purchase</li>
    <li> I do NOT like this item. I have tried it several times. Each time, it just does NOT work well on my lashes. I read the instructions and went online to double check to see if I was using it properly. I was but this product just is not for me. Arrived in just a few days. Sorry but wont buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift. Everything looks and works as advertised. I would have heard back by now if there were any problems. They loved this gift!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my chiropractors office four years ago.  I had some difficulty using at first as it was &#x27;flaky&#x27; and the &#x27;dust&#x27; would get on my face...but you learn to apply after a few tries and &#x27;vola!!&#x27; Lashes!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for those who love falsies but don&#x27;t have the time to apply them before work.&lt;br /&gt;I never noticed it flaking during the day or it causing eye irritation.  But this is my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at buying Younique mascara and I believe this is part of the foundation of their product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll save my $$ and continue with this fiber filler.</li>
    <li> I liked the effect but as time goes by, the fibers start to fall off your lashes. It made me look like I had dark circles ! Apply only before an event, and hope it&#x27;s not too long or makes you sweat...</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really does deliver.  I have tried soooo many items that promise these results, but so far this is the only one I have found that comes close.  I will continue to re-order again.</li>
    <li> The description of this sounded wonderful.  Fuller, thicker lashes...etc...  With my eyelashes, this product didn&#x27;t work.  Followed  directions ( both product and Amazon reviews ) and applied while mascara was freshly applied.  Instead of, \\&quot;Come Hither\\&quot; lashes, I got, \\&quot;Slept with make-up on\\&quot;, mascara.  Thick, clumpy and stubby lashes.  Plus the fibers fell on my cheeks, but the little brush ( included ) came in handy,  along with the directions of usage for the brush.  ( brush away baby, cause it falls on your cheeks! ) Would Not by again.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my go-to lash extending product. I have bought several products but this one is the easiest to use (for me). I have very little to-no fall out. The fibers are black (YES) so there is no fading after hours of wear. This is the one draw-back that I discovered with a namebrand cosmetic company lash extender set.</li>
    <li> My lashes look a lot thicker with the fibers.  I bought another bottle of the fibers and use it with my regular mascara.</li>
    <li> Have used others so I will say they just ok.</li>
    <li> I would have loved to try this product but unfortunately the product which arrived did not match the picture or the description.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet ,the fiber is always getting on my face :(</li>
    <li> If you have any history in makeup and know what lash fibers are you will love this product &#x3D;0) I do</li>
    <li> I have had this product before and find that it works very well as long as it is used with a wetter mascara.  The fibers need something to adhere to.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed in the quality of the broom. I will look for a better and stronger model next time</li>
    <li> This lash extender works!!!! I love it. It does what it claims to do. I am buying to fill Christmas stockings. Great item, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to get the fibers onto my lashes in a natural looking way. The next day I decided this is easily my new favorite beauty product. I have short, thin lashes and am always looking for inexpensive ways to make them look longer and fuller. For the price, this product is really great. They stay on all day even when I use my cheap, basic maybelline mascara. I probably use more than the average person would, but a month later it doesn&#x27;t seem like I have made much of a dent in the bottle. I wear it most days and have gotten many compliments. If you are lucky enough to already have great eyelashes, these will probably look quite fake, so you would only use them when you are looking to make a dramatic statement. I plan on buying again when mine runs out. It arrived promplty and was well packaged. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Not exactly inpressed. Never used lash extenders before, always just use a few coats of mascara. This product looked clumpy and didnt give the long butterfly lash look it portrays. Wont purchase again</li>
    <li> But a lot of work.  To me the fibers are somewhat difficult to get on the brush.  As a blonde with light colored lashes, this does make them look longer and stand out. Overall, pleased.</li>
    <li> delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> I, like so many others, figured it can&#x27;t &#x27;hurt&#x27; to try, &amp; since Dr. Oz, an actual &#x27;Dr&#x27;, mentioned it, what&#x27;s there to lose?  When mine came, since I didn&#x27;t know that it is sent unsealed, I was afraid to use it yet.  I did alot of reading &amp; research, &amp; found that it comes that way.  Anyway, I did try it yesterday, &amp; was so totally amazed at how gorgeous my lashes looked.  Real looking, too. I&#x27;m 52yrs old, &amp; my lashes have really thinned out, plus having blond lashes makes them even harder to see.  This is gorgeous, &amp; it seems that the less I mess with this, the less mess I have.  Like they say, just the tips of the middle to outer lashes, in between any mascara lash coat, &amp; it&#x27;s gorgeous.  Haven&#x27;t had to even use the brush to clean anything up yet, at all.  Honestly can&#x27;t imagine NOT having this, forever......Thanks, Dr. Oz, keep it coming!</li>
    <li> This product totally works! It is not as hard to use as reported. If you&#x27;re use to wearing mascara you&#x27;ll have no problem. You&#x27;ll get so carried away with the length &amp; fullness you might forget to put on the last coat of mascara to seal it. Don&#x27;t forget. Do one eye at a time to see the difference and so your mascara won&#x27;t dry before you get a chance to put on the DivaDerm. You will love this product. Try putting it on with a clear mascara for a lighter daily look.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff from my waxer. It appeared to work when I tried it out in her salon. I really dpn&#x27;t wear mascara so it was a waste of $20 for me, plus when I took it home and used it 1x - it didn&#x27;t appear to do anything more than what normal mascara does after 2 coats. Not to mention the little fibers tend to get into your eyes even if you do apply them while leaning forward</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boss&#x27; wife.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> Works great for me because I have such short eyelashes. They are loose fibers so expect some to fall off but not horribly.  There really is no wrong way of doing it but they can clump up if you don&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
    <li> There was no brush with this package so I ended up getting a duplicate product and returned this order.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 star because it does make your eyelashes look thicker; however, the fibers can get in your eyes so you have to be careful when applying.  I wear contacts so it was a little tricky.  I would not wear it every day but save it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase and will buy more in the future. I just can&#x27;t live without it!.I have next to nothing lashes and got tired of putting fake lashes.It takes practice,a little messy but well worth it!</li>
    <li> Overrated. Even after mastering recommended technique, it really is no different than the mascara I use. Fibers fall onto face and doesn&#x27;t lengthen at all. One is supposed to use regular mascara first then apply. Which I did.  Looks clumpy. Wanted this to work. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> this product has it&#x27;s issues  flakes and darkens the lid - though largely a wonderful product , really helps accentuate lashes</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness I can&#x27;t tell you enough how amazing this product is!!! I work in a place where beauty is everything and I just want to say that so many people thought I was wearing false eyelashes or that I had eyelash extensions in!! Amazing right!? I am so so happy with this product and how it makes my eyelashes look beautiful, thick, and so long!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have this down yet but so far I&#x27;ve got it in my eyes and all over my face easily. It makes your eyes water and it&#x27;s difficult to sweep away. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth it. A good mascara does close to the same thing. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Clumpy makes eyelashes heavy and uncomfortable</li>
    <li> these work great. they made my eyelashes look longer and voluminous. will definitely buy again when i run out.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product, I thought wow this is great.  The second time my eyes began to get irritated and red. It took several days for them to return to normal.  They felt like they had sand in them which I associated with the fibers in the product.  Won&#x27;t use again and wasted $20.</li>
    <li> One of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve owned. Eyelashes are my obsession I wear false lashes whenever I go out but when I&#x27;m too lazy DivaDerme is quick and simple and my eyelashes almost double in length. One thing is that it can easily get into your eyes so make sure to tilt your head down during application. I use 2 coats xox love this product I&#x27;ve gotten it for all my girlfriends</li>
    <li> It makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer.&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on individual fake eyelashes (I usually put two individual eyelashes at the end of the eye) and now my whole eye looks better. I use a heavy mascara: Loreal Voluminous, which I think helps the tiny lashes to stick to my own lashes. I tried first with my very light mascara and it does not work very well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I have short straight lashes and this stuff works wonders. You do have to take your time applying it, but you can add as many coats as you want. It will last you a long time. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes if I apply carefully and I&#x27;ve had zero issues with it flaking off. I use Urban Decay&#x27;s Perversion mascara with it.</li>
    <li> Amazing lashes. The best product to let your lashes huge! Look like we are using fake lashes. It takes time to know how to apply correctly, but once learned.... Amazing</li>
    <li> happy with the product, shipping time and price of the product. Will definately reorder again when needed. highly recommend makes the eyes really pop!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS OK. FOUND THAT MY LIDS FELL HEAVY AND IT LOOKS KINDA CLUMPED/ MAYBE I WILL REVIEW THE TUTORIAL AGAIN</li>
    <li> The product is great It REALLY does work. I have just stopped using falsies and these are the perfect go to for that full look. It&#x27;s easy to take off and doesn&#x27;t fall off during the day. You can sleep it in it too. But won&#x27;t look as great as it did before.&lt;br /&gt;The seller has great customer communication. Quick and very nice and professional...So will def be ordering from them again!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this, it makes my lashes look so full and lush! I have used this product before and knew that I loved it, but I paid a much higher price, so I love it even more at this price!</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A JOKE!  THIS PRODUCT IS SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!  THIS STUFF IS HORRIBLE!  Even when you do it right it still looks bad!</li>
    <li> they mailed me no brush but that is ok. It is a good-quality product.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out considering I have sparse eyelashes. I went out and bought some mascara ahead of time. I followed the instructions strictly and the end result was that my lashes only looked as though I had on regular mascara. The fibers didn&#x27;t make a difference. I realize that this is my first time but I was kind of disappointed. Maybe it was the mascara because it wasn&#x27;t major name brand, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;But I will keep trying because I hate the look of heavy, clumpy eyelashes and I will go out and buy a name brand mascara this time.</li>
    <li> The fibers get all over your face and stick to you and make you look like chubaka! I would not recommend this to any of my friends. I would never buy it again. Instead, just use two coats of mascara.</li>
    <li> IMPORTANT UPDATE: I had to stop using this product after 2-yrs, as I got a nasty case of blepharitis, basically clogged oil &amp; tear ducts near the lash line, causing inflammation &amp; slight infection in the eye. The extenders clogged my ducts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took an entire year to clear up, using $$$ eye cream a pharmacist had to mix up special order &amp; painful twice/daily scrubbing of the eyelash area with baby shampoo &amp; a QTip (all dr&#x27;s instructions). My eyelids were red raw &amp; my eyeballs burned for 1-yr. It also significantly affected my vision (the reason I initially saw the dr) &amp; I couldn&#x27;t walk down stairs without sitting down, because I simply couldn&#x27;t see &amp; I couldn&#x27;t drive for 6-mos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I couldn&#x27;t wear any eye makeup at all for 1-yr now (I&#x27;m just getting back to 1 slight coat of mascara on the lash tips only) &amp; that still irritates my eyes a bit, so I&#x27;ve stopped &#x27;til I work up the nerve to try it again. Ironic, as the reason I began using them was to have darker, longer lashes &amp; I had to revert to naked eyes for 1-yr... I can&#x27;t tell you how distressing this has been, because I work in the beauty field &amp; have been simply bare faced all this time... partial makeup (like foundation &amp; lipstick only) just looks silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you do wear these extenders... ensure you don&#x27;t coat your lashes all the way back to the eyelid... use them on the tips or from the middle out. My eye specialist is sure it&#x27;s the extenders, which caused the clogging, but I did press the extenders all the way to my skin line... obviously not smart in hindsight. So, I still love them &amp; may try them again, but please be careful during use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Note: I left my initial review unedited below, because they surely do work. Just be careful. Because of my experience, I did downgrade my review from 5 to 2 stars... they should come with some sort of warning, because I&#x27;ve never had clogged pores with mascara coated all the way to my eyelid, so these small extenders do seem to have a problem clogging pores. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about extenders on a beauty message board. After researching, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try mainly as it&#x27;s made from basil, Vitamin E &amp; 4-5 ingredients I actually recognize... not a lot of chemicals it takes a pharmacology degree to decipher. I&#x27;ve used lash extending mascaras in the past with no success &amp; tossed them after a few uses... they would crumble &amp; flake getting into my eyes, seemed to straighten my lashes so they looked odd, are hard to remove with eye makeup remover &amp; turned my eyes red &amp; itchy after a few hrs... very unpleasant particularly when I wore contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the look of modest false lashes (not the obvious, 60s, Twiggy-look for daily wear), but don&#x27;t wish to learn how to apply them or take the time to do it for regular use. Naturally, my lashes are long &amp; fairly thick, but blondish so don&#x27;t stand out. What I love with these extenders is I look as if I&#x27;m wearing moderate false lashes, but without the bother of applying them! Additionally, they don&#x27;t flake or crumble or irritate my eyes. I honestly have to say, my lashes look 3-4 times as long &amp; thick! Really! To get that look in the past, I&#x27;d need to layer 4+ coats of multiple mascaras. It worked, but it was time consuming, expensive to buy multiple mascaras &amp; great care was needed to avoid clumps. On mornings when I didn&#x27;t have enough sleep, it took extra attention to avoid looking as if someone threw tarantulas on my eyes! Removal was a bear, too... imagine trying to take off 4-6 coats of thick mascara... I spent lots of $ on cotton balls &amp; pricey removers &amp; lots of time trying not to tug at sensitive under eye skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For usage, I apply a thick coat of mascara... Mac Haute &amp; Naughty works best so far for me ($19) as it&#x27;s wet &amp; thick, causing the extenders to stick... then immediately ROLL ON the extenders, wait for lashes to dry, then roll on a top coat of mascara. Be careful not to scrape the extenders off, so vertical brushing or rolling the brush is necessary for the top coat... this seems to be the main issue others have in applying them. It&#x27;s not hard, just hard to remember to roll the applicator &amp; mascara, not stoke as we normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extenders look similar to vacuum cleaner dust. Some fragments may stray onto the cheek, but honestly, I&#x27;m only finding that as my 1st bottle is over 6-mos old &amp; perhaps the air has changed the quality of the product so they&#x27;ve become more flaky. It did take 2-3 tries before I got the hang of applying them. Now, I NEVER go out without them &amp; because my lashes are so nicely emphasized once the extenders are applied, I often then just apply lipstick &amp; nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update after using for 1-yr **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still ADORE this product?! I&#x27;ve just purchased a 4th bottle (although I&#x27;ve only used 2... they seem to last 6-mos for me) &amp; will continue to use this product indefinitely. Lastly, for those of you with allergies, I&#x27;m allergic to so many products, it&#x27;s easier for me to tell you what I can use than what I can&#x27;t. I have had no issues whatsoever with DivaDerme in 1-yr&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did try their mascara for $8 (see my review) &amp; didn&#x27;t like it at all. I&#x27;m disappointed as I thought it would be thicker &amp; wetter, allowing the extenders to stick. In my experience, not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the extenders if you haven&#x27;t used them before. I think you&#x27;ll love the results! The only &#x27;problem&#x27; is I feel naked without them. I put on 2 coats of mascara last weekend to go shopping... didn&#x27;t like the skimpy eyelash look, so I took an extra 30-seconds to use the extenders, then a top coat of mascara to get my usual full lash look. I love these extenders!for the top coat... this seems to be the main issue others have in applying them.

    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have really short lashes that need a lot of help.  I hate wearing falsies because they are usually so obvious.  I saw this stuff, and it had great reviews and a great price.  It takes a few times to get the hang of it, but once you do, even the shortest thinnest lashes look NATURALLY long, thick, and gorgeous.  I only need a couple coats of mascara, where used to pile it on to get the thick lashes I like.  Also, a little goes a really long way.  It only takes a few of the fibers to give your lashes oomph, so I predict that this little tube will last a long time and save me lots of money on mascara.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few years ago and ordered again this month. I like the product, so do my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;If you apply one eye at a time with your face down looking into a mirror there is limited amount of dust etc. Applying while your mascara is wet is the key, if you stop to read directions and your mascara dries it will not look natural and will have clumps. We did use waterproof mascara , not sure it that makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis. Definetly makes my lashes longer and thicker!!! LOVE IT!! Definetly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I was not born with super long lashes, so like to find a product that give me length and thickness.  This product is a bit cumbersome to use for me.  I have tried a few times, but eventually gave up.  I use a mascara by Lancome call, Doll Lashes and that gives me what I am looking for.</li>
    <li> This product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used when it comes to lengthening my lashes. It makes a significant difference in the way my eyes look with long, dark, thick lashes.  They stay on all day but come off easy when you go to remove them.  The fibers don&#x27;t collect under my eyes throughout the day like I was afraid they might.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  Only negatives are that the little fibers are loose and so I have a little layer of them all over my bathroom sink.  Easy fix though.</li>
    <li> i have very short lashes and this helps to give my eyes that diva-licious look lol  i use it every day</li>
    <li> I have to say that the fibers add length and fullness to my lashes. I agree with another that if you use mascara daily, the procedure is simple and my lashes look great. I will be ordering this from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It definitely adds length. If you&#x27;re looking to make your lashes thicker this may not do what you want it to. But it makes them look longer and comes with a really convenient brush to wipe away any fibers left behind under your eyes.</li>
    <li> This is not the first product I have purchased like this, but there are a lot of other products that get the same results for less, mess and trouble.  It doesn&#x27;t work all that great.</li>
    <li> I really love it!! My lashes are barely there, but when I use my mascara with DivaDerme Lash Extender...my eyes POP &amp; they look sexy n natural. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> In a word: legendary!&lt;br /&gt;You can use the cheapest mascara possible with this stuff and boy does it work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my eyes lasered so they are duper sensitive but this is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Got 3 for £19.99 on Groupon!</li>
    <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your money! I followed the directions to the T! It doesn&#x27;t work! I bought younique and it works great!</li>
    <li> Destroyed my eyelashes after a month or so of occasional use.</li>
    <li> I think some of the users who gave this product a poor rating, must not have been using it properly. Love it! Follow the directions and it&#x27;s like fake lashes without the hassle of applying them!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try as I have very short lashes.  I really disliked this product as when I used the mascara wand, all the little &#x27;bits&#x27; fell on my face - it was so messy.  I ended up throwing out the bottle after about 5 times of trying to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but messy to apply and not worth the bother really. It did&#x27;nt do much once It was on, I would just stick to mascara and save your money.</li>
    <li> I rate this okay for performance.  It does add length, but not much.  A good mascara can do the same or better</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It is just what I was seeking and works just as I was hoping it would.  Have also been able to sleep with it for at least 2 nights. Will certainly recommend and recorder.</li>
    <li> FIBERS GO EVER WHERE! BUT IT DOES WORK</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works the best with a wet mascara , not a  dry one. My lashes look indescribably long, no words can explain. It took me a couple of times getting it down to a science, I am really happy I ordered diva derme lash extender ... I love long lashes!</li>
    <li> I actually does make my lashes look fuller and thicker. Just use it lightly. One coat is enough or it will clump.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well. I have not had trouble with any shedding.  Mine did not have a brush for some reason.</li>
    <li> Makes my lashes look fake every time! The fibers make my eyelashes so long I don&#x27;t need to use fake eyelashes! Just buy the right mascara and add the fibers. The more layers I add the longer and thicker they get! This is my 3rd time purchasing this and love it</li>
    <li> For longer lashes, there is no need to look any further.  DivaDerme gives me the volume I want for my lashes, and it is easy to remove.</li>
    <li> This really does add to your lashes.  I dont use it every day but its nice for a special occasion or a night out.  It takes some practice to apply it evenly but it does stay put until you wash it off as long as you follow directions.  I dont like false eye lashes and this is a really nice alternative.</li>
    <li> once I get the hang of it I like the way my eyelashes look</li>
    <li> I used to use another brand of fibers that were spectacular, but I can no longer find them for sale. I tried these and although they aren&#x27;t as nice as the ones I used to use, they work. My only complaints are that you can&#x27;t get enough with one swipe of the brush, so you have to dip the brush into the jar at least twice to cover all of the lashes. They are a bit clumpier, so depending on your mascara wand, you may also need to comb your lashes. The finished effect is fabulous and they stay on all day! I have even slept in them a couple of times (I know...) but my lashes look great in the morning. Easy to come off with makeup remover, but be gentle or you&#x27;ll pull lashes out.</li>
    <li> I applied as instructed and noticed very little difference in my lashes, most of the product fell beneath my eyes.  And what did stay on at the time was under my eyes within a couple of hours later.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference and it was difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Wow this thing is amazing!  It makes my lashes look so long.  The Trick is to tilt your head down when you are applying it on the tips of your lashes.</li>
    <li> After having eye lash extensions for over 3 years my real lashes become very damaged- They have never been the same as they look short and not as many. I have had the extensions off for well over a year. I have been searching for a product whether it was an eye lash grower that took time to show results...a mascara...anything. After doing some research I bought this in conjunction with 2 other products -Lipocils eye lash conditioner and NYX Doll Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;When I use Divaderme Lash Extender with the mascara, it produced such positive results I was shocked. If you have a good mascara and apply this while mascara is wet...it is like applying little lashes(little fibers) that make the eyelash seems not only fuller but a bit longer. It does do what it says it will do and I recommend this product. You do have to be somewhat careful when applying...The tiny fibers can go in your eye-but if your careful it should be fine. Even if they do it doesn&#x27;t hurt or cause problems-I am curious to see how long the bottle lasts me. Great product so far!!!</li>
    <li> Bottle was empty after just a few uses</li>
    <li> I like the concept of this product, but I did not find it practical.  Diva derme&#x27;s fibers can be very messy and if you have thin, very short lashes-this item is not for you.  I find that after several coats of diva derme, lashes look clumpy and very weighed down. It takes lots of practice to achieve the long, curly lash that everyone likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube will last quite a long time which is why I gave it three stars, but in my experience I think investing in some good mascara and falsies is better.</li>
    <li> I love lashes sometimes I can get it with mascara, but the lash extender does the job everytime</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  I purchased a bottle for my mom and she liked it so I tried it and bought one for me.  Easy to apply and dust off the fly aways.  No issue there.  Mom says not to wear it in the rain.  I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.  I have great lashes and I use this when I have a few extra minutes to glam up.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed to</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of fall out and make my lashes unpleasantly clumpy</li>
    <li> I ordered DivaDerme Lash Extender about a month ago &amp; I am in complete Love with this product! I am a lash girl, I have been using Latasie for over a year; which by the way is amazing! Before DivaDerme I used Dream Lash &amp; it was a mess, very cheap bottom of the barrel fiber material that would clump my lashes rather than extend; it really should be called Nightmare Lash. So, I was very interested in finding good quality lash fibers; which lead me to seach the wonderful AMAZON.com where I discovered this amazing beauty product &amp; honestly I chose DivaDerme because the price was right &amp; it does come in a pretty lil package that includes a clean up brush. I have been using it almost every day &amp; my lashes are so very pretty, thich &amp; long, people frequentley ask if i&#x27;m wearing falsies or if I have Lash extenstions, even my mother asked about my Doll Lashes, but this is a combo of the Latise, DivaDerme lash extender &amp; my favorite mascara &#x27;Two Faced&#x27; Size Queen. The bottle the fibers is rather large &amp; I assume will last me at least 6+ months, &amp; like I said i&#x27;m using this stuff practically everyday. I have absolutely zero complaints about this product &amp; will most defintley be purchasing another bottle when needed. If you are looking to enchance your Lashes without the hassle of having to put on falsies, I would recommend this product, the quality &amp; price are unbeatable, I must say that Diva Derme Lash Extender is one of my top beauty must haves!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I think the bad reviews are due to user error. Your mascara MUST be very wet for the fibers to stick to your lashes. I use a nourishing lash serum, then QUICKLY apply several coats of mascara, then VERY QUICKLY apply several sweeps of this product. After a few seconds, I then apply another coat or two of mascara. They stick great if you work fast and make sure your lashes are wet enough for the dry little fibers to stick. I never end up with any on my cheeks.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  However, the seller, AtoZ Shop, does not include the brush that is shown in the picture and will not answer my email.  Not a lot of extra money for the brush, but I did choose this seller because the brush was supposed to be included.  I do like the stuff, though, and it&#x27;s super easy to use, no shedding, no irritation.  I have ridiculously short, thin and straight lashes and I usually wear false lashes.  Believe it or not, I can actually skip those and use this.  I&#x27;m amazed.  I will buy again, but I will choose another seller next time.  If they would answer my inquiry about the brush and send me one, I would revise this.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  me and a few of my friends have tried it and it really works.  A little hard to use if you are in a hurry getting ready,  but otherwise very simple to use and really works to make your eyes &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;</li>
