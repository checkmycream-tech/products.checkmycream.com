      <li>This product is truly AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge Boots No 7 fan, I use allot of their products and they are all great and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice luminous sheen to your skin without being shiny.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand, but the lift and illuminate goes a step beyond the great job it does of lifting and gives you a nice healthy glow as well.</li>
      <li>I discovered it on a trip to London and was so thrilled when they started selling it at Target.</li>
      <li>It is so rich and makes your skin feel great.</li>
      <li>I love that it has SPF and it is unscented.</li>
      <li>My skin looks more shiny and healthier, with no breakouts.</li>
      <li>and my skin is BRIGHTER for sure and</li>

      <li>Plus this is way cheaper than Meaningful Beauty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Boots moisturizer for many years.</li>
      <li>so I need to add powder over my foundation to get a more matte finish.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and it is very light and non-greasy for daytime use, yet it does the job of keeping my face hydrated.</li>
      <li>The Boots Lift &amp; Luminate Day Cream helped with the fine lines around my mouth.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product if you want a moisturizer to use in the morning underneath other makeup.</li>

      <li>But I&#x27;ve tried most of the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;best creams on the market&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t see a big difference</li>
      <li>Product comparable to higher quality day creams.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin, especially those of us with aging skin.</li>
      <li>I have combo skin, Early 30&#x27;s with mild hormonal Acne and this has not broken me out at all!</li>
      <li>This was the first time I decided to spend a little more to get a better product, but it definitely wasn´t worth it for me.</li>
      <li>It does just as good if not better than the doctor recommended 180.00 creme I was using.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything possible on the market to get a good day cream which would combat dry and flaky skin without looking oily and goopy!  </li>
      <li>It moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this day cream.  </li>
      <li>It also makes my skin very shiny</li>
      <li>and I am ready to go.</li>
      <li>Have never used it before, but it seems to work the whole day.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much, if any difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older ...</li>
      <li>The No7 is highly recommended by Consumer Reports</li>
      <li>No cons and I highly recommend Boots No7.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>However,  when I began to store it upside down the dispenser worked fine.  </li>
      <li>I looked later in the afternoon and my wrinkles around my eyes and fine lines looked soft and I couldn&#x27;t believe I was looking at a younger me.</li>
      <li>and though I loved that product, it was getting where I&#x27;d have to reapply the day cream several times during the day due to my skin feeling dry.</li>
      <li>Plumps up the skin and gives the face a soft glow.</li>
      <li>It also works very well for removing makeup - a tiny bit on a q-tip underneath my eyes makes removing smudged eyeliner / shadow / mascara a breeze.</li>
      <li>My skin is still soft and hydrated at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  in my early 50&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I am 64 years old and this cream tightens and brightens as advertised.</li>
      <li>You also can&#x27;t beat the price for such a high quality product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely love this cream! In the last few years I&#x27;ve used very expensive day and night creams on my face. I actually prefer this above all the expensive ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It absorbs quickly and it is very light and non-greasy for daytime use, yet it does the job of keeping my face hydrated. You also can&#x27;t beat the price for such a high quality product. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Now use this (and their night creme) exclusively.  So tired of commercials for expensive anti-aging moisturizers using 20-year-olds as their models to show how those wrinkles and dark spots just disappear!  I&#x27;m in my mid-60&#x27;s and have used just about everything from Pond&#x27;s cream to many of those expensive brands in department stores and this does just as well if not better than any of them.  In fact, just about everything I use on my face is this brand.  I can tell a difference both on my skin as well as in my wallet.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I am 64 years old and this cream tightens and brightens as advertised. Plumps up the skin and gives the face a soft glow. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you want a moisturizer to use in the morning underneath other makeup. I love that it has SPF and it is unscented. I wish that it came in one of the pump bottles so I didn&#x27;t have to put my fingers into the container each time to use it. Sometimes instead I get a little bit out with a q-tip. It also works very well for removing makeup - a tiny bit on a q-tip underneath my eyes makes removing smudged eyeliner / shadow / mascara a breeze. The reason for four starts instead of five is that I have skin that can be somehow oily and dry at the same time, and sometimes this moisturizer feels a little too greasy / heavy to me. It also makes my skin very shiny so I need to add powder over my foundation to get a more matte finish.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  Have never used it before, but it seems to work the whole day.  My skin is still soft and hydrated at the end of the day.  I have used Creme de la Mer for years and this Boots 7 has not disappointed me, And it is a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  in my early 50&#x27;s and I absolutely  love this!  It&#x27;s so moisturizing without the greasy feel. I put it on in the morning and I don&#x27;t have to reapply, which I did with other products due to my face getting dry during the day. I used to buy Meaningful Beauty and though I loved that product, it was getting where I&#x27;d have to reapply the day cream several times during the day due to my skin feeling dry. Plus this is way cheaper than Meaningful Beauty. It firms, lifts and moisturizes  beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Boots moisturizer for many years. I discovered it on a trip to London and was so thrilled when they started selling it at Target. The No7 is highly recommended by Consumer Reports and so I switched to it when it came out. Sometimes Target is out of the Boots No7 products. Whenever that happens I can always depend on Amazon to &amp;#34;mind the gap.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I heard this was the best cream on the market. Yeah I&#x27;ve heard that before! But I&#x27;ve tried most of the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;best creams on the market&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t see a big difference so I keep looking. I&#x27;m not vain or anything. I just like to it when I&#x27;m told I have great skin. This IS the best cream on the market. I think it says it takes a couple weeks to see a change but the first time I used it, my skin felt wonderful and had a sheen like never before. I looked later in the afternoon and my wrinkles around my eyes and fine lines looked soft and I couldn&#x27;t believe I was looking at a younger me. Imagination you say? No, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and my neighbor, who sees me often said &amp;#34; You have the most beautiful skin. What are you doing?&amp;#34; Now that was when i thanked God for Boots No 7. I just ordered the night cream and eye cream. Why not? If the day cream gets that reaction and makes me happy, just think what the night cream and eye cream will do. OH and don&#x27;t forget the serum. I did and went back and ordered it. No cons and I highly recommend Boots No7. I&#x27;ll never use anything else on my face!.</li>
    <li> Super great value and excellent results.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin, especially those of us with aging skin.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, but the lift and illuminate goes a step beyond the great job it does of lifting and gives you a nice healthy glow as well. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I liked the feel of the product but after several days I broke out so had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of wrinkle creams, cheaper and more expensive than this product, but this is working the best for me of any!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this cream. I find it to be greasy and &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; feeling. I know other people like it, but it was a true disappointment. This was the first time I decided to spend a little more to get a better product, but it definitely wasn´t worth it for me. Too bad.</li>
    <li> One of the best creams I have used. I will keep using it. It is so rich and makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Boots Protect &amp; Perfect serum.  I didn&#x27;t see much, if any difference.  I also has trouble getting the last third out of the bottle .  However,  when I began to store it upside down the dispenser worked fine.  The Boots Lift &amp; Luminate Day Cream helped with the fine lines around my mouth.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Product comparable to higher quality day creams.  Planning to try another brand.</li>
    <li> I really like this day cream.  It&#x27;s thick, but not heavy.  It leaves a nice luminous sheen to your skin without being shiny.  It moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> My skin looks more shiny and healthier, with no breakouts. I bought the night cream to use, as well. This is the best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot !! I don&#x27;t notice any smell and hope this never gets discontinued, I&#x27;ll use it forever.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Boots No 7 fan, I use allot of their products and they are all great and this one is no exception. I have combo skin, Early 30&#x27;s with mild hormonal Acne and this has not broken me out at all! Does go on a little greasy but sinks in within a couple of minutes and I am ready to go. I have been using this cream for about two weeks and my skin is BRIGHTER for sure and all my redness has gone bye bye. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet so I can&#x27;t speak for that, but I do think this is a great day cream for anyone 25 plus that want&#x27;s to do some preventative measures. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything possible on the market to get a good day cream which would combat dry and flaky skin without looking oily and goopy!  Well, this is IT!!!  This product is truly AMAZING.  I&#x27;m older ...let&#x27;s say over 60... and this has finally put an end to my search of over 20 years!  Thank you BOOTS!!!!</li>
    <li> I waited to leave a review because I wanted to use the product a while. It does just as good if not better than the doctor recommended 180.00 creme I was using. It is a bit thicker and kind greasy but for a night creme that I leave on 24 hours its a great buy and product. The blotchyness is gone.</li>
