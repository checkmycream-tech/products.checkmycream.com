    <li> I have purchased this type of brush time and time again. Having children break or loose them has been a problem. This brush has a super heavy duty handle and it seems to be so sturdy. So far so good and guess what I am going to purchase at least a couple more to share with my sisters and friends.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this brush to replace an old brush of the exact same type after 8 years of use. They hold up well and are great for thick, generally unruly, and curly hair like mine! Definitely recommend it and will continue to buy this brush in the future.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush.  This helps evenly distribute my dry shampoo which I spray in lightly even on my clean hair (for extra body).  It helps make my hair look fuller.  And, brushing my hair with this brush feels like the most wonderful scalp massage in the world!</li>
    <li> Pretty &amp; effective! Would have given it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t have so many scratches on it.</li>
    <li> I looked around for quite a bit as I wasn&#x27;t sure which brush to buy and based on the rating system for this one I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over-all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality; not too small; great service/delivery; it doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair/wigs, and I love how it help to keep the curls. I too concur this is a good product for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Review has been brought to you by &#x27;Awakened1&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ** See all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
    <li> This brush stands up to my daughter&#x27;s curly bedhead with ease. I will be buying one for every bathroom!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and needed a new brush that was not 50.00!!! this is a great brush, its very low cost, brushes great for my long hair and I loved it so much I bought one more as a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot;.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to replace a larger and more expensive Conair that finally hit the ground one too many times. I&#x27;d buy the Spornette again. It&#x27;s comfortable on my scalp and does the trick for the 15 seconds a day that I dedicate to brushing my hair. Sure you can get a similar and less expensive brush at Target but you&#x27;re going to spend an hour of your time and gas money and you&#x27;ll have to see live people.</li>
    <li> I ordered the bigger Spornette a few weeks ago and wanted a smaller one for my purse...I love this..It is the perfect size and does the job...I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price!  Much better than anything you would buy at WalMart.  My wife absolutely loves this brush, and says she would buy another.</li>
    <li> The red balls fell off the bristles after two months of use leaving a mess all over the bathroom.  I&#x27;ve had spornette brushes before and never encountered this problem-very disappointed with this brush</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what is wrong with this brush but every time I try to use it my hair becomes endlessly tangled. Maybe I need to break it in... Or maybe it only works on short hair. Either way it was a waste of my money. I&#x27;ve chosen to use my old brush -- that has 1/3 of the bristles missing -- over using this one. Tangles</li>
    <li> I bought this and loved it, and then my mom stole it. There are a lot of brushes that look like the Spornette brush, but all brushes are not created equal. The amount of give on the back cushion really lets the brush contour and smush to your head, making for a very comfortable blow drying experience. After my mom took mine, I just went and got a Conair one and it feels really hard against my head and doesn&#x27;t have any give or conform to my head shape, so I&#x27;m ordering another one of these. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other brushes like I clearly did. Just buy this one and be set for life!</li>
    <li> Excellent Brush that does not rip out your hair.</li>
    <li> Does the job - doesn&#x27;t rip hair.</li>
    <li> The brush is very sturdy and easy on my sensitive hair, does not pull too much. A good item for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been styling and profiling for months now with this great brush; it gives volume to what little hair I have left!</li>

    <li> It was a great brush, we&#x27;ll made as far as the handle and back of the paddle go, but immediately after using it, the little plastic balls on the end of the bristles began falling off one by one, all over my floor. After about a week, they&#x27;d all fallen off and now i cant use it, as the bristles are sharp on the end and scratch my scalp. Wanted to love it. Just fell apart!</li>
    <li> This is a great paddle brush, nice and sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a good sturdy powerful paddle brush.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  The brushes have a wide paddle and slender handle.  The brush bristles are firm with rounded &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; tips that don&#x27;t rip through your hair.  Even though they are attractive wooden paddles, they are not heavy and awkward to use.  They clean up easily.</li>
    <li> A good brush to have!</li>
    <li> I broke it....don&#x27;t ask how</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It is all one piece, made of wood, and thus super strong!  I have waist length hair, super thick, and drive a convertible.  Not a great combination, but this brush handles it. No worries...</li>
