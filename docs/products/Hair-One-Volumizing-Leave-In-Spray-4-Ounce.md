      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Glad Amazon had it.</li>
      <li>I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it with a light hold mousse to give my hair more texture and volume.  </li>
      <li>The price of this product is very tempting, but I would much rather pay more money for a better product, like Wen Volumizing Spray.</li>
      <li>I have very soft, silky, shiny, healthy hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and baby fine.  </li>
      <li>I have very straight hair, no body.  </li>
      <li>Good product, but a little pricy for the amount you get.</li>

      <li>the first one lasted forever.</li>

      <li>I was delighted with the results on my fine thin hair.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it for hair that is thinning or just naturally baby</li>
      <li>I did follow the instructions completely.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To use, just spray on freshly shampooed wet hair, comb it through and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a nice hold, but just stiff sticky and dulls my hair.  </li>
      <li>Mine is fine and long, but I have a lot of it, and this product thickens it just enough to hold a brushed-out style all day and night without extra weight, or help hair ornaments &amp;#34;hang on&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>on straight hair that normally hangs flat &amp; lifeless, a substantial difference is obvious.  </li>
      <li>makes my thin hair look like it has more volume.</li>
      <li>but didn&#x27;t really do anything other than add a minty fragrence to my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I decided to give this Volumizing Leave-In Spray a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. After using Hair One Hair Cleanser/Conditioner as directed, I sprayed a little of this spray on the underside of my hair. I was delighted with the results on my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> this spray has a nice scent...but thats about it.  I thought it would add some volume to my hair like it describes but didn&#x27;t really do anything other than add a minty fragrence to my hair. I bought it because hair one is comparable to wen so I assumed that this would work like wens volumizing spray but did not. I was very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Product had leaked out so only half of the bottle was left when it got to me. I ended up throwing it out after 2 days because it didn&#x27;t work at all. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product several different times and haven&#x27;t received any results from it. I did follow the instructions completely.  I have long, baby fine hair and I&#x27;m thinking maybe the weight of my hair may be the reason I&#x27;m not getting volume from this product. I will also add that my hair is all one length with no layers.</li>
    <li> I really like this product it really works on my hair is product would recommend this product to others. I will be ordering this product again</li>
    <li> Good product! It does what it says. Very light on thin, baby fine hair! It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps with lift. Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply stopped carrying it so I looked online. Glad Amazon had it.</li>
    <li> Yk. Made my hair feel sticky...straw+like.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. this is my second bottle. the first one lasted forever. it does a good job of taming my cowlicks from sleeping without being heavy. makes my thin hair look like it has more volume.</li>
    <li> Great product feel&#x27;s good and does a good job, company shipped it fast</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and many of the volumizing sprays weigh it down more than fluff it up!  I really like this spray - not heavy or sticky. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this spray.  It gives body without stripping the shine.  Hair doesn&#x27;t feel stiff and sticky.  My hair is very soft and baby fine.  I use it with a light hold mousse to give my hair more texture and volume.  Works great!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  In fact, when I got to this review, I stopped, went back and ordered it again because I realized I was out of it. Very light in your hair.  Mine is fine and long, but I have a lot of it, and this product thickens it just enough to hold a brushed-out style all day and night without extra weight, or help hair ornaments &amp;#34;hang on&amp;#34;.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I found out my Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply no longer carries this. Love this product for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Good product, but a little pricy for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave 4 stars is that , when I use this spray my hair gets dirty sooner. The spray really gives my hair volume, it&#x27;s also easier to comb it.</li>
    <li> This is really great.  Not sticky or stiff, but just adds a little bounce and control without perfumes or residue</li>
    <li> My hair elicits compliments from strangers but it drives me crazy!  I have very soft, silky, shiny, healthy hair.  You&#x27;d think that would please me, however, you&#x27;d be wrong.  My hair lacks the slightest hint of volume or body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this spray on my wet hair, it drys with volume and feels luxurious.  I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on straight hair that normally hangs flat &amp; lifeless, a substantial difference is obvious.  Hair One Volumizing Leave in Spray is the answer to my prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Hair One there is no clouding of the shine, no difference in the silky feel, and my hair still won&#x27;t hold a curl but it has body and weight!  There is no residue or flaking and it doubles as a great conditioner/de-tangler.  Hair One brings my hair to life.  I highly recommend it for hair that is thinning or just naturally baby fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, just spray on freshly shampooed wet hair, comb it through and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried too many products and this is one of the few that didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products for years, but they can get rather pricy.  When I saw Hair One Volumizing Spray, I thought I would give it a try.  I have to say I was very disappointed in the product.  I had to use almost twice the amount of product, and even then, it didn&#x27;t even come close to giving me the effect I desired.  The price of this product is very tempting, but I would much rather pay more money for a better product, like Wen Volumizing Spray.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, good price.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair, no body.  A spritz of this volumizing leave in sprary holds a curl with my curling iron, I found nothing yet better to give me volumizing and the body needed to keep my hair from just laying flat to my head.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products. The Hair one not only gives me a lot of volume but helps hold my hair in place.</li>
    <li> This product is very strange in the fact that on my hair it acts like sugar water.  It doesn&#x27;t provide a nice hold, but just stiff sticky and dulls my hair.  I tried it once and didn&#x27;t like it.  Perhaps I need to go back and re-read the instructions and use once again.</li>
