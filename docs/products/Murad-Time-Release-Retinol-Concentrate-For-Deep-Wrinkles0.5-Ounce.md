      <li>easy.</li>
      <li>This brand is worth trying as it seems to be as good as any of the higher priced skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Of course</li>
      <li>Seems to  be fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I use twice daily and am really happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>I was given a free sample of this and after 4 days of use I could see a difference.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not totally disappointed</li>
      <li>, everyone is unique  </li>
      <li>and I have experienced absolutely NO results.</li>
      <li>can only go by my own experience with this product as early use shows a good result.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly and works well as advertised.</li>
      <li>This item arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>arrived quickly and as describe...</li>
      <li>All you need is about a pea size for your whole face, I use my index and middle finger on both hands and I evenly dot the product on my cheeks, forehead, nose and chin to get a good distribution.</li>
      <li>May retry to be sure after blemishes clear</li>
      <li>I can see a noticeable reduction in the smile lines around my nose and mouth.  </li>
      <li>usually love Murad products, but this is like most other products that claim results but do not materialize.</li>
      <li>Also the deep frown lines at the top of my nose.  </li>
      <li>but does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>I had a facial recently and they only use Murad products, which are great !!!  </li>
      <li>I am on my first tube of the Murad Age Reform Time Release Concentrate and my one wrinkle is almost invisible.  </li>
      <li>I will probably purchase this product one more time before making my final decision.</li>
      <li>and it really works on the smile lines.</li>
      <li>This product really does not work.  </li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>Funny~~~the free samples lasted 2 weeks at 0.125 fluid oz.  </li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t complain about anything really.</li>
      <li>-- this stuff really works -- I can see the difference and so much cheaper to purchase thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>fast.</li>
      <li>- my real age is 56</li>
      <li>Fast service also.</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work, but nope.  </li>
      <li>I was using ROC for deep wrinkles, and had been using it for awhile with out any significant results.</li>
      <li>Generally, I like Murad products as I have used the Age Reform line for several years and am satisfied with what it does.</li>
      <li>I noticed the wrinkles appeared filled in upon application, however, I didn&#x27;t see the long term reduction I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I use Murad but had not used this particular product.</li>
      <li>so I will highly recommend this Product</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to determine if it is worthwhile.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a few years and am always pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>Before buying read reviews a lot more positive than negative.  </li>
      <li>Item did not arrive new, unopened.  </li>
      <li>Being consistent is the key.</li>
      <li>Wow! 1/3 of the price that I paid at my salon - I have been using for 6 weeks now and see the difference in my marionette lines.</li>
      <li>so far it seems to be working</li>
      <li>At my age and with my sensitive skin, anything that shows improvement is a miracle.  </li>
      <li>This product really does make a difference in reducing the look of deep wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial product that actually does what it said it would do.</li>
      <li>All the others have warnings on their packaging pointing to a possible redness and irritation, because of the presence and high concentration of retinol.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a little difference and it does seem to help fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>Its a little hard to squeeze out, but its better that way because if you use too much it can irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>Not really seeing much difference for the price of this product.</li>
      <li>No other product has reduced the deep forehead lines I have this well!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After a few weeks of use it seems to help the deeper folds around the chin, lip area.&lt;br /&gt;It help the deeper lines and I am happy thus far with this product.  To me it seems to work as good as Botox.  This brand is worth trying as it seems to be as good as any of the higher priced skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, everyone is unique  therefore, it may not work on others.  However, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Only a small amount is necessary to apply as I believe it is concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;I can only go by my own experience with this product as early use shows a good result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a few weeks, my face is not bad, will need to see what it is like in another 3 weeks, the postage is dearer than the product which makes it very expensive.</li>
    <li> Love it! Ordered more so when my first tube is gone I will have more on hand !!!!! I just cant say enough good things about this product!!!!!!!!!! I am on my 4th tube now I think and I have people asking me what my secret is all the time - my real age is 56 and I look  40 ish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was just what I needed, no needles, no doc. apts. and the price is VERY reasonable!!!!!!! If you need a younger looking you to look at in the mirror every morning then please, please try a tube ! You will be glad you did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was using ROC for deep wrinkles, and had been using it for awhile with out any significant results. I saw this product in a magazine. I already used murad skin care and loved it,so I decided to try it. I love this product! The moment I used it, it actually looked like I had used an eraser on the parenthesis,\\&quot; around my mouth! The other wrinkles on my forehead have decreased also. I really am glad that I tried this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to determine if it is worthwhile.  It has not irritated my skin which was an initial concern of mine.  I will probably purchase this product one more time before making my final decision.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample of this and after 4 days of use I could see a difference. As a former smoker I had deep wrinkles above my upper and lower lips. I have used daily for 2 months and my friends are telling me the wrinkles are reduced by at least 50%.</li>
    <li> I had this one wrinkle on my forehead that I couldn&#x27;t get rid off.  I tried many products without any results.  I am on my first tube of the Murad Age Reform Time Release Concentrate and my one wrinkle is almost invisible.  I am happy and will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> It helped to smooth my skin but as far as hiding lines, I was not impressed with the results of this product!</li>
    <li> Not for me I guess.  I love Murad eye cream but was dissapointed with this product.  Oh well, I had to try it.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be wonderful.  I have only used it for a couple of weeks and have seen a slight difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the part this was purchased from was on time and no damages to the package, would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly.  Not very noticeable results.  But I am still using it</li>
    <li> I have been asked for my I.D. and I am 66 years of age! I only wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all, a waste of money and wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Really disappointed with Murad now.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!! Use it twice a day. It has made a really big difference in the deep lines at the mouth, enough that I am no longer considering any type of procedure. Their line, alone with Elemis from Britain, have made a big difference in my skin!!! Very pleased. I have been using for about a year now.</li>
    <li> Fills in deep wrinkles. Doesn&#x27;t make them disappear but deffinaty reduces their appearance. Best product I have tried so far .</li>
    <li> I like his products I just started using this product to soon to make a comment on it but I do like it so far it seems to be working I do notice some change TY</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife and it&#x27;s great for smooth wrinkles .She&#x27;s very pleased w/ how it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and am always pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few days and swear I already see results!  No other product has reduced the deep forehead lines I have this well!  I will be purchasing this forever!</li>
    <li> easy. fast. as described. no issues</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be any better than a store brand product that you can buy at a drug store.</li>
    <li> Item did not arrive new, unopened.  The box was missing with the murad holographic seal and expiration date. Attempting to return the item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and have expression lines. And this has helped alot. I&#x27;ve noticed over the years of using retinol creams as long as you use them daily they work. When you stop using them they stop working. Being consistent is the key.</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this item.  I use it every day.  People in my house didn&#x27;t know I was using anything, and comment how good my face looked.  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this last year and was about to throw it away, when a little voice said, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t!&amp;#34;  So I tried it this week, and . . . it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 51 and it really works on the smile lines.</li>
    <li> At my age and with my sensitive skin, anything that shows improvement is a miracle.  I have smoother skin and better tone.</li>
    <li> Too harsh for my skin</li>
    <li> I love this cream and use it every day to fill in wrinkles and creases on my face before applying makeup.</li>
    <li> This is not a good product. The tube they sent isn&#x27;t even the correct packaging. Do not buy it</li>
    <li> This product should have 10 stars because in just 2 days of use, this product has nearly banished the ill expression line across my forehead. Plusss those parenthesis around my mouth are plumped up and I know with continued use I&#x27;ll have great results, this is a product worth purchasing. This product is creamy, but it is lightweight and it drys immediately after you rub it into your skin. All you need is about a pea size for your whole face, I use my index and middle finger on both hands and I evenly dot the product on my cheeks, forehead, nose and chin to get a good distribution. I have not experienced any break outs and the product has not burned my skin, I have oily skin and it does not seem to irritate my oil glands.</li>
    <li> Great product that does as promised in record time! easy on sensitive skin and very effective..Good stuff worth the money!</li>
    <li> Returned due to breaking out with welps after using this product line. Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and works well as advertised. Couldn&#x27;t complain about anything really. Its a little hard to squeeze out, but its better that way because if you use too much it can irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this concentrate for over 6 weeks, twice daily and I have experienced absolutely NO results. Generally, I like Murad products as I have used the Age Reform line for several years and am satisfied with what it does. This product however, seems to do nothing at all, except cost a lot of money. I have used it on my forehead and on the \\&quot;11\\&quot; in between my eyes. I can tell no difference in the appearance of those areas comparing now to 6 weeks ago. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this from Message Envy and I loved it so much, I bought a tube on amazon. I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money on skin care products ( I like TJ Maxx for skin products) but this worked so well I splurged and bought some</li>
    <li> Did nothing.  And has questionable ingredients.</li>
    <li> I had a facial recently and they only use Murad products, which are great !!!  -- this stuff really works -- I can see the difference and so much cheaper to purchase thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just love Murad products.  The first time I&#x27;ve tried a facial product that actually does what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> would buy again, this product works for me! After using many products that claim they will reduce fine lines this one did!</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work, but nope.  Have been using it consistently for a few months now and I still don&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> The hair salon I shop at gave a trial size sample of 2 other Murad products to me.  I liked them both but they&#x27;re pricey so I started searching for lower prices &amp; found them on Amazon.  I hadn&#x27;t tried Age Reform Time Release for Deep Wrinkles &amp; since I have plenty of deep wrinkles &amp; reviews for the product were very good I ordered to give it a try.  I&#x27;m not totally disappointed but because of the reviews was expecting a bit more from the product.  Also, the tube size is deceiving.  For $60+ I feel it should have lasted longer than 1 month.  Funny~~~the free samples lasted 2 weeks at 0.125 fluid oz.  The tube I ordered for Deep Wrinkles is 0.5 fluid oz.  I used the same amount of all 3 on the same areas.  It&#x27;s a decent product but not worth the price.  I get close to the same results from L&#x27;ORE&#x60;AL Collagen Filler at $17 ($12 on sale) 1.0 fluid oz.</li>
    <li> Not convinced that this actually dos anything.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product. Really works.</li>
    <li> This product did not arrive as shown.  the color coding on it was black not purple, the box was missing and the seal was not on it.  Attempted to contact seller, over a week ago with no response.</li>
    <li> helps make wrinkles appear less deep. I do recommend this product. Small amount goes a long way. Seems to  be fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Best skin product on the market</li>
    <li> I started to break in the wrinkles where I was applying it and had to stop using it.  May retry to be sure after blemishes clear but they seemed to be very specific to the area where I was applying the cream.</li>
    <li> I use Murad but had not used this particular product. I am very impressed and saw results very quickly. I am 61 and have almost no lines.</li>
    <li> I noticed the wrinkles appeared filled in upon application, however, I didn&#x27;t see the long term reduction I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> I guess my wrinkles are too deep for the \\&quot;Deep Wrinkle\\&quot; concentrate.  Or, perhaps I haven&#x27;t given the Time Release Retinol enough \\&quot;time\\&quot;. I think I have been using it for about 3 weeks now.  Unfortunately, I have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles around my lips. I will continue to use it and hope for the best. I do think I will need some dermatologist help in order to diminish the look of the lip lines! :(&lt;br /&gt;I usually love Murad products, but this is like most other products that claim results but do not materialize.</li>
    <li> Made my skin puffy and swollen. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Before buying read reviews a lot more positive than negative.  Well I&#x27;m going to the negative side.  After using day &amp; night consentrating  on deep wrinkles on sides of mouth no plump at all. Product is a BIG waste of money!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is the first over the counter retinol product that I can stand behind!!! Fantastic. All the others have warnings on their packaging pointing to a possible redness and irritation, because of the presence and high concentration of retinol. That never happened, until this Murad cream. It really is concentrated, and it tinglled nice. I&#x27;m sure I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I liked it but my sister loves it so i gifted to her. She is real happy with her results. Fast service also.</li>
    <li> Works great! A little pricy for what you get..but does exactly what it says it does. Be sure to follow with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Wow! 1/3 of the price that I paid at my salon - I have been using for 6 weeks now and see the difference in my marionette lines. I use twice daily and am really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing much difference for the price of this product.</li>
    <li> I rated this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to see any results. I know these things take time to work, so will keep using it &amp; see.</li>
    <li> This product really does make a difference in reducing the look of deep wrinkles. People have noticed that my wrinkles are less deep.</li>
    <li> I can see a noticeable reduction in the smile lines around my nose and mouth.  Also the deep frown lines at the top of my nose.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product really does not work.  After 4+ weeks of using, I see absolutely not change.  I would not recommend - it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and we use murad products at the spa I work at , so I waned to try it since I have heard amazing reviews about time release , well I have being using it for more than a month and yes it seems to work but &amp;#34; I&#x27;ve being notice that I being getting a lot of blackheads where are apply it so I don&#x27;t know if is because of the product or other reason , I personally love murad and all their products so I will highly recommend this Product</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and as describe... I&#x27;ve noticed a little difference and it does seem to help fairly quickly.  Will try one more time.</li>
    <li> not  doing what  suppose  to  do  at all!! not  working  at all</li>
