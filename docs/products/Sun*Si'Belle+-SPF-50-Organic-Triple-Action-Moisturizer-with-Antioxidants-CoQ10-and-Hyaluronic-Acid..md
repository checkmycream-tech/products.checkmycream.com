      <li>I really LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>I bought the variety sample pack from the company website, which I would recommend doing before commiting, it&#x27;s a great deal and a great way to try all the products first and see what works for you</li>
      <li>It is a great product, except for the inclusion of titanium dioxide particles, which has been associated with carcinogenic properties, because of free radicals created by exposition to the Sun    </li>
      <li>The coverage is nice and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I really liked the SPF 30 and didn&#x27;t want to return</li>
      <li>Vanicream was nice, but greasy as well.  </li>
      <li>AND IT HAS NICE SMELL  </li>

      <li>It is an excellent natural sunscreen for my face that contains safe non-toxic ingredients.</li>

      <li>how well it&#x27;s going to work in the summer when I&#x27;m darker and perspiring more, but it seems like it may be a fall/winter/spring option.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m ordering more today.</li>
      <li>I use Organic Sun SiBelle SPF 50 as my daily sunscreen and can report it is excellent!  </li>
      <li>While I applaud the maker of this product for making a safe, non-toxic product, I do not find this sunscreen to be usable for faces.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed friends looking at me, one friend told me how healthy my face looked.</li>
      <li>I love the texture, the scent, and the coverage.</li>
      <li>Love the 50 spf</li>
      <li>Love, love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>, how many businesses will email their clients on the weekends?</li>
      <li>The products ingredients are all truly organic and that is why EWG name it top sunscreen/moisteruizer (spelling error).     </li>
      <li>This sunscreen does not cause an allergic reaction, which is a problem I have had with many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin products.  </li>
      <li>Ok I&#x27;m about to reorder</li>
      <li>Also, since I have started using it, I have MANY fewer pimples.  </li>
      <li>It was pointed out to me that Sun*Si&#x27;Belle is actually one of the best, recommended by EWG, safest moisturizes with sunscreen</li>
      <li>So, I started using Sun*si&#x27;Belle SPF 50, and I have been REALLY pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I am sure I will explore other Sweetsation&#x27;s products based on how impressed I was with these ones.</li>
      <li>But I love that this is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group on both UVA and UVB screening and having good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not an easy feat.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better for you to have the zinc oxide sitting on the top of your skin blocking the sun, rather then being absorbed.</li>
      <li>I am not someone who likes strong frangrances, and this product does not have that at all.  </li>
      <li>/looks fine and keep the toxic stuff from entering my bloodstream.    </li>
      <li>Am very, very pleased with this company and pleased with my complexion after more than a year of constant use.</li>
      <li>This product goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light texture.</li>
      <li>All are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It is obvious that it works as a sunscreen, and it is also a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I find my face to have this fresh look, like a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>You skin looks and feels better right away.  </li>
      <li>I liked it, it has smooth texture and goes on well, not greasy like most, and not dry.</li>
      <li>Goes on well, doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast and smells great, like sweet citrus.</li>
      <li>IT IS RICH AND DEED MOUSTERIZED CREAM</li>
      <li>I am very fair (think Nicole Kidman) and it still made me ghostly white, and doesn&#x27;t fade that much.</li>
      <li>Smell is light and goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>The last time I was researching EWG it was one of the most safe, non-toxic sunscreens in SPF 50 range.</li>
      <li>And THAT is good enough reason for me to use it right there.</li>
      <li>It is slightly white but spreads very easily and is a light texture.</li>
      <li>THEN I KNEW IT IS MY NEW LOVELY CREAM .  </li>
      <li>It however seems to provide my dry skin good moisture.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy and it has many ingredients in it that are good for my skin other than the high SPF factor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and it&#x27;s rare for me to have a pimple.  </li>
      <li>There is some of course, but it fades a bit as the cream is absorbed.</li>
      <li>It works great with my sensitive skin, and protects my face in the high altitude where I live.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking to my old SPF Elta MD - much easier and seems to provide better protection.</li>
      <li>It takes a little time to soak in but feels good on the skin.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, however I wish it didn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
      <li>This works great as a sunscreen but too thick under make-up.</li>
      <li>I like this leaves my face feeling fresh not greasy, but moisturizes very well</li>
      <li>When I first bought the SPF 30</li>
      <li>Thanks Sweetsation Therapy!</li>
      <li>So... I&#x27;m thinking (and so is Europe) that a product like this one that leaves a white cast is better</li>
      <li>I really wanted this product to be harm free, since the market is filled with products with parabens and other harmful stuff.</li>
      <li>A big plus is the very, very mild smell - no added</li>
      <li>One day I purchased Blue Lizard sensitive skin , as I thought it was a pretty safe product, and it is.</li>
      <li>, I truly had not seen my face look this fresh in years (33 years old now).</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t readily attest to not getting sunburned.</li>
      <li>I am beyond picky about my sunscreen, and after using this for a couple of weeks, I have to say that I really like this.</li>
      <li>Haha, I guess I am in the mood for reviewing my purchases today.</li>
      <li>This worked very well</li>
      <li>I am not pregant, but since I ride my bike so much in the sun I have become concerned about my health and the safety of the products I use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how effective this product is as a moisturizer, since I didn&#x27;t use it all that much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works great as a sunscreen but too thick under make-up. Leaves a white film and takes some work to rub in. I would only wear this on the hottest of days when I need a lot of protection. I bought this brand because it has the least toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> The product has fair ratings on EWG and I&#x27;m happy with a natural 50 SPF level sunscreen.  I find the lotion rubs in great and I can wear make-up over it if I choose.  I think I&#x27;d look a little pale, in not a great way, if I didn&#x27;t put at least a mineral powder over it.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, however I wish it didn&#x27;t make me break out.  I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and it&#x27;s rare for me to have a pimple.  The sunscreen typically leaves me with a small one or two.  I guess it&#x27;s just my skin&#x27;s reaction to the natural oils.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m ordering more today. It is an excellent natural sunscreen for my face that contains safe non-toxic ingredients. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate it. It is slightly white but spreads very easily and is a light texture. I just put a little bronzer over it if I feel pale after applying it. Love the 50 spf and it&#x27;s balanced for both UVA and UVB protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this SPF 50 product as an addition for Sun*Si&#x27;Belle SPF 30, just to use it when I do my prolonged organic gardening outside. And I have to report that it is just as good as the SPF 30 by Sweetsation. It was pointed out to me that Sun*Si&#x27;Belle is actually one of the best, recommended by EWG, safest moisturizes with sunscreen and it&#x27;s in their list of Top 10 best products. And why wouldn&#x27;t it be, it&#x27;s great, light, smells pleasant and protects well. Oh, and 99% natural. I am sure I will explore other Sweetsation&#x27;s products based on how impressed I was with these ones.</li>
    <li> This facial moisturizer is indeed creamy and protective.  As other reviewers have noted, however, the mineral component takes quite awhile to fade; on my face I had white lines in my wrinkles (not significant to me but somewhat frightening to people who had to look at me) up to two hours after first application.  Because of my mottled, sun-dappled skin, I intend to keep using this high SPF formula regardless of the absorption issue.  One caution - a single pump dispensed more than enough for my face, neck and upper chest!  My arms and elbows got a dose of this lotion as well.  A big plus is the very, very mild smell - no added fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 18, 2012:  Better massaging has eliminated the smear-y white mark problem, and I continue to use the entire Sweetsation Therapy line for facial care.  Am very, very pleased with this company and pleased with my complexion after more than a year of constant use.</li>
    <li> Lets see, where to begin. I live in Florida where we need sunscreen year round, especially if your outdoors a lot. Aside from working I ride my mountain bike 100-200 miles per week (combination of trail and road, needless to say suncreen is important. This year I think I have tried every sunscreen on the market, literetly. All neutorgena products eventually made my eyes swell and constant water, aveeno did the same, as did olay, and every other brand on the shelf. One day I purchased Blue Lizard sensitive skin , as I thought it was a pretty safe product, and it is. However, I apply sunscreen every 2 hours when I am in the sun (as suggested) and the blue lizard seemed to get pretty greasy, to the point that I was taking a paper towel and pat my entire face to try and soak some of it up.Fallene products went on smoothly but dried my face out, as did the blue lizzard. Vanicream was nice, but greasy as well.  I began to try products like badger and beyond coastal when I accidentlly came across the EWG website listing the 2010 best/safest sunscreen products.   At the very top is sweetsation products. ALthough more money on intial cost, you actually are spending less because you need less. The products ingredients are all truly organic and that is why EWG name it top sunscreen/moisteruizer (spelling error).     The SPF 50 is easier to spread than the SPF30. The product blends in immedietly, does not make your face feel greasy, and last along time (even for me riding 2-3 hours in 90 degree weather). I have not felt any stinging in my eyes or flushing on my skin. Absolutely no effects like every other sunscreen on the market has given me. I am not someone who likes strong frangrances, and this product does not have that at all.  At first, it will leave a white cast, but if you gently rub it in and wait a few minutes the ghostly look goes away. The slightly white cast is worth the quality of the product.     When I first bought the SPF 30 I was thrown off a bit applying it,as it seemed to clump up on my face. The clumps would go away once I was able to rub them in, but had to wait a few minutes. My face immedietly had this new glow to it, I truly had not seen my face look this fresh in years (33 years old now). I am not pregant, but since I ride my bike so much in the sun I have become concerned about my health and the safety of the products I use. Sweetsation products are the safest and do wonders for your skin. I find my face to have this fresh look, like a healthy glow. I have noticed friends looking at me, one friend told me how healthy my face looked. She commented as soon as she saw me that morning. I didn&#x27;t even mention to her anything about applying anything.     Anyway, I really liked the SPF 30 and didn&#x27;t want to return so I emailed the company at the sweetsation therapy website directly, on a Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago actually. Too my surpise, about an hour later my phone had an incoming email, and it was from the owner of Sweetsation Therapy. Her email response was very impressive, how many businesses will email their clients on the weekends? not many. She gave me very helpful tips; suggested only apply a pea size or less at a time or putting a serum or day cream on first. This worked very well (the pea size amount) and no clumping at all. I was truly impressed with the cutsomer service. Since that Saturday (1-2 weeks ago) I have asked the owner a few more questions and she has always responded, never missed a question.     Sweetsation products are truly great. Even if your not in the sun everyday, the products are worth every penny. They last a very long time, longer than over the counter products and most others.</li>
    <li> My skin is light, but not very pale and I can use this sunscreen on my face without too much white cast. There is some of course, but it fades a bit as the cream is absorbed. I don&#x27;t really care if the rest of my body is a bit white. Anyway, you have to accept some white cast with zinc oxide, and on the face it can be covered with a little foundation. The cream is moisturizing enough for my combination skin, though I&#x27;ve only used it in summer so far. It protects well and it&#x27;s a joy to use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but it&#x27;s leaves a white cast and it&#x27;s very hard to blend. I also feel like I miss spots and I got sun burned. It however seems to provide my dry skin good moisture. I&#x27;m sticking to my old SPF Elta MD - much easier and seems to provide better protection.</li>
    <li> While I applaud the maker of this product for making a safe, non-toxic product, I do not find this sunscreen to be usable for faces.  It leaves a very white cast.  The white cast, in turn, makes one&#x27;s teeth look very yellow!  I am using this up on my 8 year old son and on my arms and legs, but it really looks bad on faces.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweetsation products for several years now and will continue to do so because each product performs as advertised and is well-priced.  I use Organic Sun SiBelle SPF 50 as my daily sunscreen and can report it is excellent!  I do observe it casts a slight whiteness but the white cast does disappear once the sunscreen is absorbed into the skin. If this is a concern, you can purchase the same product slightly tinted. This sunscreen does not cause an allergic reaction, which is a problem I have had with many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin products.  I give this product five stars!</li>
    <li> I just bought this item and love it!  It&#x27;s a great product.  The smell is nice and not overwhelming.  The coverage is nice and not greasy.  I have mild melasma, so I am always looking for a good sunscreen to cover my melasma.  I think I have found the perfect sunscreen for me.  You skin looks and feels better right away.  I am recommending this to everyone I know.  Thanks Sweetsation Therapy!</li>
    <li> WHEN I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT NONE OF MY FRIENDS KNOWN ABOUT IT IN ONE WEEK TIME THEY STARTED TO ASK ME WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR SKIN I ASKED THEM WHY IS THAT THEY TOLD ME YOU LOOK BRIGHTER AND SHINY THEN I KNEW IT IS MY NEW LOVELY CREAM .  YEH IT IS RICH AND DEED MOUSTERIZED CREAM AND IT HAS NICE SMELL  I LIKE IT XXX</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how effective this product is as a moisturizer, since I didn&#x27;t use it all that much.  After trying it a few times, I found that it leaves a white cast on my skin that is quite noticeable, probably due to the zinc oxide in its sun-blocking ingredients. I suppose if you have a very pale complexion, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but on my moderately light ivory skin tone, it just didn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
    <li> I love Sweetsation, and I so badly wanted this product to work for me! I love the texture, the scent, and the coverage. However, as a woman in my late 20s still suffering from acne, I have to say after about a month of using Sun*Si&#x27;Belle+ SPF 50 my face was a mess. I had lots of blocked pores and blackheads and multiple big pimples, all of which have cleared up very noticeably since I stopped using this and went back to a different moisturizer. I wanted to let people know if you have trouble skin this product is not one I recommend. For anyone else, though, it&#x27;s a treat! I do also want to note that I have experienced phenomenal customer service from this company!</li>
    <li> After using it for about two weeks every day, I have to stop using it because people at work have made too many comments about how pale I look.  I thought it might fade after an hour or so, especially after fully rubbing it into my skin for about ten minutes, but there is still a residual white color that make me look a little bit like a zombie.  I already have pale skin, so I don&#x27;t need to look even more pale.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Haha, I guess I am in the mood for reviewing my purchases today. Amazon keeps suggesting. I&#x27;ve got this sunscreen quite a while ago and even though I am out of it already it reminds me that when spring comes I will have to get it again. I liked it, it has smooth texture and goes on well, not greasy like most, and not dry. 2/3 of it is mineral sunscreen so it does leave ever so slight white hint, but not something you would notice if you apply a thin layer. The last time I was researching EWG it was one of the most safe, non-toxic sunscreens in SPF 50 range. All the antiaging properties that it has always help, we don&#x27;t get any younger unfortunately. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> I am beyond picky about my sunscreen, and after using this for a couple of weeks, I have to say that I really like this. I live in Seattle, so  i can&#x27;t readily attest to not getting sunburned. But I love that this is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group on both UVA and UVB screening and having good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect a white look after you put the sunscreen on. But it fades and I simply put my foundation on over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part for me: is that I actually see an improvement in my skin texture after using it. And THAT is good enough reason for me to use it right there.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after so much research and trial and error with other products. I am 39 and decided it was time to find great all-natural, antiaging (nut-free) products. Not an easy feat. This is a fantastic product. Although it leaves a white cast, apparently for safety reasons it&#x27;s supposed to (although I have not confirmed that it does not contain nano particles). My understanding is that if you do not see white there are most likely micronized ingredients (which are banned in Europe) to help the product sink into the skin. From there the particles can enter the bloodstream. So... I&#x27;m thinking (and so is Europe) that a product like this one that leaves a white cast is better bc it works/looks fine and keep the toxic stuff from entering my bloodstream.    I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and the first few days I did not like it. I used it over Dr. Haushka&#x27;s regenerating serum and it balled up and was difficult to spread. Now I am using it on a clean/toned face or I use a different serum, wait for it to dry, and then Sun*SiBelle spreads fine. It&#x27;s not greasy and sinks into skin after a few minutes, although leaving a white cast. It also leaves a slightly greasy finish.    I have a medium to fair complexion and this makes me look very fair. I&#x27;m not sure how well it&#x27;s going to work in the summer when I&#x27;m darker and perspiring more, but it seems like it may be a fall/winter/spring option. I wore it running and it seemed to stay put. Sun*Sibelle is a small company and the owner emailed me back immediately answering all of my questions.    A tip for all natural SPF all day and a finished look: Powder Bare Minerals Veil SPF25 over Sunsibelle. Good for shine control and SPF touch ups throughout the day.    August 2010: Ok I&#x27;m about to reorder so I guess I do like this. It leaves much less of a white cast when I use Cosmetic Skin Solutions C&amp;E Ferulic Serum first for some reason. I still put some bare minerals over it. It does not stay put when sweating profusely so would recommend a different product for heavy outdoor exercise like running. I wear a hat too, but after a summer of using this and being outdoors I have not gotten burned so it must be working. It smells great too. The best thing is that it does not clog my skin and it does not burn my eyes when it does run into my eyes while perspiring.    December 2010: I&#x27;m back! I decided to look for an everyday winter spf serum and what do I come back to after realizing Smashbox photo finish clogs my pores and is filled with chemicals, trying Kate Somerville&#x27;s \\&quot;serum\\&quot; which is greasy and is NOT a serum... this product! My skin looks better after using, paler, but better! A tiny bit goes a long way. Still love the scent!</li>
    <li> Well that&#x27;s a great news. We finally have a sunscreen with SPF 50 that&#x27;s not toxic, has no parabens or oxybenzone. I like this product and it&#x27;s light texture. Goes on well, doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast and smells great, like sweet citrus. Anti aging properties also help to keep skin in great condition. I rate it 5 without reservations.</li>
    <li> I just love it! M I have an oily t zone and with this my face doesn&#x27;t get greasy!</li>
    <li> I like this leaves my face feeling fresh not greasy, but moisturizes very well</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth.  It takes a little time to soak in but feels good on the skin. Smell is light and goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this sunscreen and moisturizer for about a year.  I started using it because I looked up the skin care products I had been using, Neutrogena, on skindeep.com, and found out that those products had lots of toxic ingredients and the sunscreen moisturizer was tested and found to be not very effective.  That made me so upset since I was using Neutrogena sunscreen because I have sun spots on my face, and I was trying to prevent getting any more! So, I started using Sun*si&#x27;Belle SPF 50, and I have been REALLY pleased with it.  It is obvious that it works as a sunscreen, and it is also a great moisturizer.  It takes a few minutes to be completely absorbed, but my experience with a true sunscreen is consistent with that.  Also, since I have started using it, I have MANY fewer pimples.  It stinks to have pimples and sunspots at the same time, and Sun*si&#x27;Belle has helped DRAMATICALLY reduce my pimples, and prevented me from getting new sunspots, even in the Texas summer sun going swimming with my kids.  I really LOVE this product!  I am starting to give it and others as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have been searching and searching for an organic moisturizer for the face with SPF. This is a quality product, however, doesn&#x27;t work on the face, at least for me - due to the heavy white cast it leaves. I am very fair (think Nicole Kidman) and it still made me ghostly white, and doesn&#x27;t fade that much. It also doesn&#x27;t moisturize enough for someone with dry skin like me. I had to use a heavy moisturizer first, and then this product, and it still was a challenge to rub in. I have a feeling it&#x27;s better for you to have the zinc oxide sitting on the top of your skin blocking the sun, rather then being absorbed. From a vanity perspective, I just can&#x27;t use this on my face. I bought the variety sample pack from the company website, which I would recommend doing before commiting, it&#x27;s a great deal and a great way to try all the products first and see what works for you</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to be harm free, since the market is filled with products with parabens and other harmful stuff. It is a great product, except for the inclusion of titanium dioxide particles, which has been associated with carcinogenic properties, because of free radicals created by exposition to the Sun    Quote from Wikipedia: \\&quot;The titanium dioxide particles used in sunscreens have to be coated with silica or alumina, because titanium dioxide creates radicals in the photocatalytic reaction. These radicals are carcinogenic, and could damage the skin.\\&quot;  [...]</li>
    <li> This is the best natural sunscreen for the face that I&#x27;ve been able to find!  I&#x27;ve tried several other sunscreens with an EWG rating of 0-2 (this has a rating of 2, which is very good), but all of them were either excessively greasy or sticky or both, most left a very obvious white film, and some were too thick.  This doesn&#x27;t leave a ghostly white film even though it is white when you first put it on.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy and it has many ingredients in it that are good for my skin other than the high SPF factor.  I found that it isn&#x27;t too thick, either, but sometimes like to put it on when my face is wet.  I hope that their reformulated sunscreens for 2013 will be as good as this was!</li>
    <li> Love, love this sunscreen.  It works great with my sensitive skin, and protects my face in the high altitude where I live.  I also use the eye cream, botanical night cream, and,  cucumber day cream.  All are fantastic.  The cocoa lip balm is great too?  My dog loves it!</li>
