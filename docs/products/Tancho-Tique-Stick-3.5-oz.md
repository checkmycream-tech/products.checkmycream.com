      <li>hair smooth &amp; silky.</li>
      <li>It managed to smooth hair edges</li>
      <li>It is lightly fragranced styling stick</li>
      <li>I also love the smell; CLEAN, FRESH LAVENDER.</li>
      <li>And to have more context, Tancho Tique was invented in 1933, so this is a classic and gem in its own right.</li>
      <li>- it is very strong and doesn&#x27;t dissipate as much as you&#x27;d hope.  </li>
      <li>right down to the scent which is an awesome lavender smell....that gets me compliments every time....</li>
      <li>I have my full head of healthy med-long hair to this very day.</li>
      <li>I have tried all sorts of modern age waxes and sprays and this thing gives the biggest bang for the buck without most of the harmful chemicals.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t put too much and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
      <li>I like the texture of this for my style (punky pixie cut on fine, straight hair)</li>
      <li>I put the product in my hair on a Monday for instance and if I shower and only use Shampoo, there are still remnants of this product in my hair after my shower to which I rarely need to apply more of this product.  </li>
      <li>product is outstanding and REALLY has EXTRA STRONG HOLD!&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this extra strong hold</li>
      <li>Very gentle not like gels and pomades.</li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the lavender smell, I would rate this product higher.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time leaving a review of a product.</li>
      <li>I love my blonde tousled style and this product compliments it!</li>
      <li>when i first received this I did not care for it.</li>
      <li>The lavender smell can be a bit overpowering at first</li>
      <li>I’ve used it to smooth my edges down in between touch-ups and also on the ends of my hair to help it blend better with my extensions.  </li>
      <li>If you want a similar texture styling product without the strong scent, check out Tigi Bed Head Hair Stick.</li>
      <li>As of now I use Glaze by Elasta QP which works really well</li>
      <li>The lavender smell is very overpowering.  </li>
      <li>It has a very OVER powering lavender scent, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
      <li>good product, but once the stick is pushed up, you can&#x27;t put it back down.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
      <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough or maybe my hair is just too thick or \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; for this lol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little sticky and not in love with the smell but does the trick.</li>
      <li>I start out with a little and work more in if needed.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of thick, wavy hair and the T helps tame it, but primarily I continue to use it for the scent: a clean lavender ...and the ladies LOVE it.</li>
      <li>but I have to agree with several other reviewers on the very strong fragrance</li>
      <li>#34;little goes a long way&amp;#34;, and put it in the right places where it counts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural and was looking for something to smooth my edges down.</li>
      <li>This has really become a staple for me especially when I am wearing my natural hair</li>
      <li>rub this directly onto your hair because it will pull out your hair.</li>
      <li>Professional Hollywood stylist recommended it to me</li>
      <li>I bought the product after it was used on my hair by a professional stylist.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mostly natural.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell but for as strong and persistent as the scent is, I would want to like it more than I do.  </li>
      <li>As a bonus, I have gotten no less then a dozen compliments on how good i smell and its been the lavendar scent of this pomade as I typically use very little to no cologne.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing but a little goes a long long way</li>
      <li>negative is the strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>Slick your hair back or use just a little to give you a great \\&quot;Wet Beach Look\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>(THIS IS NOT A WET</li>
      <li>Hard to find but worth the hunt!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for 10 years and though i don&#x27;t use it every day,it is a must have handy  do helper! I can spike up short hair, or hold a smosh here and there.  I always get compliments on the scent of my hair b/c this product smells delicious. If one was growing out a haircut, this stick could make your hair look interesting as opposed to doughty.</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse hair.  In terms of length, it comes down past my nose at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;This product is outstanding and REALLY has EXTRA STRONG HOLD!&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this extra strong hold it DOES NOT make my hair look stiff or wet.  It keeps it in place for hours and actually days.  I put the product in my hair on a Monday for instance and if I shower and only use Shampoo, there are still remnants of this product in my hair after my shower to which I rarely need to apply more of this product.  I personally like this because my hair always has that \\&quot;cool\\&quot; look.  Now if I use conditioner on my hair, it will wash out the product and I will then reapply.  As a bonus, I have gotten no less then a dozen compliments on how good i smell and its been the lavendar scent of this pomade as I typically use very little to no cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you want:&lt;br /&gt;EXTRA STRONG HOLD (really!)&lt;br /&gt;DRY LOOK (THIS IS NOT A WET LOOK PRODUCT)&lt;br /&gt;STAY IN HAIR EVEN AFTER USING SHAMPOO&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING SMELL</li>
    <li> Been using this for years, works well for shorter haircuts.  Very little needed and 1 stick last a long time, check different versions of this on Amazon as Prices vary by vendor.</li>
    <li> It works well on my hair, but something in it gives me a small alergic reaction...</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural and was looking for something to smooth my edges down. maybe if my hair wasn&#x27;t as thick it could have worked. DO NOT! rub this directly onto your hair because it will pull out your hair. I used a tooth brush or a hairbrush to apply it. It doesn&#x27;t stink but has a strong smell.</li>
    <li> I use this product when wearing my natural hair to slick down the edges, for sleek ponytail, and for blending when I wear a weave.  This product is great for blending my hair with weave because it does a great job at controlling the frizz and keeping the hair smooth and laid down. T The smell is nice and not overwhelming. There is a good amount of product in the tube.  This has really become a staple for me especially when I am wearing my natural hair flat Ironed.</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the lavender smell, I would rate this product higher.  I don&#x27;t care for my hair to smell with this scent.</li>
    <li> I saw and smelled this product in a salon and had my hair cut shorter so I could use Tancho Tique!  The understated lavender scent and texture of the product is the best I have ever used.  I bought the product before I got the cut!</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Great for flyaways and smoothing hair. Professional Hollywood stylist recommended it to me and I use it after styling my hair before spraying.</li>
    <li> Smells like the Irish Spring your father used to use. Will sculpt your hair in place but will not come out easily. My hairstylist begged me to stop using it.This stuff is like the Hotel California of hair product.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I personally don&#x27;t think it smells like lavender but my clients don&#x27;t complain and even say they like it.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it works well and gets the job done. I would say Chaz Dean&#x27;s Wen texture balm is my favorite. It&#x27;s a true lavender and smells better. Also, this stick slides out of the case a lot which is frustrating particularly when it gets covered in debris that I have to wipe off. It took me a while to figure out that you have to push it all the way out and put it back in through the bottom.  The price is good for this product. If it was more expensive I wouldn&#x27;t bother to use it at all.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hair product! I buy this every couple of months as I use it almost everyday on my edges. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to reapply it. It still will hold them for a day or two.</li>
    <li> If you know this stuff you&#x27;ll love it. It is lightly fragranced styling stick</li>
    <li> Great product- been using for years- love the smell of it!</li>
    <li> Slick your hair back or use just a little to give you a great \\&quot;Wet Beach Look\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard, greasy or dry so no white flakes.  It will make your hair look Sticky and Sexy. I also love the smell; CLEAN, FRESH LAVENDER.</li>
    <li> Love..love..this product...&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hair smooth &amp; silky. ..&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the strong fragrance. ..&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly. ..</li>
    <li> This item did not perform for me as described.  It managed to smooth hair edges but they did not stay in place at all.  The one thing I did like was the fragrance and that does not support the price of this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! Absolutely love &#x27;everything&#x27; about it, from the consistency...application..right down to the scent which is an awesome lavender smell....that gets me compliments every time....my hair looks and feels great all day. I love my blonde tousled style and this product compliments it!</li>
    <li> Best hair stick ever! Hard to find but worth the hunt! Great for fine hair! Hold the style all day, Lavender scent is great!</li>
    <li> Only gave it three stars, got this item on Friday only being using it 2 days now. It has a strong smell, not too trill about it. Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this for my style (punky pixie cut on fine, straight hair) but I have to agree with several other reviewers on the very strong fragrance - it is very strong and doesn&#x27;t dissipate as much as you&#x27;d hope.  I love the scent of lavender so I didn&#x27;t think this would be a problem for me but, honestly, I get more of a detergent smell from it than lavender.  It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell but for as strong and persistent as the scent is, I would want to like it more than I do.  I&#x27;ll use it because of the texture but would not order it again because of the scent.  If you want a similar texture styling product without the strong scent, check out Tigi Bed Head Hair Stick.</li>
    <li> The stick rolled all the way up when I traveled with it and I can&#x27;t get it to go back down. Therefore the lid can&#x27;t go back on it and it&#x27;s pretty much useless after 2 uses...</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve only used it once. I am African American &amp; I am trying to stretch my relaxers. I only do them once every three months. I bought this with hopes that it&#x27;ll hold my edges down when my new growth comes in. Well when I used this wax stick it didn&#x27;t hold like I needed it to. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough or maybe my hair is just too thick or \\&quot;nappy\\&quot; for this lol. As of now I use Glaze by Elasta QP which works really well but the hold doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me, especially in the summer months</li>
    <li> I love this stick. when i first received this I did not care for it. However, I tried it one day out of the blue on my edges being that I am 3 months post relaxer and it layed them down!!! Now, this product is not gel, but after putting gel on my edges some of them were still up and Frizzy. this product made my edges look tamed and well groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use this stick when i Flatiron or wear my hair out because I always have hair sticking up where ever I part, but all i have to do is give the parted section a little wipe over with this stick and use my finger or brush the product in and im set. I have been looking for something to lay down my stray short hairs and i have now found it. Its a keeper and it will last for a long long time</li>
    <li> This is the best wax stick ever and it&#x27;s works really well to lay down my natural black curly kinky hair</li>
    <li> This is my first time leaving a review of a product. I think Tancho Tique is quite overrated!! I bought it thinking it would be a holy grail for me after hearing so many raves about it, but it wasn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t hold my edges like others claimed, and that SMELL!!! It has a very OVER powering lavender scent, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. I normally hate wasting products, but I cant even force myself to use up this product due to the smell which I despise. I will not be buying this ever again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  A little goes a VERY long way.  The lavender smell can be a bit overpowering at first but it does fade away.  I usually apply the product with my finger to avoid getting too much on my hair but it works wonders.  I’ve used it to smooth my edges down in between touch-ups and also on the ends of my hair to help it blend better with my extensions.  The product works excellently at getting rid of those pesky flyaways and leaves a very well polished look.  It is VERY heavy so I would not use a lot of it.  I start out with a little and work more in if needed.  Also, the key to this product is putting it on your hair BEFORE you brush it down.  It works better when brushed/combed into the hair so the product is evenly distributed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must for anyone looking for a sleek look without the hardness or damage gel causes.  And this stick will last you FOREVER!</li>
    <li> The lavender scent is too overwhelming. I like the consistency and it softens my hair, BUT the smell OMG !</li>
    <li> Amazing but a little goes a long long way</li>
    <li> good product, but once the stick is pushed up, you can&#x27;t put it back down.</li>
    <li> It seems to work. It&#x27;s a little sticky and not in love with the smell but does the trick. It&#x27;s worth trying if you don&#x27;t have thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... the smell, the texture, the hold.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review since you will probably never find another user of this Tancho Tique who has used this longer than I have. Just to qualify it, I have been using this product for around 40 years already. And to have more context, Tancho Tique was invented in 1933, so this is a classic and gem in its own right. For it to survive this long and never fade away says something about the product and its staying power for decades. I discovered it when my uncle was using it and he introduced me to it. I never looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. The best thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s almost all natural. I have my full head of healthy med-long hair to this very day. It does a lot for the little no. of ingredients it has. I have tried all sorts of modern age waxes and sprays and this thing gives the biggest bang for the buck without most of the harmful chemicals. It just plainly does the job. It depends on how you use it too. I stream it randomly and directly onto my hair and comb over it and it lasts the day in styling. Secret is &amp;#34;little goes a long way&amp;#34;, and put it in the right places where it counts. I see a lot of complaints about the smell. It&#x27;s not a big deal. Don&#x27;t put too much and you&#x27;ll be just fine. For me, I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a classic. It works great. It&#x27;s a great value for the money. It&#x27;s mostly natural. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend since this is all he will put in his hair and he is in love with it. Doesn&#x27;t make his hair look hard or greasy and it lasts for YEARS. YES, YEARS.</li>
    <li> This tacky stick is great when your in a hurry to smooth back fly-aways. I&#x27;m sick of the smell now though;it&#x27;s not bad but since I use it near my face I get sick of it.</li>
    <li> I swear by Tancho! I have a lot of thick, wavy hair and the T helps tame it, but primarily I continue to use it for the scent: a clean lavender ...and the ladies LOVE it. Just saying.</li>
    <li> I use this on my clients and myself for fly aways and sleek hair styles. Very gentle not like gels and pomades. smells great also</li>
    <li> The lavender smell is very overpowering.  I thought the smell would go away after a few minutes, but it didn&#x27;t.  This would be a great product if it came without a scent.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Almost time for a reorder.</li>
    <li> Like Joaquin Phoenix in &amp;#34;Her&amp;#34;, I have found my life partner. My tancho stick is the best wingman a gentleman could ask for. 6 months ago I was alone and sad, now I&#x27;m running a polygamist compound. The stick does the trick.</li>
    <li> It could be good but...I bought the product after it was used on my hair by a professional stylist.  It worked better when she used it on my hair.</li>
