      <li>that I love the smell of it, it smells great on me!</li>
      <li>It smells so good and it a great buy for a man who loves to smell good.</li>
      <li>Pleasant smell for winter</li>
      <li>This cologne is really good</li>
      <li>A light fragrant smell, perfect for spring and summer nights by the beach</li>
      <li>Great price for my favorite Cologne</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>very good, I like it very much!</li>
      <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
      <li>and I liked it.  </li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s Gucci and probably considered by many people as top of the line brand in designer fragrances, I still find &amp;#34;Gucci pour home&amp;#34; not so great, but</li>
      <li>Received quickly, this cologne smells great....</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to say, but that I love the smell of this on my husband.</li>
      <li>And the price on Amazon was way better than any department store.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>Super nice scent.</li>
      <li>would strongly recommend to check Zegna UOMO instead of Gucci Made to Measure.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cologne.</li>
      <li>By far the most amazing smell my husband loves it.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>for this cologne &amp;#34;Gucci made To Measure&amp;#34;, all I can say is - &amp;#34;there is nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>Not a new scent but has a pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>I saw the add in my GQ magazine, and peeled back the flap to smell, and it really smelled good.  </li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>The actual bottle was even better than I remember.</li>
      <li>this is the real deal Gucci or not..  </li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing.&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Not overpowering but a real attention getter.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but may take a few extra sprays than normal.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>So far my wife and 14-year old granddaughter like it!!  </li>
      <li>Not as strong as I thought it would be, and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>And longevity is near avrg.(3-4 hours), then you can barely smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It opens up in a very classic style like &amp;#34;burberry classic&amp;#34;, but different vibes/notes of course, but unlike burberry classic, or Cartier declaration, it&#x27;s less classy and blended with something modern in the middle.</li>
      <li>I heard and saw so many reviews about this fragrance and was inches from spending $60+, but really didn&#x27;t want to just blind buy it.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you would expect for a lot less than stores</li>

    <li> Great fragrance, and lasts.</li>
    <li> This cologne is really good</li>
    <li> I smell so fancy with this fragrance</li>
    <li> Not happy with product I received, not same as in store, doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I heard and saw so many reviews about this fragrance and was inches from spending $60+, but really didn&#x27;t want to just blind buy it. Although it&#x27;s Gucci and probably considered by many people as top of the line brand in designer fragrances, I still find &amp;#34;Gucci pour home&amp;#34; not so great, but like a lot &amp;#34;gucci pour homme sport&amp;#34; - great summer cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this cologne &amp;#34;Gucci made To Measure&amp;#34;, all I can say is - &amp;#34;there is nothing special about it. Absolutely nothing.&amp;#34;. It opens up in a very classic style like &amp;#34;burberry classic&amp;#34;, but different vibes/notes of course, but unlike burberry classic, or Cartier declaration, it&#x27;s less classy and blended with something modern in the middle. Just like that gold line in the middle of the box. this is not a sweet scent, maybe tiny bit or so. And longevity is near avrg.(3-4 hours), then you can barely smell it.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend to check Zegna UOMO instead of Gucci Made to Measure. Zegna is extremely well blended and they are both sort of similar type/style frangrances(scents are different of course).</li>
    <li> By far the most amazing smell my husband loves it.  It arrived when I was told it would we are happy clients.</li>
    <li> Received quickly, this cologne smells great....</li>
    <li> Not a new scent but has a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Not very strong.</li>
    <li> Best cologne I&#x27;ve ever had....and I&#x27;ve had ALOT...!! My gf cannot keep her hands off of me when i wear it....so it&#x27;s the only one i have for now.</li>
