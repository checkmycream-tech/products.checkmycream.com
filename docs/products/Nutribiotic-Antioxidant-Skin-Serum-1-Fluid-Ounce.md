      <li>The ingredients listed here are very different than what is listed on the bottle, the actual ingredients are primarily  aloe Vera juice (which I&#x27;m highly allergic to, felt the burn</li>
      <li>Amazing beauty secret.</li>

      <li>To be fair though, the same incorrect list is on other websites, so I&#x27;m guessing the manufacture is falsely reporting their ingredients.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item thinking it was a somewhat natural product with a high concentration of &amp;#34;actives&amp;#34;, based on the product information ingredients list (the actual list, not the marketing blurb about the product benefits) on Amazon and other sites.</li>
      <li>It takes about 30 seconds to absorb, and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized without being sticky or feeling too thick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good stuff. This is the only product my husband uses &amp; he is quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a bit about how good beta glucan can be for your skin. This serum leaves my skin soft, and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> was not very beneficial. i did not notice any changes in skin texture softness even skin tone. if you are looking for a serum i would say don&#x27;t settle on this one.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews- but this product is truly a stand-out. Best serum for the price i&#x27;ve ever used and I have used all the expensive stuff. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and this never aggravates it. If i have a dry skin (and i mean burning dry skin) , after using this 2 days it is completely back to normal. Evens skin tone. Makes skin glow. Incredible ingredients for anti-aging and amazing price. Highly recommend. Amazing beauty secret. Everyone I&#x27;ve gifted this too feels the same way and raves about it.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product, nothing to throw a party for. I don&#x27;t feel that \\&quot;soak into your skin\\&quot; feeling that you get when you apply a serum to your freshly washed face. Could be that it&#x27;s the dead of winter and I need more than just a serum to feel like my skin is especially hydrated. I mix a few drops of rosehip oil. For now I will use it because I spent the money on it but probably not re-invest in this once I run out.</li>
    <li> Antioxidant Skin Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best facial serum! I&#x27;ve been using this for two years and love it! A little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My Estheticians sells this product and he highly recommends this company.  I gave it a try and agree.  Really softens the fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This is the only face lotion I&#x27;ve used for the past 3 years and I can&#x27;t imagine ever switching. I apply it directly after washing &amp; drying my face. One pump is a perfect amount for my face and neck. It takes about 30 seconds to absorb, and leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized without being sticky or feeling too thick. Overall: my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking it was a somewhat natural product with a high concentration of &amp;#34;actives&amp;#34;, based on the product information ingredients list (the actual list, not the marketing blurb about the product benefits) on Amazon and other sites. The ingredients listed here are very different than what is listed on the bottle, the actual ingredients are primarily  aloe Vera juice (which I&#x27;m highly allergic to, felt the burn so I checked the ingredients, but it was too late, welts everywhere), cetearyl alcohol and polysorbate  60. The beneficial ingredients are waaaaaay  at the end of the list. I feel deceived, this is false advertising and dangerous to anyone with skin sensitivities. You are basically buying some overpriced aloe and some emulsifier/surfactants. YUCK. I&#x27;m not going to trust Amazon&#x27;s ingredients list anymore. To be fair though, the same incorrect list is on other websites, so I&#x27;m guessing the manufacture is falsely reporting their ingredients. SHADY.</li>
    <li> Stung around my eyes and neck a little. But my skin is also extra sensitive.</li>
    <li> it feels like a lotion not a serum. It&#x27;s not terrible but far prefer my Vitamin C serum to this. Will use now and then but will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, but this stuff moisturizes without feeling greasy or sticky. It&#x27;s lightweight, effective with no parabens and only natural fragrance (which is quite nice). I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of products and smells and this one is a big winner. I&#x27;m on my second bottle - and this price on Amazon is even less than I was getting on iHerb. I also have the gentle foaming cleanser by nutribiotic and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I put one squirt on at night, and my skin immediately looks better... plump, hydrated and soothed.  When I wake up my skin looks so fresh.  I&#x27;m 35 and my skin is in ok shape, but this stuff makes it look amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks and have not found any change to my skin.  It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky when applied, seems to go into the skin.  will give it more time to see if there is any improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the same company makes an ointment that I absolutely adore. This serum is good, it&#x27;s lightweight, moderately moisturizing, and it does feel like it does \\&quot;something\\&quot; I just can&#x27;t put my finger on exactly what. It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell terrible, and is natural - all in all, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Enjoying every minute of this serum. True to its word. Second time I have ordered it and keeping this product for a while.</li>
    <li> Did nothing but this with the lotion and cleanser made my skin and my husband&#x27;s dry, irritated, and red. So regret buying these!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin product of the century.  Product sounds, well, dull.  It is more like an elixir, a protection and luxurious anointment.  It really does feel like silk in a bottle.  For the past few months, people, even family members have told me my skin looks amazing, moist and dewey!  Crazy, I am almost 60 and have been getting compliments galore.  (don&#x27;t tell anyone my age, please!)</li>
    <li> I checked the ingredients before I bought this product.  However, they do not list them all, because this product contains wheat, which I cannot use because I am a celiac.  Unfortunately, I put it on my skin before I decided to double check the ingredients.  Ugh!!!!!</li>
    <li> 10 months ago, I fell over the hose while filling the car at the gas station &amp; I first landed in a kneeling position on the concrete.  My foot caught in the hose &amp; I broke my ankle and also had horrific scrapes just below both knees.  Over-confident with the crutches in the first days, I tripped and re-gashed one of the knee wounds.  I probably should have gone for stitches, but nursed the wound from home and actually had to take a round of antibiotics when it got infected.  The result was 2 really BIG, red-wine colored scars just below each knee. I noticed the Nutribiotic Skin Serum on the website when I was re-ordering a Rice Protein Powder and I decided to try it because I read about the success rate burn victims have using this serum. I thought if it helps heal burns, then it must be able to help my burgandy-colored scars.  After only 2 months of dabbing this on my dark-red-wine-colored 2\\&quot; scars, one scar is 100% flesh tone and the other is 50% lighter, still dark burgandy but only around the edges now and I have hope for cont&#x27;d improvement! HALLELUJAH!! I am caucasian, tan fairly easily, and I am THRILLED with this product.  Recently, I began using this serum as a base to my moisturizer (I&#x27;m just beginning to see fine lines around the eyes when I smile-age 51) and I also have my teen daughter using the serum (it&#x27;s not oily) on marks she has from healed acne.  I highly recommend this product for multiple uses!! I hope this helps anyone considering trying this product.</li>
