<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been working on a full back piece. With a lot of surface area covered, my artist suggested I get this. It made my skin heal so quickly and soothed the itching. The smells great too. A little goes a long way. I used about half of this over about 8 sessions. Only downside is it is oily, so beware of what clothing touches it.</li>
    <li> Soothing long lasting after care. Little goes a long way! My new after care product for sure</li>
    <li> Great product. I seriously love it!&lt;br /&gt;Me and my man use it everyday on all of our tattoos!</li>
    <li> This is the best for healing tattoos - used by the artist during the session and works wonders for healing!</li>
    <li> I was in search of a vegan and natural or organic  tattoo balm for my first tattoo and I came across this one! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It&#x27;s 100% vegan, the ingredients are great, and it glides on smoothly. My tattoo artist used this while he was tattooing and him as well as another tattoo artist commented on how perfect it goes with my skin. The majority of my tattoo was not painful at all, whether or not that was related to this product, I&#x27;m not sure, since it was my first tattoo. But I love this product! I will always be using this tattoo balm in the future.&lt;br /&gt;*The tattoo still isn&#x27;t finished, but here is what it looked like after the first session!</li>
    <li> great product.  Leaves no oily residue. smells great and overall heals the area affected much faster</li>
    <li> Best. Ever. Used it for all 60 hours of my tattoos!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff on all the work for my half sleeve and it&#x27;s amazing!!!! My shop charged $35 for the same thing so this deal is great!!! It&#x27;s kind of stiff but once the heat of your skin hits it, the butter sort of melts and a little goes a long way. I love the smell too!!! Best tattoo care I&#x27;ve tried out of all of them.</li>
    <li> Best tattoo balm ever..did have a handful of clients that broke out in a rash. All in all, great product..better than lotion!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My tattoo was 6 days in healing when I received this and was starting to peel and itch. I applied this and could not believe how quickly it stopped itching and the peeling was not as obvious. I had been using Aquaphor (which another artist had recommended) but my new artist said to use this and order the largest tub I could find. The difference is incredible and would recommend this to anyone getting any size tattoo!</li>
    <li> Heard all about this product around town tried everything else didn&#x27;t help with the healing process this works excellent and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Is a bit greasy but a dab from a paper towel after you apply it takes care of that.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious!  Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. This stuff is a little slice of heaven. I was using aquaphor before and was getting prickly heat from what I guessing was the patroleum in the ointment. The second I put the hustle butter on it felt a lot better. No more stinging and itching. It&#x27;s really creamy and easier to spread on than the aquaphor which is thick and goopy. It also smells amazing. I wish I knew about this stuff before I got the tattoo. It&#x27;s been 3 days since I got my tattoo and I received the hustle butter in the mail today. My tattoo artist used it when giving me the tattoo but I bought some right after when he told me about it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, that is for sure.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my incredibly picky husband. He has used it for about 3 days and likes it so much that he told me to order him more of it. He works in the automotive body repair industry so when he has a new tattoo especially on the forearm, it takes a lot of abuse and really hinders the healing process. He has to cover them while he is working because the skin is so tender that it cuts and scrapes really easy. Obviously covering a fresh tattoo is not the best thing to do, but the hinderance from covering it is a lot less than it getting scraped raw if it isn&#x27;t covered. He noticed a difference in the healing speed with this cream the first night that he used it. I don&#x27;t know what it is (or isn&#x27;t) in the ingredients that makes this cream so superior in the healing process, but it is amazing how well it works. I have already ordered him some more.</li>
    <li> i have been getting tattoo work for 30 years, and in that time, i have tried A LOT of different after care products before settling on aquaphor which i used for most of my life. there is nothing really wrong with aquaphor, but it is sticky and is a pain in the ass to use, but i have always began to peel  around 5 or so days after getting work. i was introduced to hustle butter a little over a year ago and after a large piece. i noticed right away while being tattooed that it actually felt different, didnt swell as much, didnt burn as much and afterwards, it was calm as could be. i wasnt yet aware that my artist had used hustle butter while tattooing me. it wasnt til afterwards that he suggested using it as after care where he told me that he was using it for the tattoo. i took some packets home with me. i love the way it smells, i love that a little bit goes a long way, and it doesnt stick to your sheets or cloths. in about 3 to 4 days i actually peeled. i was surprised but didnt think much of it. since then, i have something like 40 hours in the chair over several sessions and in all of those sessions, hustle butter was used for the actually tattooing and for the after care and each time, i have healed in 3 to 4 days. this stuff is the real deal, dont buy into the hype. one of these jars will go a loooooong way. it is a little stiff in the container, but the second you put a finger on it, it liquifies and goes on like...well, like butter! ask your artist if he can tattoo you with this stuff and see if im bulls***ting.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Shipped super fast! And it heals tattoos super quick!</li>
    <li> I cant actually use this product when I first get tattooed I prefer to wash with anti bacterial soap and use an ointment for the first 3 days or so but after that this product is a dream, absolutely love it for healing tattoos and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I just got a tattoo and was told to use this product it is the best thing on the market if you&#x27;re having one or plan to have one use it its great the healing process was faster and I use it everyday since then</li>
    <li> Best tattoo care on the market</li>
    <li> Amazing! This product is the best! Couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it. Keeps the tatto looking brand new, the burning sensation goes away almost instantly.</li>
    <li> It took a little bit longer to get here than expected but I LOVE this stuff. Hands down the best post tattoo moisturizer ever. And as a bonus it smells fantastic. I end up using it as lotion a lot.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Smells great and heals even better!</li>
    <li> Healing was so much quicker than using any other cream I have used.</li>
    <li> Best stuff you can get for Tattoo recovery. Have a full sleeve and have used many products over the years and this stuff rocks. I have sensitive skin and things like bag balm and the like irritate my skin after a few days of use. This stuff I can use for weeks at a time with no irritation at all. Smells amazing too. Heals like no other. I also use it to moisturize from time to time and it makes the art pop. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used this for after care for my new tattoo. Smells amazing and my tattoo healed very quickly and looks great. Recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Good for my big tattoo ...is comfort, no stick, very recommended, for tattos big and small everything enjoy for you tattoo.</li>
    <li> Great product, heals the work perfectly and smells amazing my artist used it during the tattoo and I continued care after</li>
    <li> My tattoo artist uses this &amp; it works great. Shipping to forever....but the butter is great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Hustle Butter is the best when it comes to tattoo care, used during the tattoo and after its done makes it the easiest care I have ever had for my tattoos. And it smells amazing.  Update: After getting three more tattoo&#x27;s and using this during and after the tattoo I am in love with it even more, its soft, melts right in the tattoo to keep it soft and heals well. Keep in mind if this lotion gets hot and melt it will become grainy, which does not affect the healing effect but some people don&#x27;t care for the texture.</li>
    <li> If you use anything else for tattoo aftercare or skin care, swap to hustlebutter. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It smells wonderful, is organic, and soothes the skin. I even use it on my lips hands and face!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome product, tattoo healed very quickly and I enjoyed the mango butter scent. Works well on dry skin too.</li>
    <li> Yummy product for your tattoos!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to order more of this and will use on all future art work so amazing will buy again</li>
    <li> Bought my first hussle butter on vacation in Florida at the tattoo shop at universal studios for my tattoos.loved it from the start just ordered my second tub and will have to order another.. My daughter is using it on her eczema with very good results... Who knew she had a flair up on vaca and this is what we had...so will keep it on speed dial for our family needs.</li>
    <li> I used this on the recommendation of a co-worker and I have to say, it was awesome! I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells amazing it keeps my tattoo super moisturized and it&#x27;s helping heal it really quickly and the added mint ingredients give it a cooling effect without burning. I recommend this stuff to everyone. It&#x27;s a little expensive for the size but you only need the tiniest bit to cover a quite a bit.I even use it on dry spots on my skin. I&#x27;ve always used coconut oil for dry skin but this had some many other natural oils to help. Love love love!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. The best.</li>
    <li> I used this for my tattoos and it was amazing healing and kept very moisturized</li>
    <li> This body butter was great in healing up the first parts of my full-back tattoo. I&#x27;m still waiting on the artist&#x27;s availability to complete the art, but it&#x27;s about 30% done now, and everything heals up within a week or so after getting the work done. Since the artist I&#x27;m going to presently uses the &amp;#34;dot method&amp;#34; a lot, and the work includes a great amount of detail in a small space, there&#x27;s a lot of healing necessary... this expedited that process significantly!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I use it while tattooing and it reduces redness also helps the needle go in smoother and smells great recommend it everyone even as a regular skin care product my gf loves it</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good I&#x27;d eat it.  Used it well beyond tattoo heal time on dry knuckles thru winter.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have ordered it 3 times.</li>
    <li> Great product. Will never use A&amp;D again!!</li>
    <li> Great tattoo cream!-Helped speed recovery and this beats those other &#x27;creams&#x27; hands down. Recommend :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hustle Butter twice now and will use it every time I get a new tattoo. Its great stuff.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, and smells awsome</li>
    <li> Received 2 containers and hard as a rock. Bought one at the tattoo parlor and it was creamy. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> It helps heal tats, but caused big blemishes on both my husbands and my arm. I use coconut oil now.</li>
    <li> A tattoo artist in Bermuda raved about this stuff while he used it before, during, and after finishing my tattoo. Now I see why... it&#x27;s simply AWESOME. It makes new tattoos feel really protected and nourished... look at the ingredients... I swear the healing time is cut in half. I could not say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> it smells awesome and it does a nice job of keeping SOME of the redness down when you&#x27;re working, I personally don&#x27;t think it is a full replacement for a and d, especially for lining i think the ointment is superior. the price is steep and the shipping cost is high. There is a lot of hype about this stuff but I don&#x27;t think it is a real replacement, If i had to choose between AD ointment and Hustle Butter, Id have to give the edge to the AD. happy zapping.</li>
    <li> Ship fast live this stuff</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and provides great moisture! I have only used it for post-tattoo. Looking forward to using it during my next tattoo.</li>
    <li> I love it. Smells nice and really preserves the tattoo ....</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to be vegan to appreciate Hustle Butter.&lt;br /&gt;My tattoo artist  knows I&#x27;m vegan, so he used this on my last tattoo. I&#x27;ve used dozens of different aftercare products in the past, but this one is absolutely the BEST. Most vegan aftercare  products are very expensive for a small amout, but at less than $20  for 5 full ounces this  is a real bargain. It&#x27;s very soothing, not greasy and healed my skin beautifully. Although there are no added fragrances, the natural ingredients have a very pleasant mild aroma.</li>
    <li> I bought tubs to use while tattooing and while healing and I&#x27;m very happy with it in both respects.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s helped heal one on my thigh in about 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed pigment flowing with a lot more fluidity while I&#x27;ve been tattooing as well. It&#x27;s not spilling out uncontrollably, but I&#x27;m not getting a lot of build up in my tube towards the end.</li>
    <li> Smells good works well.</li>
    <li> Got a new tattoo a few months ago and the shop where I got it had these for sell (in packets though). I can&#x27;t really say whether or not it made my tattoo heal more quickly (haven&#x27;t had a tattoo for 5 years), but it did soothe it. Smells great and makes my tattoo look nice.</li>
    <li> Great butter I highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Definitely recomend for anyone that has tattoos or wants to get one!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for tattoos I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m pretty heavily tattooed and for my most recent tattoo, my artist used this while he was tattooing. The smell is pleasant (pleasant enough for me to use on a regular basis even when there&#x27;s no tattoo being healed) but didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Note, I do not have sensitive skin to begin with so feel free to take that with a grain of salt. He gave me a small sample to use after I unwrapped my new addition in place of aquaphor. I loved how my skin didn&#x27;t get sticky or gross feeling after and i immediately purchased a whole jar for myself. I also really loved how I didn&#x27;t have to switch to a lotion and could just stick with one product from start to finish. Will use again. I can&#x27;t say it healed my tattoo any better or faster than previous methods as that&#x27;s never been an issue for me but I do really prefer the feel of this on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best ever been getting tattooed for 30 yrs this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> I love it. Healing real fast. Got a cover up on my neck and my skin stays real soft. Doesn&#x27;t ever feel dry. I can move my neck around and not feel like I&#x27;m tearing the scabs.</li>
