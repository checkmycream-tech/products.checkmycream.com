      <li>love the swedish dream line.</li>
      <li>Perfect facial soap.</li>
      <li>I received a bar of it as a gift and had to have more.  </li>
      <li>Fiancé loves it she ordered more today</li>
      <li>This soap is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Gotta hand it to those crafty northerners!</li>
      <li>I had to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>Like many others, I fell in love with this soap.  </li>
      <li>I saw that the 5 star resort I went to was selling this brand, decided to read the reviews before purchasing and purchased from Amazon at a better rate.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>It is the most refreshing bar of soap.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful aroma and lasts a long time as well.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I used it that I was impressed not only with the fresh fragrance but the moisturizing effect.  </li>
      <li>Great soaps, leaves your skin moisturize not dry</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but I did enjoy it while I had it.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh, clean scent of this soap.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells so fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>The bar is t-h-I-c-k and a fresh scent awaits you!</li>
      <li>This purchase was worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>(via the box) - I want to share that it will totally and pleasantly, surprise</li>
      <li>The soap smell so good to me and last forever.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this gentle foaming cleanser.</li>
      <li>Refreshing for the skin and quite gentle.</li>
      <li>Gentle, very slight warm aroma - great soap - even for the face.</li>
      <li>I was a little surprised at the rather COUNTERINTUITIVE marketing tack these crafty Swedes took, although it makes perfect sense after using the soap.</li>
      <li>First off they aren&#x27;t available in retail stores.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite thing.</li>
      <li>Easy to layer under your favorite fragrance or simply go alone.  </li>
      <li>I first found this soap in Anthropology Store and after try it, I have to find it here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>I love buying soaps from different companies online.</li>
      <li>Have used this soap for several years now and love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>First purchased this soap at a botanical shop in Maine.  </li>
      <li>By now if you have read many soap reviews then you know I have purchased over (20) bars of luxury,European,cold cream or French soaps.</li>
      <li>tried this and will order more in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used seaweed soap in the past and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular to scents</li>
      <li>I love this soap for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>It looks like little pieces of embedded material, some kind of rotting matter of perhaps?</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing, but the fragrance does not agree with my body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In fact, once the soap gets in the shower and you have generated a lather or two, it has the same refreshing impact as the other product by the same company (Sea Salt) and the scent is much more mild than the dry bar would lead you to believe!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and stay clean!</li>
      <li>I love good tea and quality soap (french milled or glycerin/shea base) - weird combo maybe, but this scent is really incredible - fresh, long lasting without overpowering.  </li>
      <li>but I live in the dry, hot desert and noticed a difference.  </li>
      <li>extremly soft.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see all the dirt all over the bar</li>
      <li>It is more nourishing / moisturizing than the salt, but lasts a lot less long.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin and Celiac disease, so I have to be really careful about soaps that I purchase.</li>

    <li> This is my new favorite thing. It&#x27;s creamy and has a nice light scent. Perfect facial soap.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma and lasts a long time as well.</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to getting this, but 2 weeks after ordering, but, alas, they cancelled.  I&#x27;ve used seaweed soap in the past and loved it.  Hopefully it will be back in stock some day. Until then, I will always imagine what could have been.</li>
    <li> Have used this soap for several years now and love it!&lt;br /&gt;Smells so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, but the fragrance does not agree with my body chemistry.  Creates body odor for me.  Not good for me.</li>
    <li> This soap was drying.</li>
    <li> Fiancé loves it she ordered more today</li>
    <li> I first found this soap in Anthropology Store and after try it, I have to find it here at Amazon. The soap smell so good to me and last forever. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love it!  I had to purchase more.  Also, great seller!</li>
    <li> Great soaps, leaves your skin moisturize not dry</li>
    <li> I love this soap for my dry skin. I also have a scalp problem that medicine and shampoos do not work good on. I used this once to shampoo my hair and loved the results on my scalp. It helped with the flaking scalp and itch . Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Great soap with pleasant fragrance. I have very sensitive skin which usually reacts badly to scented body products but in this case my skin is smoother than ever! Also cleans well, even removing stubborn makeup!</li>
    <li> This soap is fabulous! Very nice light clean scent and non-drying. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful, clean, wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Found this soap in a little shop in Ogunquit, Maine. Oh my!  I think my partner and I smelled it over and over again because it just smelled *so* amazing!  It was $7.95 for the bar, so I know that neither of us would have gotten it if it hadn&#x27;t been something unreal!  Natural soaps with that type of scent are just hard to come by!  I also have very sensitive skin and Celiac disease, so I have to be really careful about soaps that I purchase. This purchase was worth every penny!  I even went online to save this soap to my Wish List so that I don&#x27;t forget the name!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Swedish Dream salt soap, but still quite good. It is more nourishing / moisturizing than the salt, but lasts a lot less long. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again, but I did enjoy it while I had it. Refreshing for the skin and quite gentle.</li>

It wasn&#x27;t until I used it that I was impressed not only with the fresh fragrance but the moisturizing effect.  It does lock in moisture, and I know you read that about almost any product like it but I live in the dry, hot desert and noticed a difference.  I still needed moisturizer, but this soap was pleasantly unlike others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Best smelling soap, a new favorite!</li>
    <li> Gentle, very slight warm aroma - great soap - even for the face.</li>
    <li> It is the most refreshing bar of soap.  It has a wonderful fragrance and a soothing effect on the face.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap ever!</li>
    <li> This soap smells sooooo good!  You can actually see the fleets of seaweed in the soap.  This works very well for people who have trouble with acne.  It cuts through the oil and cleans out your pores.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> If you have hesitated like I did to try this version of body soap from Swedish Dream because it was a bit too perfume heavy when you smelled it (via the box) - I want to share that it will totally and pleasantly, surprise you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, once the soap gets in the shower and you have generated a lather or two, it has the same refreshing impact as the other product by the same company (Sea Salt) and the scent is much more mild than the dry bar would lead you to believe!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and stay clean!</li>
    <li> extremly soft. fresher. greatest soap.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap. Does as it states and has a mild pleasant fragrance. Great for winter in the east.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, clean scent of this soap.  I received a bar of it as a gift and had to have more.  Will buy again.....</li>
    <li> By now if you have read many soap reviews then you know I have purchased over (20) bars of luxury,European,cold cream or French soaps. I love buying soaps from different companies online. First off they aren&#x27;t available in retail stores. Secondly speciality online or store fronts charge a fortune. The bar is t-h-I-c-k and a fresh scent awaits you!</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised at the rather COUNTERINTUITIVE marketing tack these crafty Swedes took, although it makes perfect sense after using the soap. I was surprised to see all the dirt all over the bar--I&#x27;ve never purchased a dirty bar of soap before. It looks like little pieces of embedded material, some kind of rotting matter of perhaps? I became concerned that I would actually be getting germs on myself, but after using it for months and not getting sick, I see now! It&#x27;s SO EFFECTIVE they put DIRT in it just to PROVE how AMAZING it is. Now, as a consumer appliance salesman, I&#x27;m thinking of pulling this card out and leaving some root balls or compost inside all of the washers in the showroom. Gotta hand it to those crafty northerners!</li>
    <li> First purchased this soap at a botanical shop in Maine.  I&#x27;m hooked!  Love the smell of this gentle foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> love the swedish dream line. have used the salt version of this line, love it. tried this and will order more in the future.</li>
