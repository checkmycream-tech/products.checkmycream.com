      <li>It is a very accurate representation of what you will be  dealing with.</li>

      <li>Now I&#x27;ve found this safer, cheaper, and better product.</li>
      <li>I am just in love with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The next morning you look at your beard and fall in love with it because it is perfect</li>
      <li>you should maybe leave on face for two hours to get better result even then under sunlight</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the Henna Hair dye.  </li>
      <li>And she said that the harvest moon rinses out easier, there is more henna in this bag.</li>
      <li>I took a chance with this and love it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>

      <li>There was NO irritation, NO negative reaction, just a great product that worked as advertised.</li>
      <li>It was easy to mix and use, and the earthy herbal scent was much better than the chemical dye smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to mix the light brown with the brown henna :)</li>
      <li>I top it off with a cheap shower cap that I cut some slits into for ventilation.</li>
      <li>It rinses out easily and has no harmful side effects on the hair or skin.</li>
      <li>I love it, and I love that I&#x27;m not using harsh chemicals on my hair - Henna is actually good for your hair!</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair and my hair didn&#x27;t seem any thicker at all.  </li>
      <li>smell is fine...</li>
      <li>you will be fine.</li>
      <li>The color looks very natural, leaving my hair look very healthy.</li>
      <li>Great results, I have used the national brand chemical beard dye a number of times, it never colors the grey and the color it does leave looks like it was put on with a marker.  </li>
      <li>The color was a rich redish brown</li>
      <li>And even though some did get on my skin the first time without my notice, it came out fine with just water and light scrubbing.</li>
      <li>The color does tint toward red, but overall it was easy to use, effective and a good alternative to chemical products.</li>
      <li>all super...</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t cover grey and you have to dye it more than 2 x to get the color to stay for more than a week.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply and lasts much longer than the over the counter dyes.</li>
      <li>I used the Harvest Moon henna about a month after my last chemical dye and the relief from the allergic reactions is amazing.</li>
      <li>I love that the grey looks like shinny light</li>
      <li>I used one rounded teaspoon of the dry powder, which you are told to mix with warm water until it is the consistency of yogurt.</li>
      <li>I am able to keep the white covered 100% of the time and no one knows I’m doing it.</li>
      <li>This product really works!</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling soft and smooth unlike most hair dyes.  </li>
      <li>Most of the drug stores in pittsburgh only have one product for men&#x27;s beard.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how henna would work out for me, but now I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;d never go back to the chemicals for coloring hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Asian American and it didn&#x27;t make my hair light brown as pictured, more a reddish hue.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell, similar to grass or maybe spinach.</li>
      <li>The henna dye covered all of grey nicely and the color looks natural.</li>
      <li>love henna hut henna,have used for 5 years,use dark brown and brown henna looking forward to new color, golden brown!</li>
      <li>Light Brown really livens up my color and hides the white hairs by coloring them reddish brown.</li>
      <li>And so much cheaper than highlights at the hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Wear</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I always had a light brown beard with blonde and reddish highlights.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It really only dies the gray hairs, and makes the rest of my hair more shiny, making it look like natural highlights.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product skeptically, and although it does have a strong algae like odor when applying it is wonderful (not as harsh smelling as chemical dyes).</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and looks completely natural and use less often than dye.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my light brown hair with grey.</li>
      <li>: takes an hour to dye and doesn&#x27;t reveal full color until 8 hours latter.</li>
      <li>I suspect daily brushing would wear it off quickly as well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Henna Hut.</li>
      <li>So far I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I think the light caramel is too much of  a contrast to my dark brown hair</li>
      <li>If you have a lot of white coming in on your beard, you cover the whole thing once at first.  </li>
      <li>No stains, no mess, no fuss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Harvest Moon Light Brown henna on dark/black brown hair with grey.</li>
      <li>I usually have to dye my beard more than is recommended.</li>
      <li>and then overnight settles into the lighter brown color with some red highlights (exactly the way my beard was before it turned gray).  </li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, the color is a coating, rather than something that penetrates the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>You can’t get this natural look with dye.  </li>
      <li>I covered my bathroom floor with an old towel, used gloves, and vaseline to protect my hairline.</li>
      <li>At first it turns a medium dark brown, but then washes down to medium brown with very light brown/yellowish highlights on the grey.</li>
      <li>Purchase a clean, soft bristle toothbrush Wet your beard, apply a little shampoo, and use the brush to GENTLY exfoliate your beard.</li>
      <li>I tried this product because my beard is now almost all grey and really wanted some color.  </li>
      <li>have used this a few times each year for a few years, and love it so much I plan to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>I used the light brown product, and it WILL appear a little green at first (not &amp;#34;leprechaun green,&amp;#34; just a little green tint) and that green WILL go away in 48 hours as the more natural light brown works in.</li>
      <li>Too bad, I would have liked it to be a success.</li>
      <li>The grey hairs have a light caramel highlighted look, and the dark brown hair has a reddish tone in sunlight.</li>
      <li>A tip would be to mix a smaller amount than needed and then use a touch up brush commonly found in most drug store root-dye kits to apply just where needed.</li>
      <li>You may mix just a tiny bit of this NATURAL product to do touch ups and the resistant gray hairs slowly take more and begin to last longer.</li>
      <li>I developed an allergy to chemical dyes and was getting blisters on my scalp, a rash on my neck, and constant bloodshot eyes.</li>
      <li>But the smell dissipates some after the henna is rinsed out and is completely gone after the hair is shampooed (for this henna to work properly</li>
      <li>It fades naturally without obvious root lines.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and have no desire to form red welts all over my face...</li>
      <li>this one bag will last me a long time (I keep my beard  pretty short.)</li>
      <li>It did take take two applications to completely cover the grey.  </li>
      <li>My hair is mostly grey and it covered it completely.  </li>

<li> This product came in and I followed the directions and applied to my whole head in case of a freak color (at least it would be even).</li>
<li> Plus it makes your beard fluffy and soft.  </li>
<li> Before, I had to dye my hair with harsh chemicals every two weeks to get those resistant grays at near $10 a time.</li>
<li> This product does not cover grey and I do not recommend it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it on my light brown hair with grey. At first it turns a medium dark brown, but then washes down to medium brown with very light brown/yellowish highlights on the grey. I love that the grey looks like shinny light highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine... just an earthy smell. The amount in the package can be divide to cover my shoulder length hair four times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says to only do root touch ups after the initial coloring, as the already colored hair will turn darker ... But I have found that I can cover all my hair, after each hair trim, every few months at this point of my partial greyness. It does seem to wash lighter through time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this a few times each year for a few years, and love it so much I plan to use it for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This henna covered my gray hairs well.  I am very satisfied with the results and will continue to use this product.  It rinses out easily and has no harmful side effects on the hair or skin. It does have a strong smell, similar to grass or maybe spinach. But the smell dissipates some after the henna is rinsed out and is completely gone after the hair is shampooed (for this henna to work properly the user has to wait 48 hours before shampooing the hair.)The benefits of this henna are worth the inconvenience of a slighty unpleasant smell. I don&#x27;t think the smell is any worse than the smell of chemicals in a hair salon.</li>
    <li> This product should not be sold...  it leaves your hair green, red and sometimes both colors. I would not recomm2nd to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tried this Henna product based on reviews and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair whatsoever.  I have really fine hair and my hair didn&#x27;t seem any thicker at all.  Didn&#x27;t notice any different conditioning than any other conditioner either.  I&#x27;m going to try it again though.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, and she loves it. She had been using Rainbow something???? And she said that the harvest moon rinses out easier, there is more henna in this bag. She is happy with the way the light brown colors her gray&#x27;s copper color. She will be using Harvest moon from now on.</li>
    <li> not the result I was looking for...you should maybe leave on face for two hours to get better result even then under sunlight the gray had an orange hue.</li>
    <li> You must use this every other day for a week, then ones a week will be find.follow direction to a t.and you will be fine. It&#x27;s not perfect but I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Price, Quality, Quantity, shipping... all super... really good stuff. I was looking for an alternative to expensive tubes..... and I was skeptical....but this paid off for me.... .I will re-up in a few months.... this one bag will last me a long time (I keep my beard  pretty short.)</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, item as described, will buy from again.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of a &amp;#34;natural beard dye&amp;#34; but have fallen in love with this product.  Easy to apply and lasts much longer than the over the counter dyes.</li>
    <li> I always had a light brown beard with blonde and reddish highlights.  This product is amazing and looks completely natural and use less often than dye.  If you have a lot of white coming in on your beard, you cover the whole thing once at first.  After an hour and rinsed off, the gray coming in still might look white for an hour or so and then changes color to blond and then overnight settles into the lighter brown color with some red highlights (exactly the way my beard was before it turned gray).  The next morning you look at your beard and fall in love with it because it is perfect and just they way you wanted it. What happened to all the gray?  You can’t get this natural look with dye.  I am just in love with this stuff.  Plus it makes your beard fluffy and soft.  And then once a week, do a touch up where it is wearing off and touch up any white roots that seem to show.  The remarkable thing about this stuff is it ends up covering the gray if it grows in.  I am able to keep the white covered 100% of the time and no one knows I’m doing it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sitting on the fence about this product, I advise you to go to the Henna Hut Website and watch their video. It is a very accurate representation of what you will be  dealing with. If you are purchasing this to dye your beard, the product will last a L-O-N-G time, even with repeated applications. I used one rounded teaspoon of the dry powder, which you are told to mix with warm water until it is the consistency of yogurt. Purchase a clean, soft bristle toothbrush Wet your beard, apply a little shampoo, and use the brush to GENTLY exfoliate your beard. Use the back of the spoon to apply the dye (watch the video). Wait an hour, rinse. I used the light brown product, and it WILL appear a little green at first (not &amp;#34;leprechaun green,&amp;#34; just a little green tint) and that green WILL go away in 48 hours as the more natural light brown works in. If you are wary of traditional hair dyes...I have sensitive skin and have no desire to form red welts all over my face...THIS is the product for you. There was NO irritation, NO negative reaction, just a great product that worked as advertised.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product.  It left my hair feeling soft and smooth unlike most hair dyes.  It did take take two applications to completely cover the grey.  I waited two weeks to apply the second application.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product skeptically, and although it does have a strong algae like odor when applying it is wonderful (not as harsh smelling as chemical dyes). I&#x27;m a male with short hair and thick dye resistant gray hairs on the sides of my head. This product came in and I followed the directions and applied to my whole head in case of a freak color (at least it would be even). It worked wonderfully and lasted in the grays  for about a week. That sounds negative but it is not. You may mix just a tiny bit of this NATURAL product to do touch ups and the resistant gray hairs slowly take more and begin to last longer. After four weeks and 3 uses, I would suspect this product will last me for at least two or three months. Before, I had to dye my hair with harsh chemicals every two weeks to get those resistant grays at near $10 a time. Now I&#x27;ve found this safer, cheaper, and better product. A tip would be to mix a smaller amount than needed and then use a touch up brush commonly found in most drug store root-dye kits to apply just where needed. And even though some did get on my skin the first time without my notice, it came out fine with just water and light scrubbing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian American and it didn&#x27;t make my hair light brown as pictured, more a reddish hue. The product worked though!  It covered up my gray and colored my hair.   Note, you&#x27;ll need other items before you start:  shower cap, plastic gloves, a towel, and something to put the product on your hair (like a brush for a dye kit or something like it). If you get the mixture on your hands, no big, it soaps off. Henna is great for pregnant women, as my doctor recommended no chemical dye jobs for the duration of the pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Results exceeded my expectations...  I wasn&#x27;t sure how henna would work out for me, but now I&#x27;m positive that I&#x27;d never go back to the chemicals for coloring hair.  Follow the directions &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I did not see a color changing my hair. It was messy and it stank. My floors are still stained?</li>
    <li> The color does tint toward red, but overall it was easy to use, effective and a good alternative to chemical products.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd or 4th time that I&#x27;m using this henna product. It leaves my hair thicker and it shines like never before. The color looks very natural, leaving my hair look very healthy. I&#x27;m now applying this henna product every 2 weeks to nourish my hair and make it thicker...***One package is enough for 2 applications***.</li>
    <li> I use it to dye the white hairs on my beard. It works great. You must follow pre-application cleaning instructions. Eventhough his product is gentle on my beard, it is very effective, I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my beard all hard &amp; prickly as the other hair dyes that you find @ pharmacies &amp; stores.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dark hair, and a lot of it. Gray strands are forming. I used this brand once on all my hair (that was a bit of a mess), but now I just touch up the roots every 6 weeks. Even though I have a lot of hair 1/4 of a bag is usually enough to touch up 1/2 inch of roots. It takes me 10 minutes to apply, wait 60 minutes, rinse out, done. It really only dies the gray hairs, and makes the rest of my hair more shiny, making it look like natural highlights. I love it, and I love that I&#x27;m not using harsh chemicals on my hair - Henna is actually good for your hair! And so much cheaper than highlights at the hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves (I just got a box of Latex gloves). Pour some powder into a bowl, add a little bit of vinegar (makes the color stay longer), and drizzle in just a little water at a time, stirring with a spoon, until it has the texture of yogurt. Apply in sections to your hair. I top it off with a cheap shower cap that I cut some slits into for ventilation. Wait 1 hr, rinse out well. Don&#x27;t shampoo for 2 days, just rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;Note: your hair will smell of henna for a few days.</li>
    <li> Great coverage for chemical free product.</li>
    <li> Product works however, sometimes color fails to cover white hair and sometimes looks like a rainbow, no burn effect like just for men!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover grey and you have to dye it more than 2 x to get the color to stay for more than a week.  I went back to regular hair dye.</li>
    <li> love henna hut henna,have used for 5 years,use dark brown and brown henna looking forward to new color, golden brown!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the color, it was almost a perfect match for my natural, pre-gray shade. I noted the length of time and odd smell other reviewers mentioned, but I factored that into my expectation before using the product. I&#x27;d give it five stars except for one thing - being a \\&quot;stomach sleeper,\\&quot; the color was scrubbed off the surface of my beard overnight. It just has no staying power whatsoever when met with a little friction. I suspect daily brushing would wear it off quickly as well. As far as I can tell, the color is a coating, rather than something that penetrates the hair shaft. Too bad, I would have liked it to be a success.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the Henna Hair dye.  The package says leave in for 45 minutes to an hour but I am going to try 2 hours next time.</li>
    <li> This product does not cover grey and I do not recommend it.  Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Very happy first time user! I developed an allergy to chemical dyes and was getting blisters on my scalp, a rash on my neck, and constant bloodshot eyes. I used the Harvest Moon henna about a month after my last chemical dye and the relief from the allergic reactions is amazing. It was easy to mix and use, and the earthy herbal scent was much better than the chemical dye smell. I covered my bathroom floor with an old towel, used gloves, and vaseline to protect my hairline. No stains, no mess, no fuss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Harvest Moon Light Brown henna on dark/black brown hair with grey. The grey hairs have a light caramel highlighted look, and the dark brown hair has a reddish tone in sunlight. I think the light caramel is too much of  a contrast to my dark brown hair so the next time I do my hair I&#x27;m going to mix the light brown with the brown henna :)</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me. After 3 tries it turned my beard green.</li>
    <li> Great results, I have used the national brand chemical beard dye a number of times, it never colors the grey and the color it does leave looks like it was put on with a marker.  I tried this product because my beard is now almost all grey and really wanted some color.  The henna dye covered all of grey nicely and the color looks natural.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and the dye wipes out.  Almost entirely.  I am just not sure this works on white hair.  On the brown hair, it made it darker for awhile.</li>
    <li> This product really works!</li>
    <li> I SUFFERED FOR YEARS With other hair dyes. Now my hair looks great and my scalp and skin are healthy. No more burns or rashes from the other hair dyes.  I highly recommend Henna Hut.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different Henna formulas plus other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; dyes. This is by far the best brand. I had medium brown hair that has changed to about 20% white gray hair and the rest is charcoal or asphalt gray. Light Brown really livens up my color and hides the white hairs by coloring them reddish brown. I leave it in for one hour, and rinse it out with cream rinse. I have used this color about six times and I really like it. It fades naturally without obvious root lines. Really great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than anything offered at the drug store. Most of the drug stores in pittsburgh only have one product for men&#x27;s beard. I took a chance with this and love it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: this is not harsh on my skin, does not stain my beard a black color like the other dyes, does not stain my skin, and the product has instructional videos online plus a Q and A section on the companies web site that is actually helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: takes an hour to dye and doesn&#x27;t reveal full color until 8 hours latter. Because I have three different hair textures and colors(blond, brunette,and gray) I usually have to dye my beard more than is recommended. Plus it does stink a bit.&lt;br /&gt;However, I use this product once every week and a half vs twice a week with the other product. Highly happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is mostly grey and it covered it completely.  The color was a rich redish brown and i am very happy with it.</li>
