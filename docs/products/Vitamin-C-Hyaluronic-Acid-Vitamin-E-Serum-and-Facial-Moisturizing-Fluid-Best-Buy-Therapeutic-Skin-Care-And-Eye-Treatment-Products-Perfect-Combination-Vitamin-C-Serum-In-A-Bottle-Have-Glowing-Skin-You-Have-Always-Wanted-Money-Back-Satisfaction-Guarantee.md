      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so confident on this serum that I&#x27;ve already bought my provisions for 3 months, and hope to buy more as I approach them end of my bottles.</li>
      <li>I just feel that my skin is more supple and not as itchy at it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m  excited about the difference adding this into my routine made!</li>
      <li>I saw this product, and go so excited!</li>
      <li>What I liked most was that it wasn&#x27;t tacky at all and immediately absorbed into my skin.  </li>
      <li>The serum itself is non-sticky and absorbs quickly in the skin, which is nice.</li>
      <li>She was mostly concerned with her neck and the appearance of wrinkles and lines that have started to form, she says the serum goes on very smooth and penetrates into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a light yellow/light orange in color</li>
      <li>The pump top has a cap to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>Reducing fine lines around eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>It is bottled in amber glass to protect it from the light, with a pump cap for easy application.  </li>
      <li>which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>so I was a bit nervous as I have acne prone skin, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product out; however, upon arrival I noticed it had been leaking in the cap.  </li>
      <li>My routine is to clean my face with my konjac sponge, and use this serum.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that I was very impress by the fast and incredible action this serum has on my face, it&#x27;s really amazing how a couple of drops are able to do so much, I&#x27;m 51 years old and never before used creams on my face,</li>
      <li>The most effective method for replenishing vitamin C in the skin is to go straight to the source, and apply it directly to the skin.</li>
      <li>how it make my face feel so fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>The serum is not sticky or oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a quality product and worth the investment.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better serums I&#x27;ve tried as far as value and quality.  </li>
      <li>I like to use this in combo with a derma roller right before bed.</li>
      <li>and it was my first time using Vitamin C</li>
      <li>I definitely be purchasing more after I run out.</li>
      <li>I like that the ingredients are natural and cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>I did receive this product in order to facilitate a review of it, but I would (and plan on) order it again because it not only makes my skin feel and look better, but it&#x27;s made in the USA, doesn&#x27;t test on animals, and doesn&#x27;t use junky filler ingredients.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  </li>
      <li>The fine lines are less visible and my skin feels smooth.</li>
      <li>but so far it has done exactly what I have wanted it to!</li>
      <li>hahaha)</li>
      <li>Item was received fast and as described.</li>
      <li>I do this this in the morning when i am getting ready for work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read/heard about vitamin C being good for your skin, but never really got around to trying any vitamin C related products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited that my fine lines are slowly disappearing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>like the little cute bottles this comes in.</li>
      <li>This vitamin C skin serum is viscous, with a pale golden color and a clean citrusy scent.  </li>
      <li>You can use it as is or put your regular moisturizer on right over it.  </li>
      <li>I also liked that a little bit (one pump) is enough to do my whole face and neck -- it&#x27;s also gentle enough to use around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>Vitamin C is an essential component in the body’s production of collagen and a potent antioxidant that can help rejuvenate aged and sun damaged skin.</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive skin and am allergic to almost anything.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I have been looking for something all natural for my face!</li>
      <li>personally I think it&#x27;s very overbearing.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this Vitamin C Serum over big name brands because IT DOES WORK and is extremely reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>My face felt alive with the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; from the hyaluronic acid...</li>
      <li>Also, the product smelled old.  </li>
      <li>so I wondered if they were just clearing out their old inventory.  </li>
      <li>My skin is smoother, it&#x27;s not oily and it looks better after only a few days of using it.</li>
      <li>If you like a very perfumed product, the natural &#x27;raw&#x27; scent might be a little off-putting for you, but I liked it.  </li>
      <li>The serum blends very well and is very light on the skin - which I like as I am prone to my face feeling heavy, clogged, and sweaty when I put on too heavy of a product.  </li>
      <li>I like how smooth my skin feels and breakouts actually seem less.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks less dull and more vibrant and uniform.</li>
      <li>He has slightly big pores and now, his face is a bit smooth than usual which was never the norm.</li>
      <li>I used this serum directly after using a micro dermabrasion facial.</li>
      <li>However, this product has a neutral scent, applies easy and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Being picky, I like the darker glass bottle which will help to keep the product fresher longer (no light damage) and the pump dispensed just the right amount of product</li>
      <li>It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive</li>

<li> I have a dark spot on my face</li>
<li> You may think this is a small bottle but a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> ,  The Vitamin C Serum has already made some of my dark Melasma spots a little lighter and it has even made my skin look a little smoother.  </li>
<li> Received bottle without a seal, opened and with dried contents stuck to the side.</li>
<li> The color is a bit weird  because it&#x27;s not clear as the other serums I have tried.</li>
<li> Few small pumps of the serum</li>
<li> I am anxious to see how it improves with continued use</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product seems been used before shipping, the bottle&#x27;s cap leaking brown liquid, no confident to put on my face.</li>
    <li> As serums go, this one has a nice scent and comes in a sizable bottle. Be careful around any broken or sensitive skin. It has a bite! I like it because that way I know its working. I like to use this in combo with a derma roller right before bed.</li>

If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it, it has a money back guarantee - you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose, but happier skin to gain!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read/heard about vitamin C being good for your skin, but never really got around to trying any vitamin C related products.

    <li> Amazing product!! I used this serum directly after using a micro dermabrasion facial. I was amazed at the difference adding this into my routine made! My skin feels refreshed and softer. The serum is not sticky or oily and absorbs quickly. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is by far the best serum I have used with great results.  It leaves my skin feeling nourished &amp; hydrated. It isn&#x27;t sticky like other serums I have used previously. I would recommend this Vitamin C Serum over big name brands because IT DOES WORK and is extremely reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and am allergic to almost anything. My skin varies between oily and dry, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to manage. I tried the VItamin C+ serum and immediately felt the difference. My skin is smoother, it&#x27;s not oily and it looks better after only a few days of using it. I have not had any allergic reactions and my skin feels hydrated. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> PureSouth Naturals sent me this to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I am already starting to see the results,  The Vitamin C Serum has already made some of my dark Melasma spots a little lighter and it has even made my skin look a little smoother.  I am anxious to see how it improves with continued use but so far it has done exactly what I have wanted it to! Great product...</li>
    <li> My mom likes this. She is using it twice a day and loves the way her face is looking and feeling. Reducing fine lines around eyes and mouth. Her face looks brighter and radiant; younger.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something all natural for my face! There comes a point in every woman&#x27;s life when she begins to try products on her face. Vitamin C is an essential component in the body’s production of collagen and a potent antioxidant that can help rejuvenate aged and sun damaged skin. The most effective method for replenishing vitamin C in the skin is to go straight to the source, and apply it directly to the skin. That is why I wanted to try this product. This product contains hyaluronic acid and vitamin E aslo which have their own healing properties. After using this product on my face, neck and hands for 3 days, I noticed a difference in my skin. The fine lines are less visible and my skin feels smooth. Some products in the past have had bad scents. However, this product has a neutral scent, applies easy and a small amount goes a long way. I apply it at night after I wash my face and before bed. My skin feels tightened also. Great product! I have a dark spot on my face and I hope this product will lighten it up.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking so great after using this. I&#x27;m excited that my fine lines are slowly disappearing. This is a quality product and worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this ASAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://c8fd1lgkqziy9rbgudv431qeax.hop.clickbank.net/\\&quot; target&#x3D;\\&quot;_top\\&quot;&gt;Click Here!&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li> This vitamin C skin serum is viscous, with a pale golden color and a clean citrusy scent.  The simple formula contains 20% vitamin C  plus vitamin E, as well as hyaluronic and amino acids.  It is bottled in amber glass to protect it from the light, with a pump cap for easy application.  It can be kept in the refrigerator for a cooling, soothing sensation when applied to dry, irritated, or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum moisturizes and protects the skin and will improve its appearance with regular use over time by increasing hydration, reducing the visual effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.  It also minimizes the appearance of enlarged pores and decreases shininess in oily areas.  It is intended for use on the face, but is equally effective on problem areas like elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.  The hyaluronic acid may help repair and replace damaged protein structures in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PureSouth Naturals provided vitamin C serum for evaluation and review</li>
    <li> I did get this as a part of a review and it was my first time using Vitamin C so I was a bit nervous as I have acne prone skin, but so far so good. I am going to keep using it. I like how smooth my skin feels and breakouts actually seem less.</li>
    <li> Item was received fast and as described. Thank you and would do business with again</li>
    <li> Received bottle without a seal, opened and with dried contents stuck to the side. Yuck! Wish I could have tried it :{</li>
    <li> They say a picture says a 1000 words... Well I was speechless when I got my product...it shows 3 bottles of product for the price... Only to get one in the mail I felt deceived... As for how the product works, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell as of yet.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this as a gift to my mom who is constantly complaining about how she&#x27;s starting to finally look her age. Like a lot of vitamin c serums the smell is very strong and personally I think it&#x27;s very overbearing. My mom agreed that the smell is terrible but after a few uses it gets tolerable and most importantly she started to see results when applying this to her skin twice a day. She was mostly concerned with her neck and the appearance of wrinkles and lines that have started to form, she says the serum goes on very smooth and penetrates into the skin quickly. I applied it to my neck as well just to test it and there was no greasy feeling left afterwards which is a huge plus. I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s a magical serum that will make you look 18 again but I have definitely seen an improvement in my mom&#x27;s skin within the last 3 weeks since she has been using the product so that&#x27;s why I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to try this product for my blog in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I say this is something you have to have after you try , absolutley love the glow to my skin! I will buy again</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was very impress by the fast and incredible action this serum has on my face, it&#x27;s really amazing how a couple of drops are able to do so much, I&#x27;m 51 years old and never before used creams on my face, but I&#x27;m so confident on this serum that I&#x27;ve already bought my provisions for 3 months, and hope to buy more as I approach them end of my bottles. 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been feeling my skin very dry since I start using it. Is that how it should feel?</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product out; however, upon arrival I noticed it had been leaking in the cap.  Also, the product smelled old.  I did send it back.  I had ordered this product as a daily deal so I wondered if they were just clearing out their old inventory.  I don&#x27;t know but I was disappointed with this, especially since the reviews were so good on it.</li>
    <li> VITAMIN C serums are beoming my fav!. I loveit!!!. I also like  how it make my face feel so fresh and clean. My routine is to clean my face with my konjac sponge, and use this serum. I do this this in the morning when i am getting ready for work. It is so refreshing, I feel more awake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m  excited about the difference adding this into my routine made! My skin feels refreshed and softer. My skin also for sure!face looks brighter and radiant. This serum  also helps in lifitng the fine lines and wrinkles I have! I have noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the little cute bottles this comes in. Its a good quaility and you can tell its made well. The pump top has a cap to keep it clean. Which makes this product easasy to use. You may think this is a small bottle but a little bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely be purchasing again.Im glad i recieved this product in exchange for my honest review. I suggest everyone gets this and add it to your routine!.</li>
    <li> I like this Vit. C serum for the reason that it does make my skin more fair, smooth and radiant. I just feel that my skin is more supple and not as itchy at it was on some days because I have combination skin. The good thing about this serum is that, you don&#x27;t have to put a lot. Few small pumps of the serum and it will work its magic on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that this serum is unscented as I prefer my serums to be scent-free. The color is a bit weird  because it&#x27;s not clear as the other serums I have tried. It&#x27;s more of a light yellow/light orange in color but it doesn&#x27;t matter to me because it works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also asked my husband to try it so we could see the effect on his face. Wow! My husband doesn&#x27;t have the clearest complexion in the planet (sorry honey! hahaha) but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or the serum is also doing wonders on his pores. He has slightly big pores and now, his face is a bit smooth than usual which was never the norm. I will keep observing the improvements on my hubby&#x27;s facial complexion and will try to update for any findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I do give it my thumbs up and will recommend it to everyone who wish to smoothen their fine lines, get fair complexion and supple skin.</li>
    <li> I saw this product, and go so excited! What a great price, i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I used it this afternoon as soon as it was delivered. My face felt alive with the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; from the hyaluronic acid... with no oily feeling afterwards! Invigorating! I love it! :)</li>
