<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have to use oxygen you know what a disastrous time you have keeping the lines untangled. This product will help keep those lines straight, it&#x27;s a godsend.</li>
    <li> They Worked great  they fit very tight in air line no leaks good price on them worth the money too</li>
    <li> REALLY I DON&#x27;T KNOW USE IT.</li>
    <li> Use them with a 50&#x27; tube and it helps some from getting tangled walking around the house after a few hours. Still have to unhook from the connector once a day and straighten the tube manually to keep the kinks out. It would help if the 50&#x27; tube was a little less stiff without compromising the strength and durability of the plastic. The swivel tubing connector does what it can by swivelling.</li>
    <li> works better then the one that the oxygen place gave us</li>
    <li> Way to &#x27;spensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Great gadget.  Keeps my oxygen hose from getting kinked up. (A situation that can drive you daffy.  Only have to replace REPLACE the hoses about once a month now, instead of weekly.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered these and I did so because they work. My mom&#x27;s line stays straight now. I think the oxygen is actually getting to her, and she hasn&#x27;t had nearly the tangle problem that had me worried about broken bones instead of oxygen. The only deduction is for the two that separated far too easily. They seem fragile, but worth the gamble. Shipping was fast and accurate. I recommend these if you need them.</li>
    <li> These connecters just don&#x27;t hold up under regular use and I wouldn&#x27;t consider using them again.</li>
    <li> This has saved my oxygen cord several times from getting kinked. When I see the hose start to wind up all I do is unwind around the swivel. I just love this one. Have tried others but this is the best on by far.</li>
    <li> They are nothing but crap. i have had two and when you go to disconnect them from the cannula or tubing they break into two parts</li>
    <li> My husband uses these for his oxygen tubing.  They help in unkinking the lines.</li>
    <li> I simply do not know what this is for.  I had hoped it would extend the tubing from the water container to the concentrator which is tight.  It wasn&#x27;t worth returning.  Clearly it has some other purpose.  If you can explain how it is used, that would be nice.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Connector can become partially unsnapped and leak at swivel joint if stepped on or caught by wheel of powerchair but can easily be snapped back to fix.  Does great otherwise in keeping the air hose from twisting and tangling.</li>
    <li> I had constant kinks in my o2 lines before I got this product. After I inserted the releaser into the o2 lines life has been easier. I don&#x27;t have to constantly unwind the lines. The work well and are worth the money as a good value.</li>
    <li> This connector has already fallen apart.  I am trying to figure out how to return it and get my money back.</li>
    <li> Probably the BEST one made!!!</li>
    <li> These things are great. I have one on the oxygen concentrator end of a 25 foot hose, and another on the nasal cannula end. No more tangled mess!</li>
    <li> I like how this product keeps my tubing from tangling but as I need to change tubing, I pulled it apart when I tried to remove tubing from it. Not able to repair it. Had to throw it away after a 1 month use. I did purchase another one to see if it was just my fault or the product. I also ordered a different kind and I&#x27;m using it now with no issues in removing tubing when needed. It&#x27;s up to you if you want to try this connector. It does what it is made to do, but unsure of it&#x27;s stamina.</li>
    <li> This works very well for long lines of oxygen tubing and an active person! Huge difference noted between having it and not.</li>
    <li> This is easy to install and helps reduce kinking but doesn&#x27;t eliminate it for the 50 foot cord my wife has. The 2 pieces will sometimes come apart when the tubing gets caught on something but are easy to push back together.</li>
    <li> These swivel connectors from Mes are the best that I have found. They look like there&#x27;s a glide gasket in them and they don&#x27;t wobble or catch. I have now replaced all my old swivels with this one.</li>
    <li> it does the job, but the design is a joke if you want to get up and walk around, the little burr that sticks out on it gets hung on every thing, and if you step on it by mistake, it will let you know real fast. Need to be more mobile friendly, a sleek new design. The price is a little much too, $4.75 for .25cents of plastic, really.</li>
    <li> What can I say this fit the bill perfect. With this swivel my wife&#x27;s oxygen does not get all tangled up. Highly Recommended. I bought a few for back ups.</li>
    <li> Excellent swivel.  No more tangles!!!!!</li>
    <li> While the swivel works well, it is difficult to get off and on because the entire surface is smooth.  If you don&#x27;t have to remove it then it works great.</li>
    <li> As ordered and of good quality.</li>
    <li> very good stopped all my problems with kinked coils of hose to trip over</li>
    <li> love it with the swivel</li>
    <li> I think this is a fantastic device.  I ordered it for my mother with 24/7 O2 usage to alleviate the problems she has with her 50 foot cord kinking up daily.  The connector works great in linking 2 25-foot tubes together, however the only issue is that my mom tinkers around with the connector and it disconnects in the center of it and appears broken.  She can&#x27;t figure out how to put it back together, so then I need to come over and reconnect it.  We have since gone back to one 50-foot kinking line because she can&#x27;t be without constant O2 flow. .</li>
    <li> I have purchased 6 of these connectors, 5 of which leak air.  As a result I do not get the oxygen that I need for everyday life.  I did have one that worked well until it broke.  When I went to replace it with one of the others, I noticed that it leaked.  After trying the other ones, I found out that they all leaked.  But I did just buy two more in the hopes that the quality control is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tubing swivel connector is really needed especially if one is use a 50 ft. tubing from the oxygenator that I use.  I have no need for it with my portable oxygenator. Just the one I use around the house.</li>
    <li> Not worth even the $5.00.  It broke the first time I tried to separate it from the main line.  Would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever!  No more kinks in my tubing and being strangled by twisted cannula tubing!</li>
    <li> I wrote an earlier review with a 1-star rating. This was a mistake. I ordered a similar product from a different company at the time I ordered here. This devise was on time, works very well and I am very satisfied. The other product was the one I wanted to give a one star rating.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement part of my mom&#x27;s oxygen machine and these were exact and priced very well. Came earlier than expected also! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very please with it.</li>
    <li> I truly cannot rate the product as it did not work out the way I wanted.  I  did not remember, I had a water trap on the line because we need the humidifier.  There is no way to make it fit hard plastic to hard plastic.  It is a really nicely engineered part and I kept them for some future needs.</li>
    <li> Everything satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This item is great!  It is the first time my oxygen tubing has not been kinked or tangled.  I have needed this for 2 years, glad I found it now.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Very helpful!</li>
    <li> It swivels only with great effort, it squeaks as it swivels, and if you accidentally tug on your hose, it comes apart at the seam.</li>
    <li> My mother in law uses 2- 25 ft hoses together. We added two swivels to this setup and now no more kinks. Great product.</li>
    <li> love it ...very helpful</li>
    <li> I have often worried about tripping over the twisted tubing from my O2 tubing. This tiny device  makes that almost a non-issue. I still have to look where I am going so I don&#x27;t trip over my own feet, but the twisted tubing is virtually gone. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really helps to keep my o2 tubing from getting tangled</li>
    <li> My husband loved it. No more twisting of the air line.&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
    <li> the connector works like advertised, I will be ordering more in the future, It makes keeping the hose kink free easier.</li>
    <li> My brothers 2 of them are much more comfortable walking around without all the oxygen lines always getting tangle this item  was the answer to more  easier life.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews before buying this connecctor and found that many people were unhappy because they had a hard time getting the cannullars disconnect from the tubing swivel. All you have to is get a Q tip and dip it in Baby Oil. Stick the Q tip into the opening of your canulars and lubricate the plastic. Then slide the swivel tubing in and stop a few milimeters before the end. I have a 25ft tube plus my 7ft nasal canula and no KINKS!!!!!  Now when you want to take it out, rock it back and forth, pulling out at the same time (like you would rock a tire stuck in the mud) and my tubing released after the 3rd rock. I had the swivel tubing for circa 3 weeks in there and it did not affect the \\&quot;priming\\&quot; at all.&lt;br /&gt;Now if you just want to take the swivel tubing out because you want to replace the cannula, you can of course just cut the old connection.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpful - Aggie</li>
    <li> This stops the annoying twisting of the cannula. The connection is hard to disconnect but I find that a plus. I just got a second hose for use at night with my CPAP machine and that solved the problem. My oxygen providers gives me all the hoses I need. Also, the connector will come apart if you pull too hard on the hose - it&#x27;s like a quick disconnect. Don&#x27;t worry all you have to do is carefully line up the two pieces and slide it all back into place. And I have to use a 7&#x27; cannula hose with this connector to gain two male ends - again no problem. I really don&#x27;t miss that twisted hose mess below my chin. And the main hose stays nice and straight too - it&#x27;s really a clever solution to an annoying problem. I like this connector!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly, kept my 50-foot line from kinking.  The only negative was it  broke fairly easily when attempting to remove it.  It is not repairable.  I&#x27;ll just be more careful with one in the future</li>
    <li> Delivered when promised  Delivered when promised in great shape. Was easy to order and was just what was advertised I will use this dealer again in great shape. Was easy to order and was just what was advertised I will use this dealer again</li>
    <li> does the job - keeps the tubing from kinking.  Previous connector broke because I changed between a cannula and mask for a few hours daily - it couldn&#x27;t handle the extra twisting/pulling pressure.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this little handy connector, it has made a big difference for me!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the swivel, unless someone signed for it and are failing to admit it?</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Makes it much easier to deal with 50 feet of hose.  Doesn&#x27;t prevent all tangles, but definitely helps.</li>
    <li> I would give this a 4.5. because I had a hard time assembling the tubes to the connector, but it is probably just me. it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.  I really appreciate these connectors</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these to trial and it is still holding up after three tubing changes.  It did come apart with the last change but I managed to snap it back together.  It does prevent kinking of the tubing as advertised.  It also tolerates the normal abuse of being stepped on, ran into walls, run beneath doors,  and the occasional cat attack.  As a nurse I know that these are not meant to last long.  In the hospital setting an item like this would be disposed of with each tubing change.  I see that some of the other reviewers are unhappy that the connector came apart when the tubing was changed.  Come on people, this item is small and constructed of several pieces of plastic.  It is made this way to allow it to swivel and decrease looping and tangling of the tubing which occurs with ambulation.  And it does this quite well.  But if you expect it to stay intact when you are pulling hard on it while  guessing about the proper way to remove it from the tubing you are probably expecting too much!  One reviewer suggested applying lubrication prior to putting the tubing and connector together.  I was able to remove my connector by holding it tightly at the center while gently pulling and rocking the tubing back and forth.  I suggest purchasing several of these as you would your tubing and cannulas.  Try changing it using the suggested tips and simply get a new one out if you need to.  While it is nice that this item will last for more than one tubing change it is asking a lot to expect it to never break. And it is a good idea to change all of the tubing including the connector on a periodic basis as this decreases the risk of infection.  Overall this is an inexpensive item which does not cost any more than connectors which do not swivel and holds up well to everyday use.  If it breaks during changing and needs to be replaced so be it.  I would be changing it periodically anyway to decrease risk of infection.  And it does such a nice job of preventing kinking of the tubing that it is just worth it!ng that it is just worth it!</li>
    <li> My mom does not move much but if she does it won&#x27;t be a twisted mess. Hopefully she won&#x27;t be needing it at all in 6 months.  Let pray!</li>
    <li> After 4yrs. of kinked and twisted line I was so glad to fine this connector. It does the job. I have no complaints, and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL WITH THE GREEN TUBING.  Delivery right on time</li>
    <li> For someone who uses oxygen regularly this is the best  swivel connectors I&#x27;ve ever found&lt;br /&gt;As long as care is taken When disconnecting there should be no problems With the unit coming apart</li>
    <li> Loved the fact it keeps my oxygen tubing straight and doesn&#x27;t twist and knot up like before. Price very reasonable</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for your prompt courteous service. I now don&#x27;t get tangled up in the tubing. Would definitely use you again if the need arises and would recommend you as well.</li>
    <li> It did stop my oxygen hose from kinking. Wish I had this a long time ago. I don&#x27;t have to replace hoses as often as before.</li>
    <li> Works as supposed to..</li>
    <li> This brand swivels much freer than some of the others I have tried.  The lenghts of the ends are a little long and make it hardeto get my hoses connected but it really doesn&#x27;t present a problem.  I like there connectors!</li>
    <li> MY AIR TUBEING  NO LONGET GET TWISTED ..  NO LOSS OF AIR FLOR DUE TO AIRTUBING GETTIN PINCHED IF  YOU  NEED OXYGEN  THIS  IS THE PERFICT ,,,I HAVE NOT LOSS MY AIR FLOW  THIS SEIVEL  I CAN NOT SAY  THANK  YOU  ENOUGH. I WAS GOING AROUND TRYING TO UNBUNCH IN TIST AND UNKINK MY AIRTUBE,</li>
    <li> This is great! I was amazed at how it keeps my 50 ft. cord from being tangled up like it had been before I bought this. Now, I don&#x27;t spend hours undoing a tangled cord. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I cannot say for sure that the quality is poor on this productut, but it came apart in just two weeks.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Just as described. Came when promised.</li>
    <li> Wow!  What a difference.  Had that 50 foot long hose constantly kinking up, saw this connector, thought I would give it a try.  Easy to &amp;#34;install&amp;#34;, had no problems with it, does not leak.  Most important, No More Kinks!  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> My O2 hoses tied themselves in knots with this connector.  It only worked to release the kinks if I manually twisted it.  I will not be using in the future.</li>
    <li> Purchased based on other reviews. Hoping this will solve problem of kinks that obstruct flow of oxygen. It is a very smooth turning accessory.</li>
    <li> excellent product, price and service.</li>
    <li> Worked well, It did help keep those loops and twists out of my 50&#x27; hose. Somewhat over priced as most of these items are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this swivel for for about a year now - I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of them. My 7&#x27; cannula is connected to a 25&#x27; hose, with this swivel in between. It does help keep the long hose from kinking up as much as it would without a swivel, but there is always some twisting, even with other brand swivels I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that the connector snags on something as simple as the baseboard corner of 2 walls. I installed nice base and added quarter-round to that, slightly rounding the corner with sandpaper, hoping it would help prevent the snags. Didn&#x27;t help (the base looks great though). Occasionally the hose gets wedged up at the top of the wheel and the bottom of the concentrator. If I tug on the hose when it or the swivel get caught, sometimes - too often - the connector comes apart at its seam. It&#x27;s easy enough to snap back together, but it becomes a real source of irritation when it happens during a time of distress or when my hands are full. I sometimes wonder if it would be better if it would, instead, pull the cannula from my face. Maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t someone make a cannula/hose swivel connector that doesn&#x27;t get hung up on the slightest obstacle. I&#x27;d be willing to pay a premium for a device like that. Anyway, I finally got tired of having to snap the swivel back together. I worry that it also gets dirt in there. So, I&#x27;m done with this brand and am shopping for a different one. Thought I should leave my review while I&#x27;m doing that.</li>
    <li> This product works really well has kept my O line tangle free. To use in the middle of your O line you will need the proper fittings.</li>
    <li> Always good to be able to connect oxygen hoses together, and these are awesome</li>
    <li> Really solves the kinking problem.  An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Good product. Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The o-rings between the two pieces leaked. Couldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> works and does awesome job keeping the hose unkined</li>
    <li> Work great and not a bad price!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to attach 2 lines together.</li>
    <li> Very handy to stop kinks.  Do not pull to hard or you will break it when changing lines.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet, but they were delivered on time, and in working order.  I see nothing wrong with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Huge relief from prior tubing tangles.  A winner!</li>
    <li> The swivel connector solved the problem. No more kinking. Worked better than expected. Highly recommend this item. Glad I purchased the connector. It makes the difference.</li>
    <li> Works good. It is very hard to remove from the tubing once it is pushed in.</li>
    <li> Does what is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It works very well.. no more tubing all rolled up to have to untangle..</li>
    <li> IT DOES&#x27;NT REALLY HELP MUCH</li>
    <li> 1) It works&lt;br /&gt;2) It hurts when you step barefoot on it, breaks often if stepped on while wearing shoes.&lt;br /&gt;3) fairly inexpensive and easily replaced when it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;4) it is a piece of plastic that does what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;5) I will buy again</li>
    <li> wrong item useless for me</li>
    <li> My wife has COPD and spends 18 hours a day connected to an oxygen concentrator via a 20m oxygen hose. The Oxygen tubing swivel connector kinking releaser that I purchased has proved invaluable as in moving around the house my wife now no longer experiences twisting or kinking of the 20m oxygen hose. We are overjoyed at the purchase and most impressed with the overall service received from date of order placement.</li>
    <li> Started leaking after two days.</li>
    <li> It works great for my husband and does what it supposed to do.</li>
    <li> No more tangled mess under my chin!!!  The 50&#x27; hose is no longer a kinked up mess!!!  I am very happy with this purchase!!!  This swivel has made life a bit easier for me....that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about!!</li>
    <li> This swivel connector has been absolutely what we oxygen users need.  It is totally frustrating to walk around all day with tubing dragging&lt;br /&gt;behind you and then you have to stop disconnect and get all the knots out of the line.  With this swivel connector you will not have to do&lt;br /&gt;that, your tubing will stay straight with no knots.  It is wonderful not to be all tangled up, thank you so very much for developing this handy&lt;br /&gt;easy to install device.</li>
