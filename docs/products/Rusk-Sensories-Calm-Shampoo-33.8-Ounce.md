      <li>This is one of my favorite shampoos of all times.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the texture.</li>
      <li>I tried this shampoo in a motel in Casper WY, and was extremely pleased.  </li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>

      <li>For fine hair you couldn&#x27;t do better.</li>

      <li>My hair is fine and falling out some as I age.&lt;br /&gt;Rusk</li>
      <li>and I would gladly have remained a loyal customer.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much I have curly hair and this shampoo cleans  and can be rinced out very easily</li>
      <li>makes hair smooth</li>
      <li>This shampoo works great for my coarse hair.</li>
      <li>Smells good, hair clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find the original in the stores anymore.</li>
      <li>The product has been reformulated so I was trying to order the original product pictured.</li>
      <li>I love the original but not the new sulfate free version.  </li>
      <li>I guess I am back on the hunt for a good shampoo.</li>
      <li>the older version that I love.</li>
      <li>It never fails to deliver the relaxed, clean look I like in my hair.</li>
      <li>the only kind, I&#x27;ve found</li>
      <li>Previously bought at salon and loved it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves it soft and easy to manage</li>
      <li>This product is very very watery.</li>
      <li>From other reviews I read, no one seems to like the new sulfate free kind.</li>
      <li>This is the exact shampoo that the golf resort at Bandon Dunes uses.</li>
      <li>Whereas the old Calm shampoo was concentrated and worked great for my normal but fine hair, the new formula is extremely watery and leaves a strange residue on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>You have to use twice as much.</li>
      <li>I have color treated hair and it help with the frizz and cleans very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I have very oily hair; it leaves it clean but not dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>I am accustomed to with this particular shampoo to a watery gray color.  </li>
      <li>My guess is that through shipping at high altitudes, the liquid expands.  </li>
      <li>Instead I received the new reformulated which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 of theses several months ago &amp; they were exactly as advertised,</li>
      <li>It is like someone dumped out half the bottle and then filled it up with water.</li>
      <li>I hate the sulfate free kind!</li>
      <li>Also, when it arrived it was leaking and made a huge mess in the box.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the same ones again from this same supplier &amp; they sent me the sulfate free ones.  </li>
      <li>I am really sad that this shampoo is no longer good.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels clean, fuller, and moisturized without that slightly limp and oily feel that some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos create.</li>
      <li>After having gone through two 33.8 ounce bottles of Rusk Sensories Calm shampoo previously I was dismayed to find that the bottle I just ordered is the &amp;#34;new, improved&amp;#34; formula with argan oil.  </li>
      <li>Sensories Calm Shampoo gives what little hair I have some fullness and brightens it up as well.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, I just bought another bottle from another vendor for less than half the price I paid for this one and it IS the correct version.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Bring the old one back Rusk!</li>
      <li>What is strange is that when I received it, it looked normal but over the course of about a month (and I had not even used it yet), it turned from the bluish color</li>
      <li>I even tried shaking it up really well and turned it upside down.  </li>
      <li>It really is like someone dumped half of it out and replaced it with water or baby oil.  </li>
      <li>Economical because I only use a small amount - about the size of a nickle.  </li>

<li> Economical because I only use a small amount - about the size of a nickle.  </li>
<li> Also recommend Rusk Thick spray for extra volume -- it really does work.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed that Rusk changed this formula as the old Calm shampoo was really fantastic</li>
<li> Cleans my hair really nice and does not bleach out any of the red base dye that is used in my hair for my ombre look.</li>
<li> The lids on all 3 was loose and leaked into package.</li>
<li> The first time I ordered, it was like glue( thick and heavy).</li>
<li> I noticed from the beginning how it would feel very dry in my hair and my hair would get all tangled up as I was washing it.</li>
<li> This shampoo does not contain sulfates, however, it still has to clean your hair, so instead they use ALCOHOL to clean your hair of dirty oil!!!</li>
<li> I am extremely frugal and I do not throw anything away.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> the other one-star reviews:  </li>
<li> Other than that the product was as advertised.</li>
<li> The bottle did leak a little when delivered</li>
<li> The shampoo was thick and not watered down like I have read in some other reviews.</li>
<li> However, the conditioner is too heavy.  </li>
<li> This seemed to be watered down or outdated.</li>
<li> so I cannot verify whether this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula uses alcohol, but another reviewer testifies that it does and I agree that alcohol is the absolute worst thing you can use on your hair!!!!  </li>
<li> I have thin hair &amp; have no problems with this shampoo leaving my hair oily after using it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d recommend Rusk conditioner if you have thin hair.</li>
<li> This is false advertising.</li>
<li> This is by far the worst shampoo I have ever used</li>
<li> There&#x27;s something wrong with it.</li>
<li> Unfortunately all 3 shampoos that were wrapped separately leaked.</li>
<li> It is watery, smells bad, and leaves a residue on my hair.</li>
<li> So when I looked at the ingredients, I was shocked.</li>
<li> This is false advertising!!!</li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Previously bought at salon and loved it.  This seemed to be watered down or outdated.</li>
    <li> Beware!! This shampoo does not contain sulfates, however, it still has to clean your hair, so instead they use ALCOHOL to clean your hair of dirty oil!!! I am extremely frugal and I do not throw anything away. I had not choice, this product was drying my hair insanely, I had to discard it. I noticed from the beginning how it would feel very dry in my hair and my hair would get all tangled up as I was washing it. So when I looked at the ingredients, I was shocked. There is nothing worst for your skin and hair than alcohol!</li>
    <li> Lasts forever, has a nice smell. This is the exact shampoo that the golf resort at Bandon Dunes uses. Liked it there &amp; now found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d probably buy this for the scent alone but it&#x27;s also a good shampoo.  I recommend it and the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. Love the smell and the texture. Makes my hair feel and look good. (Well I think it looks good, heh). I have very oily hair; it leaves it clean but not dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is one of my favorites. I have color treated hair and it help with the frizz and cleans very well. The bottle did leak a little when delivered but oh well. The shampoo was thick and not watered down like I have read in some other reviews. RUSK products are always very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who thought a bar of soap was as good as shampoo.  Wife thought different and started buying me all different kinds of shampoo to try.  So so.  I tried this shampoo in a motel in Casper WY, and was extremely pleased.  Economical because I only use a small amount - about the size of a nickle.  Smells good, hair clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I love this; cleans and softens! Makes hair so manageable! I would recommend this product to anyone as it great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product strait from the cosmetic wholesale before, and it is way different.  The product from here is awful, sticky and leaves a nasty residue.  The actual product is not like this at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim at Walgreens, then ran out and found this on Amazon for a great price.  It leaves my hair silky smooth, and a little goes a long way.  Smells great.  My only concern was shipping, because the bottle leaked.  My guess is that through shipping at high altitudes, the liquid expands.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. I liked it. I doesn&#x27;t make hair freezy. I would recommend it to others. makes hair smooth</li>
    <li> The best shampoo period. Been using it for years. I am a professional cosmetologist and I know great shampoo. This is it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Rusk Products for decades. It is challenging to find it in store or salons, so I buy it on-line now. It never fails to deliver the relaxed, clean look I like in my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after purchasing a much smaller bottle at a local store to try it.  This 33.8 oz bottle was the same price as smaller bottle.  I am also very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> For fine hair you couldn&#x27;t do better. Use the conditioner, too.</li>
    <li> the only kind, I&#x27;ve found, that does not make my head itch.  It does not protect color, though, if you dye your hair</li>
    <li> The product has been reformulated so I was trying to order the original product pictured. Instead I received the new reformulated which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I swim five days a week and the chlorine was thinning my already thinning hair.  This stuff seems to keep the process under control.  when purchased in this large size which I use to refill the hotel size bottles is a good value.</li>
    <li> Ditto the other one-star reviews:  the formula has been changed and it&#x27;s terrible!  It really is like someone dumped half of it out and replaced it with water or baby oil.  I even tried shaking it up really well and turned it upside down.  I am away from my home at the moment so I cannot verify whether this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; formula uses alcohol, but another reviewer testifies that it does and I agree that alcohol is the absolute worst thing you can use on your hair!!!!  I am really sad that this shampoo is no longer good.  I&#x27;ve become more and more environmentally conscious, and I was so happy I had found a shampoo that worked so well.  I guess I&#x27;m back on the hunt.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of theses several months ago &amp; they were exactly as advertised, the older version that I love. I have been using this for about a year now. I recently purchased the same ones again from this same supplier &amp; they sent me the sulfate free ones.  I hate the sulfate free kind! It leaves a residue in my hair.  This is false advertising!!! Very disappointed! Why did they change the formula anyway? From other reviews I read, no one seems to like the new sulfate free kind. Bring the old one back Rusk!</li>
    <li> After having gone through two 33.8 ounce bottles of Rusk Sensories Calm shampoo previously I was dismayed to find that the bottle I just ordered is the &amp;#34;new, improved&amp;#34; formula with argan oil.  Whereas the old Calm shampoo was concentrated and worked great for my normal but fine hair, the new formula is extremely watery and leaves a strange residue on my scalp.  I am very disappointed that Rusk changed this formula as the old Calm shampoo was really fantastic and I would gladly have remained a loyal customer.  I guess I am back on the hunt for a good shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair &amp; have no problems with this shampoo leaving my hair oily after using it.  It&#x27;s a light shampoo and smells great.  However, the conditioner is too heavy.  I&#x27;d recommend Rusk conditioner if you have thin hair.</li>
    <li> Cleans my hair really nice and does not bleach out any of the red base dye that is used in my hair for my ombre look.</li>
    <li> This product is very very watery. You have to use twice as much. I have used this product before and it was not watery like that. It is like someone dumped out half the bottle and then filled it up with water. I won&#x27;t buy this from here again. There&#x27;s something wrong with it. Also, when it arrived it was leaking and made a huge mess in the box.</li>
    <li> I, too, have had this product from a salon. This is NOT that product. It is watery, smells bad, and leaves a residue on my hair. I won&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not even deserve one star.  What is strange is that when I received it, it looked normal but over the course of about a month (and I had not even used it yet), it turned from the bluish color I am accustomed to with this particular shampoo to a watery gray color.  It also says &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; on the bottle and I&#x27;ve never seen that before.  This is by far the worst shampoo I have ever used and I only used it twice.  It is slimy and didn&#x27;t even lather up.  I will not purchase from this vendor again.  What&#x27;s more, I just bought another bottle from another vendor for less than half the price I paid for this one and it IS the correct version.  This is false advertising.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately all 3 shampoos that were wrapped separately leaked. The lids on all 3 was loose and leaked into package. Other than that the product was as advertised. Thanks</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered, it was like glue( thick and heavy). The second time it was like water. Either Rusk has a problem with consistency or their distributors are screwing with their product! I would suggest buying from a beauty salon in person. Can&#x27;t believe Amazon allows this practice to happen!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shampoos of all times. I would recommend this to anyone even for color treated hair.  Hair comes out silky and smell good.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much I have curly hair and this shampoo cleans  and can be rinced out very easily</li>
    <li> I love the original but not the new sulfate free version.  Can&#x27;t find the original in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Very happy.  Good price</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for my coarse hair. It leaves it soft and easy to manage&lt;br /&gt; Good price which always help!!!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. My hair feels clean, fuller, and moisturized without that slightly limp and oily feel that some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos create. Has a very light pleasant scent at first that dissipates and won&#x27;t interfere with your perfume. Also recommend Rusk Thick spray for extra volume -- it really does work.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and falling out some as I age.&lt;br /&gt;Rusk Sensories Calm Shampoo gives what little hair I have some fullness and brightens it up as well.</li>
</ol>
