      <li>Exactly what I wanted...</li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks for having these.  </li>
      <li>This box gets flattened when packaged, and you need to open the box (i.e., square it up) in order for the frame tabs to fit in.  </li>
      <li>Works just as fast and no cuts or scrapes.</li>
      <li>Not to mention this two-pack is like getting a filter free compared to buying locally.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what we were needing for our new furnace.</li>

      <li>(I&#x27;ve done it numerous times and get a little better each time).</li>
      <li>(it has a protrusion that acts as a key), and the filter media has holes placed for the frame tabs such that it will fit in the frame in only one way.  </li>
      <li>I had no trouble installing the filter per the enclosed instructions</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back whenever I need new filters!</li>

      <li>The filter came within a few days and is an original American Standard filter.  </li>
      <li>The only part of the installation which may be a little non-obvious is the fact that one end of the filter media (the noticeably thicker end) actually forms a little box, which is intended to fit into a corresponding notch area on the frame ends.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with purchase and transaction.</li>
    <li> This came with the new system installed a few years ago. I have stuck with the original.  It filters out small particles well</li>
    <li> perfect fit works like a charm</li>
    <li> These replacement filter packs are perfect.  Two arrive in one package in a timely manner.  A great benefit of purchasing them through Filters Now is that you can have them set up on auto shipment.  It is awesome to know that I will have a pack of filters arrive every three months, guaranteeing clean air in my home year round.</li>
    <li> Original fit filter media for the fancy air filter attached to the furnace of the house I just bought. Installed easily, 5 stars because it does exactly what it promises to do.</li>
    <li> Was a Trane OEM replacement as indicated.  Installed perfectly.  Price was good.</li>
    <li> If you have a Trane or American Standard furnace with provisions for their \\&quot;Perfect Fit\\&quot; filters, this is the real thing.  Never accept a substitute.  The fanfold design means there is plenty of filter to capture dust over the life of the furnace.</li>
    <li> The filter came within a few days and is an original American Standard filter.  It is an exact replacement for the original filter installed in my HVAC.  I had no trouble installing the filter per the enclosed instructions (it&#x27;s fairly obvious anyway).      The only part of the installation which may be a little non-obvious is the fact that one end of the filter media (the noticeably thicker end) actually forms a little box, which is intended to fit into a corresponding notch area on the frame ends.  This box gets flattened when packaged, and you need to open the box (i.e., square it up) in order for the frame tabs to fit in.  BTW, the notch on the frame end ensures that it can be inserted in the HVAC housing in only one way (it has a protrusion that acts as a key), and the filter media has holes placed for the frame tabs such that it will fit in the frame in only one way.  This ensures that the filter is placed in the HVAC housing with the correct air-flow direction.</li>
    <li> Same product as from your local HVAC shop for much much lower price. Easy to install in about 5 mins. biggest challenge is going into attic when 120F!  Also found out that if you use these you can use the cheap filters on each level.</li>
    <li> They may be expensive but they work very well.  Timely delivery and I found a secret to installing them without cutting my hands on the metal gridwork - put them in from the bottom.  Works just as fast and no cuts or scrapes.</li>
    <li> I had bought this item before and it is great for the recommended one year replacement cycle. Once I found they worked great, I returned and bought 6 more. This saves me time and possible money as the price goes up in the future.</li>
    <li> I worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find these filters online since they&#x27;re so specialized but did. I ordered them and a few days later they arrived. Installed one of the two filters without any problems. It saved me a lot of money not having an air conditioning specialist install them.</li>
    <li> Easy to order, great price, quick delivery.  I&#x27;ll be back whenever I need new filters!</li>
    <li> I was able to get these filters for a good price, and they were delivered in just two days. Needless to say I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great price. Delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> always what i need at a good price...</li>
    <li> I have purchased this before, and it is cheaper than the alternatives, with a good rating.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit of work to fit it in the frame, but anyone with a bit of skill should be able to manage.</li>
    <li> fast delivery great price</li>
    <li> These filter do a great job all year round, for our heating in the winter and our AC in the summer. The first time changing them was a little bit of a chanange, but once you understand that the filter is made for several size filter racks and what the instructions mean about just putting the extra folded pleats in the last slot, they&#x27;re a breeze to change.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my ac.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Just not at all easy to install.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought them. I use the hard plastic frame that was with the install of the HVAC unit; the media is quick and simple to use and is a lot less expensive than a pre-assembled unit. Also saves space and only requires changing twice a year.</li>
    <li> Precisely the filters I need. Installation directions are excellent.</li>
    <li> They are the exact replacement for my Trane furnace at a great price.  I&#x27;ll purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> These are the exact fit for our Trane unit and the price is much better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted...at the right price</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipping, made the wife very happy!</li>
    <li> These are exactly what we were needing for our new furnace.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered wrong filter.  Return processed quickly and replacement (correct) filters sent without question or delay.  Correct filter is exact fit.  Very nice!</li>
    <li> Filters were exactly what I needed. Reasonably easy to install, and apparently functions well.</li>
    <li> These filters are great and meet the &amp;#34;form/fit/function&amp;#34; of the OEM manufacturer&#x27;s.  They do a fantastic job of filtering our well water for chilled drinking, etc.</li>
    <li> The replacement filters for the American Standard units work very well but can be a challenge to assemble (I&#x27;ve done it numerous times and get a little better each time). They trap incredible amounts of dirt and dust and last easily the six months they are targeted for. The internet allows the user to purchase the filter packs at less than half what the A/C contractors charge when they come out to do the service so I use them to keep the overall cost of service and maintenence as low as possible.   Very good product, for those able to put the filters into the frames. Otherwise, let the HVAC service men do it for you.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having these.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to pay a crazy markup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an air filter! Good product and service. Thanks</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and received the product as expected. It is a little tricky getting the filter folds into the frame. I think after doing it a couple times it will go better. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> OEM exact replacement, the same filter that my AC guy charges me over $50 for.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> Buying this two-pack is a huge money saver and much more convenient than trying to make it buy our HVAC provider&#x27;s parts store the few hours they are open. Not to mention this two-pack is like getting a filter free compared to buying locally. Works perfectly with our Trane system.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppsoed to do. Those of us who have them know they&#x27;re a pain in the behind to replace but we all know that going in. What I do not like of the Trane version is the seemingly one-size-fits-all filter that ends up folding 6 pleats into one area ... and yes, it is the right filter for the right Perfect Fit enclosure but my issue is more with Trane&#x27;s enclosure than the media filter. it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and the price was a bargain.</li>
    <li> I should of ordered BAYFTAHEXM2 instead of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had that product listed with this product and i mistook it for the one above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got packed away with Christmas wrap and i could not find the box nor the return slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not their fault, it was mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four star review should be zero stars for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT for the product or vendor, they deserve 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very Happy with the right product.</li>
    <li> If U pay attention to how the old filter fits in the drawer as u remove it, then you reverse the process when installing the new one, it is not too bad. And hey, u only have to do it once a year or so.</li>
    <li> They fit, but the mesh is very sharp so wear gloves when installing.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted to do make mandatory restatement about how an item is, ok it is what I want and does fine</li>
