### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Found it here for best price,</li>
      <li>Great Spray!!</li>
      <li>By itself, I don&#x27;t know, but if you are using laser comb therapy as well, then it&#x27;s the best combination for thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has great body!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  </li>
      <li>this is a great product wish it was cheaper</li>
      <li>This has kept my hair and scalp in great condition without the sales tactics of my Dr&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>Thank you, great price.</li>
      <li>Great price and service.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a great conditioner, get Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle instead.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant peppermint smell to it too.</li>
      <li>good product I needed.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own great.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>I have had really good results with this.  </li>
      <li>Love the shampoo too!</li>
      <li>The tricomin is easy to use and gives my hair a nice texture which I need for styling.  </li>
      <li>During that time, I have retained most of my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok--</li>
      <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
      <li>I can see more thickness than before.  </li>
      <li>The follicle spray is fantastic for thinning hair!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I would have lost all my hair if it wasn&#x27;t for this product.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll buy more and continue.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Thought I was loosing more hair</li>
      <li>after a week of sporadic use it literally ruined my hair, the healthy ones thinning, shedding the healthier ones  and paradoxically leaving my thinning spot identical for some reason ...</li>
      <li>Makes hair fall out more and caused inflammation on the scalp.  </li>
      <li>There is not any more loss of hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is much more fuller.</li>
      <li>I was thinning around the temple area and within 2 weeks I have noticed fine hairs beginning to grow.</li>
      <li>This spray seems to target the scalp, which what I really needed most!</li>
      <li>dermotoligist told me about this product and when i used it a week later i saw great improvement.</li>
      <li>So my kind request to people out there who are considering to buy this product to immediately change your mind and never buy this product which is of no use in spite of its high price.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference when I use it, more like a leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>When I call my medical office to purchase their follicle spray to keep my hair healthy there is always a lot of pressure to do another transplant or buy more than I want to buy.  </li>
      <li>long, which is pretty good for 3 weeks, I think.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with my results so far.</li>
      <li>, I just don&#x27;t know if its worth the price.</li>
      <li>This spray is a miracle product though it is a bit pricey but just about worth it.</li>
      <li>After doing my homework on this product, I feel it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>The person who cuts my hair confirmed that this is new growth.  </li>
      <li>but it was new hair growing forward!!!  </li>
      <li>It is my first week using it.  </li>
      <li>The first time I purchased through the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>If it stops any further hair loss I will be pleased</li>
      <li>This has helped my hair so much!  </li>
      <li>Most people who&#x27;ve ever watched their hair thinning can likely agree that you know when things change.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for 3 weeks, sparingly, on the specific areas around my hairline and crown where thinning was becoming more obvious.  </li>
      <li>I will keep using it, but I am very discouraged with this product.</li>
      <li>I added this thinking that another factor would help, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I just use the spray and not the whole package and works on</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping I see results after 3 months of use.  </li>
      <li>It really works you can feel it on your scalp.</li>
      <li>but if I could just see some new growth I will be ecstatic!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s encouraging enough that I don&#x27;t feel like a fool, and I feel like the investment was worth it.  </li>
      <li>product doesn&#x27;t do anything in growing new hairs .....</li>
      <li>I know it is new growth because it is coming in gray, so it stands out from the hair that is colored.  </li>
      <li>I have combined Rogaine with Tricomin and it does not give me any new hair fibers.</li>
      <li>My hair loss stopped and I even started getting new hair growth.</li>
      <li>The new growth is already over 3/8&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Soon my scalp went from an irratating pink color to a healthy white scalp and i noticed baby hair.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not ready to really make any judgement until I have used these products for a much longer time.  </li>
      <li>During that time, nearly all my hair fell out.</li>
      <li>expensive) product after reading all the good reviews about it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use Rogaine, but i can clearly see the layer on scalp created by this product can definitely stop Rogaine from doing its job.  </li>
      <li>As such, I experience considerable hair loss.    </li>
      <li>This one is a bit easier to use than the Rogaine - still waiting to see if it helps fill in bare areas for my hair.</li>
      <li>I am surprised and pleased to say that I was wrong.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for certain where I would be without Tricomin, but I have been using it for more than ten years and, at age 52, I still have all of my thick head of hair and only small amounts of gray at the temples.</li>

<li> I have not used any other similar product, but for me, this is a keeper so far.</li>
<li> so both do last me a long time..  </li>
<li> For its cost it should have grown a few new hairs</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used it for that long.</li>
<li> It does tend to make your hair dry.</li>
<li> No new hair growth on my head.  </li>
<li> My hair are still pretty thin after using it for 8 months, now.</li>
<li> After, i used it for a few days this thing left a blueish layer on my scalp.  </li>
<li> I am also using 2 other products recommended for women&#x27;s hair.  </li>
<li> Not sure only used it a few days</li>
<li> i believe my hair loss has been slowed down.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used for a few months with other hair loss products.</li>
<li> I am noticing much less hairloss</li>
<li> I also notice less hair in my hairbrush now.  </li>
<li> almost made me bald in less than 10 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Saw little to no impact.</li>
<li> It seems that it is making my existing hairline a little fuller</li>
<li> I just got the product a few days ago, so the jury is still out, but I reveived it in a timely manner, and it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell.</li>
<li> so i was having trouble with hair loss and dandruff.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and don&#x27;t buy from this seller, they will NOT work with you on returning it.</li>
<li> It no better at conditioning hair than any store bought conditioner.</li>
<li> Not sure if it is doing anything for the DHA which I have.</li>
<li> got it because i had a small spot  where my hair was thinning ...</li>
<li> I have been using this for about 5 months now and am not sure if I&#x27;m purchasing again.</li>
<li> This may work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me, it made my hair feel very stiff and brittle as well.</li>
<li> I was honestly shocked to find that, after 1 week, I began to see slight evidence of growth, and by 2 weeks, definite improvement.  </li>
<li> I read some reviews that complained because this product didn&#x27;t grow hair.</li>
<li> Being that this product is supposed to help with hair growth, it is impossible to say if it works yet or not.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>
<li> After a month of using this my hair stopped annoyingly falling out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The worst product every used on my hair.  Don&#x27;t buy it from this seller as they will not let you return it if you open it.  How else are you supposed to know if it works.  Makes hair fall out more and caused inflammation on the scalp.  Terrible stuff.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and don&#x27;t buy from this seller, they will NOT work with you on returning it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for only about one month.  I am also using 2 other products recommended for women&#x27;s hair.  The tricomin is easy to use and gives my hair a nice texture which I need for styling.  I am noticing much less hairloss but I&#x27;m not ready to really make any judgement until I have used these products for a much longer time.  If it stops any further hair loss I will be pleased but if I could just see some new growth I will be ecstatic!</li>
    <li> but, it seems to be working.  I was thinning around the temple area and within 2 weeks I have noticed fine hairs beginning to grow.</li>
    <li> this is a great product wish it was cheaper</li>
    <li> This product was just horrible for me.... almost made me bald in less than 10 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it because i had a small spot  where my hair was thinning ... after a week of sporadic use it literally ruined my hair, the healthy ones thinning, shedding the healthier ones  and paradoxically leaving my thinning spot identical for some reason ... I went into depression and still going through phases now.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could sue those guys ...  I did a lot of research on this and the side effects ...didn&amp;#34;t expect this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just BS.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever used for anti hair loss .This product doesn&#x27;t do anything in growing new hairs .....and this product usage makes your existing hair brittle and uneasy to handle and unmanageable. So my kind request to people out there who are considering to buy this product to immediately change your mind and never buy this product which is of no use in spite of its high price.</li>
    <li> All it does is make your hair feel thicker like a hair gel. I was disappointed. For its cost it should have grown a few new hairs</li>
    <li> This spray is a miracle product though it is a bit pricey but just about worth it. I did massive damage from constant coloring and styling with my hair and scalp so i was having trouble with hair loss and dandruff. I tried every medicated shampoo or mouse in regular drug stores but they never seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;A dermotoligist told me about this product and when i used it a week later i saw great improvement. This spray seems to target the scalp, which what I really needed most! Soon my scalp went from an irratating pink color to a healthy white scalp and i noticed baby hair. After a month of using this my hair stopped annoyingly falling out. I just use the spray and not the whole package and works on it&#x27;s own great.It has a pleasant peppermint smell to it too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. My hair looks healthier and fuller.  My friend has been using it as well and she raves about its effects too.</li>
    <li> I have had really good results with this.  I am a female and have had 2 hair transplants.  When I call my medical office to purchase their follicle spray to keep my hair healthy there is always a lot of pressure to do another transplant or buy more than I want to buy.  This has kept my hair and scalp in great condition without the sales tactics of my Dr&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> After doing my homework on this product, I feel it is worth the money.  I have been dealing with thinning scalp areas and thought this would help.  I have purchase this twice now and have notice my hair is filling in well.  Only use once a week after washing my hair and I focus on my edges and the spot that is prone to thinning.  It lasts me about a year so the price works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 5 months now and am not sure if I&#x27;m purchasing again. It seems that it is making my existing hairline a little fuller but it&#x27;s not growing hair where there isn&#x27;t any. Overall I like it, I just don&#x27;t know if its worth the price. If you have the extra money to spend I suggest giving it a 6 month try. I&#x27;m nearing the end of my third bottle and am still debating purchasing another.</li>
    <li> Like others..I use with minoxidil ...  I use just on the hair line so both do last me a long time..  I quit using this and started up again 5 months ago...  It jump started my hair growth.. Thought I was loosing more hair but it was new hair growing forward!!!  I was so amazed to see a hair line replacing a receding one.  Using both and not changing!!  Love this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rogaine for several years. During that time, I have retained most of my hair. However, my hair was starting to get thinner. So, I tried Tricomin shampoo and conditioner for about three month (while still using Rogaine 5%). During that time, nearly all my hair fell out. It seems that the conditioner coated my scalp with a gel-like residue. This gel prevented Rogaine from reaching my scalp. As such, I experience considerable hair loss.    So, I stopped using Tricomin conditioner but continued to use Rogaine. My hair loss stopped and I even started getting new hair growth. As such, I believe this product does not prevent or reverse hair loss. Instead, it does the opposite - it will make your hair fall out. Therefore, I would not recommend this product for treating hair loss.    Additionally, I would not recommend this as a conditioner. It no better at conditioning hair than any store bought conditioner. If you are looking for a great conditioner, get Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle instead.</li>
    <li> avoid&lt;br /&gt; eat lettuce this will stop your hair loss and avoid eating a lot of  oil , including olive oil</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has great body! My beautician noticed the change in my hair. Love the shampoo too!</li>
    <li> I just got the product a few days ago, so the jury is still out, but I reveived it in a timely manner, and it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell.</li>
    <li> Thank you, great price.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because i&#x27;m still using this product and anything that has to do with hair takes time to see results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really hoping I see results after 3 months of use.  Will post back again after 3 mos.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for 1  year with revivogen shampoo. it seems to work. i believe my hair loss has been slowed down.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product.  The first time I purchased through the manufacturer.  The last two times was through Amazon.com.  I am satisfied with my results so far. I can see more thickness than before.  I am using this product in conjunction with Minoxidil and they seem to work well.  I don&#x27;t believe anything is going to be an \\&quot;overnight sensation\\&quot; except hair transplants.  And any product that makes exhorbitant promises I am leary of.</li>
    <li> Keeps my Hair On My Head</li>
    <li> I bought this product with a lot of skepticism, ready to admit that I had foolishly wasted my money on some overpriced and overblown promise.  I am surprised and pleased to say that I was wrong.  I have used it for 3 weeks, sparingly, on the specific areas around my hairline and crown where thinning was becoming more obvious.  I was honestly shocked to find that, after 1 week, I began to see slight evidence of growth, and by 2 weeks, definite improvement.  I know it is new growth because it is coming in gray, so it stands out from the hair that is colored.  Most people who&#x27;ve ever watched their hair thinning can likely agree that you know when things change.  The person who cuts my hair confirmed that this is new growth.  I also notice less hair in my hairbrush now.  The new growth is already over 3/8&amp;#34; long, which is pretty good for 3 weeks, I think.  I can&#x27;t say this will work for everyone, of course, but this has been my experience.  It&#x27;s encouraging enough that I don&#x27;t feel like a fool, and I feel like the investment was worth it.  I have not used any other similar product, but for me, this is a keeper so far.</li>
    <li> This has helped my hair so much!  My dermatologist recommended it to me and I could not thank her enough!</li>
    <li> Saw little to no impact.</li>
    <li> No new hair growth on my head.  There is not any more loss of hair.  I have been using Tricomin for four months.  I have combined Rogaine with Tricomin and it does not give me any new hair fibers.</li>
    <li> The follicle spray is fantastic for thinning hair! Try it in combination with the shampoo, both were recommended by my Dermotoligist.</li>
    <li> Not sure only used it a few days</li>
    <li> I use every day even if I am not shampooing my hair. Great Spray!!</li>
    <li> It really works you can feel it on your scalp. My hair is much more fuller.</li>
    <li> I just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I bought this(pretty expensive) product after reading all the good reviews about it.  After, i used it for a few days this thing left a blueish layer on my scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very good.  What i did to remove that smelly layer on my scalp was to shave my head and start over with this solution and repeating that same next month.  I saw no hair gain or loss.  I don&#x27;t use Rogaine, but i can clearly see the layer on scalp created by this product can definitely stop Rogaine from doing its job.  My hair are still pretty thin after using it for 8 months, now.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that complained because this product didn&#x27;t grow hair. It&#x27;s not Rogaine. It&#x27;s a folicle spray so if you are looking to keep the hair folicles you already have, this is the product for you. By itself, I don&#x27;t know, but if you are using laser comb therapy as well, then it&#x27;s the best combination for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> As yet, it has not done anything. My hairdresser concurs with this, as she saw nothing either.  I will keep using it, but I am very discouraged with this product.</li>
    <li> good product I needed. Good price.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is doing anything for the DHA which I have. Haven&#x27;t used it for that long. It does tend to make your hair dry.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say for certain where I would be without Tricomin, but I have been using it for more than ten years and, at age 52, I still have all of my thick head of hair and only small amounts of gray at the temples.</li>
    <li> This one is a bit easier to use than the Rogaine - still waiting to see if it helps fill in bare areas for my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok--I&#x27;ve used for a few months with other hair loss products. Doesn&#x27;t have a fragrant smell. I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference when I use it, more like a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have lost all my hair if it wasn&#x27;t for this product. Found it here for best price,</li>
    <li> I bought this item after reading the description that it could be used simultaneously with rogaine. My combo was hairmax laser comb+rogaine. I added this thinking that another factor would help, but it really didn&#x27;t. After about 2-3 weeks of use, I started to notice increased shedding of hair, I stopped immediately and hoped I didn&#x27;t undo what the hairmax comb and rogaine did for me. After another 2-3 weeks of just the lasercomb and rogaine, I stopped seeing shedding hair, and thankfully I&#x27;m back to where I was before I started tricomin. This may work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me, it made my hair feel very stiff and brittle as well.</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle, but have not continued to buy it.  I don&#x27;t think I gave it enough time.  I heard about Revivogen and switched to using that, and didn&#x27;t want another product to add to the routine, so I did not continue using the Tricomin spray.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair feel fully and like the spray.  It is my first week using it.  I bought it in hopes that it will help regrow some hair or stop my hair from falling out.  I will write a further review in the future.  My expectations are that it will not regrow my hair.  My regimen is to use Tricomin and Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Great price and service.</li>
    <li> Being that this product is supposed to help with hair growth, it is impossible to say if it works yet or not.  It would take months of use to make a call on it&#x27;s efficacy.  Maybe I&#x27;ll buy more and continue.  Trusted hair growth websites have suggested using this along with rogaine to aid in hair renewal, growth stimulation. I see hair growth, but is it from the rogaine alone, IDK.&lt;br /&gt;But I will buy it again for sure.</li>
