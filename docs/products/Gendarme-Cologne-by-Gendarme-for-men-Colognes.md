<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this cologne for years. This seller was a fast shipper and cologne was fresh in box.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again</li>
    <li> Wonderful clean fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  The clean fresh smell is unlike any other colognes out there.  The price was not bad at all.</li>
    <li> YUMMY. Fresh, clean, subtle.  This men&#x27;s cologne is the best!  LOVE IT. It&#x27;s been a staple fragrance of my husbands for years and will continue to be!  Very good price, and super fast shipment!  Great seller.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Great Price! Fast delivery! I like the way it smells I bought it for my Husband for Christmas, so I don&#x27;t know how he will like it.</li>
    <li> Great clean scent.  Very light and clean smelling...almost citrus-like.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I really like this cologne.  Nice, soapy scent, though subtle, and not overpowering. Plus,some of the highest celebrities have worn it...</li>
    <li> Gendarme has a fine powdery smell - not like the alcohol smell that most fragrences have. My only complaint is that is could be a little stronger.  People  melt when they smell this fine fragrence. Even the most hardcore male will stop and smell the roses. [...].</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son &amp; he loves it. I find most men&#x27;s colognes &amp; after shaves too strong-smelling. This has a subtle, very pleasant scent. It would work well as a woman&#x27;s cologne too.</li>
    <li> I cried myself to sleep every night for months when I heard that Gendarme was discontinued. I also had to start therapy.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, it is light and fresh perfect for everyday. Thank you for your quick processing and super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> love  and so much cheaper than dept store</li>
    <li> Right away I think this smells terrible.  It smells like cheap soap mixed with my great aunt&#x27;s perfume.  After like 5-10 minutes, however, it smells very nice and the scent sticks around for hours.  The soapy smell mostly goes away and it smells much better than my aunt&#x27;s perfume :).  I would give it 4 stars if it did not smell so terrible to start out with.  I would recommend going into a store and trying this out before buying it just to make sure that you like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I guess the problem is that I got a fake spray.  I have learned recently that you do not want to buy 4 oz bottles when buying through Amazon.  Idk why they can&#x27;t get better quality control but for now just stick to smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> Gendarme is like no other cologne. It&#x27;s subtle, clean scent is rich with citrus and verbena.  I would highly recommend Gendarme to any man who likes a different scent that is not overpowering!    Paul S  Las Vegas, NV</li>
    <li> Received the package more quickly than I expected.  The scent is as good as I remember.  Clean and subtle, which is what I like.  My co-workers and patients smell clean and light.</li>
    <li> A quiet and sophisticated mens fragrance. Best gift I ever gave myself!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my go to scent! Subtle and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. Probably won&#x27;t buy again. It does smell fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the fact that the nice, fresh smell doesn&#x27;t last very long. I prefer a&lt;br /&gt;fragrance that smells nice 2-3 hours after application.</li>
    <li> A Gift for another, He likes this, and will not change either.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my husband one Christmas because a coworker wore it and smelled so fresh yet masculine whenever you passed by his office. After one bottle, my husband was hooked. He wants this all the time and whenever anyone asks me what he would like for his birthday or Christmas, I just tell them Gendarme and he&#x27;s happy.</li>
    <li> You will always find some people that do not like a particular scent, and I happen to be one those people in this case. I will say this: I am quite picky with fragrances, although I will tolerate most, hence my excitement to try this cologne after reading such great reviews.    Well, I was quite disappointed to say the least.  As other have said, it does have a soapy smell, which should have been a red flag for me.  If I want to smell like soap, I will use soap in the shower instead of a much more pleasant smelling body wash.  There&#x27;s another scent in this fragrance that I also don&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is, but all I know is to me it&#x27;s reminiscent of a scent for older women.  Granted, it is a very light scent and not overpowering at all, but if I don&#x27;t like it there&#x27;s no point in wearing it.    As always, make sure you sample your colognes before you buy.  I tried it on two separate occasions and didn&#x27;t like it either time.  You should also be aware that the cologne doesn&#x27;t last the longest.  Of course that makes sense given how light it is in the first place, but just giving a heads up.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase, thank you.</li>
    <li> It is WONDERFUL, subtle and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve been unable to find this cologne/after shave in any stores around here, I decided to order on line.  Not dissapointed. &lt;br /&gt;Got a fair price and fast shipping to my door.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this cologne it has become &amp;#34;his&amp;#34; signature go to scent .  I love it too, and it is very long lasting.  The  Gendarme balm he likes as well.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars and recommend</li>
    <li> The vendor was quick and packaging had no problems. I have used the product for 10 years was able to buy at several high end stores that have now closed.     Dan Boffa</li>
    <li> this fragrance lasted about 5 minutes then there was nothing.....very bad I was very dissapointed I would like to return it for credit......how do I do that?</li>
    <li> I have used Gendarme before and always find it to be a quality product.</li>
    <li> As always, perfumes need to work with the chemistry of one&#x27;s skin...so if it smells wonderful on one doesn&#x27;t mean it works the same for the rest.    For me, this smells good when applied...the drydown...well, what can I say?  smells like Woolite.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance that is crisp and clean. A nice change of pace from typical colognes. Not overpowering and it mixes with your own chemistry to give you your very own smell.  I used it years ago, but it&#x27;s hard to find, the price is decent on amazon, ships out fast.</li>
    <li> Great smelling fresh scent, wish it lasted a little longer:&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> This cologne smells awesome! I have received many compliments and definitely recommend this to all men.  Thanks to LL Cool J for recommending it.</li>
    <li> Great product; seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for the man in my life. Being familiar with Gendarme I already knew that when he wears it; we&#x27;re talkin beyond belief... purchasing the cologne at a reasonable price with great service response made everything first class.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the price of this classic cologne but not by its quality.  It didn&#x27;t have the rich lingering scent that it did long ago.  It seemed watered down and lacked the jasmine and bergamot???? fragrances.  For some time, I looked for a Gendarme website so I could buy directly but to no avail.  I think it was created since my initial review.  I will drive down to the Gendarme store in Los Angeles and keep you all posted.</li>
    <li> This as Chanel Platinum Egoiste are my two mainstays. I would definitely get this again. Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but will last you through the better part of the day.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s and mine, favorite Cologne.  It has been missing in the departments stores for several years much to my husbands dismay.  I found it cruising online at Amazon and now my hubby is delighted.  The scent is so clean, fresh and masculine that you&#x27;ll want to stay side by side with your man 24/7.  Love it!</li>
    <li> All went well. Received my order right away. I&#x27;m one  happy man 😃😃😃😃😃</li>
    <li> It is frustrating to order cologne over the internet because you never know if what you are getting is a quality product (read: not skunked) until its too late.  Well, it was too late with this!  The cologne smells absolutely aweful.  It must have gotten skunked from extreme temperatures or something.  I know that its not the smell the cologne is supposed to have because I&#x27;ve warn this kind for years.  It smells of old rubbing alcohol.  I tried contacting the seller about it, but to add insult to injury I never heard back.</li>
    <li> Love that my man doesn&#x27;t smell like a pushy used car salesman with this one!  Clean scent.. It is different and that&#x27;s why WE love it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years. I am a woman and this is my go to fragrance every time. The scent is clean and subtle, as most woman&#x27;s perfumes are so overwhelming. It also reminds me of my Dad. RIP Daddy, I Love You!</li>
    <li> Great price and was delivered before promised</li>
    <li> Heard about this in some magazine and thought I&#x27;d try it.  It smells very good.  People mention how good I smell all the time.  It smells fresh.  Not lemony, not flowery, not powdery, no one smell dominates.  I&#x27;m a woman and to me it just smells clean.  Also it&#x27;s labeled mens cologne but it doesnt have that spice men cologne smell and doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;men&#x27;s cologne&amp;#34; at all to me.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I get lots of compliments on the clean, fresh smell.  Never overpowering like woodsy colognes can be.</li>
    <li> I think the bottle that I received was too old to be used.  The smell is extremely weak and dissipates quickly.  I tossed it out.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price!!</li>
    <li> This product really irritated my allergies and smells horrible.  It is non refundable. :(  Stuck with something I cannot use!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other colognes, but keep coming back to the best, Gendarme.  Everything else is just too overpowering.  This is a light, crisp scent. Slightly sweet but not perfumey. It&#x27;s perfect if you&#x27;re looking for that smell of \\&quot;clean,\\&quot; not sweet or aftershave like.    This is by far the best cologne for me ever.  I too have had many comments over the years -- all good -- when I wear this, especially those formal occasions where you have just a hint of it on your outer clothes.  Trust me, when you meet the people -- whether handshakes or family hugs -- they&#x27;ll comment on \\&quot;how good you smell.\\&quot;  Truly.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all times favorites and i will gladly recommend it to all my friends. The product is terrific. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> The cleanest fragrance of any available for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For special occasions or just everyday wear, Gendarme is guaranteed to get you remembered!</li>
    <li> this is my husbands favorite cologne,  so I really hope that you all will carry it always. thank you very much</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful smelling cologne.definately not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Truly unique:) Enjoy it...wonderful gift for someone or for yourself.  I love the way it smells - very subtle not room clearing:)</li>
    <li> Brought this as a gift; loved by all! Great light fresh scent. Looking forward to trying their women&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my hubby!</li>
    <li> Love this scent for my husband.  He has been wearing it for years and it&#x27;s easy to find here and at a great price...it arrived quickly as well.</li>
    <li> Gendarme is a good smell but not a great smell ,it does last for some time I have used better stuff the price is pretty good for 4 oz.please try before you buy.George-from elpaso.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best cologne on the market. I get nothing but compliments when I where this. Its a light clean smelling fragrance. If your looking for something different from the overwhelmingly perfume drivin to the point where you can still smell whomever it was wearing the gallons of whatever it was even after you have left where ever you were for what seems to feel like forever. Way to many of those types of mens colognes out there. This is different then the norm and better then anything out there. You will not be disappointed, nor will anyone your hanging out with.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend mentioned that this was his favorite cologne but he could no longer find it in stores. I was excited when I found it on Amazon and ordered it for Christmas only to be very disappointed that when it arrived. The box did not have the usual cellophane wrapping that colognes come so I sprayed a bit to test it and the fragrance was very off due to age! Must be old stock and now I can&#x27;t return mail for an exchange or get a refund because it is a hazardous material.  Do not recommend this product at all and will never buy fragrances online ever again.</li>
    <li> I recently saw someone on the Ellen Degeneres show who said they were wearing Gendarme and this is what brought it back to mind.   I looked it up on the internet and found their website and that Amazon also sells it. I used Gendarme in the past and many of my friends and family liked it so well that they started using it as well. I first ran across Gendarme in New Orleans in the 1980&#x27;s at a local men&#x27;s clothing shop called \\&quot;All American Boy\\&quot; in the French Quarter. \\&quot;All American Boy\\&quot; offered small trial-sized vials as a free sample.  When I got home, I tried it and loved it so much I went back to the store the next day and bought a 4 oz. bottle.  It is so clean and crisp that I wore it every day.  I ALWAYS received compliments on my cologne when I wore Gendarme.       NOTE:  I must make a comment about the \\&quot;history\\&quot; of the cologne that I read atn Gendarme.com.  The site claims that the cologne was created in 1991.  This is NOT accurate.   Don&#x27;t understand why they are fudging the date of Gendarme&#x27;s creation.  I wonder if they purchased it from another company and want to take credit for it?       I was able to purchase my second bottle of Gendarme here in Louisville.  I eventually ran out of my second bottle, but the store that sold it  had gone out of business and I couldn&#x27;t find it after that.  Anyway, I will be purchasing another bottle very soon.  It IS wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing has a great fresh shower smell. Have worn this cologne several times and gotten several compliments. The best way to describe this cologne is it has a light long-lasting smell.</li>
    <li> The only cologne I wear.  Great price.  Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Theoretically, this is man&#x27;s scent, but my wife has worn it for 15 years and it still intoxicates and arouses me.</li>
    <li> This product was either fake or watered down. The scent lasted for about 5 mins. I will not buy again. I did buy 2 bottles and both where the same, so this leads me to believe they where watered down or fake.</li>
    <li> Cleanest smelling men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband; although, I did have myself in mind.  Love this scent...fresh, light, clean, great for summer.  Will have to order more since, I use this, too!!</li>
    <li> Good, light, pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Spray pump doesn&#x27;t work. Also this is the first time I bought this cologne, but it does not last very long, after 3 hours can&#x27;t smell it at all. The bottle had some weird residue on it, that came off with water and sponge. All of these things lead me to suspect this may be a counterfeit knock off. No way to return because Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow. This will be the last time I buy cologne from Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a fake replica!  It has &#x27;some&#x27; of the original scent in the first few sprays, but it is, overall, very watered down, and after a few days you will notice the scent is extremely weak even after spraying 3 or 4 times! DO NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
    <li> After using the product for a few days I found it was old and weak.  It was so bad that my wife asked me to stop using it.  Turns out that Gendarme now makes a weaker version of their original (which I received) that isn&#x27;t worth the money.  Really disappointed in the company and product I once loved.</li>
    <li> My husband and son really love this. My husbands been using it for over 20 years. Glad its still around.</li>
    <li> Beautiful crisp smell. Get compliments every time I wear this. Have to purchase again almost out of it. Love it!</li>
    <li> A great cologne, I wear it nearly every day. A  masculine scent thats not too overpowering not matter how much you use.</li>
    <li> This product falls short of it&#x27;s intended goal.  It starts out with a nice scent however the scent only last a couple of hours.  As time went on I had to increase the amount of spray just to get the couple of hours.  I finished using this cologne in record time.  Too bad, It had a refreshing scent but was like drinking water, not substantial if you are thirsty for a reasonalbly lasting scent,(falls short).  The sprayer actually stunk in performace.  I will be watching for this style, (falls short).&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed that Amazon is falling short with its Cologne offerings.  Amazon you should monitor the complaints everyone can&#x27;t be wrong. Let us know when you get back on track Amazon, we are headed to the Department Stores.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product does not smell like the one I bouht from the manufacturer. the aroma from this product is like it was diluted or something. like I said I bought from the manufacturer and one mist will smell great, with this product I have to spray myself with it in order to lightly smell like I am wearing it. Don&#x27;t know what this is all about. No more buying from this seller for me.</li>
    <li> Gendarme is for the man who doesn&#x27;t want that &amp;#34;smell me before AND after I&#x27;ve left the room&amp;#34; fragrance. It has that just stepped out of the shower clean smell. Very crisp and fresh and not thick and heavy like a high school boy drenched in Axe or your neighborhood taxi cab driver. It&#x27;s embarrassing to even wear those overpowering colognes.  Wear Gendarme...people won&#x27;t think you have cologne on...they&#x27;ll think you just smell good. A word of caution: Nordsroms sells this for $90. I&#x27;ve heard there is a lot of counterfeit Gendarme products, and $39 sounds too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Clean, soapy scent especially good for summer. Can be overpowering at times, which makes it tedious to smell over long periods.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Fast ship.</li>
    <li> I have worn Gendarme for the past twenty years. It&#x27;s clean and fresh, not overpowering. People (sometimes even strangers) tell me how GOOD I smell! It&#x27;s all I will wear scent wise.</li>
    <li> My husband and I was watching Inside Edition when LL Cool J came on and the announcer said he smelled wonderful and he said he was wearing Gendrame, so I went online and ordered it for my husband. Now let me tell you she was not lying it smells sexy</li>
    <li> This is a great clean scent.  Can probably be worn an time without offending anyone.  Smells much like a soap from a high&#x3D;end hotel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of scents.  DH loves cologne and we have to be very careful that he doesn&#x27;t wear anything that will trigger a migraine for me.  This cologne has a light fresh scent and we&#x27;re both happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Gendarme for at least the past 20 years, back when it was only available at a West Hollywood store called &amp;#34;International Male&amp;#34;.  It has come a LONG way!  Although there are a gazillion scents for men, this is my all-time favorite!</li>
    <li> The only cologne I have worn........in 20 years! I am not a fan of colognes. Most men&#x27;s colognes are just too overwhelming and I tire of the smell long before the bottle would be empty. Not the case with Gendarme. A timeless and subtle scent that I am complimented on daily. So glad I found it here on Amazon. The bottle graphics are different from the last bottle I purchased so I was a bit worried that the fragrance had changed as well........no.......the same classic scent I discovered years ago!!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Gendarme for several years yet despite living in a large metropolitan city(Chicago) it became increasingly difficult to find. It used to be sold at Marshall Field&#x27;s(only the Water Tower store) and they stopped carrying it before they ceased to exist.A few local menswear stores carried it but they folded too. I did find it at other stores when traveling out of state, but finally found it on Amazon and at a better price than most of the stores when they did happen to have it. It has a clean, fresh citrusy,almost \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; scent and doesn&#x27;t overpower like many flowery/woodsy scents.Occasionally people have commented that I smelled like I \\&quot; just stepped out of the shower\\&quot;. Not bad!</li>
    <li> Always liked it. could not find it locally after Dillards quite carrying it. I think I saw it advertised for a lot less though</li>
    <li> Great product and it makes my husband happy when ever I order it since it is so hard to find!</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the original cologne.  Smell like crap</li>
    <li> Great service and product !</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in a department store 20 years ago, because my office had anounced that we were no longer able to wear cologne because of to many sensitive noses.  They assured me when I purchased it that this cologne was made for this reason.  I tryed it and to this day I have never offended anyone in the office.  It&#x27;s a fresh clean and very soft smell!</li>
    <li> This is a light fresh and clean just stepped out of the shower sent.  Not heavy like others that enter the room before you!</li>
    <li> Gendarme is clean smelling however the scent does not last.  I agree with the reviewers who said it smells like soap.  I would rate it higher if the scent was longer lasting.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and have been buying it for years.&lt;br /&gt;On me, the scent doesn&#x27;t stick and I need to spritz more throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I carry some around in an atomizer, which is fine, because I smell like I just stepped out of the shower all day long!</li>
    <li> I have been having withdrawals ever since Agua Lavander (by Puig) disappeared.  Imagine, the Spanish fragrance company stopped making Frank Sinatra&#x27;s favorite cologne.  I wore it for many years, then boom---------gone.  I even wrote the Company in Spain and received no response.  Then &amp;#34;voila&amp;#34; at a recent dinner party my wife smelled Gendarme on the host.  She immediately insisted that I order it.  It may not be Agua Lavender, but it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big Steve Martin fan, and his favorite scent is &amp;#34;tuna fish sandwich&amp;#34;.  Well, fan or not I&#x27;m going to stick with Gendarme.</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean smelling, I have been using it for years when I first found it in Sacs NYC.. Awesome</li>
    <li> This thing was just water.  I returned mine after 2 uses cuz it just reeked of cheap knockoff.  Bought one from nordstrom instead</li>
    <li> The Best...Clean Smell!</li>
    <li> Great!! Fast ship very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> My husband likes it.. Someone recommended it and I decided to buy and the scent is light and crisp.. Stays on too</li>
    <li> My favorite scent.  Clean and crisp, light but not feminine.  I like to add a few drops of patchouli oil to musk it up a bit.</li>
    <li> I am a female and have been using this cologne for years. Love the clean fresh smell. Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> great fragrance. really turns heads.</li>
    <li> Good purchase experience...so-so cologne. I bought this because I smelled it on someone and asked what is was. But there must have been some other difference.</li>
    <li> Cannot go wrong with this product - I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it first became available from International Male - clean and natural and always the best choice if you&#x27;re not sure what to buy or wear. Smells like you just got out if the shower!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was wearing this fragrance and I thought would enjoy it too.&lt;br /&gt;As with most fragrances it wears different with each individuals own odor.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well with me.&lt;br /&gt;Different from my friends bio.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne for someone who does not want to smog people around them.  It is light and has a nice natural smell that is very subtle.</li>
    <li> I had been asking all over Las Vegas to see if anyone carries this product. Nope, they never heard of it. Even the fake stores didn&#x27;t have it. What does that tell you? You see, LLCoolJ mentioined this on twitter and I had to check it out. It&#x27;s been way over 1 year and finally I bought it. It is different! It is not your typical cologne that smells the same as the others. It is not like pachoulli, Cool Water, CK One or something that a lot of people tried to wear to be cool. It has a clean smell. You may think it&#x27;s floral but not it&#x27;s not. A clean smell on a man is attrative. A cologne that&#x27;s not powerful is attractive. It arrived just in time for our 18 year anniversary. My motto is this: &amp;#34;If it makes your mouth water for a long time after smelling this up close on a man, it is the right cologne to have in your collection.&amp;#34; This is worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gendarme for years and really love it&#x27;s fresh botanical lightness. This is a truly unique cologne that is hard to find in stores. I&#x27;m actually glad that it is unique, but it still remains a classic product.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous , clean,fresh scent.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this cologne for over 25 years.  It is a wonderful, clean scent that you&#x27;ll never tire of.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical whether this was original or fake.  But after a few months use, I like it.  Smells very subtle and I have used and loved Gendarme for decades.</li>
    <li> quite a savings and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> I understand that colognes and perfumes are a matter of personal taste but this stuff is rank!</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite cologne ever</li>
    <li> Right fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Right price&lt;br /&gt;Excellent shipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read so many reviews about this fragrance and decided to test it out myself.  Yes it does remind you of shampoo but in a very good way.  It stays on you for a whole day leaving a very distinct smell, nothing that a shampoo could accomplish.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item because I think it is what Dollie Parton wears and she has been said to be the nicest smelling person in show business!</li>
