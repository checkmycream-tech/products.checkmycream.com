      <li>After all, if you want to keep the matte look you can&#x27;t use a glossy top coat.</li>
      <li>ManGlaze contacted me and offered to send replacement bottles, as they were sure that I must have received defective product somehow.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love.</li>
      <li>As this looks better on guys</li>
      <li>I will be buying many more colors.</li>
      <li>Like most nail  </li>
      <li>Love this matte polish..</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Just a bit of warning, removing the nail polish is a bit of a struggle and if your using nail polish removers you will damage the top layer of your nail.</li>
      <li>got this polish as a gift and wasn&#x27;t sure if it needed a topcoat.</li>
      <li>I love this polish</li>
      <li>This nail polish is great and dries to a beautiful matte finish but dried up and became goopy after about a year.</li>
      <li>I was used to alpha nail which is a true matte, this is in-between and although it is otherwise a nice product I wont buy again.</li>
      <li>Most matte polishes chip easily</li>
      <li>was pleasantly surprised to find that without a top coat Matte is Murder still had great staying power</li>
      <li>Application is awesome, brush is not one of those cheap low grade ones.</li>
      <li>Cool that it came with a guitar pick!</li>
      <li>but this one chipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>I did feel it chipped fairly easily, perhaps another coat +</li>
      <li>Nice mate, looks good but only a day or two..</li>
      <li>oh and it dries really quickly!</li>
      <li>I totally love this, goes on smooth, dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Perfect Matte with a little shimmer.</li>
      <li>Two coats is all it took to get a smooth matte finish.</li>
      <li>it goes ok easy and drys fast...</li>
      <li>I have never used matte nail polish before this product, I am glad that this was the first polish I chose to use.</li>
      <li>I did get a better result than I did the first go-round.</li>
      <li>After seeing it in person, I most definitely need my own...</li>
      <li>Anyways this is a great product, it dries fast, lasts more than other brands, and the finish is amazing, you really have to try it yourself to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
      <li>I think most girls will like other polishes, but many guys I&#x27;ve spoken with love it.</li>
      <li>and has an awsome matte finish you cant find in stores with other nailpolish.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a good time, although I am preety easy on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>This is the only polish ive found matte that doesnt shine one bit.:) and for that I Love Manglaze nail polish for life</li>
      <li>one coater with practice and mattes super quick.</li>
      <li>But still worth trying.</li>
      <li>Really liked this nail polish, the matte was an instant hit.  </li>
      <li>I saw an ad for Chanel&#x27;s matte nail polish and thought it looked cool, but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $100.</li>
      <li>looks really awesome if you use regular glossy black nailpolish in conjunction with it</li>
      <li>It looks great, especially applied as french tips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because of the nice finish it did have once it managed to dry.</li>
      <li>Otherwise product is exactly like described.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it actually stayed matte for more than a day.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more from this company.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and officially obsessed.</li>
      <li>but their customer service is even better (if that&#x27;s possible)</li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more.</li>
      <li>you want a product that will last and aren&#x27;t too fussed about it staying matte after the first day, this might do you just fine.</li>
      <li>Color is a nice matte black.</li>
      <li>It dries fast so keep that in mind.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t Like it, dries too fast when ur putting it on as well.</li>
      <li>but I really like it..</li>
      <li>Does dry pretty quickly which is a plus and comes out matte exactly like it says.</li>
      <li>This is the best Matt black in the world seriously I was kinda worried what it would turn out to b like</li>
      <li>Even with a clear coat to make it shine, the fine glitter (not very visible as a matte finish) gave a pleasant subtle sparkle.</li>
      <li>Definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the money I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;d be better off with Butter London&#x27;s Union Jack and Mattifying Topcoat than this chunky waste of money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too serious just moisturize it with lotion or what ever you have and let it heal on its own, about a week or so.</li>
      <li>Currently I am on day 5 since I first applied the polish.</li>
      <li>Read some reviews, pulled the trigger and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Just keep in mind that it LOOKS dry before it is ;-)</li>
      <li>Has just a tad hue of silver glitter, so in this case it&#x27;s not black out type.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recomend this to any guy, male, boy, etc  </li>
      <li>works really well, lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Plus it didn&#x27;t really stay matte for very long; I would say a day.</li>
      <li>This was my first black nail polish for myself.</li>
      <li>At first when you put it on it&#x27;s glossy and even a little sparkly -- fear not!</li>

<li> I type all day and only got a few *tiny* chips, which were easily fixed with a touch up.  </li>
<li> I expected a ten dollar polish to hold up well</li>
<li> but it looked like it was grey.</li>
<li> This is not a flat matte black either, it has some shimmer that gives it depth and dimension.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never pictured myself as a nail polish type person. I bought this stuff and it sat idle in a draw for 6 months, even trekked unopened across the country in a car with.  One day someone painted my toe nails with it and I fell in love.</li>
    <li> Love this polish!  Application is awesome, brush is not one of those cheap low grade ones. It glides on well. Color is a nice matte black. It dries fast so keep that in mind. I&#x27;m very happy and officially obsessed. I&#x27;m definately going to buy all the colors! Fantastic company &amp; excellent products.</li>
    <li> Immediately after application I grew a beard, chest hair and an emo bang. Got worse next morning, as I woke without boob but added out door &#x27;plumbing&#x27; and an assumption that any woman who didn&#x27;t sleep with me after I complimented her was putting me in the &#x27;friend zone&#x27;</li>
    <li> This nail polish is arsome.  Does dry pretty quickly which is a plus and comes out matte exactly like it says. Like most nail  polishes you need two coats.  I just wish that it wasn&#x27;t 12 bucks for shipping and the product. Otherwise product is exactly like described.</li>
    <li> This was my first black nail polish for myself. I liked this product a lot for the durability. I&#x27;m not to found of the smell of nail polish when you try to put it on. Also after maybe like a week or so, not matter how well you put the nail polish on it will chip at the edge of the nail and at the back of your nail. I would recomend this to anyone and would buy this product again. Just a bit of warning, removing the nail polish is a bit of a struggle and if your using nail polish removers you will damage the top layer of your nail. It&#x27;s not too serious just moisturize it with lotion or what ever you have and let it heal on its own, about a week or so.</li>
    <li> This is the best Matt black in the world seriously I was kinda worried what it would turn out to b like but when it arrived I was so happy I love manglaze they truley have the best Matt Polish I&#x27;m very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I saw an ad for Chanel&#x27;s matte nail polish and thought it looked cool, but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $100. This is a great product for a great price. Two coats is all it took to get a smooth matte finish. At first when you put it on it&#x27;s glossy and even a little sparkly -- fear not! It dries without any shine.</li>
    <li> This polish is absolutely amazing. A must have for anyone who is looking for a matte nail. I will definitely be getting more.</li>
    <li> I liked this a lot and received a lot of compliment.  I will buy it again when i run out.</li>
    <li> I expected a ten dollar polish to hold up well but this one chipped very quickly. I thought the polish would be very black but it looked like it was grey.</li>
    <li> I totally love this, goes on smooth, dries quickly. and has an awsome matte finish you cant find in stores with other nailpolish.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a good time, although I am preety easy on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using since it came&lt;br /&gt;And HIGHLY recomend this to any guy, male, boy, etc  As this looks better on guys</li>
    <li> Awesome. On my 5th or 6 bottle. Of course, like any matte anything, it will start to get a lil shiny/glossy after a day or so. There is no way for any polish to stay 100% matte, as you are buffing them whenever you touch anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fav polish.Has just a tad hue of silver glitter, so in this case it&#x27;s not black out type. But still worth trying. I think most girls will like other polishes, but many guys I&#x27;ve spoken with love it.</li>
    <li> Nice mate, looks good but only a day or two..</li>
    <li> OMG all I can say is beautiful... I love this polish it rocks the house my nails look amazing... it goes ok easy and drys fast... Love it</li>
    <li> An AMAZING product backed by an even better company!!! they went above and beyond quality service. I will continue to buy and recommend this product to everyone!!!! oh and it dries really quickly! love that!!</li>
    <li> not the matte-est polish I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ll tell you that. I was used to alpha nail which is a true matte, this is in-between and although it is otherwise a nice product I wont buy again.</li>
    <li> Perfect Matte with a little shimmer.</li>
    <li> This is the only polish ive found matte that doesnt shine one bit.:) and for that I Love Manglaze nail polish for life</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the easiest thing to find a really deep matte black. Read some reviews, pulled the trigger and was pleasantly surprised. Good color, good coverage and fast drying.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is great and dries to a beautiful matte finish but dried up and became goopy after about a year.</li>
    <li> Definitely wasn&#x27;t worth the money I paid for it.  The polish was so thick you could barely do anything with it! I ended up giving it away to a friend.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars because of the nice finish it did have once it managed to dry. Even with a clear coat to make it shine, the fine glitter (not very visible as a matte finish) gave a pleasant subtle sparkle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overdue for an update on this review. ManGlaze contacted me and offered to send replacement bottles, as they were sure that I must have received defective product somehow. I accepted and agreed to update my review - for better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? Zoya&#x27;s Dovima still beats Matte is Murder, hands down. I did get a better result than I did the first go-round. I am still a little worried about the short shelf life of the polish if a long wait to purchase the bottle I first got was, indeed, the deciding factor on the quality - it&#x27;s not uncommon for a bottle of polish to sit around a year waiting for the right season for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a product that will last and aren&#x27;t too fussed about it staying matte after the first day, this might do you just fine. If you want a truly matte polish, you might look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:&lt;br /&gt;I like black polish. I like matte polish. Here&#x27;s a company that specializes in matte polish, I&#x27;ll give it a try. What a waste of money! This applies unevenly, dries to a satin rather than matte finish, and looks a mess no matter how skillfully it&#x27;s applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoya&#x27;s Dovima and OPI&#x27;s mattes are better than this. You&#x27;d be better off with Butter London&#x27;s Union Jack and Mattifying Topcoat than this chunky waste of money.</li>
    <li> Customer service is KILLER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this polish as a gift and wasn&#x27;t sure if it needed a topcoat. These dudes(dudettes?) responded to my email in 7 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its one coater with practice and mattes super quick.</li>
    <li> I have never used matte nail polish before this product, I am glad that this was the first polish I chose to use. The color is amazing, and the matte finish is awesome and I dries super-fast, no waiting around with wet nails.</li>
    <li> Love this matte polish..it does have a little shimmer to it but I really like it..I will be buying many more colors.</li>
    <li> Stays matte for like an hour and then it gets all ugly after, I don&#x27;t Like it, dries too fast when ur putting it on as well.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it said it was. Two coats lasts forever! Chips off eventually at the tips. But much less than any other nail polish.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows this product is amazing- but their customer service is even better (if that&#x27;s possible) I had some issues with my order and they worked it out for me hassle-free. I have recommended them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Most matte polishes chip easily but Manglaze polishes last so well. This is not a flat matte black either, it has some shimmer that gives it depth and dimension. It looks great with a shiny top coat too.</li>
    <li> I guess you could say i&#x27;m a nail polish collector, and i&#x27;m happy that i added this to my collection because i&#x27;m in love with matte is murder. I&#x27;ve never seen matte nail polish before, but this is amazing. The polish is great quality, and the artwork on the bottle is unique and awesome. I will definitely be buying more from this company.</li>
    <li> This product lived up to it&#x27;s name. The matte finish is jut what you would expect it to be. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little scared to use a matte nail polish. After all, if you want to keep the matte look you can&#x27;t use a glossy top coat. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find that without a top coat Matte is Murder still had great staying power (I did still use a base coat). I type all day and only got a few *tiny* chips, which were easily fixed with a touch up.  The touch ups blend in great too, which is often not the case with glossy finish nail polishes. Currently I am on day 5 since I first applied the polish. I&#x27;m hoping it will last until I get my second order of Man Glaze (Santorum, Fuggen Ugly and Cabron).</li>
    <li> I find myself coming back to this polish all the time. It looks great, especially applied as french tips. I&#x27;ve used other matte black polishes but they don&#x27;t look as matte as this one does. Love it!</li>
    <li> Really liked this nail polish, the matte was an instant hit.  I did feel it chipped fairly easily, perhaps another coat + protective cover would do the trick.  Will look for additional colors in the future.  Cool that it came with a guitar pick!</li>
    <li> This polish is the mattest of mattes! The best matte color polish I have been able to find.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth, looks completely great. I can&#x27;t wait to get more colors!! Just keep in mind that it LOOKS dry before it is ;-)</li>
    <li> works really well, lasts a long time. looks really awesome if you use regular glossy black nailpolish in conjunction with it</li>
    <li> I bought this polish as a gift for a friend. After seeing it in person, I most definitely need my own... Along with some of the other colors!</li>
    <li> To be honest, this nail polish wasn&#x27;t so great. I really love the art cover, but I was disappointed when I realized this matte black had a little shimmer to it. Plus it didn&#x27;t really stay matte for very long; I would say a day. It would get shiny after 24 hours and that made me quite upset. I just wanted a simple matte black, no shimmery/glittery finish. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it actually stayed matte for more than a day.</li>
    <li> I am a guy who does his nails; yup. Anyways this is a great product, it dries fast, lasts more than other brands, and the finish is amazing, you really have to try it yourself to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
