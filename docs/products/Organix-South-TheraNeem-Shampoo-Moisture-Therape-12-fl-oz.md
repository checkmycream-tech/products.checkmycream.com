      <li>I don&#x27;t have skin issues, so I can&#x27;t attest to theraneem&#x27;s ability to help with that, although neem and aloe are two of the top recommendations for moisturizing and healing the skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m soooooooooo pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>

      <li>Great natural shampoo!  </li>
      <li>Which were in excellent condition and performed as expected.</li>
      <li>Hair is softer, healthy, shiny and smells fresh and organic!</li>
      <li>It smells incredibly funky, but works wonders on my dry scalp.  </li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Consistency--like light maple syrup</li>
      <li>This shampoo is fabulous.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, however, is what a fabulous job the shampoo did to calm my scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands, not necessarily for scalp problems but just trying to get that perfect clean soft shiny hair.  </li>
      <li>It smells a bit funny, but I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the scent because of how enjoyable the results are after washing.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, it took a couple days for my hair to adjust to the new product.</li>
      <li>Smells and leaves hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Also, arrived very quickly too, overall, very pleased.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely very moisturizing, and smells quite a bit better than the Scalp Therape does.    </li>
      <li>It not only is good for my hair, but I shampoo my dogs with it too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Before using this for the first time I clarified my hair using a strong clarifying shampoo to remove the build up of the coconut oil etc.</li>
      <li>The only one of the many, many I have tried to rid my scalp of flakes.  </li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner based on the fabulous reviews I read here first.</li>
      <li>For my second purchase of Neem, I chose to go with this \\&quot;Moisture Therape\\&quot;, and my son and I like it even more than the Scalp Therape version!   </li>
      <li>I came across Neem oil shampoo when I googled lice products right here on Amazon</li>
      <li>My scalp feels great too, still a little itchy, but not anything like it was!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>As I mentioned earlier, this is my favorite shampoo of all time.  </li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my thinning hair having a body of thick hair great shampoo...</li>
      <li>After using Neem Shampoo, my son&#x27;s psoriasis is completely cleared up for the first time EVER!!  </li>
      <li>The product is very watery and will run right through your fingers.</li>
      <li>to my surprise by the second treatment I noticed the lice turn bright white and</li>
      <li>and although my dog has a long way to go before she is better...</li>
      <li>Ship was fast.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work but</li>
      <li>very organic</li>
      <li>I will stay with this product as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>I then applied a simple organic full 100% neem oil on her skin after that</li>
      <li>Smell--herbal, not bad, feels like I am in the red wood forest.   </li>
      <li>Hands down, this is my favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>, it works up to nice tiny bubbles on wet hair.   </li>
      <li>as I have a dog with ringworm which is highly contagious.  </li>
      <li>It is completely non drying and really moisturizes it.</li>
      <li>The moisturizing properties make my hair smooth and silky, even when wet.  </li>
      <li>Cannot live without this product.</li>
      <li>The first one was just the regular Neem \\&quot;Scalp Therape\\&quot; Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Once my hair is dry, it feels like a dream (I have s-wave hair, normal thickness; not coarse, but not silky smooth either).  </li>
      <li>i have sensitive scalp</li>
      <li>As far a dander control, I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
      <li>I will be using it again this weekend, as they recommend the product 3xs a week for ringworm, which is not a worm, but a fungus which the dogs could have picked up in the yard from the wild cats that are always rummaging through the yard.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stop the itching on my scalp but either this or the conditioner made my hair feel soft.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased everything there is for sensitive scalp, dermatitis, contact allergies -</li>
      <li>My hair felt so dry that first day even doing that.</li>
      <li>Result--my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry, yet hair feel clean and manageable.    </li>
      <li>My hair is normally very dry, I dont have dandruff, but I do tend to have a VERY itchy scalp especially if I dont wash daily, but because I dont want to use sulfates</li>

<li> &quot;     What a huge relief ( for both of us ), as it used to make me feel so bad for him having to deal with all the questions and teasing.  </li>
<li> I keep coming back as this one works for me at least.</li>
<li> A fresh, earthy scent, not at all unpleasant but certainly not your run of the mill, off the shelf scents either.</li>
<li> I found the scent odd, while clean-smelling.</li>
<li> it took  a while for a doctor to diagnose it ,they kept telling me I was pulling her hair too tight because the lice infested her hair line and side burns.</li>

<li> No more watching and waiting for bottles of biolage or other salon products to go on sale.</li>
<li> VERY few tangles in comparison with other shampoos.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s like the conditioner makes your hair a little to limp and lifeless</li>

<li> I even gave a bottle to a friend, who was battling lice on thier child and that did the trick, without any harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> Although this product is thin in consistency, a little goes a long way if you continue to work it in.</li>
<li> No more flakes or \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; are visible on his scalp.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have purchased everything there is for sensitive scalp, dermatitis, contact allergies - you name it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that has works.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because reviewers said it helped their scalp issues.  All it did is give me oily hair and I tried to give it a fair shake.  I followed all instructions.  At first I wanted to believe it was helping but eventually it only made it worse.  Would not recommend this product for scalp issues.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because we&#x27;ve done some research on the properties of neem and it&#x27;s ability to heal and moisturize skin, as well as the antiseptic qualities.  Hands down, this is my favorite shampoo.  Ever.  It smells a bit funny, but I&#x27;ve come to enjoy the scent because of how enjoyable the results are after washing.  I have oily skin, and have all but stopped using conditioner, occasionally doing an herb-infused apple cider vinegar rinse.  Since bringing theraneem into my rotation (I tend to alternate shampoos to avoid build-up, though I haven&#x27;t had issues since I&#x27;ve switch to organic shampoos), I haven&#x27;t needed to do an ACV rinse.  The moisturizing properties make my hair smooth and silky, even when wet.  VERY few tangles in comparison with other shampoos.  Once my hair is dry, it feels like a dream (I have s-wave hair, normal thickness; not coarse, but not silky smooth either).  I don&#x27;t have skin issues, so I can&#x27;t attest to theraneem&#x27;s ability to help with that, although neem and aloe are two of the top recommendations for moisturizing and healing the skin.  As I mentioned earlier, this is my favorite shampoo of all time.  No more watching and waiting for bottles of biolage or other salon products to go on sale.</li>
    <li> Great natural shampoo!  Really helped my dried out hair.</li>
    <li> Smell--herbal, not bad, feels like I am in the red wood forest.   Consistency--like light maple syrup, it works up to nice tiny bubbles on wet hair.   Result--my scalp doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry, yet hair feel clean and manageable.    I love it, best shampoo ever, trust me, I have tried plenty,including some $30+ shampoo. I will stay with this product as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Although MY shipment took longer to process, likely for inventory-related reasons, the brief wait time wasn&#x27;t a problem for MY items. Which were in excellent condition and performed as expected. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate, at all, reordering from this company.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Neem Shampoo.  The first one was just the regular Neem \\&quot;Scalp Therape\\&quot; Shampoo.  It smells incredibly funky, but works wonders on my dry scalp.  My son has also had phenominal results with Neem, and he has SEVERE psoriasis on his scalp and the back of his neck.  For my second purchase of Neem, I chose to go with this \\&quot;Moisture Therape\\&quot;, and my son and I like it even more than the Scalp Therape version!   It is definitely very moisturizing, and smells quite a bit better than the Scalp Therape does.    After using Neem Shampoo, my son&#x27;s psoriasis is completely cleared up for the first time EVER!!  No more flakes or \\&quot;scaling\\&quot; are visible on his scalp.  He likes to keep his hair cut short, and now he can..... and he no longer has to worry about the kids at school asking him \\&quot;what&#x27;s all that weird stuff on your head?\\&quot;     What a huge relief ( for both of us ), as it used to make me feel so bad for him having to deal with all the questions and teasing.  I would HIGHLY recommend either one of the Neem Shampoos, as they BOTH do a great job!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This shampoos is great! I&#x27;ve tried many brands, not necessarily for scalp problems but just trying to get that perfect clean soft shiny hair.  This is it!</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of shampoos to relieve my dry scalp issues... Some of them were recommended by my Dermatologist. None of them worked for me. I went to my Herbalist and this product was recommended. It WORKS for me. No more scalp issues. I take it to my beautician and have her use it when I get my hair done!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner based on the fabulous reviews I read here first. I found the scent odd, while clean-smelling. The product is very watery and will run right through your fingers. I do little squirts on my head directly to avoid waste. Most importantly, however, is what a fabulous job the shampoo did to calm my scalp. It&#x27;s no longer itchy, no more flakes - ever. Even with the strange scent and wateriness, I still give it five stars for its effectiveness. Kudos neem, whatever you are.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fabulous. It is completely non drying and really moisturizes it. Neem is a great product for those who arn&#x27;t aware, but this shampoo is one of the best of all types that I&#x27;ve gotten and one of my favorites. The fact neem has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties is an added plus for good hygiene and cleanliness.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t stop the itching on my scalp but either this or the conditioner made my hair feel soft.  Did not get rid of dandruff yet.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it took a couple days for my hair to adjust to the new product. My hair is normally very dry, I dont have dandruff, but I do tend to have a VERY itchy scalp especially if I dont wash daily, but because I dont want to use sulfates I dont wash my hair often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this for the first time I clarified my hair using a strong clarifying shampoo to remove the build up of the coconut oil etc. and followed it with the TheraNeem conditioner for scalp therapy. My hair felt so dry that first day even doing that. So next day i washed and conditioned again, etc by the third day my hair had adjusted its not super soft and I found i didnt need to use any oil in my hair. My scalp feels great too, still a little itchy, but not anything like it was!</li>
    <li> The only one of the many, many I have tried to rid my scalp of flakes.  This one soothes it and a little goes a long ways.  I have ordered it several times.  I keep coming back as this one works for me at least. A fresh, earthy scent, not at all unpleasant but certainly not your run of the mill, off the shelf scents either.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t us due to fragrance issues.</li>
    <li> I was purchasing this product to help with dander control and added moisture. As far a dander control, I don&#x27;t see a difference but my hair has more moisture to it.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Love it! Will do business with them again.Exactly as described.  Love it! Will do business with them again.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted.  I have enjoyed this tremendously.  I was completely impressed with the timing of getting my item.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this Theraneem moisture shampoo WITH the matching conditioner...the other products I&#x27;ve tried were not great, this one was super...not harsh either!  Everything in the Theraneem shampoo is very good. It was recommended to me from a friend that has four dogs, who are always getting into something!...as I have a dog with ringworm which is highly contagious.  I like the fact that it does not have the harsh Neem smell that organic neem can have.  I will be using it again this weekend, as they recommend the product 3xs a week for ringworm, which is not a worm, but a fungus which the dogs could have picked up in the yard from the wild cats that are always rummaging through the yard.  Like the conditioner, which arrived today with this shampoo,  I used it the second I got it and although my dog has a long way to go before she is better...I then applied a simple organic full 100% neem oil on her skin after that, I am pleased with the product and smell...very organic Also, arrived very quickly too, overall, very pleased.  Ship was fast. I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my thinning hair having a body of thick hair great shampoo... Over all a great product for gentle hair works well with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds my expectations Imy daughter and I have  been battling head lice for years. So I now don&#x27;t believe the myth that only white people can get lice lol! I won&#x27;t lie it took  a while for a doctor to diagnose it ,they kept telling me I was pulling her hair too tight because the lice infested her hair line and side burns. The medicine they prescribed was very strong so you couldn&#x27;t use it daily it took it away for a while but it always came back. After years of prescriptions and home remedies with mayonnaise Vaseline etc. I came across Neem oil shampoo when I googled lice products right here on Amazon I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work but to my surprise by the second treatment I noticed the lice turn bright white and those little suckers were sliding right off of her hair. It also improved her scalp dramatically and her hair is growing back in the front I&#x27;m soooooooooo pleased with this product. If you have lice bypass all the over the counter crap and prescription pesticides get this product you can use it daily it&#x27;s safe and natural and it works!!!!!!!😄</li>
    <li> although I like this it&#x27;s like the conditioner makes your hair a little to limp and lifeless</li>
    <li> Although this product is thin in consistency, a little goes a long way if you continue to work it in. Hair is softer, healthy, shiny and smells fresh and organic!</li>
    <li> A very good product for your scalp . i have sensitive scalp so it works great and it does what it says.</li>
    <li> this is the best shampoo you can get! It not only is good for my hair, but I shampoo my dogs with it too. I use to battle fleas awful, with these dogs. I haven;t had no fleas in a couple years, from using this shampoo. Before that my house always had fleas well into the winter, but not anymore. I will never be without a bottle in the house. I even gave a bottle to a friend, who was battling lice on thier child and that did the trick, without any harsh chemicals. So I say this is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product . Used it with my essential oils ! Wonderful !</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves a medicinal smelling film on the hair. It smells a little like insecticide. It also has some not so save chemicals in it if you look it up on Skin Deep.</li>
    <li> One of my family members is going through a very harsh regimen of drugs much like chemotherapy. It is drying him out so badly. He had dandruff and a very dry itchy scalp,  and he said it felt like \\&quot;alligator\\&quot; scalp. Tried tar shampoo, which gave some relief from the itching and moisturizing shampoo and conditioner - which helped jis hair, but NOTHING touched the \\&quot;alligator scalp\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL I bought THIS shampoo with neem oil. After three washings, his dandruff and itching and dry , bumpy alligator scalp totally disappeared!!</li>
    <li> Smells and leaves hair feeling clean.</li>
