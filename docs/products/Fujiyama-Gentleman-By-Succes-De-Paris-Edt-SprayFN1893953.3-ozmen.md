      <li>DON&#x27;T EVER PAY MORE THAN 20 BUCKS!</li>
      <li>Good and cool Fragrance!!</li>
      <li>I liked it,  </li>
      <li>While opening the box, I was immediately impressed with the packaging of the fragrance - in the box, it screams of top shelf designer - very well packaged.  </li>
      <li>sweet smelling, women love it!!</li>
      <li>a great, light, distinct smelling men&#x27;s Cologne.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the scent of this cologne.</li>
      <li>For the money this is an interesting scent for evening wearing.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is very rich and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>longevity is above fair, and it drops into a rather pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Great for those special occasion dinners, company meetings, first dates, etc.....</li>
      <li>Smell good fast delivery</li>
      <li>To this day, every time I wear this special fragrance I get a compliment!</li>
      <li>My \\&quot;knee jerk\\&quot; recommendation is that this would be a good entry level cologne for those younger in age getting their first bottle or those looking for a great buy.  </li>
      <li>Again, I can&#x27;t leave it off recommended lists - those looking for a great value and those just starting off a collection.  </li>
      <li>thought it was pretty sexy sophisticated yet sweet but</li>
      <li>Great gift especially for Christmas</li>
      <li>Was very pleased with this purchase the price was also great the smell.s is not to loud and it has a long lasting smell will be ordering more of this product for sure !!</li>
      <li>What a way to leave a unique impression on that special someone.</li>
      <li>this is perfect for that drive with the lady.the elegant smell is sensual in my opinion, unless shes masculine heavy in her taste of scent when it comes to you.</li>
      <li>What was the final deal breaker was when the woman at the register asked what I was wearing that smelled so good?</li>
      <li>Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent</li>
      <li>im surprised this hasnt received more rave.</li>
      <li>By far my sons favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>It is worth according with the price.</li>
      <li>It is cheap - approximately $10.00 for a large bottle - great buy for that</li>
      <li>the scent truly stands out it veers on the unisex side but defitnely more towards the male.</li>
      <li>Has a great long lasting scent but it is weakened after an 8 hour application.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gentlemen was my first purchase of a Fujiyama product.  </li>
      <li>If it lasted longer, I would rate higher.  </li>
      <li>Well, scent is like ice cream  - that&#x27;s why there are so many flavors, but this one is quite subtly Asian in flavor</li>
      <li>But by other reviews they liked the scent.</li>
      <li>(I suppose I have too much disposable income..</li>
      <li>Fujiyama is a interesting brand and offers something different.</li>
      <li>last but not least im picky of scent and will toss a risk that didnt work, this is lightyears away from a cheap smell, preference:</li>
      <li>Now I have something with a very masculine smell that my wife really, really likes very well.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a designer cologne without that designer high tax.</li>
      <li>The bottle is uniquely designed (the nozzle a little cheaply made) - but kudos on the bottle and packaging (I may be the only one who notices these things..</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>The scent has below average projection and sillage and the longevity is weak - hardly detectable on the skin following two to three hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentleman does offer great flexibility - it is pleasant enough without being overbearing to wear anytime of year, any occasion, and either night or day.  </li>
      <li>What is the old saying, \\&quot;sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>its soft but demands attention</li>
      <li>adult club non congested..drive with your other..lone time at jazz playing spot</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of this cologne.</li>
    <li> sweet smelling, women love it!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this scent and so do I. It smells better than any of the expensive others that he wears.</li>
    <li> The price was GREAT for the size and my son and brother love the scent. Great gift especially for Christmas</li>
    <li> I brought this cologne for my kids Im teaching them to be young men and its a nice scent i wore it a few times and i have alot of women at my job ask me the name of this cologne.</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this purchase the price was also great the smell.s is not to loud and it has a long lasting smell will be ordering more of this product for sure !! Will be sharing it with friends also a Must Buy !</li>
    <li> This was a blind buy. But didn&#x27;t like scent. Can&#x27;t even explain the scent. To me smelled terrible. But by other reviews they liked the scent. is I guess it is a preference.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very rich and sophisticated. Not at all like your run of the mill designer fragrances..not sporty, or predictable. I cannot believe this fragrance isn&#x27;t more popular in the U.S! Cedar, Musk, Jasmine, Lemon, and Patchouli. WOW! A++++++</li>
    <li> Although I had no idea what it smelled like, I decided to buy this cologne at Marshall&#x27;s for ten greenbacks. I was looking for a designer cologne without that designer high tax. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance because I be smellin&#x27; real nice. The Japanese part of me decided to go for something other than rice. My Adidas Ice Dive was running low and the scent was getting weak. So I wanted a big bottle of something that didn&#x27;t make me smell like a geek. Now I have something with a very masculine smell that my wife really, really likes very well.</li>
    <li> Well, scent is like ice cream  - that&#x27;s why there are so many flavors, but this one is quite subtly Asian in flavor</li>
    <li> For the money this is an interesting scent for evening wearing.  Fujiyama is a interesting brand and offers something different.</li>
    <li> By far my sons favorite cologne. It smells wonderful and priced great!</li>
    <li> i picked up rocawear x9, for my collection and wanted to grab something a little extra, yet not too costly. my take is that its defitnely a must have. the scent truly stands out it veers on the unisex side but defitnely more towards the male. longevity is above fair, and it drops into a rather pleasant smell. its soft but demands attention im surprised this hasnt received more rave. this is perfect for that drive with the lady.the elegant smell is sensual in my opinion, unless shes masculine heavy in her taste of scent when it comes to you. fujiyama gentlemen, will certainly have me curious of its other scents. last but not least im picky of scent and will toss a risk that didnt work, this is lightyears away from a cheap smell, preference: adult club non congested..drive with your other..lone time at jazz playing spot (careful this one may not last long). my best tho shower then spritz then foreplay.....this is the number one recommend....</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cologne on my man!!!</li>
    <li> great delivery service I now smell like a million bucks</li>
    <li> Smell good fast delivery</li>
    <li> Good and cool Fragrance!! It is cheaper. It is worth according with the price. It is a good option for a day-to-day perfume.</li>
    <li> Ok... So I am a fan of the \\&quot;blind buys\\&quot;... What is the old saying, \\&quot;sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you\\&quot;... In relation to purchases, sometimes you find a keeper and sometimes you don&#x27;t..!!  (I suppose I have too much disposable income..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen was my first purchase of a Fujiyama product.  While opening the box, I was immediately impressed with the packaging of the fragrance - in the box, it screams of top shelf designer - very well packaged.  The bottle is uniquely designed (the nozzle a little cheaply made) - but kudos on the bottle and packaging (I may be the only one who notices these things..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the bottle, Gentleman has notes of floral and musk then settles into a very pleasant fragrance of spicy and woodsy notes.  The scent is very pleasant and easy on the nose.  Sweetie complimented the fragrance, smelling it following the initial application.  The scent has below average projection and sillage and the longevity is weak - hardly detectable on the skin following two to three hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentleman does offer great flexibility - it is pleasant enough without being overbearing to wear anytime of year, any occasion, and either night or day.  My \\&quot;knee jerk\\&quot; recommendation is that this would be a good entry level cologne for those younger in age getting their first bottle or those looking for a great buy.  It is cheap - approximately $10.00 for a large bottle - great buy for that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final tally for Fujiyama Gentleman is 4.0 stars out of 5 stars.  I love the scent and it is a great buy.  If it lasted longer, I would rate higher.  Again, I can&#x27;t leave it off recommended lists - those looking for a great value and those just starting off a collection.  Make today count... Optimism moves the world...</li>
    <li> To my surprise while scanning the fragrance aisle at Marshalls I ran across an open box of Fujiyama Gentleman and gave it a try. I liked it,  thought it was pretty sexy sophisticated yet sweet but nothing dramatic. However, by the time I found my purchase and got on line I had three random women compliment me on my cologne. I couldnt believe it. What was the final deal breaker was when the woman at the register asked what I was wearing that smelled so good? I literally ran off the counter and grabbed the last open bottle which I got for only $6! To this day, every time I wear this special fragrance I get a compliment!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T EVER PAY MORE THAN 20 BUCKS! DEALS ARE OUT THERE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great, light, distinct smelling men&#x27;s Cologne. Great for those special occasion dinners, company meetings, first dates, etc..... What a way to leave a unique impression on that special someone. Has a great long lasting scent but it is weakened after an 8 hour application. You can still smell it though....</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance for men. Everywhere I go even with just a little on get lots of complements!!</li>
