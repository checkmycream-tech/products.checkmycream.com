      <li>I love this color because it goes with everything and every season.</li>

      <li>Good for the day and hot for the night.  </li>
      <li>A nice vibrant color with a nice shine to it.  </li>
      <li>but it kind of fun to see the color change.</li>

      <li>All of them were fantastic, except for this one.</li>
      <li>Great color wore it all last summer!  </li>
      <li>Had the color at a salon, and liked it so much I had to get some.  </li>
      <li>OPI is always a great product,  Applies easily and comes off with minimal effort with acetone remover.  </li>
      <li>Even so, it&#x27;s perfect for the first few.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous blue color.</li>
      <li>Very pretty</li>
      <li>It was a fresh bottle of polish.  </li>
      <li>Kind of between a metallic sapphire and electric blue.  </li>
      <li>but fun to play with.</li>
      <li>They have great colors, although the names are kind of silly.</li>
      <li>Nice color but its not the same color as in the photo.</li>
      <li>It is just right.</li>
      <li>Tip for people buying nail polish: look on google images first</li>
      <li>It is an outstanding color of blue.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a blue that has a bold and unique hue</li>
      <li>The color changes very quickly if you go outside</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>very disapointed</li>
      <li>Got this because it was the much coveted &amp;#34;opi&amp;#34; brand.</li>
      <li>It was much darker and shinier than the photo.</li>
      <li>very majestic looking.</li>
      <li>The main color is of a dark but bright royal blue with a hint of royal purple.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bright but a beautiful deep color whereas the China Glaze has  little more turquoise in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>gold red and green sparkles over royal blue is quite beautiful.</li>
      <li>I was also pleased that the product wasn&#x27;t old and dried out.  </li>
      <li>I am definitely not pleased with this this, and was expecting better from a brand that always delivers.</li>
      <li>The blue was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This blue is exactly what  </li>
      <li>but this is very close to University of Kentucky Wildcat basketball blue.  </li>
      <li>The one I received was much darker &amp; took several coats of polish.</li>
      <li>This color blue is not too light and not too dark.</li>
      <li>and not dark or gothy.</li>
      <li>The color goes away pretty quick and that&#x27;s the only complaint</li>
      <li>The label on the bottom clearly read \\&quot;Blue</li>
      <li>Let me add that I also type frequently which adds stress on the nails; however I tried China Glaze ( 2 different colors - blue and purple) and both lasted 2-3 weeks without a chip w/ same activity level.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The polish stays on for a long time and it doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as the other ones.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this on my toes, great coverage, doesn&#x27;t chip, OPI is always the best!</li>
    <li> I just bought several nail polishes from OPI. All of them were fantastic, except for this one. The blue shown here is -not- the blue that came with my bottle. The label on the bottom clearly read \\&quot;Blue My Mind\\&quot; but the colours from the bottle shown on Amazon and the bottle I received are clearly not the same. The bottle I received was many shades darker than this one, so light skinned buyers, beware! The bottle shown is a medium blue, but the bottle I received was dark blue, almost indigo. I am definitely not pleased with this this, and was expecting better from a brand that always delivers.</li>
    <li> Got this because it was the much coveted &amp;#34;opi&amp;#34; brand. The color shown is not the color I received in the mail. The one I received was much darker &amp; took several coats of polish. Would not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> This polish is the perfect color. In different lights you will see variations. The main color is of a dark but bright royal blue with a hint of royal purple. If you are looking for a blue that has a bold and unique hue this is it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this color yet but I do love OPI. They have great colors, although the names are kind of silly. My favorite nail polish brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this color for the 4th of July and it was a great purchase.  The blue was exactly what I was looking for.  A nice vibrant color with a nice shine to it.  I always do at least 2 coats anyways so that&#x27;s what I did with this color also.  Another great OPI color to add to any collection.</li>
    <li> Color is an absolutely beautiful blue. Shiny but not glittery.</li>
    <li> OPI is always a great product,  Applies easily and comes off with minimal effort with acetone remover.  Looks great too!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful blue!!! Great price. I wish I ordered more</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quick turn around time for receiving the product.  I was also pleased that the product wasn&#x27;t old and dried out.  It was a fresh bottle of polish.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous blue color. Perfect for toes while sitting around the pool. Okay for fingernails, but definitely bright. I&#x27;ve noticed that the color fades after a couple of days and becomes almost translucent. Even so, it&#x27;s perfect for the first few. I can&#x27;t stop staring at my toes!</li>
    <li> The color is great. Kind of between a metallic sapphire and electric blue.  The polish was a bit thick so could use some thinner.  It definitely was noticed and is a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; statement.</li>
    <li> Nice color but its not the same color as in the photo. It has a metallic look to it not the solid color shown</li>
    <li> OPI is my favorite brand of polish.  I normally do not used colors like this but this is very close to University of Kentucky Wildcat basketball blue.  GO BIG BLUE!  I could not find this in OPI gel plosh.  I did find a Blue My Mind gel in Sally hanson brand but have not tried it yet.</li>
    <li> Thought it was going to be a royal blue like the picture but it&#x27;s more of a metallic indigo. Very dissapointed. Tip for people buying nail polish: look on google images first</li>
    <li> I had acrylic nails for years which always adhered well to color, so when I removed them and went  natural, I had a rude awakening in store for me regarding durability. I tried various  OPI colors, including Blue My Mind and they chipped within 3 days. Blue My Mind chipped within 1 day. Let me add that I also type frequently which adds stress on the nails; however I tried China Glaze ( 2 different colors - blue and purple) and both lasted 2-3 weeks without a chip w/ same activity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I love OPI colors much more than China Glaze. This blue is exactly what  I wanted w/ a hint of purple. It&#x27;s not bright but a beautiful deep color whereas the China Glaze has  little more turquoise in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution: 2 coats of China Glaze and 1 of OPI to bring it closer to the color I want. Stayed on 3 weeks. Perfect\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> color is not like it seems. i settled for a pale blue and got a shiny blue instead. very disapointed</li>
    <li> Great color and consistency. It&#x27;s vibrant and goes on great. Very pretty and I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments. Best blue ever.</li>
    <li> I ordered a few of these for my wife and she loves them. She loves painting her nails with it. The color changes very quickly if you go outside so consider that before purchasing it. The polish stays on for a long time and it doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as the other ones. The color goes away pretty quick and that&#x27;s the only complaint but it kind of fun to see the color change.</li>
    <li> The OPI Blue My Mind simply blew my mind.  It is an outstanding color of blue.</li>
    <li> This color blue is not too light and not too dark. It is just right. Good for the day and hot for the night.  You will enjoy it, for all ages.</li>
    <li> The color in the photo is not the color I received. It was much darker and shinier than the photo. Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I always get wonderful comments from total strangers when wearing this polish, I love it, it&#x27;s vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;two coats will do the job..</li>
    <li> Had the color at a salon, and liked it so much I had to get some.  O.P.I. is very good quality polish</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Nice for spring</li>
    <li> I love this color because it goes with everything and every season. The color is richer than it appears in the picture. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Great color wore it all last summer!  Packaged well and received on time!</li>
    <li> This polish goes on smooth and takes two coats. It lookes way better on me than in the picture. A deep almost royal blue with traces of silver. very majestic looking. and not dark or gothy. but fun to play with. I also cover this with sparkles. Just feeling kinda in the christmas spirit. gold red and green sparkles over royal blue is quite beautiful.</li>
