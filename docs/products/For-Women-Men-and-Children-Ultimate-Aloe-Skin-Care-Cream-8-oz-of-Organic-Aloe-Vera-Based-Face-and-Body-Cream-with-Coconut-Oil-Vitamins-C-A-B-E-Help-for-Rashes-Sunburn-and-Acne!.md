<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not know yet the effect. But packing status and capacity are satisfied.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream several years ago. My heels were dry, cracked, and bleeding. I tried every product I could find that said it would stop my heels from cracking and nothing worked. After using Ultimate Aloe twice a day for about 2 weeks I noticed a change in the skin on my heels. The dryness was gone and the cracks were healed.  I now use Ultimate Aloe all over my body and my skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I bought at a home show and discovered it made my feet and hands so soft.  I ran out and thought all aloe vera creams were the same.  They are NOT!  I am buying more because nothing has made my skin feel so soft and not irritated my skin.  Wonderful stuff I would HIGHLY Recommend it for soft skin and sensitive skin.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Not what it states it will do. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and the only thing I find it does is take the itch away from rash I have. It has not taken the red blemishes away or the rash itself.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It stings my face, don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> The cream is very effective. It helps the skin become soft and smooth. The best hand cream I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Bought it 2 months ago. I could write a long review, but not necessary. I tried it because someone had it and told me it was really good.  I use it for my face as a result of mild redness. It&#x27;s really good for blackheads, skin problems, etc. It made a good difference, plus doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it clears them well. It gives a slight burning sensation, must be from all essential oils plus aloe. Great lotion, for sure will buy again, little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My mother gave me this cream she got at a fair for older women in Utah.  I only used it when I ran out of my expensive cream, but was pleasantly surprised.  My skin seems tighter, smoother, and clear.  The price is great and so are the results.</li>
    <li> This aloe product makes my skin feel great.  It makes my heels crack-free and comfortable.  It is a nice product.  However, I was told it would help the looks of varicose veins - after more than 6 months of use, I see no change in the appearance of my veins.  I continue to use it because it does work well as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this cream!&lt;br /&gt;Finally a cream that is perfect.</li>
    <li> on this product, all ingredients are from nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I feel so oily</li>
    <li> Amazing cream...love it!!</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, minimal fragrance, soothing.  I find it a little expensive, but I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> I feel a bit stupid for 1) not knowing about this product, and 2) not knowing how MANY benefits there are to using aloe vera lotion. Where have I been? I got a pretty significant chemical burn and in my research on how to help it heal I stumbled upon this marvel. I read the many reviews and decided that many people can&#x27;t all be wrong, and I bought it. The following depiction of my experience so far is not being exaggerated in any way. Within ONE HOUR of putting some of this lotion on my burn (which has been untreated for 2 months and not healing on its own) I could see a noticeable difference in reduced redness and puffiness. Within the first few hours it was much calmer, not burning or itching like it has since the onset of the burn. I&#x27;ve only been using this 2x a day for 4 days, even missing one of those days, and the burn is almost invisible!!!!!! My skin is very soft, supple even, and I estimate about 95% of my burn has faded away as if by magic. I am shocked, and again, saddened I just found this product. The list of ailments this lotion treats is beyond impressive so if you are plagued by any of them do yourself a favor and buy this. Now! Forget the price, the value is worth the cost 100x over.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!!! It doesn&#x27;t smell great (not bad at all but not great) but it leaves my skin so soft and it cleared up my whole back that was breaking out from it being so hot! Highly recommend this cream!</li>
    <li> Does a job on several kinds of dermatitis, in different areas of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this can cure; it is for a &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; use.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful Aloe lotion. I had been out in the sun too long and my forehead got burned. I needed something with aloe so I ordered this product. It really took the sting out and put the moisture back in. I have kept using it as my face cream even though my burn is gone. Make up goes on nicely over it. Will purchase again. Best thing- the don&#x27;t test their product on animals so I will definitely refer this to my friends &amp; family!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. My skin was very dry skin became soft and moist like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Good day, feeling the skin, there is fun to see in the mirror every day.&lt;br /&gt;Once again I would like to also buy.</li>
    <li> unbelievable. very good. i happy keeps my hands soft for a whole day</li>
    <li> This cream is great and really does heal your skin.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product, I was really expecting to help my sons skin, and it did nothing at all 😫</li>
    <li> I love this product - everything in 1 jar - I have even used it on my dogs skin who has horrible skin rashes.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is currently trying it on his psoriasis - hopefully it will do the trick - great product</li>
    <li> a really nice creamy product!</li>
    <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe how it heals so quickly</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped on my dry elbows or sunburned skin. No noticeable difference than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; lotion. : (</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited to be able to buy this product on Amazon, I love all the natural ingredients and how it feels on my skin!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have been experiencing psoriasis kind of skin condition on my face along with various other symptoms since the past 3 months and I was depressed with my condition.I found out i am vitamin d deficient.I started taking vitamin d supplements and along with it, I wanted to give this cream a try to heal the skin before going to a dermatologist and to my surprise this cream has healed my face to a great extent.It does sting a bit sometimes but not always when I apply it where there is some irritation on my face but the stinging goes away in seconds and instantly relieves my itching and takes away my redness and inflammation.I guess that is a part of the healing process.It has been only 10 days of using this cream and I am very happy with the results.I will definitely be using this cream in the long run.It is a great healing cream, even works when I sometimes get a pimple.Absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy cream. No smell. Only use for my legs now. Too heavy for face.</li>
    <li> I love this aloe cream!  It has almost no odor, is not greasy, is thicker than regular lotion, and is very moisturizing.  It is much more useful than most lotions/creams.  When I put it on bug bites, it helps stop the itching.  It is great to put on sunburns. I recommend this aloe cream to all my friends and family and have bought it for them as gifts.</li>
    <li> Fantastic healing cream. A little is all you need. Haven&#x27;t found a better product for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Great  no greasy  !  Very fast</li>
    <li> Product works great on my dry skin better than any other I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;m very happy with the results and will order more</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use all creams because I have sensitive skin and break out easily but I can use this cream as a night moisturizer and overall body cream. I even use it on my lips and haven&#x27;t had a problem! I liked it so much I bought some for my sister!</li>
    <li> holy crap.  A while after using this my cheeks started to burn and feel hot.  When I looked in the mirror they were screaming red.  Had to wash it off and apply my usual face cream (Red Rock organics which helps my rosacea but doesn&#x27;t eliminate it completely. I also use Perlier products with no issue, I mention that because I know they have preservatives in their products, so it&#x27;s not like my face is THAT sensitive).  I got this for the aloe, but I guess I had a reaction to some of the other ingredients.  I&#x27;ve put most of the natural ingredients listed on my face before, so it must be some of the ones that I don&#x27;t recognize.  What a bummer.  Smells sort of like yogurt.  Seemed to arrive sealed well enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have very light rosacea, slight redness sometimes and little bumps to go with it.  Started a few years ago.  Had perfect skin before that.  Sorry, but I had a pretty bad reaction to this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have a tough case of itchy DH (celiac skin rash). While no topical product has proven to work miracles for me, this one is definitely one of the best. It always itches for a few minutes when I first apply it, which isn&#x27;t unusual. When the itching subsides, I end up with hours of itch relief, which is awesome! Four stars instead of five because the cream isn&#x27;t as rich a moisturizer as I&#x27;m used too. If my skin rash is extremely dry, I have to apply this twice to get relief. Some people may not like the smell of it, but frankly, I&#x27;m grateful that there are no chemical fragrances in it. If there were, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds on psoriasis treatments and this one is amazing. Saw great improvement is just a few weeks....good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care cream on the market.  I&#x27;ve been using this particular brand for the past year, and I just love it!  I&#x27;m very excited to see it&#x27;s now available on Amazon, hello free prime shipping!  This cream has very simple, natural ingredients, with aloe and coconut oil being two of the best things you could use on your skin.  I have combination skin- I get dry patches on my face, hands, legs, and feet- but I also have oily patches on my face.  This is the only skin care cream I&#x27;ve used that does the job on all those areas.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, and my dry skin is moisturized- win, win!  This cream is unscented, so it&#x27;s perfect for people who are sensitive to scented lotions and creams. I can safely use this on my allergy prone son as well.  It&#x27;s also great for minor burns and sunburns.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this cream, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I normally do not leave reviews but I definitely wanted to say how much I love this cream.  I have very dry sensitive skin.  It is difficult to find any products that will keep my skin moisturized without irritating or burning it. This is the first cream that I have tried that actually keeps my face moisturized all day and doesn&#x27;t sting when I put it on.  My skin feels really smooth and soft now.  Also I noticed that my face does not dry out right  after I wash it any more.  I will definitely be using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> Ultimate Aloe Skin Care Cream has been a favorite for us ever since we found it at a Home and Garden Show....  It is awesome to finally be able to get it off Amazon which makes it much easier to order and pay for!  The cream itself is great for my kids with eczema and other extremely sensitive skin issues, as well as winter skin, aging skin, etc.  Has not caused anybody any irritation and just helps moisturize the crustiest of skin problems.  We love Ultimate Aloe skin care cream!</li>
    <li> Cheap is a very good product.</li>
    <li> This does the trick and is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ultimate Aloe Skin Care for over 2 years now. It is without a doubt the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it as my daily facial moisturizer, eye cream, and all over body cream. It&#x27;s light, absorbs quickly, not greasy but moisturizing. I have very sensitive and dry skin and this product has been great. Living in Arizona sucks the moisture right out of your skin and this stuff always does the trick without being heavy or greasy. I have given it as gifts and all the recipients loved it. My massage therapist even uses it for massages and raves about my skin quality. The VERY BEST part are the pure ingredients. You could eat most of it! Our skin is our largest organ and I&#x27;m so thankful to have something I can trust being absorbed into my body. The customer service of the company is supperior, also. You should definitely try this!</li>
    <li> I have used Ultimate Aloe Skin Care for years.  Now it so convenient to buy it on Amazon.  Ultimate Aloe Care is so creamy and easy to use all over the body.  It soaks in and does not wash off, so it great for hand cream.  Our skin is another organ and Ultimate feeds the skin with all its natural ingredients from nature. It has kept my skin healthy and hydrated.  I Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I ordered 2 jars so I could have one in my bedroom and one in the kitchen. The fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and is perfume free won me over !!!!!!!!!! We live in a very cold climate and the Ultimate Aloe Skin Care does wonders for our dry skin. I will definitely be reordering this product in the future.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!  In 2013 I started having breakouts on my face around my nose and mouth and chin.  I went to the dermatologist and they diagnosed me with something called perioral dermatitis.  There was nothing that I could do for it except try a gel based antibiotic.  Steroid cremes only made it worse and there were no known causes for it.  The bumps were very painful, they felt like each one had a barb on it that went straight to the nerve when touched.  I was at an expo and was wandering around and happened onto this booth.  Jeff started talking to me about the product and noticed that I had the irritation on my face.  He offered a sample of the product but I was very skeptical.  He tried to get me to buy but I didn&#x27;t bite.  I told him that I would be at the expo again the next day to help a friend in her booth and if there was any difference in my face I would buy it the next day.  I went home that night and within a couple of hours the flames lightened on my face.  It was visibly less inflamed and it felt better.  The next day I stopped by and bought the small jar of the product and continued to use it over the next month.  I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT!!!  Within 2 weeks my condition had completely cleared up with very minimal evidence that it was ever there at all.  I went to the very next expo and paid the entrance fee just so that I could go in and find the big jars of this product!  It has been over a year and a half and I have not had one episode since I started using Ultimate Aloe.  I WILL NEVER STOP USING THIS PRODUCT!!!  Thank you to the company for an outstanding product that does wonders for everything from my skin condition to burns and dry skin...</li>
    <li> This is a great all over body cream..but I especially like it for the rough spots like elbow and heels!</li>
    <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money.  Not anything special.</li>
    <li> This is the most compforting cream for my skin when it is inflamed.</li>
    <li> aloe  good... i like skin...thank.s</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultimate Aloe for years. My heels would crack and bleed until I started using this product. I would get a pedicure and they would use a food grater to get the dead skin off. I went for a pedicure last week, the first one since last September, and they were so soft they only had to use the pumice stone! I was telling the lady sitting next to me about it and she said she was going to buy some.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! This works for so many things! We have used it to cure diaper rash, acne, burns, eczema and more! We never have dry skin anymore. It has a rich earthy smell, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your body after you apply the lotion. A little bit goes a long way and one jar will last several months, even if we use it on our two toddlers after every bath. It has replaced my face moisturizer and sunscreen. I put a little bit on my knuckles and wrists before bed and I don&#x27;t have any issues with dry, cracked, bleeding knuckles anymore. It really is as good as it sounds.</li>
    <li> YES, this product met my expectations and then some. It&#x27;s far better than other, more expensive, brands that I have used. Far exceeded my expectations! The best thing about this cream is that you can use it for everything from a hand lotion to a healing lotion. And it&#x27;s great that it has almost no order, which is wonderful if you have severe allergies like I do. This cream is light, easy to spread, and absorbs easily into your skin with soothing and healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an all purpose lotion or for a special cream to help with dry itchy skin, etc..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first product that I have ever been able to put on my face, it leaves my skin smooth and younger looking, and even works great under makeup with nothing but good side effects. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my ankles where I have some minor varicose veins that are often painful, this cream has a mild numbing effect which is very soothing. I use in on rough dry hands, heels, etc. and it has helped improve all of that.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a very small amount to be effective so the cream last a long while.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it formy son exzema. It&#x27;s amazing. I love it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very nice item!!</li>
    <li> Very nice cream with good for skin products in it. No fragrance to bother you or mix with what you wear.</li>
    <li> Beware... this lotion is so great, you&#x27;ll find yourself absentmindedly touching your face because it&#x27;s so soft. The ingredients are pronounceable, to include no parabens! Wish I could order a larger since I&#x27;m using this for both face and body lotion. Love it.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to get this one.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!! great for helping to even out my too-oily skin</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  I first found it at a Rotary Convention in New Orleans.  I love the fact that the ingredients are pure and that it is made in the USA!  I have used it on a skin tag and would you believe the tag .is shrinking. Nothing amooths aging skin like this.  MAB</li>
    <li> The skin has become very moist.</li>
    <li> This item is very good quality.</li>
    <li> Best lotion around. Helps my mom keep her skin hydrated. She takes a lot of medication and that seems to dry her out. This is the only lotion that works for her. I have dry cracked hands and sensitive skin and I now have some a fantastic product that heals and I can use on my skin. This ultimate Aloe is amazing. I tell every one I know how great it is!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for 2 yrs &amp; love it! I&#x27;ve always had dry, sensitive skin. Now I have no rough elbows, heels or &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; skin after showering. My complexions evened out. I use it everywhere--hands, feet, body, face &amp; lips. It&#x27;s pretty much replaced all my other old lotions, creams &amp; balms. It&#x27;s light &amp; non greasy under makeup &amp; handles my occasional breakouts. My husband&#x27;s using it now for after shaving &amp; on his dry hands too! Nice to get it so easy on Amazon now :)</li>
