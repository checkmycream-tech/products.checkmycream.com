<li> IT&#x27;S NOT FAIR TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS.&lt;br /&gt;*sorry</li>
<li> The only reason why I am giving it 4 starts is because I wish the bottle would had come sealed (like I have always purchased it in other places).</li>

<li> BUT, it&#x27;s not as greasy as some other removers I&#x27;ve run into.</li>
<li> I mix a bit of other oils in (specifically tea tree oil, vitamin e, and vitamin a) and it helps keep my acne under control.</li>
<li> and I am very careful with skin care.</li>
<li> Other than that, no complains!</li>
<li> Sadly it burns my sensitive eyes just like the Lancome product.</li>
<li> AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND.</li>
<li> A WEEK AT LEAST) ELSEWHERE</li>
<li> i like this product, not amazing</li>
<li> Too bad it is not easy to find it in the US.</li>
<li> Now I have to go to weird places to get my hands on it, like Amazon or eBay.</li>

    <li> i like this product, not amazing but it does get the job done, however i do have to go over my face about 2 times with this, sooo not too shabby. :p</li>
    <li> I curse the day Pond&#x27;s discontinued this elixir of awesomeness. As a life-long acne sufferer, this product was a godsend to me. I mix a bit of other oils in (specifically tea tree oil, vitamin e, and vitamin a) and it helps keep my acne under control. Now I have to go to weird places to get my hands on it, like Amazon or eBay. Why, Ponds, whyyyyyy?</li>
    <li> Gentle yet thorough eye make up remover. Gently sweeps off eye make up without pulling or dragging the skin. My eyes feel refreshed after I finish using it! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I really like this make up remover. It&#x27;s better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried. The price is good and it really removes water proof mascara.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Is great for taking off any kind of mascara. I love it. Too bad it is not easy to find it in the US. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, does not irritate eyes, leaves skin feeling fresh and soft, does not dry skin and does not remain too greasy after use.</li>
    <li> BUT, it&#x27;s not as greasy as some other removers I&#x27;ve run into. If you have impossible-to-remove makeup, this is your remover. Just be aware you&#x27;ll to give your face a good wash afterwards to get the greasy feel off.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cleaning/hydratante for a long time, I hope to continue buying it through Amazon, highly recommended, it works for me.</li>

    <li> i really love this make up remover, and honestly i only use this brand because even if i&#x27;m wearing waterproof mascara and eyeliner, this product feels gentle on the skin, it leaves a fresh smell, doesn&#x27;t feel oily and removes all make up! would totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall very happy with my purchase. The only reason why I am giving it 4 starts is because I wish the bottle would had come sealed (like I have always purchased it in other places). Other than that, no complains!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I thought it would have a thicker consistency but when I got it was not what I expected it is like a bottle of oil. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I adore it and I have bought it THREE times now this year,removes even my super waterproof eyeliner/mascara that soap doesn&#x27;t even smear..let alone remove it. Here&#x27;s my problem. AMAZON,PLEASE STOP TAKING MY STAPLE PRODUCTS AND FORCING ME TO SPEND $25 JUST TO GET THEM. I&#x27;VE ORDERED THIS THREE TIMES *ALONE* AND IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND. NOW I TRIED TO REORDER IT AND IT&#x27;S AN ADD-ON ITEM. I AM A PRIME MEMBER 2 YEARS FOR TWO YEARS NOW, BUT I MAY AS WELL TAKE MY BUSINESS(5 ORDERS A WEEK AT LEAST) ELSEWHERE IF YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP DOING THIS. IT&#x27;S NOT FAIR TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS.&lt;br /&gt;*sorry everyone else for that and again,this is a super amazing eyemakeup remover so you&#x27;d better remember to grab it when you&#x27;re placing an order or else you&#x27;ll pay royally fot it. *sad face*</li>

    <li> This is identical to Lancome makeup remover! Sadly it burns my sensitive eyes just like the Lancome product. I do like the Almay makeup remover pads. They are much gentler for me. If you love lancome buy this instead and save some $$![[ASIN:B0049S5DFG Almay Oil-free Eye Makeup Remover Pads, 120-Count (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> Después d hacer la orden con un cupón d redimir q aceptaron, el producto llegó con la factura sin el descuento. Me están cobrando todo. Eso molesta.</li>
    <li> This is great to use as a toner after cleansing.  I have dry skin so for me it isn&#x27;t oily at all.  Leaves the skin silky.</li>
    <li> Very effective, cheap and a great makeup remover. It works perfectly when you are wearing waterproof makeup.&lt;br /&gt;This is my go to eye makeup remover.</li>
