      <li>I just love the way this stuff smells.  </li>
      <li>The hair fragrance is also a cute idea</li>
      <li>The hair fragrance mist is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Frederick Fekkai is a top name brand in hair care.</li>
      <li>and I was able to run my fingers through my hair without any resistance.</li>
      <li>The sizes are very large!!</li>
      <li>Its a good purchase and it smells amazing but would NOT pay the regular asking price of $50+ dollars.</li>
      <li>migraines easily</li>
      <li>year older loved it...</li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>I cannot express how much I have fallen in LOVE with this shampoo!</li>

      <li>She loves it and keeps telling me how nice the whole set is.</li>
      <li>Has an 8 ounce bottle of Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner, a .33 bottle of hair fragrance mist (which smells amazing) and a small rose colored cosmetic bag!</li>
      <li>and I use it on date night, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase the full size when it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
      <li>It restores your hair quickly.</li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
      <li>This pack is an exceptional value, and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame too because this has been my favorite shampoo for years now until I recently became more aware of the ingredients in beauty products.</li>
      <li>I got this pack for an amazing deal during a lightning deal and I&#x27;ve only used Fekkai since.</li>
      <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo makes your hair so soft</li>
      <li>I love the Fekkai shampoo and conditioner - they make my color-treated hair soft and takes the frizz away.</li>
      <li>Other than the regular price, I&#x27;m happy and can&#x27;t complain!</li>
      <li>I gave this set to my mother in law for Christmas and she has RAVED over how much she LOVES this set!  </li>
      <li>Scent was pretty neutral.</li>
      <li>The included rose gold pouch is a cute touch but is more or less a giveaway item for me since it&#x27;s too small to hold anything substantial (as a makeup or toiletry bag).  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much Amazon for having these deals!</li>
      <li>Tried this shampoo and conditioner after reading helpful recommendatios but very disappointed.with products.  </li>
      <li>but like I said the shampoo has very mild-nice scent.</li>
      <li>My daughter likes it so much she keeps taking it.  </li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>
      <li>Purchased this for $5 during Amazons lightning deal and would maybe pay double that later, at most.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this gift.</li>
      <li>It made my hair feel very soft</li>
      <li>thanks for making me look current!</li>
      <li>She wanted some good &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using it, she said it is no better than the suave shampoo we usually get at Walmart.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since no other products were put on hair I came to the conclusion</li>
      <li>I snagged this when it was on sale as a fun little splurge.  </li>
      <li>The set looks very expensive and my sister (15 years old) was super excited to receive it.</li>

<li> One day after using these products a strange itching occurred on my scalp.  </li>
<li> Too bad I couldn&#x27;t finish it after learning more about some of the possible health risks involving a couple ingredients!</li>
<li> The 1st time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;just shampoo &amp; blew dry.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s creamy and a little bit does go a long way.  </li>
<li> Perfume is small enough to not be to bulky during travel or if in a gym bag.</li>
<li> Cuts down on frizz.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is not easy to find a selection of Fekkai in our area.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dull my color and adds a shine and smoothness to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
<li> I have used Fekkai in the past but not routinely.&lt;br</li>
<li> Fekkai was not a good shampoo or conditioner for my skin type.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> This was such a great buy as a lightening deal! Great scent and fekkai hair products are always great to my hair!</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo and conditioner after reading helpful recommendatios but very disappointed.with products.  One day after using these products a strange itching occurred on my scalp.  Since no other products were put on hair I came to the conclusion Fekkai was not a good shampoo or conditioner for my skin type.  This continues itching lasted until products were washed out of hair.  Disposed of remaining.</li>
    <li> Gave it to a friend and she LOVES it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner!  Doesn&#x27;t dull my color and adds a shine and smoothness to my hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I just love the way this stuff smells.  It definitely keeps my color lasting longer and I look forward to using it every time I hit the shower.  It&#x27;s creamy and a little bit does go a long way.  The included rose gold pouch is a cute touch but is more or less a giveaway item for me since it&#x27;s too small to hold anything substantial (as a makeup or toiletry bag).  The hair fragrance is also a cute idea and I use it on date night, but I don&#x27;t think I will purchase the full size when it&#x27;s gone.  The shampoo and conditioner, however, are now permanent staples.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I have fallen in LOVE with this shampoo! I got this pack for an amazing deal during a lightning deal and I&#x27;ve only used Fekkai since. It&#x27;s like washing my hair in liquid velvet that smells amazing! Thanks so much Amazon for having these deals!</li>
    <li> Excellent product....my hair loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo makes your hair so soft and I love the quick service you are awesome Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Fekkai products are amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift. She wanted some good &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using it, she said it is no better than the suave shampoo we usually get at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  My daughter likes it so much she keeps taking it.  lol</li>
    <li> I gave this set to my mother in law for Christmas and she has RAVED over how much she LOVES this set!  The smells is not over powering at all and very pleasant!  Will order again for myself!!!!</li>
    <li> Great gift set to give to my beauty lover friend. She loves it and keeps telling me how nice the whole set is. That makes me feel that I should have kept it for myself. Ha Ha Ha..  She told me that she loves the fragrance and also the feeling after washing the hair.    I received a discount in exchange for an hones, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> Great price on a color care package set!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for $5 during Amazons lightning deal and would maybe pay double that later, at most. Its a good purchase and it smells amazing but would NOT pay the regular asking price of $50+ dollars. Other than the regular price, I&#x27;m happy and can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> Gave as gift.....20+ year older loved it...thanks for making me look current!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, love the scent!</li>
    <li> This package is really nice and will be great for a great gift for the beauty person in your life. The size of the products is a great size and the perfume included is nicely displayed. I&#x27;d highly recommend this gift.</li>
    <li> Fekkai has take frizz out if my hair.  It also smells great.</li>
    <li> Great product, loved it</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I snagged this when it was on sale as a fun little splurge.  Love the way this smells!!</li>
    <li> I have never tried this product before. I purchased it during a lightening sale. I am so satisfied with the way this leaves my hair!! It is an excellent shampoo and conditioner and I would definitely buy again! It made my hair feel very soft and I was able to run my fingers through my hair without any resistance. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I managed to get this item for a steal using amazon&#x27;a daily deals and coupons!!!! HOLY WOW!!! Worth every penny and about 4000 more. I would totally pay 50 plus dollars for this set. The sizes are very large!! The set looks very expensive and my sister (15 years old) was super excited to receive it. I think this makes a wonderful gift for a lady of any age. Frederick Fekkai is a top name brand in hair care. Bravo amazon, BRAVO !!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing gift set! Has an 8 ounce bottle of Fekkai Technician Color Care shampoo and conditioner, a .33 bottle of hair fragrance mist (which smells amazing) and a small rose colored cosmetic bag! I love the Fekkai shampoo and conditioner - they make my color-treated hair soft and takes the frizz away. Love the fragrance mist as well - it&#x27;s got a dreamy scent! This pack is an exceptional value, and I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> The hair fragrance mist is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Got on a lightening deal! Great value!</li>
    <li> I love Fekkai, this was a great deal! I purchased it on a lighting buy. Its a must have for when you color your hair. It restores your hair quickly. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair (the conditioner is wonderful)! I often reach for this and push my costlier products aside.</li>
    <li> What a great price! Too bad I couldn&#x27;t finish it after learning more about some of the possible health risks involving a couple ingredients! It&#x27;s a shame too because this has been my favorite shampoo for years now until I recently became more aware of the ingredients in beauty products.</li>
    <li> this set is to love! I have used Fekkai in the past but not routinely.&lt;br /&gt;It is not easy to find a selection of Fekkai in our area. My hair is color treated&lt;br /&gt;but goes flat with some shampoo. The 1st time I used it, I didn&#x27;t use the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;just shampoo &amp; blew dry. My hair looked and felt great. I had been considering&lt;br /&gt;ordering it, then when I saw it as a lightening deal I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. It does have&lt;br /&gt;a fragrance, but not overpowering. I have not used the trial fragrance yet. I get&lt;br /&gt;killer migraines easily-but like I said the shampoo has very mild-nice scent. Getting this&lt;br /&gt; set for my dau-in-law and the volume set for my 2 gran-daughters to share!!.</li>
    <li> Product is great on my hair. Cuts down on frizz. The tote was perfect to keep make up in a large purse or gym bag. Perfume is small enough to not be to bulky during travel or if in a gym bag. Scent was pretty neutral. Not too strong.</li>
    <li> Great value for a high quality hair product!!</li>
