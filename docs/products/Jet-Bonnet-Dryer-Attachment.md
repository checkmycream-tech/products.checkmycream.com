      <li>This is the best.  </li>
      <li>Works wonderfully for all 3 purposes.</li>
      <li>but when I used it I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
      <li>I love it!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product and fits my hatbox hairdryer.</li>
      <li>A very good buy.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it but looks nice!</li>
      <li>But this is WAS A GOOD IDEA</li>
      <li>It was the perfect &amp; cheap solution to my curly hair dilemma.</li>
      <li>Good product</li>
      <li>Otherwise its a good product.</li>
      <li>It got to me in good time</li>
      <li>Too the people saying it blows off your head, it says right there in the instructions to use the lowest blow setting for best results.  </li>
      <li>Best of all the price was just right.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this item!</li>
      <li>I think the level of heat is dependent on the handheld dryer you own.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure my experience will be good</li>
      <li>so buy at your own risk</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and so amazingly easy to store that I have put away my hooded hair dryer for good</li>
      <li>I love this cause</li>
      <li>Make sure to put a towel on these spots.</li>
      <li>It also contours to your head so you don&#x27;t have all that room around the edges which gives you better drying ability.</li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The blow dryer does not work any more.</li>
      <li>If you are roller setting your hair, you may have better luck, but if you&#x27;re not, don&#x27;t frustrate yourself.</li>
      <li>and I actually love it.</li>
      <li>:) also i tie a hair tie around the draw string</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>It works OK</li>
      <li>I love this bonnet dryer.  </li>
      <li>All of the changes were more that I paid for this item.</li>
      <li>and it keeps my curls frizz free!</li>
      <li>Great seller, fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>lol but other than that its great</li>
      <li>Honestly it works great on low &amp; that is what the instructions recommend.</li>
      <li>It could fit on the head better, as it kind of alsmost goes over the eyes when it is inflated with air, but overall it works great.</li>
      <li>Great for those of us who have three (or more) girls in the home; I am able to do all of their heads at the same time!</li>
      <li>Also to the people saying it burns your neck, put it on the warm setting ( honestly I don&#x27;t know why they did not think of this unless they have a 15 year old blow dryer that does not have that option but all blow dryers now a days have it).</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is easy to store.</li>
      <li>It stores away easily</li>
      <li>The cap goes over your head fine</li>
      <li>But it suits me just fine.  </li>
      <li>but if you can adjust the heat on your blowdryer you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>Light weight, easy attachment to your blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I love gold n&#x27; hot!</li>
      <li>The bonnet could fit a basketball compared to the head of a humans.</li>
      <li>I now can sit comfortably while my hair dries &amp; look fabulous.</li>
      <li>It great when treating and deep conditioning my hair</li>
      <li>Before I turned my blowdryer on it didn&#x27;t fit, so I knew when the blow dryer&#x27;s air would have moved the boneet off of my head.</li>
      <li>Dries evenly and comfortably.</li>
      <li>I used commen sense and that my hairdresser does NOT use a high temperature (she uses a warm temperature) on my hair.</li>
      <li>So I suggest setting the dryer on warm and high</li>
      <li>I ordered this before learning the beauty supply around the corner has a hard top very reasonably priced, but I&#x27;m going to keep it because it&#x27;ll be perfect for travel.</li>
      <li>but it will get very hot and sometimes slips off my head.</li>
      <li>I turn the dryer up on high and the bonnet completely inflates, which is good, but it lifts off my head like a balloon to the sky.</li>
      <li>This heats up fast!!</li>
      <li>so I had to sit there holding it the whole time!!</li>
      <li>The product is a great idea, but had a little struggle keeping the tube part on the end of the hair dryer nozzle.</li>
      <li>It was well worth it.</li>
      <li>its actually pretty cool</li>
      <li>Worth the try for the price of the product.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a good product</li>
      <li>The air did not flow right and the bonnet still fell off.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, I use it to deep condition my hair, the problems with the product is that the bonnet does not stay on your hair if you do not secure it to your head with bobby pins, or some kind of hair clip.  </li>
      <li>it gets really hot</li>
      <li>I have a Belson Gold &amp; Hot hair dryer if that gives any context.</li>
      <li>Dries my hair fast!</li>
      <li>The blow dryer I used is s a gold n hot as well.</li>
      <li>It only applys heat to the top of my head.</li>
      <li>This bonnet is a more convent way to deep condition, and add an hot oil treatment in your home.</li>
      <li>I looks funny, but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
      <li>The gold color is pretty.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I have with this one it doesn&#x27;t have any way of sitting on top of your head without blowing off and you have to keep adjusting it  and holding it on your head a lot</li>
      <li>I purchased the Jet Bonnet Dryer Attachment because I am interested in hair care.</li>
      <li>otherwise it will be way to hot on your head.</li>
      <li>The product can get rather hot and burn the neck of the person that is using it, I usually have to keep a towel wrapped around my neck and for my ears, I secure the cap with the pins making sure it does not touch my ears.  </li>
      <li>I tried the heat before Mom and it was about as hot as a hard top dryer with my Chi handheld dryer on low, and my mom actually said the heat felt good!</li>
      <li>You have to have it position a certain way for it to stay on.</li>
      <li>I liked that it took less time drying my whole head</li>
      <li>My main concern is it has HOT spots where the hose and bonnet meet...</li>
      <li>The Bonnet does fly off  which is a little inconvienent, overall it get&#x27;s</li>
      <li>it works really well and very affordable</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>it can REALLY burn and hurt...</li>
      <li>Save your money and get the real deal.</li>
      <li>This fit my hand-held dryer, which I can prop up on my vanity while I put on my makeup.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Really helps make hair treatments work into the hair shaft.</li>
      <li>The hood is way to big and there is no attachment or drawstring to secure the attachment to the head, so when the dryer blows air, the attachment is blown off the head.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very compact and convenient.</li>
      <li>There is nothing  to hold the hose on the hose end onto the dryer and the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on very well...</li>
      <li>I recommend highly!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Junk. Not only was this a piece of junk, but they wanted to charge me to send it back (restocking fees and shipping). All of the changes were more that I paid for this item. Waste of money! Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I had to figure out the best way to use this bonnet attachment because I was experiencing the same results as a few of the other reviewers. I figured out that I have to set my handheld dryer to low otherwise the cap will just blow off my head. I also set my dryer to low/medium heat level because on high the cap will burn your scalp and ears because of the material. Lastly, I place the cap on just enough to cover my head leaving room at the top for the air to circulate down. It now works quite well for me, I only use it however for my weekly deep conditioning treatments (roughly 30 min per week).</li>
    <li> This thing does not have a drawstring, so it either covers my entire face or slips off my head..</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jet Bonnet Dryer Attachment because I am interested in hair care. I did not like using the regular hooded hair dryer because it kept me stationary. With the Bonnet hair dryer I can have mobility to do the things I want to when under the dryer. It great when treating and deep conditioning my hair and I have the flexibility to use it at whatever temperature I want it. It&#x27;s lightweight and so amazingly easy to store that I have put away my hooded hair dryer for good and I only use this now. I love it.</li>
    <li> I do not have a small head and it did not fix my head. The bonnet could fit a basketball compared to the head of a humans. Before I turned my blowdryer on it didn&#x27;t fit, so I knew when the blow dryer&#x27;s air would have moved the boneet off of my head. Then I came up with the idea of adding rubber bands to it. That didn&#x27;t help either. The air did not flow right and the bonnet still fell off. I had to hold the bonnet while my blow dryer was on my bathroom counter. I wished it had an adjuster since people do not have the same size head or hair length and thickness. This should have been made and sold to the public.  sure if I felt a different using a plastic cap covered with a thick winter hat comapred to this bonnet. I love gold n&#x27; hot! But this is WAS A GOOD IDEA AT ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*BTW My hair is 2 inches to my armpit. I have natural hair.</li>
    <li> This heats up fast!! I used it once and I actually love it. I thought it was going to be too big for my head but when the blow dryer is attach, your head is in a big, hot bubble. So I suggest setting the dryer on warm and high otherwise it will be way to hot on your head. I liked that it dried my very curly, long, thick hair in 10 minutes or so.</li>
    <li> Great seller, fast shipping.  The product is a great idea, but had a little struggle keeping the tube part on the end of the hair dryer nozzle. Worth the try for the price of the product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my local beauty supply store because at the time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest in a real hooded dryer. This does the trick for quick deep conditioning treatment, but unless you have a large head and/or hair down to your waist it will not stay on. You have to hold it, but the plastic will burn your fingers, ears and neck if it gets to hot (which happens even when I put my blow dryer on low). Save your money and get the real deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at my local Beauty Supply Store for $10. It was well worth it. I use as little heat as possible on my hair.Once, I  Air  Dry for a while I sit under here for 30 minutes under a low temperature and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It works OK but if you dont put it on tight, it will blow right off your head or separate from the blow dryer. My main concern is it has HOT spots where the hose and bonnet meet...it can REALLY burn and hurt...so buy at your own risk</li>
    <li> It does not work as indicated.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. It is horrible. It only applys heat to the top of my head. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m sure my experience will be good</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it but looks nice!</li>
    <li> The bonnet came a day after the expected delivery date, but it did arrived in the retail packing, and it works as expected. I ordered this before learning the beauty supply around the corner has a hard top very reasonably priced, but I&#x27;m going to keep it because it&#x27;ll be perfect for travel. I used it on my mother during her deep conditioning, and it kept flying off! I bought this for roller sets, and was concerned that it would be too small to use over the rollers, but I think it will fit with a bit of room to spare! I tried the heat before Mom and it was about as hot as a hard top dryer with my Chi handheld dryer on low, and my mom actually said the heat felt good! I think the level of heat is dependent on the handheld dryer you own. I would definitely recommend this to those with dryers whose low heat setting is warm, not hot, because it will become hot over a period of time inside the bonnet</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Excellent product. However, the box was open when I received it. It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if the product was brand new.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I use it to deep condition my hair, the problems with the product is that the bonnet does not stay on your hair if you do not secure it to your head with bobby pins, or some kind of hair clip.  The product can get rather hot and burn the neck of the person that is using it, I usually have to keep a towel wrapped around my neck and for my ears, I secure the cap with the pins making sure it does not touch my ears.  Other than that it is a good product, the bonnet should have been made similar to a plastic elastic hair cap.</li>
    <li> i bought this Bonnet dryer and for the price i paid...its actually pretty cool the only turn off i have about this is that it doesnt have drawstring..So if you are planning on using this you either have to have  GIANT head or either be using rollers i use flexi rods and it get the job done.!!also it gets really hot so i have to turn it off to catch a breather at times..lol but other than that its great i put my flexi rods in my hair but the dryer over and i do my makeup at the same time talking about MULTITASKING</li>
    <li> This bonnet is a more convent way to deep condition, and add an hot oil treatment in your home. Light weight, easy attachment to your blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from sally&#x27;s. it works really well and very affordable considering i am a college student. really no different from a hooded dryer i still use the same amount of time adjusting it to my liking only difference is i can sit anywhere in my apartment and dry my hair :) also i tie a hair tie around the draw string so it doesn&#x27;t move if i do.</li>
    <li> Well, let&#x27;s call it like we should... this thing looks a little funny, but it is a great way to dry your hair if you are a busy multi-tasker. I usually wash my hair and then sit down to work at the computer and by the time I have finished with my emails, my hair is dry. I usually put in a few rollers (large sized) to curl the ends and I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a little Moroccan oil to protect my hair from the heat. I looks funny, but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a few catches, I can&#x27;t get the thing to stay on by itself, so I use a scarf to hold it. It isn&#x27;t a big deal, but it could have been made with some sort of a chin strap to hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 of these (one I keep in my suitcase for travel) and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent in the heat department. It surrounds your hair set as described and distributes the heated air as promised. The problem is that the hood slides off with the slightest movement. Without an elastic band or tie down on its rim, it is difficult to keep it on. Otherwise its a good product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this item!</li>
    <li> oooo la la.  This is the best.  It stores away easily yet it still does the job.  It also contours to your head so you don&#x27;t have all that room around the edges which gives you better drying ability.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from sallys and I think it&#x27;s great. I have thick natural curly hair and when I do wash and goes it takes two days to dry and often gets frizzy.I love this cause I don&#x27;t have to wait ten years for my hair to dry and it keeps my curls frizz free! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this to deep condition my hair and to quickly dry my natural 4b hair when I set it in Bantu Knots and Flat Twist styles. Works wonderfully for all 3 purposes. I abhor hard bonnet dryers because I am very short and can never get the height adjusted properly. I usually have to sit on pillows or something to boost me up. Very uncomfortable lol! I now can sit comfortably while my hair dries &amp; look fabulous. I also don&#x27;t have to make hairstyling an all day task anymore. I recommend highly! Also had no real issues with it blowing off as long as I used LOW speed setting. I do use a plastic cap when deep conditioning so that held the bonnet some. You will need ear covers if used on any temp besides low. Honestly it works great on low &amp; that is what the instructions recommend. I have a Belson Gold &amp; Hot hair dryer if that gives any context.</li>
    <li> I bought this from local beauty supply. It works great! Dries my hair fast! I was looking for a bonnet hair dryer a while back but because of the negative reviews I didn&#x27;t buy this one. But I&#x27;m happy I found this one at my beauty supply and did buy it!! Too the people saying it blows off your head, it says right there in the instructions to use the lowest blow setting for best results.  So if you put it on high, then thats why it flew off your head. Also to the people saying it burns your neck, put it on the warm setting ( honestly I don&#x27;t know why they did not think of this unless they have a 15 year old blow dryer that does not have that option but all blow dryers now a days have it). Change the temperature!! I used commen sense and that my hairdresser does NOT use a high temperature (she uses a warm temperature) on my hair. It dries my hair quicker then my hair stylist hard professional bonnet dryer. All that for ten bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also I have relaxed African American hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wet set my hair with rollers. Although it does get rather hot on the highest heat setting, I found by using the low heat setting, (warm) on my hand held dryer, it was quite comfortable and dried my African American hair in 30 mins.</li>
    <li> Too small, not what I was specting, really just for Conditioning you cant really fit any rollers in it very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really helps make hair treatments work into the hair shaft. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and thought I could work with it but it just would not dry the entire head plus there is no elastic to keep it secure on your head. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I brought this item for drying my roller sets. It takes me around an hour or so to dry my hair completely. Maybe around 45 minutes into it I started to smell something burning. I pulled the dryer out of the hose and the barrell had started melting. The blow dryer I used is s a gold n hot as well. I had the dryer set on low but it melted anyway. The blow dryer does not work any more. This bonnet is not intended for prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these and I love them. Dries evenly and comfortably. Great for those of us who have three (or more) girls in the home; I am able to do all of their heads at the same time!</li>
    <li> I liked that it took less time drying my whole head but it would get really hot on forehead and the back of the neck. Make sure to put a towel on these spots.</li>
    <li> I like to use this when I have nothing better to do but just sit there when I don&#x27;t want or feel like sitting under the other dryer. The only problem that I have with this one it doesn&#x27;t have any way of sitting on top of your head without blowing off and you have to keep adjusting it  and holding it on your head a lot I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> when you turn the dryer on, the cap blows off your head, there is nothing to keep it on your head, maybe a draw string would help</li>
    <li> I like it but it will get very hot and sometimes slips off my head. You have to have it position a certain way for it to stay on. It does its job and I now mainly use it for deep conditioning treatments</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! It&#x27;s very compact and convenient. I use it for weekly deep conditioning as well as silk wrapping.</li>
    <li> Did they forget to add the feature that will prevent the cap from flying off your head? The cap goes over your head fine but once you turn on the dryer, it fills up and flies off. Then if you try holding it down, it burns your whole face and hands. Just horrible. I&#x27;m sending it back. I still haven&#x27;t read any reviews and I regret it.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product at all. Once the air starts blowing it will not stay in place, it flies off. Not a good buy at all.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, not what i expected it too small to fit all of my hair inside of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the impression that this will last for very long. The tubing is a flimsy material and will likely tear soon, but it is doing the job for now.  I also don&#x27;t like that you&#x27;re cannot use rollers or a plastic cap with it.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to store. However, the cap will rise off of your head if you are deep conditioning with a plastic cap on. I either hold it down with my hand or use a towel to hold it down. I would recommend purchasing a bonnet dryer attachment with a drawstring.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and fits my hatbox hairdryer. It could fit on the head better, as it kind of alsmost goes over the eyes when it is inflated with air, but overall it works great. A very good buy. The gold color is pretty.</li>
    <li> There is nothing  to hold the hose on the hose end onto the dryer and the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on very well... It needs a drawstring or other support to stay on 😞😞😏</li>
    <li> I gave this bonnet a 3 because when drying my hair with rollers I had to keep turning the air flow around so the whole hair could dry. but I was under the dryer for an hour so it wasn&#x27;t bad. And it&#x27;s a big no no if your hair is just wrapped wet. the bonnet kept coming off when it was turned on. Good product but just couldn&#x27;t give it a 5</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on your head..it blows off so I had to sit there holding it the whole time!! doesn&#x27;t stay on the blow dryer either!</li>
    <li> It got to me in good time but when I used it I wasn&#x27;t too impressed. It burns the back of my neck when I use it but it doesn&#x27;t say I should put a towel around my neck. Also when the blow dryer is attached to it, the bonnet flys off my head. Therefore I have to hold it down. Which is a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> The Bonnet does fly off  which is a little inconvienent, overall it get&#x27;s the job done. For less than 10 dollars you can&#x27;t complain. You get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bonnet gets a little hot but if you can adjust the heat on your blowdryer you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I suppose if you have a large/fat head, then it would stay but for those of us with a normal sized head, don&#x27;t waste your money. It stays on my dryer with no problem but once you turn your hair dryer on medium, it will slowly lift off your head. I turn the dryer up on high and the bonnet completely inflates, which is good, but it lifts off my head like a balloon to the sky. I try to deep condition with it, at least, but after 15 minutes of constant struggles, I always shut it down. I hate this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say ... If you are roller setting your hair, you may have better luck, but if you&#x27;re not, don&#x27;t frustrate yourself.</li>
    <li> HAVENT USED IT AS YET BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO. ANYONE USED IT BEFORE AND WANT TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE PLEASE DO SO</li>
    <li> Bought this from a local beauty supply store ($12) on impulse (i.e. without doing &#x27;research&#x27; or prior review of the product- Big Mistake). The hood is way to big and there is no attachment or drawstring to secure the attachment to the head, so when the dryer blows air, the attachment is blown off the head.&lt;br /&gt;Upon searching for reviews on Youtube, I noticed other users had the same complaint; many also complained of uneven distribution of heat and that the dryer got too hot at times. I have since returned the dryer attachment. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> For a tube video my username is Marisa271. It&#x27;s portable takes little space. Now i use it to activate my hair treatments with heat. Hooks up to my blow dryer with the attachment for concentrated focus. Hair drying. Is large enough to use over rollers.</li>
    <li> It was the perfect &amp; cheap solution to my curly hair dilemma. Letting my hair air dry in winter makes going out in the cold, extremely uncomfortable. This fit my hand-held dryer, which I can prop up on my vanity while I put on my makeup. I do have to hold it on with a big plastic clip on each side, but in 5 minutes it&#x27;s dry enough for my needs.</li>
    <li> I love this bonnet dryer.  It fits over your rollers or rods.  It may be a little big if you are not using roller or rods however.  But it suits me just fine.  I love it.  It&#x27;s portable and you can just fold it up and go.  Best of all the price was just right.</li>
