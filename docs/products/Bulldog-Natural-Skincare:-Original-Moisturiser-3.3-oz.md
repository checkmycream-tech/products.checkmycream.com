<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Simply put, it caused my face to swell up.  Embarrassing, as I teach business classes at a state university.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m very mindful that this kind of adverse reaction is personal, unique and unpredictable to the first-time buyer. One of the problems with buying sight-unseen...although buying a sealed tube of this stuff at a local drug store would have yielded the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I figured if my face could have a bad reaction to this stuff, there might be someone else out there who might as well.  So, caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my sister for Christmas and absolutely love it. The smell is great and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy like most lotions do. It just soaks in and feels very lightweight. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way too. One container lasted me nearly six months.</li>
    <li> only problem is that there is no sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is a good price for a natural men&#x27;s skin care product, and is working very well for me. I use it to moisturize my face after I shave, and has really helped me in avoiding irritated and dry skin.</li>
    <li> The Bulldog Natural moisturizer is a great addition to any skincare products that you currently have.  This is all natural and really leaves your skin feeling refreshed without all of the harsh chemicals that dry your skin out.  The smell is definitely that of a lemon-ish scent and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and like the how it makes my skin feel.  Best bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> Dang, this product is awesome. I have dry skin, but I was looking for something that would not leave or make my face oily immediately or some time after application. This moisturizer leaves my face with matte smooth looking finish and my face does not become oily afterwards. It does a little after like 8 hours or so, I just wipe it with we cloth or napkin and I am good to go again. Smells good too, different and better than other products. One of the best moisturizer products I have purchased in long time.</li>
    <li> My face had started drying in the cold weather, so I bought this stuff and now my skin feels smooth and comfortable. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Fast absorbing, non greasy formula, with a pleasant scent. Much better in those areas compared to Oil of Olay and Neutrogena. Price point is also more reasonable. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for natural skin products for men and bumped into this. Gave it a go and I&#x27;m loving it. I use after showers and after shaves. It smells great and it don&#x27;t get any allergic reactions from it. I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something that is paraben free and sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Overall really happy with this face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I used Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel for the longest time and finally ran out. I was in the market to just keep going with Kiehl&#x27;s but the high price made me think twice.&lt;br /&gt;I went out on a limb here but read similar reviewers rave how they switch from Kiehl&#x27;s. The lotion is very thick which for my dry face is good. For the few comments about the scent... in my opinion it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I miss the Kiehl&#x27;s lotion and the minty cool fresh feeling, but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Nice mellow, natural scent.  No greasy after-feel. No glycolic acid which is great.  Wish it came in a bigger quantity.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine yes, but I&#x27;m sure Aveno from Walgreens isn&#x27;t this much per ounce.  So the smell is slightly less girly, big deal.  It&#x27;s moisturizer.  Just buy the regular stuff.</li>
    <li> Great, non-greasy facial moisturizer with the hint of a fresh, citrusy scent. Dries quick. I use it after I shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not been tested on animals and is said to be all natural, all well and good but I puzzled about the fragrance. It, as first, seemed a bit medicinal but over time I recognised the essence of a familiar scent. Mystery solved:  the scent very much akin to extra strength Imperial Leather soap - if there were such a thing. No matter really, since it fades quickly after use.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for two weeks, and I have been extremely impressed with its ability to improve the quality of my skin. I have sensitive skin and I use this primarily on my face and sometimes the backs of my hands (which dry out easily). If you are looking for a moisturizer that does not leave a greasy processed oil on your face and actually doesn&#x27;t smell like rubbing alcohol, this is the way to go. I did a lot of research before picking this up and I know I made the right choice. This will be the No. 1 moisturizer I buy from now on.</li>
    <li> After using this product until the bottle is over, I can say :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is a soft cream with a light lemon scent , absorbed very QUICLKY  into the skin leaving no residue or oily face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A few minutes the scent disappears , but the moisturizing continues for the rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-To see results should be used daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not have any SPF, if you want this type of protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Packed with natural ingredients : essential oils, green tea, green algae, konjac mannan and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-After a few weeks my skin looks healthier , moisturized. I see the change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GOOD PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Does not feel heavy or oily when applied.  Lasts for a good portion of the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun using a moisturizer for my face.  Bluntly, I just grew tired of a dry and itchy face over the winter.  This isn&#x27;t the first product I tried, but it is clearly the best.  The first and only other product I tried claimed to be a moisturizer with a 15SPF rating.  After using it for roughly 1 week, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  It was clearly a sunblock first (and only mild at that) and moisturizer second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bulldog is completely different.  After applying the product, my face is softer and smoother and I don&#x27;t have that shiny gloss brought on by some sunblocks.  I&#x27;ve seen other comments about the smell, but I found it pleasant and very mild.  And the wife agrees.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and no parabens. I am a guy who hates oily feeling skin products and this one does not feel that way at all. My dermatologist explains that they can either feel oily or feel waxy. This is more the later, but really it feels like your skin is just soft and not coated with anything. The scent is subtle, spicy, natural, non-perfumy and nice and then pretty much disappears approximately 15 minutes after application. This is the first skin care product I have actually liked and now that my skin has gotten much older and sun damaged I really need this stuff. Now hopefully this company keeps making it for the long-haul. I will copy this review for all the other versions of this company&#x27;s moisturizers I bought.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin then this product doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t mean extreme dry skin issues, just run of the mill dry skin.  Almost as soon as you get it rubbed on your skin, the skin feels tight like no moisturizes had been used at all.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Wasn&#x27;t greasy and the scent was a very light sandlewood smell. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m very picky with face lotions. Definitely notice improved skin with daily use.</li>
    <li> No overpowering scent.  Keeps my skin looking healthy.  Much cheaper than a lot of other options</li>
    <li> This works really well, as other users mentioned it does have a unique smell but it&#x27;s better than not wearing it at all.</li>
    <li> great face wash, smells good and docent leave residue behind. i apply it after i shave. also it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to moisturize.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer i have tried yet, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to start off saying that I have so many skin problems, dryness -in the winter, oily-in the summer, just to mention a few. So this product doesn&#x27;t feel like a regular moisturizer, which usually leave your face , shiny, oily and greasy. It&#x27;s more like a cream that absorbs super fast. I have tried Kiehls -two different kinds, and Olay, both are oily, they simply don&#x27;t absorb properly. Bulldog keeps my face oil free. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin after showering during the cold winter months in New Jersey and needed something higher quality than the standard CVS brand of moisturizing lotion. With Bulldog lotion I use less lotion and have better skin. The lotion smells excellent as well and I have gotten numerous compliments for it.</li>
    <li> This is a decent face lotion to use on super dry days, like the day after clean shave and the razor has just beat your face down. The lotion itself does a great job, but I have noticed once applied it is greasy to the touch after several hours of being on. But it doe NOT smell bad at all. Overall it is a decent lotion.</li>
    <li> Great price, doesnt leave an oily after mess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Bulldog fan. It is a little thick, but it works well and isn&#x27;t at all greasy. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been gradually testing mens face lotion starting from the cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is great. My face usually feels dry until about the third application of most face lotions. With this lotion I apply it once...maybe twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and not perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No SPF, which is the only downside. Love everything else about it.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this, since there were so few reviews for it anywhere.  I saw that it was voted best by Men&#x27;s Health and Allure (Korean) and was incredibly cheap compared to the others it was up against.  This lotion is amazing!  It has a good, fresh smell, but definitely not to over-powering. The consistency is rather thick.  It&#x27;s a lot thicker than I am normally used to, so I guess it was perfect that I found this during the winter time.  I like it so much that my gf wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  Well I guess she also likes it because now she rotates it through her regimen of Shiseido moisturizers and I&#x27;m left needing to buy more..</li>
    <li> Smells ok, but a bit strong for my taste.  Goes on well and won&#x27;t leave you oily, but not sure how well it moisturizes skin.  Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I have using Billy Jealousy for some time now and just felt like I needed a change. Can&#x27;t even remember how I found this but the whole product line is great. Love the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients with essential oils. No greasy feeling and smells great. Now I wish they sold it in larger bottles.</li>
    <li> This lotion is perfect. My face gets very dry and this works wonders, much better than standard lotion (I&#x27;ve used aveeno and cetaphil in the past). I like the smell too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they made different (airline friendly) sizes</li>
    <li> The smell is kind of meh, but you only need to apply a little bit and it does the job. Every time I got out of the shower I would have noticeably dry skin around my mouth. This fixes that right up. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, but i only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a small size, and the dispenser style makes it hard to use all of the product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin look.  even had a friend asked what I was using as my skin looked so much better.</li>
    <li> Got for perpetually dry areas of skin on my face.  I usually have to use sensitive skin face wash and aftershave, but I opted for the Bulldog Original because of its natural composition.  The product worked almost instantly and it really lasts.  Feels light and absorbs quickly.  Smells different (in a good way).  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I just got this moisturizer a few weeks ago, and man I could not be more happy about it! I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other products that actually work, but I was looking for something more on the natural side (As every product that I&#x27;m getting now). I live in the Caribbean when it gets really hot pretty much all year round sometimes really humid and nasty, some others very dry, so my skin gets very dry and Oily on the T-zone, This product keeps my face sooo moisturized and healthy looking and feels so good and refreshing when I apply to my skin, also the smell kind of citrus y I really enjoy it, I use this every morning and then apply a separate product with SPF (Which is the only downside of this, I hope they make an SPF version of it) and I&#x27;m set for the day. Then at night I just apply coconut oil, which works wonders! Anyways I absolutely recommend this product, hands down!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has a mild fragrance and is not greasy. I also like the fact that it contains natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the more expensive Shiseido for over a year now and decided to look for something less watery/greasy. The shiseido product was fine but i was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t leave my forehead/face shiny which lead me to Bulldog. I&#x27;ve read about bulldog through a mens health magazine so decided to make the small investment. The product is very thick/rich and goes on easy. It smells GREAT. My girlfriend loves the scent and knows when i have it on which is always accompanied by a compliment. I feel it provides the proper moisturizing components needed to keep my face hydrated all day (much more than shiseido). My only ask: Add SPF protection! Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer works well enough and I have very dry, sensitive skin. Not the best I&#x27;ve used but definitely not bad either. It smells strongly of bergamot (which is one of the ingredients) which may not agree with some men. If you don&#x27;t know what bergamot smells like I suggest you try to find out before getting this. Think Brute aftershave/deodorant and it&#x27;s fairly similar.</li>
    <li> So Good, it&#x27;s really nice for a moisturizer with a more masculine scent. Not really into moisturizers but i&#x27;m into this stuff!</li>
    <li> Feels/smells great.  Nice to know it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
    <li> I used Kiehls face fuel for years, and I never had any complaints about it other than price. This Bulldog stuff is even better; it&#x27;s thicker so less lotion is needed for a given level of moisturizing, it has a nice earthy scent, and it&#x27;s way less expensive. It also feels great on my sack after I shave it. I&#x27;m a content convert.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say the smell was too much, well maybe you should NUT up son.  Maybe i like a little &amp;#34;hint of toothpaste&amp;#34; for my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuff works, Not greasy, not heavy, and it makes my beard as soft as rabbit fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deal with it.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve used; refreshing smell, lasts 8+ hours.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product. Leaves skin feeling refreshed, and superbly moisterurized during these harsh winters. Also the lotion smells remarkably clean and masculine.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality lightweight face lotion. I read in previous reviews that some felt the fragrance was to cologne like but I actually enjoy the fragrance, which was surprising since I don&#x27;t usually like anything with a cologne smell but with bulldog it is light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Nice light lotion with a good scent to it. I use it for my face and so far no issues. I also like the ingredients better than the toxic store bought lotions.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, no doubt but the smell kills me. Has a bit of a chemical scent which really puts me off.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, it relieved my dry skin within a week but it is not oil free. I never get acne but once i started using it, my face broke out like never before to the point where i had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer was good. But I think it did not work well with my skin. I would feel a very slight hot sensation while applying it. After a few uses I noticed that it aggravated some of my acne. So I think the product itself may not be bad but it just did not work for my skin. I am using Aveeno moisturizer now and it works much better for me.</li>
    <li> Wanted a natural moisturizer, but unfortunately this uses phenoxyethanol, a neuro- and reproductive toxin, in large quantities. My search for a less harmful moisturizer continues.</li>
    <li> Feels very good on my skin and leaves my face looking healthy when applying after a shower. I stopped using face moisturizers for a long time because any I had tried were cheapo products. They either didn&#x27;t keep my face very moisturized or they left my face looking oily. Bull Dog finds a perfect balance and keeps my face looking healthy without the oilyness. 5/5</li>
    <li> Feels great after the Bull Dog face wash. Probably just feels like it, but my face looks smoother.</li>
    <li> Not okay for sensitive skin. I got some acne after using it</li>
    <li> Bulldog Natural Skincare’s Original Moisturiser is another stellar grooming product from the innovative London-based men’s skin care brand.  This rich face lotion acts as an incredible post-shave moisturizer that helps to alleviate dryness and irritation.  Its incredible scent is the result of an all-natural blend of essential oils including lime, patchouli, bergamot, and lemon.  The nourishing moisturizer absorbs easily into the skin without leaving a greasy shine.  A pea-sized amount will keep your face feeling great throughout the morning and afternoon.  Those who care about anti-aging properties will appreciate Bulldog Natural Skincare’s Original Moisturiser contains green tea extract to help keep us looking young longer.  Give it a try if you’re looking for a fantastic natural face lotion.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell of this. It drives her nuts--she&#x27;s all over my face when I apply it. Not an exaggeration at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also natural and keeps my skin moisturized, the two reasons why I originally purchased this. I don&#x27;t need to apply as much product as other lotions. I only apply a little bit and I can apply a thin layer all over my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Fantastic daily moisturizer that never feels greasy. I&#x27;ve already noticed a marked improvement in skin health.</li>
    <li> My skin actually feels moist, it really does. The only issue that I have is that my skin is really oily which it works well with anyway even though it isn&#x27;t oil free. However my nose accumulates the most oil and it tends to overdue it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, I had a history of bad skin products that don&#x27;t work and this breaks the cycle!</li>
    <li> Cream absorbs quickly and smells nice.  Glad I bought it after researching which men&#x27;s moisturizer was the best.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Use it twice daily and can definitely tell the difference. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> As a bulldog owner, how could I not buy this. Works well, not too greasy. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Okay. I&#x27;m relatively new to moisturizer in general, so the only comparison I have is to the Kiehl&#x27;s Facial fuel. I loved the Kiehl&#x27;s product, but thought I may be able to find something else at a lower price worth trying out. When compared, the Bull Dog left my face feeling stickier, and did not seem to soak in to the skin as quickly, or as well. The big issue here, however - and the reason I&#x27;m writing this review - is the scent. It smells very &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; - think heavy amounts of Jasmine and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; oils - and VERY strong. I only wore it for one day before just biting the bullet and picking up another bottle of the Kiehls because the scent of the Bull Dog became overwhelming.  If you are thinking about buying this, I highly recommend smelling it at a physical store first because you will smell like this stuff all day long.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my husband and he loves it... It really does the works as he has extremely dry skin and he recommends it 100%</li>
    <li> This stuff is better than anything I&#x27;ve found on the shelf in stores. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Works very well, has a nice scent and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> this might be the only moisturizer in the world that managed to make my skin even more dry then it was before.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t use this on my face.  I use it on my arms/legs, though, and my wife loves the smell of it.  I recommend this for non-facial application.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling oily. Other facial lotions I have had in the past do not. I would recommend buying a different brand if you are worried about  residue.</li>
    <li> Recently, during the winter season, I noticed my skin was drier than usual, flaking at times concerning me with a potential shedding disorder. It was mostly around my cheeks, so as you can imagine, I felt like like a snake shedding and every eye that laid upon me was nothing but disgusted. Although this is a slight exaggeration of actual events it is to show that a little skin dryness can ruin confidence even if its all in the mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to search up some manly moisturizers that would be strong enough to combat my dryness and in due time I found the right one. After a few days of usage my dry skin was gone leaving behind smooth and intact skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies and dries fast leaving no oily feeling as other creams can do (granted I&#x27;ve only used Nivea growing up as a child). The smell may be strong at first but will eventually dissipate as your hungry skin chomps on them needed moisturizing goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is no joke when it comes to your moisturizing needs. A very satisfied customer indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So stop searching and buy this product now! Or keep looking, to each their own.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product at all. If you have super dry skin, like me, this cream provides the moisturizing effect for barely an hour, even if you apply loads. The good old niveas and vaselines that worked well when you were kids, works best even now. I am still hunting for the so-called savvy brands of moisturizers that can work for upto 12 hours.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every moisturizer out there. This is the one. Feels the best, looks the best and smells the best. I am a 25 year old man and have found my face a best friend.</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all but it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m in the experimental phase. I will say it goes on smoothly and leaves no residue which is a positive. Also it is non greasy on my skin, again a positive attribute.</li>
    <li> I did not expect the odor to be so unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Tired of spending $30+ for a tiny bottle of facial lotion?  You should give Bulldog a shot.  It does a great job of fighting dry skin and smells pretty good too!</li>
    <li> Really nice product, value-priced and fixes all my dry skin issues.  Smell is good, though some may not like it.</li>
    <li> Recommend by Men&#x27;s Fitness.  Found it okay and certainly less expensive than a lot of the ones that are promoted</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used great product from many premium mens skincare brands over the years. This one has become my favorite moisturizer. While it certainly is a great value I can also say that even if all of the products I have used were the same price, I would still choose Bulldog for my moisturizer. It absorbs well and feels weightless on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave any shine or greasy appearance. It smells great, uses ingredients that I am happy with and provides a perfect amount of moisture for my skin. I have not had any issues with whiteheads or clogged pores and it has improved my skin. I live and play year round in the mountains of Utah and deal with dry air and sun. This product is comfortable on my skin and works exceptionally well in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It really helps with winter dry skin on my face. I have sensitive skin and do not get a bad reaction like others have reported.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed a big difference.  The smell is a little off-putting at first but I&#x27;ve quickly gotten used to it, and the benefits far outweigh the smell.</li>
    <li> Husband Love this! Same as roll on for eyes he loves the scent, minty. (it probably wakes him up!) :))</li>
    <li> Good product. I have been using other medium grade lotion for a while, but, switched to this one, and currently using this product for &amp;#62; 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;The advantages of this product: (1) fairly good lotion in terms of moisturizing and scent, (2) portion is big enough, so, I order less frequently and use it longer than other similar grade products which only has half the portion (may be cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;The only note is that when there&#x27;s only 10% left, the container is not really good at pushing it out, so, I have to cut the tube, and there&#x27;s still fairly a lot left which I can use for almost a week. If they can improve this aspect, it will be even better!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I&#x27;d tried many &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; that ultimately are just sunscreen with a different label. This one goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and a little goes a long way. Definitely recommended for a good face moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Non greasy and smells very minty and good. Great product</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I have oily skin to normal skin and it does a great job of moisturizing without making me feel greasy. It has a great, light scent that smells fresh but doesn&#x27;t linger. It may seem a tad expensive but you get a good amount of it and it really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for something natural and effective with no frills or foofy price tag and if you&#x27;re in the market  for something like that, I don&#x27;t think you could find a better product. Only draw back might be no SPF and not prime eligible</li>
    <li> The Kiehls men&#x27;s face moisturizer has been my go-to for the last few years, but I wanted to try something that was A) Cheaper and B) Left my face a little less shiny. I read about the Bulldog product online and it had great reviews so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) No Shine&lt;br /&gt;2) Fairly Cheap&lt;br /&gt;3) Great Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;4) Did not break out (my skin is very sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The smell - I guess some people will like it, but it has somewhat of a cheap after shave smell to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like better about the Kiehls product is the smell, I am going to make the switch to Bull Dog for good, unless a better product comes out for the same price!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price and smells great</li>
    <li> Works great. Upon application it absorbers quickly in the skin. Pleasant scent. I have Rosea and I dehydrate quickly producing dry skin on my face. Bulldog suppresses this dry skin. My only complaint is me. I have to remember to apply the product when needed. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in Bulldog. Being a Georgia Tech fan, I wish it was called Yellow Jacket instead of Bulldog. This lotion by any other name would work as well.</li>
    <li> Guys, if Paul Bunyan was around today and chose to use hand lotion to keep the women that so often swung off his bulging arms happy when they came in contact with his ax swingin&#x27; hands, this woulda been it.  Honestly, the stuff works just like any other hand lotion (no surprises there, right?) BUT it smells about 1000x better (you won&#x27;t attract bees to your flowery hands), is less greasy (it isn&#x27;t made of bacon fat), it claims to be from all natural ingredients (no man-made Ununseptium to be found in this bad-boy, as far as I can tell), and it is called BULL DOG...come on.  How can you even compare a brand like BULL DOG to some kind of Special Silky Hands Bargain Brand Lotion.  You can&#x27;t, so stop trying and snag a bottle of this.</li>
    <li> one of the best and I guess top on my list  of premium men&#x27;s moisturizers . You get whats its made for and nothing greasy about it which in my book is a huge plus.. Before I purchased the Bull Dog Skin care I have been going from brand to brand weekly. I am truly proud to say I can depend on this product for my everyday usage!!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels really nice on the face. I have never owned a &amp;#34;skin tightening&amp;#34; face cream, but it kind of feels like it is tightening the skin. Might just be one of the ingredients. So far in the week and half I&#x27;ve had it, I have been very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the UK if that matters to anyone...</li>
    <li> An excellent moisturizer.  I use this on my face and neck immediately following my morning shave.  A small amount is all that is necessary so a tube of this lasts a long time.  Have bought more than once and will continue to do so.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Kind of a strong scent .. but it fades quickly luckily because I try to get my man to use moisturizer and smelly stuff isn&#x27;t what men like to put on</li>
    <li> I bought Bulldog Original Face Scrub 3.3 oz along with Bulldog Natural Skincare: Original Moisturiser, 3.3 oz. They caused my face to break out in red splotches. I threw them both away.</li>
    <li> This product has helped my dry skin immensely. Even on days I dont use it I feel a difference. Yep.</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on smooth and leaves no streaks. My one con is it smells a bit more earthy than I prefer. Other than that it is awesome.</li>
    <li> I usually purchased drug store brands like Nivea, Dove, etc.  I decided to try this lotion based on the great reviews.  I love this lotion! This product keeps my face moisturized without being oily.</li>
    <li> This is a really good oil free natural skin moisturizer from Bulldog Skincare. Goes on easy and leaves no slippery oily feeling. The only ting I could say semi negative possibly is that it absorbs super fast. You must really move to get in on the area before it either all soaks into your skin, or your hands. Its a race. It really gets in there. No SPF in case you are wondering, or if you are allergic to those chemicals.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal all natural skincare for men. Especially helps to prevent dry face for men</li>
    <li> not greasy&lt;br /&gt;great scent&lt;br /&gt;effective</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Good value/price for amount&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;more natural ingredients than other moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;Keeps face moisturized most of day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;My face Is very sensitive. This caused me to break out really bad within 2-3 days of using it. I really wanted to like it because it&#x27;s cheap and I liked that is was a more natural product than others on the market. Its not a bad moisturizer, just got a good one for my face.  Only thing Ive found that doesn&#x27;t make me break out is Menscience advanced face lotion. But it&#x27;s just way to expensive, reason why I gave this a try.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent. My face has never felt smoother. Smell is earthy but fades fast. I highly recommend this product for men.</li>
    <li> Great fresh smell, sinks into the skin immediately, totally non-greasy, no build up on the skin.</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve used quite a few other moisturizers, which did well enough, but by the end of the day my face would be way too oily. This one however does great, been using it for months, my face feels good, and most of all not all greasy at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Works great. No sticky or greasy residue. A little goes a long way. I recommend this to all men. Thanks</li>
    <li> Was recommended to use this by a friend who moved to the other side of the country from me. I personally consider this the best I&#x27;ve used in comparison with other big box and store brands. Will continue to buy until I run across something better.</li>
    <li> The product itself was very good but it did not last very long at all compared to other products of the same size.</li>
    <li> I like the way this lotion hydrates my skin.  What I am not so fond of is the smell!  It smells like Old Spice or something in that category.  Unfortunately, the smell lingers all day and from time to time I smell it.  My wife says she doesn&#x27;t mind the smell so I guess it is ok.</li>
    <li> I will be using for life, along with their other products anyone who samples it ends up stealing mine or buying their own!</li>
    <li> Made a difference in my face. I have average skin with no blemishes and primarily use this just to moisturize once a day. Overall I am very pleased. No harsh or strong smell; no greasy or oily residue. I plan to purchase this product in the future so long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, as moisturisers can get really pricey. But I am not a huge fan of the smell.  Its true as other reviews said, strong at first but mellows out when you put it on your face. It does work, But it smells like an old mans cologne which is not what Im going for.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well and a pleasant yet (not overpowering) scent. I&#x27;ve tried many other men&#x27;s moisturizers from more expensive brands (Jack Black, Clinique, etc) and this one is by far the best - only lacking a sunscreen</li>
    <li> Pretty good...im not an expert but maybe five stars if it were half the price.</li>
</ol>
