<li> This nail polish is overhyped and expensive for no reason because i have tried really cheap products, and this one</li>
<li> Anyways, I&#x27;m not a frequent wearer of nail polish.</li>
<li> Stays on long!</li>
<li> so I won&#x27;t run out for a very long time!  </li>
<li> I found this color on Amazon while trying to find a rare polish color called Bermuda Shorts, which turned out to be way too expensive.  </li>
<li> not real purple or totally pink.</li>
<li> but the color is not exactly as shown.</li>
<li> Other sellers Selling OPI products polish were watered down and chipped within a day, so I guess those were fake.</li>
<li> The nail Polish was thick.  </li>
<li> Because of my olive-toned skin, a lot of colours that I like look awkward on my hands.</li>
<li> You wont be sorry!  </li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> This is a Great product. Other sellers Selling OPI products polish were watered down and chipped within a day, so I guess those were fake. This is a nice dark pink color, it matches my \\&quot;Dish It Up\\&quot; lipstick from Mac cosmestics, that is why I ordered this color. So happy with it..A+ seller for selling real OPI, will but more from asap:)</li>
    <li> Don’t be fooled by this product!  This is not the real OPI.  This nail polish is sooooooo thin and chips easily.  I had to throw it away and go to a beauty supply store to ensure I got a quality polish.</li>
