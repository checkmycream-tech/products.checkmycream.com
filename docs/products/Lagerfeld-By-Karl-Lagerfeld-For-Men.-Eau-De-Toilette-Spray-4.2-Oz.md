<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just like I remember.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT SMELLING PRODUCT THEY USE TO SELL THIS IN PUERTO RICO BUT  I CANT FIND IT ANYMORE. AND IN THE U.S ITS VERY HARD TO FIND IN STORES. THE SIZE IS VERY NICE! THE SMELL IS GREAT! AND THE PRICE IS MODERATE!</li>
    <li> This was ordered for my husband. It is a very nice smell and very mellow to in close courters.  My asthma doesn&#x27;t like to high of chemical smells so have to be sure and get my man a nice smelling cologne. He grew up with this from his mother and it really is a perfect smell for your man of the house.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I started wearing Lagerfeld Cologne in the mid 70&#x27;s. I am STILL wearing it!!! Why change what works?</li>
    <li> Hard to find Lagerfeld in the stores - very happy to have found it on-line.  Arrived in excellent condition and fast.</li>
    <li> My Husbands Favorite Cologne and I love it on him too. Price and delivery excellant</li>
    <li> no problems. excellent service. good product.</li>
    <li> Product is the same as sold in Department Stores.  Arrived in sealed box and as advertised.  Will buy again from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Lagerfeld is a Christmas tradition for the guys in our family. Tried &amp; true - have used it for many years and occasionally even get told how good I smell. Now my grandson is beginning to use it. To me it&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; fragrance - my wife just now said it smells &amp;#34;sensual &amp; masculine&amp;#34;. What else could I ask for?</li>
    <li> Thank you is a delightful fragrance an a really good perfume, buy it for a gift and my friend loved it!</li>
    <li> It was really nice to be able to buy this cologne at such a great price!  Lagerfeld smells really good on my husband, and he always receives compliments whenever he wears it.  I was also pleased at how quickly my order was shipped.</li>
    <li> Daily. Always loved the scent and so does the women. So keep carrying it. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I have never been seduced by a cologne before. I don&#x27;t know what is in it, but when my Husband wears it, I can&#x27;t keep my hands and lips off of his neck. It must be the way a cat feels when they roll around in catnip!</li>
    <li> This is the only scent my husband has used for years and it is really tough to find!  I&#x27;ve ordered it here a few times and it comes quickly and without issue, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 25 years.</li>
    <li> This cologne has been  my favorite for years.  It&#x27;s never failed to bring me many compliments from the ladies I greet with a hug.  It really does bring me  blessed assurance, and confidence in my daily public outings.</li>
    <li> A great summertime scent.</li>
    <li> Cant find this product in stores any more so it&#x27;s nice and convenient to buy it on line. it&#x27;s nice when things work out the way they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  Heard rattling in the box.  When he opened it, the top was broken.  He could still use the fragrance.  A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this since my US NAVY days 1979-1985</li>
    <li> Great gift, came in early and he loves it! This also had a very good price on it, as this stuff is hard to find! Thanks for posting it!</li>
    <li> A bit old fashioned but the ladies love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lagerfeld for 40 years and can tell the difference between the real and the fake. Bottle came in very quickly and it was the original and genuine I&#x27;ve used forever. Women always compliment me on the aroma, even those so old their sense of taste and smell is long gone ..that&#x27;s how good Lagerfeld is !</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of Lagerfeld. I bought some for my hubby years ago and he&#x27;s used it ever since. My 19 yr. old son used it one day and loved it, as well. I ordered this one for him. We got it quickly and at a good price.</li>
    <li> My son in law&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  He refuses to wear anything but Lagerfeld.  The women love it too!  Nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I really love this on my husband.  It is original I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I initially discovered this cologne many years ago, when I bought it as a gift for my Dad. Now, it is a standard among my small collection. I love the somewhat spicy scent, and it has good &#x27;staying-power.&#x27;</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time but it looks like they are the last, hope they dont stop making them.</li>
    <li> This truly is my husbands smell, works perfect with his body chemistry</li>
    <li> Great product ... very fast shipping</li>
    <li> For nearly a decade during the 1990s I used Lagerfeld. It&#x27;s amazing how effective it was as a dating mechanism.. I think I got more dates because of Lagerfeld Cologne than at any other time in my life. I was at a buddies with it on, and his wife was literally all over me, saying \\&quot;I can&#x27;t believe how you smell!!\\&quot;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter 2013 - I decided to try Lagerfeld out again, after all these years and ordered a bottle of this up.  Anxiously awaiting it, the box arrived and I immediately opened it and noticed it smelled &#x27;off&#x27;.. A few squirts on my chest, and I couldn&#x27;t even breath - the smell was like a cleaning product - Lysol or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What have they done with this formula? Whatever they did - they ruined it.. This is not the old school, awesome smelling stuff.. This is chemical junk that smells like cheap dollar store cologne.. What a shame, and a shameful way to do business. I would guess they changed the original one to save money - that&#x27;s how these companies work. I caution anyone wanting this - realize you are NOT getting Lagerfeld the way it was, and sadly unless you want to spend $200 a bottle for Vintage stuff on Ebay you aren&#x27;t getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lagerfeld fails.</li>
    <li> Excellent, as promised</li>
    <li> SIMPLEMENTE CONVENCIONAL</li>
    <li> Came only 80% to 85% full; then the fragrance has lost most of it punch. Used to be able to get the desired effect with 1 or 2 sprays now takes 3 to 5. I am guessing the are selling old stuff that over time has lost its fragrance.</li>
    <li> Lagerfeld has a long lasting pleasing aroma. I have many friends that say many different colognes irritate their nostrals, but lager feldt does not. I love it!</li>
    <li> My husband, rancher type dude, loves this scent and I love it on him. Very manly, not flowery or too strong....classy.</li>
    <li> Still a great scent after all these years.  I wore Lagerfeld in the 90&#x27;s and for some reason stopped some years ago.  I decided to buy another bottle and am I glad I did.  The scent is as I remember. Sheer quality.</li>
    <li> Ive used this for over 30 years. This is a fake product and I will never use Amazon again for any reason I want my money back or the real thing sent to me at no charge.Pretty sure you will not respond to this message. what a waste of my valuable time and money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just want I needed.  Thank You</li>
    <li> Good price fast shipping, if this is what you use, buy it. Not much else to say. Same as thirty years ago, but cheaper</li>
    <li> Product is as described  top if bottle was broken shipping was slow</li>
    <li> My husband has been using it for at least 25 years and I still lobbed it!</li>
    <li> The lady of my life loves it on me she says it is fresh and smell great when I&#x27;m gone she can still smell me that great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is Genuine Lagerfeld. Smells very similar, but lasts maybe an hour?</li>
    <li> Excellent , it&#x27;s just what I expected</li>
    <li> When I smelled this on my man, I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing him.  I love that soft, yet masculine, powdery smell.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> the product was good however the packing was not. When I receive the item the top ring was broke up. I knew that if I send it back and had to wait on that to be re mailed back out it would be another 3 weeks so I just decided to keep it. I&#x27;m sure they would have probably replace that had I reached out to them</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for so many years I can&#x27;t remember how long.  I even used to wear it myself because I loved it so much.  He has tried some different ones a few times but always goes back to the Lagerfeld.  That saying &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; definitely applies here.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this since high school and after spraying a couple of sprays, brings bad old memories (ones I can&#x27;t share ... lol!).</li>
    <li> Great fragrance from the past, and still get loads of compliments on it.  Not to heavy just right just a couple of squirts and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lagerfeld for more than 40 years and it one of the few I&#x27;m not allergic to. However, it not easily available anymore. Great price and great delivery. Wanna make Grandpa smile, buy him this...</li>
    <li> All seem to notice when I use it and respond positively. It has a pleasing aroma that makes me feel good.</li>
    <li> This is the actual Lagerfeld.  I cannot find this item in no store where I live.  I&#x27;ve tried the outlet such as the perfume outlets but that all didn&#x27;t look or smell like the actual real Lagerfeld.  Also, the price was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Highly recomended for gift or to add to your cologne group a great cent at an unbeatable price for the size highly recomended size for a gift or for yourself.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this cologne for years. He always gets compliments on how well he smells. A masculine scent.</li>
    <li> Great price for this size cologne!  It is my husband&#x27;s favorite so I purchased it for him for Father&#x27;s Day.  He loved it!  Was delivered on time and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Great product great service</li>
    <li> I love the way he smells when he wears this cologne!  It stays on him all day and is such a good price for quality product.</li>
    <li> Great price for a difficult to find fragrance.</li>
    <li> my husband says it does not have the same scent as the one he just finished.</li>
    <li> excelente producto, lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I am giving it a three, because the new scent is an awesome bug repellant.  I am not Joking!!!  My husband noticed that buffalo gnats, and deer flies won&#x27;t even get near him while he is mowing.  Kind of expensive for bug repellant, but it is better than using deet or other oily bug sprays.  He won&#x27;t go to the golf course without it.</li>
    <li> You know I was going to buy this on Amazon and am a fan of full size bottles in general.But K-Mart had the 1.7oz size on sale for $12.49.A pretty good deal as I snatched up the last two at my local store.But I still recommend Amazon for being well priced so I will be back here for the full size.So,it&#x27;s nice to see alot of people praising this 70s scent but others say &amp;#34;what does this cologne smell like&amp;#34;? a good question.I can&#x27;t speak for other individuals but here&#x27;s my opinion from wearing this on and off as an occasional buy throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lagerfeld Classics Scent:&lt;br /&gt;To me the scent of this cologne is dry cedar wood,orange teased with some kind of spice,and vanilla powder.There is a minty quality that dies down into a green/herbal accord that&#x27;s very faint...I&#x27;m guessing basil.All of this sits on top a bed of tobacco and smells pretty rich.Everything pretty much changes hands as the cedar and tobacco becomes more dominant and the sweetness becomes very light.I don&#x27;t consider Lagerfeld to be ultra masculine where animal musk notes and darker woods and spices would lend more ruggedness and depth.It&#x27;s a good cologne and comes off as very natural on dry down.in my opinion Lagerfeld Classic runs very cool and is friendly to wear year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drift from this cologne eventually in desire for a rich scent on dry down but something about Lagerfeld always reels me back in.</li>
    <li> Love this colonge. Lasting scent.</li>
    <li> This must be old/bad product, I have been wearing this for 15 years. First time I have purchased online, smells AWFUL, tossed 2 bottles! Save your money and purchase at a store.</li>
    <li> My husband does not want to use anything else.  He has been using it for years!  It is a great product</li>
    <li> Personally, I love this cologne.  I recognize the smell immediately when I&#x27;m out or in a crowd and someone is wearing it.  As some of the other reviews have noted, I&#x27;m not sure this is exactly the same as years ago, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it three stars is because the ladies in my life do not like it.  Maybe it&#x27;s not a good mix with my chemistry.  It&#x27;s also too strong for an office environment, so I&#x27;ll be sticking to my other favorites to use on a day-to-day basis.</li>
    <li> Used this cologne for years.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s more of a spicy, woody aroma.  Never cared for colognes that have that heavily sweet fragrance.</li>
    <li> Someone had given me Lagerfeld as a gift at one time and I loved it.  I was glad to find it on line.  My wife loves for me to wear it.</li>
    <li> This is the Lagerfeld I had many years ago. Can&#x27;t say for sure if it is &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;. May be somewhat, but still smells great and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it and also can&#x27;t find in stores anymore. Probably because there are so many different fragrances there is just not enough room to stock all of them. My wife loves it and says just use a little more.....&lt;br /&gt;BTW if you like and use POLO, you will pay 2 times the cost...check Amazon prices.</li>
    <li> Great! Love it a LOT.</li>
    <li> I have used this Toilette spray for about 13 years  ----like it very well .  :)</li>
    <li> Thank you! Very well all! Excelent, It came good terms, It is the favorite perfume my dad, Thanks all of!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and purchasing it from Amozon for years and I am total satisfied with it !!!</li>
    <li> A fragrance that endures....still get compliments from people when I wear it...Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Great classic fragrance at a reasonable price. I will order again soon.</li>
    <li> I wear this if I am going out or not. It has the best smell and the ladies love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, a little on the spicy, musky &amp; leathery side and it reminds me of my youth.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and love the light scent.</li>
    <li> My husband loves to use Lagerfeld and I - and all my friends - love to smell the fragrance as he walks by!  We can no longer find this fragrance in department stores, and we were thrilled when Amazon located it for us!  Thanks Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> Great product and I was very happy with it, and received it very quickly</li>
    <li> Excelente servicio los felicito y les doy 5 estrellas. el perfume es una delicia lo recomiendo para hombres exigentes saludos.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional and it is everything that I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I was initially worried that this was somekind of knockoff, but it is the real deal at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;Mark</li>
    <li> This product gets one star ONLY because of the nice bottle.  My son received it as a gift and made the mistake of spraying it amongst the whole family.  It smelled of alcohol with a lingering odor of old, old, old man.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Classic Lagerfeld</li>
    <li> I must say, I remember this from back in the day when I couldn&#x27;t afford it.  I receive my bottle in  reasonably quick fashion. I put a little bit on my wrist and have been smelling that area all day. All I can say is WOW!</li>
    <li> HAVE USED THIS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. STILL GET COMPLIMENTS FROM WOMEN ON HOW GOOD I SMELL! PRETTY GOOD FOR AN OLD FART!</li>
    <li> While this fragrance does smell like the original...it does NOT have the last effects as the original...and not quite as stron...a bit disappointed...</li>
    <li> My wife first bought this cologne for me in a military PX about 8-9 years ago.  I liked it a lot.  I&#x27;ve since ordered it twice here at Amazon (different suppliers I believe), but it sure &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; that this spray&#x27;s been watered down compared to that very first bottle my wife purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lagerfeld smells great, but it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as it used to be, nor is it as long-lasting as some other colognes I use (Polo or Calvin Klein Eternity).  For that I say its a 3-star and OK.</li>
    <li> Great product! Brand new box, delivered quickly! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  Great smelling stuff.</li>
    <li> Rapid delivery.  Wife likes it.  What more could you ask?</li>
    <li> Price right and shipping was fast. I have been using this product for over 20 years and have friends who won&#x27;t let me where anything else.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend who was having trouble finding it.  It is a light, not overbearing fragrance.  My friend and her husband love the scent and they both are sharing the bottle!</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING, WE RECOMENT ALLWAYS, FIVE STARS +++++A+A+A+A+A+A+A</li>
    <li> They must have changed the formula. Smells like some kind of bug spray or insecticide. I got some from the store that was the old stuff and smells great. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I&#x27;ve ever liked. I don&#x27;t know if women like it and I don&#x27;t care. It smells nice and is better than the supposedly &#x27;manly&#x27; fragrances out there; in my opinion that is...</li>
    <li> This Lagerfeld do not smell like or last as long as the old Lagerfeld maybe because the old Lagerfeld was a splash on. and the new stuff is a spray.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this cologne anywhere where we live, so when I found it on Amazon I was excited.  My husband was happy to get it for Christmas as it is one of his favorite colognes.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. Have worn it before it became &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;. Never disappoints.</li>
    <li> My favourite fragrance on my man!  It&#x27;s nice and lingering, sexy, sensual!  I&#x27;ve bought this for years and will definitely continue.</li>
    <li> My favorite for any man.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Lagerfeld cologne.  The only issue we had was in the shipping.  The top of the bottle was completely broken off and crushed when it arrived to our house.</li>
    <li> Personally, I love original Lagerfeld. Nothing like it. Hopefully its status passes from outdated to classic soon. Out of vogue and into Walmart? So be it.</li>
    <li> Item was as described</li>
    <li> Old school Lagerfeld.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift about 5Years ago, Have used nothing else. Try it the Women even know how good it is.</li>
    <li> Mom got this years ago for me and it brought back memories. Great cologne for a great price. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores anymore but a soft gentle cologne that&#x27;s clean and fresh</li>
    <li> Great. Love it. It&#x27;s my boyfriends favorite. Hard to find, not in stores.&lt;br /&gt;It showed up 2 days after ordering. Will deffenitly order again.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this cologne and it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Lagerfeld he has bought in the past. It smells a lot like Lysol.</li>
    <li> I have worn lagerfeld for years and it is a very good distinctive aroma. The first bottle i bought was very weak and&lt;br /&gt;Not the correct stregth or smell. I didnt complain or return it i jost figured it was a bad batch. Almost gone i decided to order another one and damn if its not exactly the same. I dont understand who is at fault here but i wont be back!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect delivery except the ring on the cap was broken.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a true Lagerfeld.</li>
    <li> Best Men&#x27;s Eau De Toilette Spray Ever !!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful fragrance. It has the slightest hint of a powdery smell but it is still a totally masculine fragrance. I can&#x27;t believe that it is no longer being sold in stores (or at least I have been unable to find it) but I highly recommend it. Love it!</li>
    <li> And either you like the smell of it, or you don&#x27;t! This sentence is here to comply with the requirements.</li>
    <li> Been wearing Classic Mens Lagerfeld for 25+years. I&#x27;ve been and continue to be stopped in stores, on the street, everywhere by women and men alike, and asked what I am wearing. It is certainly a unique scent unlike any other</li>
    <li> This is a great place to buy this wonderful, classic fragrance.  You cannot find it in Macy&#x27;s anymore and it is so easy to order it here on Amazon.  It brings back old memories and helps to create new ones.  I am glad we can buy it here.</li>
    <li> You may have to make your own judgement here.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is of a &#x27;spivey&#x27; variety and mild in intensity.&lt;br /&gt;Reviews such as this are less helpful unless you know how the fragrance blends with your own skin chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;For me, the match is good.&lt;br /&gt;Will it be good for you?</li>
    <li> Has always been my favorite cologne.  A manly scent and A legend in my book.</li>
    <li> There is NO better smell than Lagerfeld, and this was a great find for the price!!  I recommend it to anyone looking for a subtle, earthy smell...  I can&#x27;t say enough!!!  VERY happy with this find!!!</li>
    <li> I was just reorganizing the bath shelves and came across this delicious scent once&lt;br /&gt;again.  It brought me right back to those salad days of courtship and romance&lt;br /&gt;with my handsome hubby.  There is just nothing like it! I have placed it prominently&lt;br /&gt;on the front row of the shelf and my first request when he returns from his practice&lt;br /&gt;today is that he wear it....AND KEEP WEARING IT! I will certainly utilize my lovely PRIME&lt;br /&gt;membership to reorder as necessary! Thanks AGAIN Amazon..and thanks Lagerfeld for&lt;br /&gt;creating the best men&#x27;s cologne EVER!</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and he is thrilled to have another new bottle.  I appreciate the great service.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Same as store but for a lot less.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lagerfeld for over 20 years and I still get frequent compliments on it. It is my fragrance of choice and of all the women in my life, since II started using it. Lagerfeld has been referred to as &amp;#34;babe magnet&amp;#34; and I raise my voice in wholehearted affirmation, because I cannot think of a better name for it. I will never wear anything else as long as I can get it.</li>
    <li> I like this cologne, which I have used for 20 years or more. Fragrances come and go, but this one matches me well, and elicits favorable comments. &amp;#34;A little dab will do ya&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lagerfeld for over 40 years and see no reason to change. Have to mail order it the last few years but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some 15 years.  Receive many compliments regarding it and it was selected for me by my wife.</li>
    <li> Retro 1970&#x27;s fragrance,forgot how much I love this stuff. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I got the lagerfeld for my husband that one of is favorite cologne he love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my spouse, this is his signature scent. Packing good, price excellent. I will be a repeat customer</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for over 30 years, and still get compliments every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> love it..great,great,great</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments about how good I smell.  I will use it as long as it exists.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> wished I could find the Classic stick deodorant</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for men for years.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH!! I will only buy this from Amazon. AMAZING product. My husband only wears this colonge. Love being able to buy such a big bottle!!!!</li>
    <li> Thankfully when I ordered I got 2 bottles.  It was my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and could only get it at Amazon.  Now I can smell him anytime I want.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  I GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Package looks genuine, new, and sealed in shrink wrap, and contents are as described, but... I&#x27;ve been wearing Lagerfeld for more than twenty-five years, and the contents of this spray don&#x27;t smell anywhere close to the same. Actually it stinks. It&#x27;s headed for the trash can.</li>
    <li> This German product is wonderful.  I didn&#x27;t know much I loved the smell of it and the design of the bottle until my mother bought me a bottle of Liz Claiborne&#x27;s Curve--pfew! what a pong!  Unlike the Curve product, the Lagerfeld doesn&#x27;t overpower you or last seemingly for a few days.  Just put one spritz on before you head to the office, and it&#x27;ll last the whole 8-hour shift, and it won&#x27;t smell like a gas attack.  Very recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Lagerfeld for 25+ years. Every man should have a bottle of this. The women really love it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I used to wear this back in the early 80s when I dj&#x27;d in a nightclub. brings back a lot of memories</li>
    <li> Ordered on Monday, delivered on Wednesday. Extremely fast service and the product is exactly what I wanted for a great value...</li>
    <li> This is the best ever fragrance that my husband wears! He gets MANY compliments but most of all I love it too and that&#x27;s what really matters... besides him of course.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance as an occasional change to Obsession. It is masculine and stays with me for long periods.</li>
    <li> This cologne has a very lasting and manly smell. I was looking for it long time. Arrived on time and well packed.</li>
