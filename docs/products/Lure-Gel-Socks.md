### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These socks are wonderful; they smell great and soften your feet overnight!</li>
      <li>Five stars for sure!!!!!</li>
      <li>I am trying to wear them a couple of evenings each week to keep my feet in good condition!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too happy about that</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>Product is good except that I used them at night and my sheets are stained with what looks like oil.  </li>
      <li>is good, received product quickly.price is good, also.</li>
      <li>Try putting them in the microwave for 30-60 seconds before putting them on, you will love it!  </li>
      <li>And she says the smell is nice.</li>
      <li>I like the smell and they moisturize my feet nicely and smell</li>
      <li>But her feet do get nice and smooth for about 12 hours.</li>
      <li>Love the way they make my feet feel.</li>
      <li>since I laundered the sheets and the stains on both the fitted and top sheets did not come out.</li>
      <li>Comfortable for around the house and wearing overnight.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect them to work, but was happy to find out that they really do work.  </li>
      <li>This pair is not hot, not cold, perfect for me.</li>
      <li>what I like the most about these socks, is the fact that I don&#x27;t get too hot in them.</li>
      <li>They kept my feet very warm but the best thing is that after I wore them, my feet were so soft and calluses and hard spots seemed much softer.  </li>
      <li>They feel very funny to walk around in...</li>
      <li>It is amazing how soft my feet were the first morning.</li>
      <li>Good sock, worked well for my dry feet.  </li>
      <li>But now they are fine, and my feet are SO soft.</li>
      <li>a huge difference,&lt;br /&gt;im 61 years old &amp;</li>
      <li>Good to sleep in but hard to walk in..</li>
      <li>The socks didn&#x27;t even come in real packaging.</li>
      <li>but my feet would be much smoother after wearing them.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I love the socks.</li>
      <li>I tried my first pair of gel socks last evening.  </li>
      <li>Usually I cool my body by sticking one feet out of the covers, and inevitably all other socks that I tried I had to remove at a certain point.</li>
      <li>My husband surprised me with these socks.  </li>
      <li>so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;quality</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that the gel becomes kind of sticky and a couple places</li>
      <li>They dont come up as high on the back heel as the picture portraits.  </li>
      <li>I am seeing similar products for less at one of the big chain drugstores (W).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizing - I wear size 8-8.5 shoes and these just fit.</li>
      <li>feet felt soft when i woke up and didnt take long to ship</li>

<li> Only thing, I wish they were a little bigger.</li>
<li> they dry and crack otherwise.</li>
<li> Work well to soften dry skin at heels and calloused toes, outer foot ball.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wear these over night to as my feet is dry</li>
<li> and I had some dry cracking areas on my feet.</li>
<li> My feet stay soft and no more cracking for me.</li>
<li> these wear out a little faster than the blue ones that used to be offered here on Amazon.</li>
<li> If I was a size 9-1/2 or larger, they would not fit.</li>
<li> They are made in China, not the USA, and there is no company named &amp;#34;Lure Health and Beauty&amp;#34;, especially not in New York where the box of the gloves indicated.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;its not for little kids.&lt;br</li>
<li> Now I have made a habit that a few times a week I go to bed with these on and problem solved.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not brave enough to get too close to her feet to smell them</li>
<li> They game in a baggie with a Chinese language paper insert.</li>
<li> The little &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; on the bottom are hard plastic not rubber which would give them some grip.  </li>
<li> wears very well for people with bad feet</li>
<li> Seems shady to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I agree with another reviewer that they are hard to walk in because your feet slip across the gel.  </li>
<li> Just do a Google Images search for &amp;#34;gel spa gloves&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
<li> Seriously you could use her feet to refinish floors.</li>

<li> A few of them got so bad that they started to bleed.</li>
<li> They are clammy when cold.  </li>

    <li> Good sock, worked well for my dry feet.  My only complaint would be that the gel becomes kind of sticky and a couple places it fell off the inside of the sock after just a couple uses.</li>
    <li> these wear out a little faster than the blue ones that used to be offered here on Amazon. they do help keep my feet moist tho. they dry and crack otherwise.</li>
    <li> It helps moisturize well the feet. what I like the most about these socks, is the fact that I don&#x27;t get too hot in them. Usually I cool my body by sticking one feet out of the covers, and inevitably all other socks that I tried I had to remove at a certain point. This pair is not hot, not cold, perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I tried my first pair of gel socks last evening.  They kept my feet very warm but the best thing is that after I wore them, my feet were so soft and calluses and hard spots seemed much softer.  I truly recommend them.</li>
    <li> My husband surprised me with these socks.  I really didn&#x27;t expect them to work, but was happy to find out that they really do work.  They feel very funny to walk around in...but my feet would be much smoother after wearing them.  I am trying to wear them a couple of evenings each week to keep my feet in good condition!</li>
    <li> Love the way they make my feet feel. Only thing, I wish they were a little bigger. They dont come up as high on the back heel as the picture portraits.  If I was a size 9-1/2 or larger, they would not fit.</li>
    <li> it was a gift, so I don&#x27;t know how well they worked for moisturizing the feet, but they did leave greasy-looking footprints on the hardwood floor.</li>
    <li> i like the fact there is  LAVENDER  OIL  n them.&lt;br /&gt;i have to wear support  nylons  and i add these to my feet and WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;what a huge difference,&lt;br /&gt;im 61 years old &amp; this is for all ages,&lt;br /&gt;although  i think over 13  so kids won&#x27;t put the gel in there mouth&lt;br /&gt;its not for little kids.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wear these over night to as my feet is dry .&lt;br /&gt;thanks seller.</li>
    <li> wears very well for people with bad feet</li>
    <li> After buying the socks and the gloves, I found out that these are falsely advertised. They are made in China, not the USA, and there is no company named &amp;#34;Lure Health and Beauty&amp;#34;, especially not in New York where the box of the gloves indicated. The socks didn&#x27;t even come in real packaging. They game in a baggie with a Chinese language paper insert. After some research, I found that these are often rebranded and sold by various Chinese companies. Just do a Google Images search for &amp;#34;gel spa gloves&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Various different company logos on the same basic packaging, especially sold on non-US websites like Ali-express. Seems shady to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the product, not great. I didn&#x27;t try the socks because I became suspicious after receiving them with the Chinese &amp;#34;packaging&amp;#34;. But, the gel on the gloves just stuck to my hands, so when I pulled them off I had bits of the gel left on them and had to wash it off.</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my daughter who is on her feet all night. She loves them</li>
    <li> These socks are wonderful; they smell great and soften your feet overnight! It is amazing how soft my feet were the first morning. The only drawback: my foot is a size 10, and they were a wee bit snug - I had to stretch them a bit. But now they are fine, and my feet are SO soft.</li>
    <li> I am barefoot a lot in summer and I had some dry cracking areas on my feet. A few of them got so bad that they started to bleed. Talk about pain!!!! Ordered these cause cotton socks just weren&#x27;t working and in three nights of wearing them I had mayor improvement. Now I have made a habit that a few times a week I go to bed with these on and problem solved. My feet stay soft and no more cracking for me. Five stars for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price</li>
    <li> I like the smell and they moisturize my feet nicely and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of  things I don&#x27;t like about them.  1.  I agree with another reviewer that they are hard to walk in because your feet slip across the gel.  2.  The little &amp;#34;feet&amp;#34; on the bottom are hard plastic not rubber which would give them some grip.  3.  They are clammy when cold.  Try putting them in the microwave for 30-60 seconds before putting them on, you will love it!  4.  I am seeing similar products for less at one of the big chain drugstores (W).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizing - I wear size 8-8.5 shoes and these just fit.</li>
    <li> Good to sleep in but hard to walk in.. feet felt soft when i woke up and didnt take long to ship</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife who has feet like sandpaper. Seriously you could use her feet to refinish floors. She says these are weird in that they are squishy when you wear them and not good to walk around on as they leave oily marks on the floor. But her feet do get nice and smooth for about 12 hours. And she says the smell is nice. I&#x27;m not brave enough to get too close to her feet to smell them so I&#x27;ll take her word for it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use these because they leave greasy footprints all over my house. I even tried wearing a pair of cotton socks over them and they still greased up my floors.</li>
    <li> Work well to soften dry skin at heels and calloused toes, outer foot ball. Comfortable for around the house and wearing overnight.</li>
    <li> The gel inside of the socks is rubbing off some! Other than that, I love the socks.</li>
    <li> Product is good except that I used them at night and my sheets are stained with what looks like oil.  I&#x27;m not too happy about that since I laundered the sheets and the stains on both the fitted and top sheets did not come out.</li>
    <li> I gave these gel socks to three persons who have feet problems from diabetes. so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;quality is good, received product quickly.price is good, also.</li>
