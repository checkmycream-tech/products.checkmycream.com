      <li>I love the revaleskin night cream.  </li>
      <li>My face was clearer, the pores had shrunk and the texture seemed much more even.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and was delighted that I found it on amazon at a more affordable price.</li>
      <li>This works for me and most eye makeup comes off easily too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very drying, so it&#x27;s best to alternate.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed at all.  </li>
      <li>I also use a toner post cleansing and the cotton ball is clean, so I know that the dirt is getting off with just washing.  </li>
      <li>not recovering from the laser, this can be used with your Clarisonic to get a deeper clean.</li>
      <li>So, if you like the foam to feel like your face is getting clean, this cleanser is not for you.</li>
      <li>It does not lather, and I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I also am using the Revale Intense Recovery cream on my face and it is also outstanding.</li>
      <li>This cleanser does not suds up, but it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Revaleskin Facial Cleanser is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The real bonus is that it easily removes waterproof mascara without stinging my eyes.</li>
      <li>just feels real soft as i clean.  </li>
      <li>Overall, my skin texture seems better, but it can be attributed to the combination of pore refining products that I am using.  </li>
      <li>I love this cleanser, tried it for the first time when an esthetician recommended this cleanser after a facial been hooked since.</li>
      <li>Once my face is cleansed it feels soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Works better than actual rosacea products and medicines.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>I then dispense about 4 pumps of the cleanser onto my damp fingers and apply to my forehead and nose first.  </li>
      <li>Price was good that if it didn&#x27;t work for me, I didn&#x27;t feel like my money was wasted  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and mild rosacea.</li>
      <li>but you can use in the shower instead of most milk cleansers where you use on dry skin then</li>
      <li>It lightens the age spots on my face and neck and is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves this product</li>
      <li>I have the whole line of Revaleskin products.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser is extremely gentle but cleans well.  </li>
      <li>While my skin is still damp I apply the Revale Intense Recovery Treatment antioxidant serum.  </li>
      <li>though I have really oily skin, but it feels like it really cleans it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very neutral on this product.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive,oily skin  2.</li>
      <li>Since this cleanser is like a watery, non-foaming liquid, you have to gently massage your face and neck to evenly distribute the product.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;d really like to know what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>I originally found out about it from my dermatologist and have used it for the last 6 years.  </li>
      <li>I spent $$$ on the Armani skincare line and although it smells amazing the results weren&#x27;t the same as what I get with Revale-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Revale skin care system.</li>
      <li>It makes my face feel clean without feeling dry.  </li>
      <li>It is delicate on my skin but effective.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t use again and am looking for a new cleanser.</li>
      <li>i am giving this product a 4 star because it makes my skin very soft</li>
      <li>and my skin was very sensitive afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance and propylene glycol.</li>
      <li>My sensitive skin looks and feels clear and balanced.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 49 and my skin has issues with adult acne and rosacea.  </li>
      <li>After using other Revaleskin products that were excellent, I find this product disappointing.  </li>
      <li>It does not dry her skin and makes it soft.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ve been swayed with 2 other lines, Armani Gentle Balm Cleanser and</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t wet my face first, if a spot on my face is dry</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years and was glad that I could get it at a more affordable price thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> product in excellent condition..sealed package   Very quick service.  Definitely will use this service again!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product for a couple of reasons:  1. I have very sensitive,oily skin  2. Read a few reviews that were promising on a couple of blog sites  3. Price was good that if it didn&#x27;t work for me, I didn&#x27;t feel like my money was wasted  With that said, I actually like the cleanser. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin...though I have really oily skin, but it feels like it really cleans it. I also use a toner post cleansing and the cotton ball is clean, so I know that the dirt is getting off with just washing.  Overall, my skin texture seems better, but it can be attributed to the combination of pore refining products that I am using.  I would recommend this to anyone who has oily, senistive skin wanting a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate and also minimizes pores. Also, the bottle is large so at this price it should last at least 3 months using 2X a day.</li>
    <li> Revaleskin Facial Cleanser is the best facial cleanser I have ever used. It is delicate on my skin but effective. It has cleared up my skin beautifully and it tightens my pores. Love it!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite cleanser. I always get compliments on my skin when I&#x27;ve been using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a year now, went to the dermatologist to see what I should be using and she showed me this line-Now I&#x27;ve been swayed with 2 other lines, Armani Gentle Balm Cleanser and then one from Bobbi Brown, within 1 day I had issues-I do have to use a lot of squirts with this cleanser but it never burns my eyes or causes a reaction to my skin, so I will always stick to this cleanser-It&#x27;s almost a milk cleanser but you can use in the shower instead of most milk cleansers where you use on dry skin then tissue off-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the day and night lotions, and again I tried other lines but my skin only likes this RevaleSkin care line-I spent $$$ on the Armani skincare line and although it smells amazing the results weren&#x27;t the same as what I get with Revale-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the Intensive Recovery, eager to see how that works-</li>
    <li> This facial cleaner is the bes I have ever used.  I originally found out about it from my dermatologist and have used it for the last 6 years.  It cleans my skin with many types of city and well water I have been exposed to.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleanser. I have very sensitive skin and mild rosacea. This has been an amazing product.  Works better than actual rosacea products and medicines.  I also bought the Elette cleanser for my occasional acne. It&#x27;s very drying, so it&#x27;s best to alternate.  I&#x27;ve had problems with the pump, like a lot of others.  I just screw off the top and pour the product out.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, but still cleanses.  Also removes my eye make up without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Using it for years!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cleanser, does not foam as described but who cares.  This works great on my laser-treated skin and helps even my skin tone and reduce fine lines.  I use it every evening.  Tips for use, I wet only my hands, not my face.  I then dispense about 4 pumps of the cleanser onto my damp fingers and apply to my forehead and nose first.  Since this cleanser is like a watery, non-foaming liquid, you have to gently massage your face and neck to evenly distribute the product.  That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t wet my face first, if a spot on my face is dry then I didn&#x27;t get the cleanser on it.  I rub in circles and you will get just a hint of a white foam, but not like other soap cleansers.  I then splash my face to wash it off and pat dry with a towel.  While my skin is still damp I apply the Revale Intense Recovery Treatment antioxidant serum.  One pump of that covers my entire face and jaw.  I let the serum dry for about 5 minutes before applying sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;When not recovering from the laser, this can be used with your Clarisonic to get a deeper clean.</li>
    <li> i can no longer return item or ask seller the question that i know of but on the directions of this bottle is says that it will foam up, mine does not foam.  does anyone one else have this problem?  there is not an expirations date on the bottle so just wondering. i am giving this product a 4 star because it makes my skin very soft and i do use the day cream along with it.  i love their products.  i see others have the same question i have about it foaming up so i&#x27;d really like to know what it is supposed to do.  i squirt at least 10 squirts on a dry face.  just feels real soft as i clean.  no soapy look at all.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I have sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance and propylene glycol. This works for me and most eye makeup comes off easily too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Revale skin cleanser for six months now and my skin has never looked better. My sensitive skin looks and feels clear and balanced.  I highly recommend the Revale skin care system.</li>
    <li> Excellent product would recommend all for Revalskin products. Does wonders for the skin.  My Dermatologist recommended this line for skin healing and protection.</li>
    <li> I love the revaleskin night cream.  It lightens the age spots on my face and neck and is very moisturizing.  The cleanser really was sad.  I love a face cleanser that is sudsy; this one advertised that it was and it totally was not!  After 2 days of using it I had a few breakouts.  I won&#x27;t use again and am looking for a new cleanser.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> After using other Revaleskin products that were excellent, I find this product disappointing.  It does not lather, and I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin type. I hear that its being discontinued -- too bad, because I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I had plastic surgery (not elected) and my skin was very sensitive afterwards.  It has been 5 months since my procedure and I am hooked!!!!  I also am using the Revale Intense Recovery cream on my face and it is also outstanding.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It makes my face feel clean without feeling dry.  You only need about 10-12 pumps to wash your face. One thing to note - it does not foam up like soap.  So, if you like the foam to feel like your face is getting clean, this cleanser is not for you.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist highly recommends this line because it has the best anti-oxidant absorption; this line is most effective antioxidant of many products tested. I&#x27;ve been using the night cream, eye cream and cleanser for 5 years; just recently trying the Tightening serun to see if that works. My skin looks better than my younger sister; tight skin, small pores, not many age spots (I use Cerave Day SPF 15). It also help with redness.  I am 45 and have oily skin (but I don&#x27;t break out). This product line does not make my skin more oily.  The cleanser is extremely gentle but cleans well.  The real bonus is that it easily removes waterproof mascara without stinging my eyes. I also use a prescription retin A and that is all I need to keep my skin looking great. No need for laser treatments, acid peels or micro-dermabrasion!</li>
    <li> What can you say?  Revale is the best.  Love it and a great gtreat price. Works great on the skin.</li>
    <li> My package came opened, and the skin care box was ripped as well. There was atleast 2 cleanings in the cap, it spilled during delivery.</li>
    <li> Smells old and does not have a coffee scent I expected.  Have hardly used it.</li>
    <li> love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very neutral on this product. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on a coworker&#x27;s experience with it.  I was not disappointed at all.  I only purchased the cleanser (the moisturizers are too expensive for me at this time).  I&#x27;m 49 and my skin has issues with adult acne and rosacea.  Within a week I had noticeable imiprovements.  My face was clearer, the pores had shrunk and the texture seemed much more even.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I have the whole line of Revaleskin products.  This cleanser does not suds up, but it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  I follow up with the day cream or night cream.  I first bought this at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and was delighted that I found it on amazon at a more affordable price.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for the past year and loves it. It does not dry her skin and makes it soft. She absolutely loves this product</li>
    <li> Seller shipped right away and price was great. I love this cleanser, tried it for the first time when an esthetician recommended this cleanser after a facial been hooked since. Once my face is cleansed it feels soft and smooth. I also notice less redness in my cheeks while using this product.</li>
