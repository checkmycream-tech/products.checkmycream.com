      <li>So err on the side of caution because this thing REALLY works!</li>
      <li>works like a champ, just make sure to go easy, just remove a little at a time, don&#x27;t try to remove it all in one session.</li>

      <li>also laughed because there is no more pain or discomfort.</li>
      <li>I am following up with a good lotion for dry feet.  </li>
      <li>Works amazingly at removing all the dead skin from my feet.</li>
      <li>Left my foot feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>I was conservative with how much I used it</li>

      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks,  MICROPLANE</li>
      <li>Only took 2 days to receive &amp; was free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>My feet feel much better, but still have a ways to go since I did not want to take off too much skin at once as other reviews have suggested.  </li>
      <li>It gets all the dead skin off and leave your feet looking summer ready.  :-)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m going to purchase a few more for family members.  </li>
      <li>My left foot is done and my right foot isn&#x27;t in the photo</li>
      <li>my feet feels brand new</li>
      <li>Took off dry skin quickly without any attempt on new skin.</li>
      <li>Especially if your foot is really callused!</li>
      <li>I used it last night for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Go easy and take a little off at a time.</li>
      <li>It actually works very well.</li>
      <li>I have baby soft feet again..</li>
      <li>and I was being careful because it was my first time.</li>
      <li>I live in the Southern California desert, and I go barefoot or wear flip-flops almost every day.  </li>
      <li>My only wish is  that I would like it very much if they would make a smaller rounded one to get into smaller areas  around the toes.  </li>
      <li>Make my feet summer ready in no time, especially after wearing boots for a year long deployment.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve had  a large, thick callous developing on the ball of my right foot over the last few years.</li>
<li> The dry skin shredded off instantly.  </li>
<li> As other reviewers said, you could go &amp;#34;too far&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a little sensitive now.</li>
<li> But be careful, don&#x27;t go to deep, or feet will be sore!</li>
<li> Just go slowly and don&#x27;t shave off too much in one session.</li>
<li> I used it on my DRY feet per instructions.  </li>
<li> heavy duty grating of my thick callouses on my heels and balls of my feet.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt in a few strokes.  </li>
<li> thing was less expensive, and mowed the large callous on the ball of my right foot down in a few minutes...</li>
<li> I did get a little over zealous with my stubborn big toe</li>
<li> your feet don&#x27;t need to be wet</li>
<li> I did purchase the pink one</li>
<li> Be careful, don&#x27;t get too aggressive with the microplane foot file or you will end up with sore feet.</li>
<li> Just be careful not to overdue it..</li>
<li> I had to do it again a few weeks later, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
<li> , b/c the other one was in my duffle bag</li>
<li> Unlike other products like it, there is nothing to catch the waste.</li>
<li> After reading reviews I just do a little filing at a time though</li>
<li> I recommend using it either over a waste basket or over the tub.</li>
<li> Waste of time and money, and also a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This rasp works well at removing the dead skin from my feet.  </li>
<li> Start slow, though, this thing is SHARP.  </li>
<li> If the handle was stiff it would be five stars.</li>
<li> Kinda difficult to get in the tight spots with this big thing though.</li>
<li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have raw feet.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unbelievably efficient.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t go hard or your feet will be raw..</li>
<li> if you try to remove a thick callus in one session you will end up sore.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Cheese grater design. It actually works very well. Better than I expected. Took off dry skin quickly without any attempt on new skin. Handle flexes a bit and could be stiffer. It does have an arch on its paddle making it easy to work the curves of a foot heel. If the handle was stiff it would be five stars. Still a good purchase and worth getting.</li>
    <li> This rasp works well at removing the dead skin from my feet.  Easy to use and great results.</li>
    <li> The salon where I get a pedicure no longer uses files. This worked just as well. After reading reviews I just do a little filing at a time though so I will not get sore heels.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!!! Works amazingly at removing all the dead skin from my feet. Leaving them smooth in no time! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> OMG work great i never tought that one a day i would use a foot rasp whitout water&lt;br /&gt;it great their no effort needed  work just like a drop a water sliding on a window&lt;br /&gt;just be carful to not overdo the rasping</li>
    <li> Great value and serves it&#x27;s purpose of removing calluses.</li>
    <li> Works great! It gets all the dead skin off and leave your feet looking summer ready.  :-)</li>
    <li> wow, this thing is amazing !!! I no longer need to  soak my feat and use the scraper with the razor blade. I have cut myself  too many times with that. This wonderful product  is something you can use anytime, like when you are watching tv. I have always had terrible calluses especially on my heels, and ball of the foot and  big toes. This takes care of them. My only wish is  that I would like it very much if they would make a smaller rounded one to get into smaller areas  around the toes.  I give this product an A+++++++++++++++++++  I will never be with out this, ever.</li>

    <li> Awesome!!! Especially if your foot is really callused! Perfect for my feet!! But be careful, don&#x27;t go to deep, or feet will be sore!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  I live in the Southern California desert, and I go barefoot or wear flip-flops almost every day.  I didn&#x27;t think anything would work on my calluses, but this really, really does!  Start slow, though, this thing is SHARP.  It blows away traditional &amp;#34;pumice&amp;#34; type products.  I am following up with a good lotion for dry feet.  Simply put, this thing WORKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this rugged rasp but my girl friend has taken it over.</li>
    <li> omg this think is amazing. my feet feels brand new</li>
    <li> I work on my feet all day, and I like to run, bike, lift weights, etc. I&#x27;ve had  a large, thick callous developing on the ball of my right foot over the last few years. Has been increasingly annoying all the time, but had recently become painful. So I decided to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried Dr. Scholl&#x27;s salicylic acid discs. Waste of time and money, and also a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing was less expensive, and mowed the large callous on the ball of my right foot down in a few minutes...and I was being careful because it was my first time. I laughed because there were skin flakes everywhere, like sawdust. Kinda difficult to get in the tight spots with this big thing though. I may look for a smaller/skinnier one which may be easier to get closer to my big toe joint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also laughed because there is no more pain or discomfort. I had to do it again a few weeks later, which I don&#x27;t mind. Not much trouble at all for excellent results. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Good product, much better than the razor</li>
    <li> Best thing I order all Year this things has my feet looking a million times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im def Happy</li>
    <li> this is my new best friend my feet are so dry rough I just got it read reviews and your feet don&#x27;t need to be wet I just rub my feet and wow felt smooth put some Vaseline on them I must say im ordering another one well worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all..... pumice stones, pedi-egg, blade callous removers,  nothing I used would  work for me.&lt;br /&gt;This is the ultimate foot file for dudes..... I did purchase the pink one so it was easy for me to find .  I used it on my DRY feet per instructions.  whew ,this file makes short work of callous removal.....  heavy duty grating of my thick callouses on my heels and balls of my feet.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt in a few strokes.  I used a regular white pumice stone to blend on the sides of my feet........Be careful, don&#x27;t get too aggressive with the microplane foot file or you will end up with sore feet. This is the best I&#x27;ve found  and I&#x27;m going to purchase a few more for family members.  Thanks,  MICROPLANE</li>
    <li> works like a champ, just make sure to go easy, just remove a little at a time, don&#x27;t try to remove it all in one session. if you try to remove a thick callus in one session you will end up sore.</li>
    <li> Great product - very pleased!</li>
    <li> Take the reviews about the file as fact. It&#x27;s unbelievably efficient. BE CAREEFUL NOT TO GET CRAZY WITH IT! Go easy and take a little off at a time. It took more than one day for the skin to build up so don&#x27;t try to remove it all in one day.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Make my feet summer ready in no time, especially after wearing boots for a year long deployment.  So great...I actually bought&lt;br /&gt;another one, b/c the other one was in my duffle bag and I flew home for leave without unpacking!</li>
    <li> This is easy to use. I recommend using it either over a waste basket or over the tub. Unlike other products like it, there is nothing to catch the waste.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to try this!  Only took 2 days to receive &amp; was free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful.  I used it last night for the first time.  Started with my heels and sides of my toes where I have always had thick callouses.  The dry skin shredded off instantly.  My feet feel much better, but still have a ways to go since I did not want to take off too much skin at once as other reviews have suggested.  Cannot wait to tend to my feet again tonight with this awesome Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp!  I am obsessed!</li>
    <li> Love this thing can&#x27;t stop feet look sooooooooo young</li>
    <li> I have baby soft feet again.. Just be careful not to overdue it.. Get a feel for it first .. Don&#x27;t go hard or your feet will be raw..</li>
    <li> It does what I needed it to do.  Works better than a pumice stone. Left my foot feeling smooth.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Does a great job fast and easy.</li>
    <li> It works well for maintaining nice feet between pedicures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried soaks and pumice stones, but they never really give me great soft feet. I used this once and already have gotten rid of the callouses I&#x27;ve had for years. I added a before/after photo. My left foot is done and my right foot isn&#x27;t in the photo so you can see the difference. My feet feel great!  My husband instantly asked to use it too!  As other reviewers said, you could go &amp;#34;too far&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re not careful. I was conservative with how much I used it so I wouldn&#x27;t have raw feet. I did get a little over zealous with my stubborn big toe and it&#x27;s a little sensitive now. I expect that&#x27;ll go away in a day or two. So err on the side of caution because this thing REALLY works!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm with my pumice stone.</li>
