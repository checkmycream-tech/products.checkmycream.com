### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Morning breath has improved, which is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>this may be a very good idea.</li>
      <li>The taste is good and I am all for keeping the Dentist at bay!</li>
      <li>They have a very nice minty flavor</li>
      <li>/&gt;The taste of those lozenges is pleasant.</li>
      <li>like that, unlike a liquid, the &#x27;good stuff &#x27; stays in your mouth for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They state in the included literature that 8 tablets are a 1-month supply, and that you should repeat the treatment every month in order to maintain the good bacteria colonies in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>End results seem good.</li>
      <li>And should we avoid mouthwash while using this product, to avoid killing the good microbes?</li>
      <li>They taste good.  </li>
      <li>They have a rather nice, pleasant taste.</li>
      <li>All in all though, to freshen breath more than just by temporarily eating a mint, this is good stuff.</li>
      <li>As for results, I think I would honestly have to use them for a longer period to write about long-term results.</li>
      <li>The tablets taste nice.  </li>
      <li>So here&#x27;s what I can tell you: The flavor of the lozenges is nice, and they dissolve in about five minutes.</li>
      <li>These are very strong and feel like they burn my tongue.</li>
      <li>TheraBreath used to make a probiotic gum which I liked much better.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered more and will update my review when I see (or don&#x27;t see) long-term results from monthly use of this 7-consecutive-days product.</li>
      <li>do have to say, though, that I enjoyed the &amp;#34;Guide to Probiotic Treatment&amp;#34; booklet that came with the lozenges.</li>
      <li>and I actually enjoyed using them.</li>
      <li>The pack also comes with a booklet with interesting details about the what, why and how of the probiotics for oral health.</li>
      <li>the slower the better.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic</li>
      <li>I chew one of these pleasant-tasting lozenges each day and it helps me have better breath.</li>
      <li>will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any great changes in terms of breath or saliva and the probiotics wouldn&#x27;t be expected to make any great observable change.</li>
      <li>Bringing in beneficial microbes for a sustained and healthy balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My breath smells noticeably better.</li>
      <li>This product contains probiotics to enhance the healthy bacteria in the mouth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still not 100% sure</li>
      <li>I liked how fresh my mouth felt after sucking on one.</li>
      <li>That would be pretty amazing if it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have noticed a huge difference since I have used the tablets.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sugar free, which I like, because I took these at night before bed and didn&#x27;t want to have a bunch of sugar in my mouth over night.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>, you can diminish one of these side effects by replenishing your mouths friendly probiotics, and this product from Therabreath is the best&lt;br</li>
      <li>One week after taking all 8 tablets, I&#x27;ve not noticed any significant change to my gums.</li>
      <li>First of all, I love the idea.</li>
      <li>It might prevent or throats or gum conditions, but my mouth is pretty healthy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s interesting that it doesn&#x27;t contain xylitol (which is also known to have positive oral health properties).</li>
      <li>For full disclosure I have begun using [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I take probiotics daily with my multivitamin, so I do believe that probiotics can do a body good</li>
      <li>My son liked the coating on the gum and chewed it for a long time before bed (which is what you are supposed to do to keep the healthy bacteria in your mouth).  </li>
      <li>Pretty sure I am not taking this right.</li>
      <li>These do foam nicely and give your mouth a clean feeling, but in actually they damage your mouth lining and friendly</li>
      <li>I experienced much fresher breath, especially in the morning, and the results lasted for well over a month.  </li>
      <li>My oral hygiene is pretty good, I do not suffer from any undue bacterial plague so can only assume that my breath, teeth, gums and gut are happier and healthier than they were a month ago.  </li>
      <li>Worth trying for those intrigued by the concept.</li>
      <li>So, my rating is for the consistency and taste, which was far better than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>Worth a try.</li>
      <li>and my mouth just didn&#x27;t taste quite right after three days of living on cough syrup.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe it works better for those already with healthy gums, and maybe it would work for me after several months of 8-tablet treatments, but I&#x27;ll stick with my frequent dentist visits and home routine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was surprised and pleased that this seemed to really help me with tooth sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very promising indeed.</li>
      <li>TheraBreath Oral Probiotic says it works by planting little colonies of good bacteria in your mouth.</li>
      <li>then I was willing to take them after tasting the first melting, not chewable,</li>
      <li>, after the first 8-day treatment, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Therabreath Probiotics are taken very differently than most probiotics.  </li>
      <li>I did notice his breath was better especially in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE these and will be purchasing regularly.  </li>
      <li>After reading through the pamphlet, I realized that I had probably thrown away the first dose by doing that.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like this product though long use of this would be more beneficial and it&#x27;s about 9 dollars for a weekly supply.</li>
      <li>The tablets come in an easy to use blister pack, have a chalky texture, a mint-like flavor and are palatable enough.  </li>
      <li>noticed my gums looked more pink instead of red, breath was better through out the whole day instead of just after brushing my teeth, I even noticed my throat wasn&#x27;t as scratchy or irritated as it normally was.</li>
      <li>He went to the dentist last month and everything was fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Each lozenge is all natural, sugar free and has a mild, malty pepperminty flavor reminiscent of an antacid tablet.</li>
      <li>There is a nice sized booklet inside this box that has a lot of information regarding these little lozenges.</li>
      <li>You consume 1 lozenge per day until the box is exhausted and by the end of the course you should have improved breath and a healthier system through the inclusion of probiotic bacteria (specifically M18 and K12 that the booklet explains in great detail) in your mouth, throat and stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t taste much citrus.</li>
      <li>It would probably take about a two month period to really see how the product is doing.  </li>
      <li>Probiotics can be very helpful in our oral hygiene regime.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t feel like i needed my cough drops as much.</li>
      <li>And what is the big deal about them being sugar free when, in fact, they have both sucralose and dextrose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Specifically, they claim that it targets the harmful bacteria responsible for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In theory, I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Both are unusual for me, but perhaps it&#x27;s just coincidence.</li>
      <li>The package contains a detailed booklet that outlines the risk/benefit analysis of this product which has me living in eager anticipation of seeing the dentist next week.  </li>
      <li>I also felt more confident with my breath; I usually carry gum with me, chew some in the morning before school begins (and yes, I floss and brush regularly) and then sneak in a piece here and there throughout the day since I work closely with students and don&#x27;t want to be a &amp;#34;stinky-breath&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>All the other information I found was &amp;#34;infomercial&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;One site warned against giving oral probiotics to immune compromised individuals and recommended xylitol as an appropriate alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>thing I would suggest to the manufacturer, though, is to make sure that the directions are clear on the box and that they match what is on the long, scientific pamphlet on the inside.  </li>
      <li>just a little bit off, a week or so of these from the 8 day box is good for getting back to normal.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for people who don&#x27;t like to chew gum.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell if this product is actually effective.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t bad, it just isn&#x27;t delicious</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say it did anything for his mouth as far as cavity protection.  </li>
      <li>The only negatives I have found were a dry, cottonmouth at night, (more so than I am used to), and the rather high cost.</li>
      <li>The instructions aren&#x27;t very clear.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant lozenge that dissolves in your mouth and populates it with (putative) beneficial bacteria.  </li>
      <li>I would be interested to see if my dentist noticed a difference in the health of my mouth, but I&#x27;m still five months away from my next checkup, and I don&#x27;t want to spend the money to repeat this probiotics course each month until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was a first for me because I had read about &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; tastes and such.</li>
      <li>The company makes some pretty big claims about this product.</li>
      <li>You only get about a week&#x27;s worth in the package (which makes the packaging overkill in general).  </li>
      <li>that strain K12 is well suited for use as an oral cavity and upper respiratory tract probiotic due to its natural propensity to inhabit the human oral cavity and be strongly competitive with a number of potential oral pathogens that have adapted to the same ecological niche.</li>
      <li>You take one lozenge daily until you finish the whole pack of 8 lozenges, and then repeat the treatment monthly.</li>
      <li>The effects are to last a whole month.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re supposed to let it completely dissolve in your mouth for maximum probiotic culture population retaining in your mouth.</li>
      <li>Natural Chamomile Flavor, 16 ounce]]</li>
      <li>There are 8 lozenges included in a foil wrap, and you are directed to take one a day, not too near meals, nor just before you brush your teeth.  </li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s how this works -- the box contains 8 lozenges and 1 small but very detailed booklet that elaborates on how the product works and the nature of pro-biotics and related supplements.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You only get about a week&#x27;s worth in the package (which makes the packaging overkill in general).  The only thing I got was a sore throat (which may or may not be related to these probiotics... could just have been a bug that happened to go through while I was testing these out.)  My tongue was still filmy, no noticeable change in gums, or plaque.  I take probiotics daily with my multivitamin, so I do believe that probiotics can do a body good, I&#x27;m just not sold on the claims of this set.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have just used the oral tablets, even though it recommends you use all their products. I have noticed a huge difference since I have used the tablets. I used two a week. I noticed my breath was not as harsh in the mornings, I also noticed that during the day I wouldn&#x27;t have that off odor coming back like a bad habit. I highly recommend for people who don&#x27;t like to chew gum. Which I don&#x27;t. I do carry cough drops, because my throat seemed to be irritated all the time. I am not a big mint person either. Every once in a while I will have a mint, but I prefer to floss my teeth and brush my teeth. I&#x27;m that person that has a spare toothbrush at work and carries floss with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my gums looked more pink instead of red, breath was better through out the whole day instead of just after brushing my teeth, I even noticed my throat wasn&#x27;t as scratchy or irritated as it normally was. Didn&#x27;t feel like i needed my cough drops as much. Overall, I am quite intrigued by this product and would definitely buy them. I&#x27;d even say a must have for people with bad breath or horrible breath. Even people who seem to be a magnet for cavities.</li>
    <li> These come with a specific set of instructions to help you replace the &#x27;bad&#x27; bacteria in your mouth and throat with &#x27;good&#x27; bacteria.  Considering that you are turning your mouth into a petri dish, these actually have a lasting impact, (instructions recommend repeating treatment monthly).  There are 8 lozenges included in a foil wrap, and you are directed to take one a day, not too near meals, nor just before you brush your teeth.  They have a chalky consistency,  (you are supposed to chew them), but do not have an unpleasant taste.  Simple enough, but I was surprised how well they work and how long they lasted.  I experienced much fresher breath, especially in the morning, and the results lasted for well over a month.  The only negatives I have found were a dry, cottonmouth at night, (more so than I am used to), and the rather high cost.</li>
    <li> Therabreath Probiotics are taken very differently than most probiotics.  They are chewable citrus flavored lozenges that are chewed in the mouth for eight days.  The effects are to last a whole month.  My husband has bad breath at times so he chewed them and said they tasted fine.  I did notice his breath was better especially in the mornings.  I can&#x27;t really say it did anything for his mouth as far as cavity protection.  He went to the dentist last month and everything was fine.  It would probably take about a two month period to really see how the product is doing.  So far, though, my husband likes it and this is an affordable treatment to help with bad breath and oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure I am not taking this right. Not getting the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are pretty bad shape, so maybe they would have helped more had I taken them 10 years ago?</li>
    <li> Probiotics can be very helpful in our oral hygiene regime.  Most people use toothpaste with useless foaming agents, usually Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), and Ammonium Laurel Sulfate (ALS). These do foam nicely and give your mouth a clean feeling, but in actually they damage your mouth lining and friendly biome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A article in PubMed- &amp;#34;Should toothpastes foam? Sodium lauryl sulfate--a toothpaste detergent in focus&amp;#34; concluded &amp;#34;In conclusion, sodium lauryl sulfate has some side effects, and future work should therefore be concentrated on finding other possible toothpaste detergents without these side effects.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you can diminish one of these side effects by replenishing your mouths friendly probiotics, and this product from Therabreath is the best&lt;br /&gt; yet.  Simply chew and dissolve one tablet a month, and you&#x27;ll have a healthier mouth, with fresher breath and likely less cavities and gum issues too.</li>
    <li> In theory, I really like this product. It&#x27;s supposed to help prevent bad breath, throat problems, plaque, cavities, and gum problems. After one 8-day course, it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s working. So here&#x27;s what I can tell you: The flavor of the lozenges is nice, and they dissolve in about five minutes. I liked how fresh my mouth felt after sucking on one. I did notice that I woke up with an unusual taste in my mouth on the mornings after using this product, and I had dry mouth at night. Both are unusual for me, but perhaps it&#x27;s just coincidence. I would be interested to see if my dentist noticed a difference in the health of my mouth, but I&#x27;m still five months away from my next checkup, and I don&#x27;t want to spend the money to repeat this probiotics course each month until then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, though, that I enjoyed the &amp;#34;Guide to Probiotic Treatment&amp;#34; booklet that came with the lozenges. There&#x27;s a lot of useful information in it, and it also includes deep discount offers on some of TheraBreath&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of probiotics. I&#x27;ve been using a 10-strain probiotic capsule for the past year and a half. I used to get at least two or three sinus infections a year; I&#x27;ve gotten exactly zero since I began using the probiotic. So I&#x27;m definitely a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s hard to tell whether TheraBreath Oral Probiotics are working or not. The company makes some pretty big claims about this product. Specifically, they claim that it targets the harmful bacteria responsible for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dental Cavities&lt;br /&gt;Ear Aches&lt;br /&gt;Throat Discomfort&lt;br /&gt;Bad Breath&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;and more&amp;#34; (whatever that means)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insert that comes with the tablets says if you use the product for 7 days you will notice a reduction in the following symptoms:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yellow coating on the tongue&lt;br /&gt;Morning breath&lt;br /&gt;Bad breath during the daytime&lt;br /&gt;Throat discomfort&lt;br /&gt;Ear aches&lt;br /&gt;Tooth and gum problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so all I have to do is suck on a lozenge once a day for 7 days and those awful maladies all go away, or at least be significantly reduced? That would be pretty amazing if it&#x27;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 days (there are 8 tablets in the package). They state in the included literature that 8 tablets are a 1-month supply, and that you should repeat the treatment every month in order to maintain the good bacteria colonies in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after the first 8-day treatment, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums aren&#x27;t bleeding when I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning breath? Still there. Daytime bad breath? No different than it was before. Sore throat and ear aches? No change, but I didn&#x27;t have those before I started. Tooth and gum problems? &amp;#34;Problems&amp;#34; is an awfully broad term. It&#x27;s impossible for me to know whether or not this is actually improving my teeth and gums, although the reduction in bleeding is certainly a good thing (assuming it&#x27;s actually attributable to this product and not just a coincidence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy another box in a month, as directed, and I&#x27;ll update this review if I notice any further improvements.le to this product and not just a coincidence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy another box in a month, as directed, and I&#x27;ll update this review if I notice any further improvements.</li>
    <li> I had never tried oral probiotics before. This was a first for me because I had read about &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; tastes and such. That&#x27;s not the case at all with these TheraBreath lozenges. They have a very nice minty flavor and I actually enjoyed using them. As for results, I think I would honestly have to use them for a longer period to write about long-term results. So, my rating is for the consistency and taste, which was far better than I was expecting. I have ordered more and will update my review when I see (or don&#x27;t see) long-term results from monthly use of this 7-consecutive-days product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised and pleased that this seemed to really help me with tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to take, just pop one in your mouth and let it slowly dissolve.  It&#x27;s sugar free, which I like, because I took these at night before bed and didn&#x27;t want to have a bunch of sugar in my mouth over night.  The package says to chew it, the insert says to let it slowly dissolve.  I wanted to let it last as long as possible and stay in my mouth working it&#x27;s magic, so I didn&#x27;t chew it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s helpful for several mouth and throat issues - plaque and cavities, bad breath, acid erosion, tarter, gum problems.  I can&#x27;t say it helped me with any of those.  Maybe?  I know it did help my teeth be less sensitive, so if it&#x27;s doing anything else, that&#x27;s a bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 8 lozenges in the package.  The package recommends to repeat the 8 lozenges once a month.  I have my next package on it&#x27;s way!</li>
    <li> I think it would take several months to see any change from this item and I just didn&#x27;t see any benefit from it with just the one package. I didn&#x27;t notice any great changes in terms of breath or saliva and the probiotics wouldn&#x27;t be expected to make any great observable change. It might prevent or throats or gum conditions, but my mouth is pretty healthy so there&#x27;s not much it can do for me. If I had any kind of problem that might be helped by probiotics, such as bad breath or any irregularity in my gums, I&#x27;d certainly try this again.</li>
    <li> A lot of things on the packaging of these seem to be misleading, starting with chewable and ending with ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These need to be taken for 8 days. That was 7 days longer then I was willing to take them after tasting the first melting, not chewable, lozenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on the need for probiotics but do not understand the benefits of these. A lot of my probiotics are chewable, yummy sugary gummy bears, so wouldn’t that leave probiotics in my mouth? And what is the big deal about them being sugar free when, in fact, they have both sucralose and dextrose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly they left me with questions, not answers.</li>
    <li> One week after taking all 8 tablets, I&#x27;ve not noticed any significant change to my gums. I know I have some periodontal issues and have been on an aggressive plan with the dentist, and I was hoping these might help, but there has been no noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works better for those already with healthy gums, and maybe it would work for me after several months of 8-tablet treatments, but I&#x27;ll stick with my frequent dentist visits and home routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my current experience, I cannot recommend these, but as always, &amp;#34;your mileage may vary.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of TheraBreath products for a long time. First from ordering direct, and a few years later at my local chain drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every product I have ever tried works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lozenges are near tasteless, so they are easy to chew.&lt;br /&gt;I like that, unlike a liquid, the &#x27;good stuff &#x27; stays in your mouth for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but so are trips to a periodontist.&lt;br /&gt;Even more expensive is a stroke or heart attack. Poor oral health can be a contributing factor.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> In the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using these, they&#x27;ve improved my breath and reduced plaque. I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect on anything more serious than that, as I don&#x27;t ordinarily suffer from the other afflictions for which they&#x27;re advertised.</li>
    <li> I have taken the whole course of the lozenges in the past 8 days and it appears to have a positive effect on my breath. My breath smells noticeably better. For full disclosure I have begun using [[ASIN:B00VN04SY0 TheraBreath Dentist Recommended Soothing Oral Rinse- Natural Chamomile Flavor, 16 ounce]] in addition to the lozenges about a week ago. Either the lozenges or a combination of these products have seemed to reduce my bad breath noticeably. Other than that, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different about my oral health. Though the instructions does say that it would require the monthly use of probiotic treatment for optimal oral health and ongoing maintenance.  The lozenges are roughly 1/2&amp;#34; in diameter and 1/4&amp;#34; thick. They have a rather nice, pleasant taste. You take one lozenge daily until you finish the whole pack of 8 lozenges, and then repeat the treatment monthly. You&#x27;re supposed to let it completely dissolve in your mouth for maximum probiotic culture population retaining in your mouth. The pack also comes with a booklet with interesting details about the what, why and how of the probiotics for oral health. The product seems to work, at least have a positive impact on my breath. Very promising indeed.</li>
    <li> I took these for a few weeks, several days apart.  The tablets taste nice.  I couldn&#x27;t tell much difference as far as oral health during this brief test, but after reading some of the medical articles about these particular strains, I&#x27;m going to try this every once in a while to get the potential benefits.  Yogurt typically contains a related strain, S. thermophilus, but that&#x27;s not exactly the same as what&#x27;s in these tablets.  For anyone curious about how these TheraBreath bacterial strains work, I recommend reading the article &amp;#34;Developing Oral Probiotics From Streptococcus salivarius&amp;#34; which I found on the Medscape website.  The research summarizes: &amp;#34;it appears that strain K12 is well suited for use as an oral cavity and upper respiratory tract probiotic due to its natural propensity to inhabit the human oral cavity and be strongly competitive with a number of potential oral pathogens that have adapted to the same ecological niche. In addition, the immune responses of cell lines to co-incubation with S. salivarius K12 indicate that it elicits no proinflammatory response but rather an anti-inflammatory response, as well as modulating genes associated with adhesion to the epithelial layer and homeostasis. By these strategies, S. salivarius K12 appears to be well-tolerated on the epithelial surface, while also actively protecting the host by BLIS-mediated inhibition of pathogen replication and stimulation of cytokine-mediated reduction of virus replication and pathogen-induced inflammation and apoptosis.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product contains probiotics to enhance the healthy bacteria in the mouth. Given that bad breath, gingivitis, and cavities are caused by an overabundance of bad bacteria, it&#x27;s an interesting way to handle the situation. Designed to be a once-a-month treatment (for 8 days), it&#x27;s easy to take, the pill dissolves quickly and it doesn&#x27;t taste too terrible. It&#x27;s somewhat similar to a quick-dissolving B-vitamin. It did seem to improve morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does contain sucralose as the sweetener. It&#x27;s interesting that it doesn&#x27;t contain xylitol (which is also known to have positive oral health properties).</li>
    <li> This product is formulated to colonize the mouth with beneficial bacteria to improve oral hygiene. One lozenge is to be taken per day for eight consecutive days. The treatment is to be repeated monthly. After the initial treatment there was a noticeable reduction of coating on the tongue and fresher breath upon awakening in the morning. There is a contradiction, though, between the instructions listed on the box from those in the pamphlet enclosed in the package. The directions on the box state to chew and swallow the tablet while the pamphlet instructs to allow the tablet to dissolve in your mouth. I chose to do the latter. I plan to continue to use the product as part of my oral hygiene routine.</li>
    <li> I had had a cold, my nose was clogged and my mouth just didn&#x27;t taste quite right after three days of living on cough syrup. The first day that I took this, I noticed that by the end of the day my mouth was a little drier. By the end of the week, my breath was closer to what it was pre-cold and a few places where my teeth had gotten sensitive were no longer bothering me. I wouldn&#x27;t call it miracle working, but it does sort of restore some balance to the bacterial ecosystem that is your mouth. Given the cost, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d make these a one-a-day thing by default, but if you&#x27;ve had a cold, or dental work or something else that has your teeth and mouth just a little bit off, a week or so of these from the 8 day box is good for getting back to normal.</li>
    <li> These are very strong and feel like they burn my tongue. But they do the job.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the 8 days that was recommended, along with Therabreath toothpaste.  On the second day that I began taking these (you let it dissolve in your mouth), I came down with a sore throat.  I&#x27;m a teacher and illness was going around in my classroom, so it was not a surprise.  What I found was that using it over the next days, the sore throat and other symptoms eased quickly and I wonder if inoculating my mouth and throat with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; bacteria might have been helpful.  I also felt more confident with my breath; I usually carry gum with me, chew some in the morning before school begins (and yes, I floss and brush regularly) and then sneak in a piece here and there throughout the day since I work closely with students and don&#x27;t want to be a &amp;#34;stinky-breath&amp;#34; teacher!  ButI found I wasn&#x27;t worrying about my breath during this course of probiotics.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would suggest to the manufacturer, though, is to make sure that the directions are clear on the box and that they match what is on the long, scientific pamphlet on the inside.  On the box the directions are to chew one tablet each day for 8 days.  In the pamphlet, you are instructed to let it dissolve slowly in your mouth - the slower the better.  I chomped up the first one, reading only the outside directions.  After reading through the pamphlet, I realized that I had probably thrown away the first dose by doing that.&lt;br /&gt;Because I struggle with inflamed gums at times, I will be buying another course of this to see if it can help me in the long run.</li>
    <li> I chew one of these pleasant-tasting lozenges each day and it helps me have better breath. The probiotics contained within are supposed to prevent cavities, gum disease, acid erosion, and a whole-host of other mouth nasties. What I can say is that my teeth do feel cleaner and my breath seems to be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a booklet that comes in the packaging that explains how the probiotics work and that you should repeat the treatment once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of packaging for this 8 small lozenges is rather ridiculous.</li>
    <li> TheraBreath Oral Probiotic says it works by planting little colonies of good bacteria in your mouth. There is a nice sized booklet inside this box that has a lot of information regarding these little lozenges. This product creates little colonies inside your mouth to protect your teeth from cavities and it eliminates invading colonies of bacteria. So, I picture little colonies of super bacteria fighting agents combating the bad germs that cause bad breath, gum disease and tooth decay. This also helps the probiotics in your gut. This box contains a daily lozenge that you let slowly dissolve in your mouth. The slower it dissolves the more it can colonize in your mouth to chase out the bad bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product though long use of this would be more beneficial and it&#x27;s about 9 dollars for a weekly supply. The little guide also states that Therabreath uses M18 and K12 which reduces cytokines that cause inflammation and gum disease. If you suffer from gum disease and or bad breath and other symptoms, the 9 dollars a week could prove to be a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of those lozenges is pleasant. I&#x27;d say this is a decent product that long term use should be beneficial though people have noted their bad breath was eliminated instantly while some mouthwashes only mask the problem, this seems to fix it. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> There is something to these lozenges!  The pack is a set of 8 of them and the instructions are to take one a day until gone.  Morning breath has improved, which is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t wake up feeling like my mouth is wearing socks.  These are definitely going into my cart to remind me about them in the future.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s how this works -- the box contains 8 lozenges and 1 small but very detailed booklet that elaborates on how the product works and the nature of pro-biotics and related supplements. You consume 1 lozenge per day until the box is exhausted and by the end of the course you should have improved breath and a healthier system through the inclusion of probiotic bacteria (specifically M18 and K12 that the booklet explains in great detail) in your mouth, throat and stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each lozenge is all natural, sugar free and has a mild, malty pepperminty flavor reminiscent of an antacid tablet. While the box lists the tablets as &#x27;chewable&#x27; the instruction booklet advises users to let is dissolve slowly in your mouth in order to maximize the distribution of the probiotic matter. Letting the tablet slowly dissolve in your mouth takes around 10-12 minutes. End results seem good. By the time you finish all 8 lozenges their is a slight but noticeable improvement in oral hygiene. Plaque buildup seems reduced and morning breath seems tampered down a notch or two. Worth trying for those intrigued by the concept.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these and will be purchasing regularly.  The taste is good and I am all for keeping the Dentist at bay!</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the idea. Oral care products generally all focus on just one thing - killing whatever is living in your mouth. Now, there is a product that has a different focus: Bringing in beneficial microbes for a sustained and healthy balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give 4 stars out of 5, for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s hard to tell if this product is actually effective. I competed a full 8 day cycle, waited a few weeks, then bought another 8 day cycle and completed it as well. I&#x27;m still not 100% sure if anything is different.&lt;br /&gt;2) The instructions aren&#x27;t very clear. It says to chew them up, but then it also says to keep them in your mouth as long as possible, which means don&#x27;t chew them up. So which one is it? And should we avoid mouthwash while using this product, to avoid killing the good microbes? I&#x27;m also using the TheraBreath mouthwash, and wondering if the two products are acting against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give this product another try in a few weeks and see if anything noticeable happens, if it does I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> Probiotics containing BLIS K12 Probiotics is the way to go.  It prevents strep throat for my son who used to get strep all the time.  TheraBreath used to make a probiotic gum which I liked much better.  My son liked the coating on the gum and chewed it for a long time before bed (which is what you are supposed to do to keep the healthy bacteria in your mouth).  I am not sure why they discontinued the gum.  These are lozenges.  They taste good.  I just miss the gum.</li>
    <li> This is a probiotic forumula meant to help with oral health, much how other probiotics help with digestive health. There are 8 tablets and the dosage is 1 per day. It is labelled citrus flavor but I don&#x27;t taste much citrus. It isn&#x27;t bad, it just isn&#x27;t delicious either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not doctor or dentist but what I can say is that, after a week of taking these, there is already a noticeable difference in my oral health. Better breath (not that it was bad before) is immediately noticeable. As for stronger enamel, I&#x27;ll have to report on that the next time I go to the dentist to see if they notice a difference. All in all though, to freshen breath more than just by temporarily eating a mint, this is good stuff.</li>
    <li> My oral hygiene is pretty good, I do not suffer from any undue bacterial plague so can only assume that my breath, teeth, gums and gut are happier and healthier than they were a month ago.  The tablets come in an easy to use blister pack, have a chalky texture, a mint-like flavor and are palatable enough.  The package contains a detailed booklet that outlines the risk/benefit analysis of this product which has me living in eager anticipation of seeing the dentist next week.  I would not discourage anyone from trying TheraBreath but on the basis of a single course, my ability to address long term results is limited.</li>
    <li> Not unpleasant lozenge that dissolves in your mouth and populates it with (putative) beneficial bacteria.  These strains are meant to crowd out pathogens and produce (putative) beneficial enzymes.  They possibly prevent cavities, ear infections, cure bad breath and gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;Putative was the word used (over and over) in the medscape review I read.  All the other information I found was &amp;#34;infomercial&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;One site warned against giving oral probiotics to immune compromised individuals and recommended xylitol as an appropriate alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think they could be dangerous, but not sure the evidence of efficicacy is there yet.  It is not possible to make that determination from anecdotal reports of 8 day trials, with no control group.&lt;br /&gt;I will be watching though - this may be a very good idea.</li>
</ol>
