<li> My previous 3 in 1 cleanser was a clear gel, and this one looks like a white cream and does not feel the same at all.</li>
<li> We have used Timewise for several years, but it seems like there are less granular beads that help to rejuvenate the skin.  </li>
<li> I use the Timewise bar cleanser for daily use and only use the tube of cleanser when I&#x27;m traveling (wet soap is hard to pack!)  </li>
