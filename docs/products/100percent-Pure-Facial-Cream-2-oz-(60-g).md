      <li>My mom love how it feels on her skin</li>
      <li>I cannot speak highly enough about this wonderful lotion!</li>
      <li>When I asked which product seemed the most effective, she said, it&#x27;s the cheapest product - toner (pure Witch Hazel).  </li>
      <li>So easy to travel with a tube</li>
      <li>Feels fantastic when applying.</li>
      <li>and I use several of there products with great results.</li>
      <li>I threw out all of my Aveeno products that were supposed to alleviate redness but were filled with chemicals</li>
      <li>I love pure 100% products.</li>
      <li>Love that it consists of pure organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I love 100% pure products, but didn&#x27;t even get the chance to try this cream.</li>
      <li>The smell reminds me of blueberry yogurt and it is mild and fades.</li>
      <li>Put toner on first (I use inexpensive Thayer&#x27;s Aloe Witch Hazel - alcohol free).  </li>
      <li>After reading a lot of reviews and comparing prices I decided to invest in the 100% pure line and it has made a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>Great product,great for using all year round.</li>
      <li>I think it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>This would be enough on it&#x27;s own if I used two pumps instead of one.</li>
      <li>I like that this is more natural than others I have</li>
      <li>I do not believe this brand is 100% natural, I believe this is a scandal like most beauty products in the markets</li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when I found 100% Pure Acai Berry lotion!  </li>
      <li>I love this line of natural products and recommend them all highly!</li>
      <li>, when I get out of the shower I spray with 100% Pure Organic Rose Hydrosol Tonique, then combine two drops of rose-hip seed oil with 100% Pure Organic Acai Berry Antioxidant Facial Cream and smear that all over my moist face, neck, and chest.</li>
      <li>I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>All of the products from this company are stellar.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will buy it again in the future.</li>
      <li>love this cream..... not as pricey as some of the other clean ingredient ones that are out on the market</li>
      <li>Finally a product from 100% Pure that I absolutely love.  </li>
      <li>I have Rosacea and recently I was having a lot of redness and burning/itching/tingling after having good luck with my skin for several years, so I switched up my skin routine.</li>
      <li>Not only does my skin feel like silk, it smells clean and fresh</li>
      <li>Blends quickly into my mature skin and is not greasy or oily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; and anything with any type of odor - there are no artificial fragrances in this cream.</li>
      <li>The tube arrived promptly and very well packaged, along with a couple of complementary product samples.</li>
      <li>The pump is neat and you can control how much you want to come out.</li>
      <li>This lotion smells heavenly and really moisturizes without clogging pores.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin really smooth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Every now and then, I come across a lotion that makes my skin extra silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>You will use half as much lotion for a greater effect.  </li>
      <li>A woman who worked for a skin line that&#x27;s been around since the 1950&#x27;s told me that she has seen a lot of older women who&#x27;ve used her skin line for decades.</li>
      <li>cream is light and has a very faint but pleasant berry scent.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gone completely to 100% Pure products and boy</li>
      <li>After much research, and experimentation with green/organic moisturizers, this one emerged as the clear winner.</li>
      <li>It is light and non-greasy and leaves my skin soft all day long.</li>
      <li>It is extremely difficult to find a good organic face moisturizer that is not expensive.</li>
      <li>This cream has Japanese Honeysuckle too, and it&#x27;s even higher than Vit C and Vit E in the ingredient list.</li>
      <li>The chemical composition of Japanese honeysuckle resembles very closely to that of synthetic paraben preservatives and their only difference is that Japanese honeysuckle contains a free radical that parabens don&#x27;t possess.</li>
      <li>I ordered this particular one because a previous reviewer said that it had a mild smell and that her husband didn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, but still moisturizing and I like the smell, but people with sensitive noses might find it a bit strong.</li>
      <li>I have aging dry skin and it moisturizes deeply and also actually penetrates skin, instead of sitting on top.</li>
      <li>Now I cleanse with 100% Pure Organic Lavender Seafoam Facial Cleanser</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I received an older product, but it seems to carry a light rancid smell.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it is all natural so does not cause break outs.</li>
      <li>and she can use it on her sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely purchase again as it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>I have terribly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews on how thick this product was, I was nervous, but I love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have Roseacea and can&#x27;t use just any lotion as they make my face break out.  Not this!  It is wonderful and I can&#x27;t live without it.  Just a tiny amount goes a long way and restores elasticity after I wash my face.  I love it.  I threw out all of my Aveeno products that were supposed to alleviate redness but were filled with chemicals and I&#x27;ve gone completely to 100% Pure products and boy, am I ever glad I did.</li>
    <li> This moisturizes well and it smells absolutely wonderful! I think it was worth the price. Happy I found the line.</li>
    <li> I was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance and since I&#x27;ve been off gluten I&#x27;ve felt great and my skin cleared up a lot. But I was still noticing itching, blemishes and dry sky despite my dermatologist recommended face products. Then I realized they had wheat in them!    After reading a lot of reviews and comparing prices I decided to invest in the 100% pure line and it has made a HUGE difference. Within days the irritation on my skin was gone and my blemished are almost non existent now. Even if you don&#x27;t have a gluten sensitivity, give this line a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! This lotion smells heavenly and really moisturizes without clogging pores. Fabulous!</li>
    <li> i thought it would have been a little better , after I put it on my skin feels dry and some places look dry smh unfortunately I will have to try something else3</li>
    <li> It is a miracle in this bottle !!! I am 33 and I have sensitive , dry skin . This product I have used for one year and my skin looks and feels great , it is a very good moisturizer. I love that is with healthy , organic ingredients . I would recommend !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many face creams.  Ones that promise.  Ones all organic.  And I feel this one rates closer to the top.  I&#x27;d definitely purchase again as it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  It&#x27;s a lighter coverage face cream.  Did not leave my face oily.  I felt it brightened my skin.  My only negative is the smell.  I&#x27;m not sure if I received an older product, but it seems to carry a light rancid smell.  I was hoping for a fresher scent.  So I&#x27;ve switched the use of this to my &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; tube.  Which is why I love the design.  So easy to travel with a tube and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the pump.  I loved this design, but now that I look, it appears they may have changed the design.</li>
    <li> All of the products from this company are stellar.  I have terribly sensitive skin and I use several of there products with great results.</li>
    <li> I love pure 100% products. After reading the reviews on how thick this product was, I was nervous, but I love it. It is thick, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too thick and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> love this cream..... not as pricey as some of the other clean ingredient ones that are out on the market</li>
    <li> This cream has Japanese Honeysuckle too, and it&#x27;s even higher than Vit C and Vit E in the ingredient list. The chemical composition of Japanese honeysuckle resembles very closely to that of synthetic paraben preservatives and their only difference is that Japanese honeysuckle contains a free radical that parabens don&#x27;t possess. As I mentioned in my review for its Hydrating Tonique, Parahydroxy benzoic acid has been shown to display estrogenic activity in the body, just like parabens do. So going by the strict standards of purists, Japanese honeysuckle is a no no for natural and organic skin care products. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Was looking for an organic replacement to the facial cream I&#x27;ve been using and unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t it. Not sure which ingredient caused the reaction but after about 3 weeks of use, my skin looked like that of a teenager. Suffice to say, I&#x27;m back on the market for a new organic facial cream. :(</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer. I have aging dry skin and it moisturizes deeply and also actually penetrates skin, instead of sitting on top. Plus, it is all natural so does not cause break outs. Truly a great product. Use every morning.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well and smells nice.</li>
    <li> Every now and then, I come across a lotion that makes my skin extra silky smooth.  Within a year or two, that lotion is usually discontinued.  Imagine my surprise when I found 100% Pure Acai Berry lotion!  Not only does my skin feel like silk, it smells clean and fresh (something my husband loves).  For women with husbands who dislike perfumes, this product is a must!  I cannot speak highly enough about this wonderful lotion! TIP: Put toner on first (I use inexpensive Thayer&#x27;s Aloe Witch Hazel - alcohol free).  While your skin is still wet with toner, apply this lotion.  You will use half as much lotion for a greater effect.  A woman who worked for a skin line that&#x27;s been around since the 1950&#x27;s told me that she has seen a lot of older women who&#x27;ve used her skin line for decades. When I asked which product seemed the most effective, she said, it&#x27;s the cheapest product - toner (pure Witch Hazel).  She said that the older women who had noticeably younger skin in their 60&#x27;s 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s were all women who religiously used toner before putting on lotion.  I can honestly say at age 44 (I&#x27;ve been using toner for 13 years now) my face looks more like 35 than 44!  Update: This review was for 100% Pure Acai Berry lotion ONLY - not the tomato lycopene (someone recently moved my review to that product, which I did not review).</li>
    <li> I love 100% pure products, but didn&#x27;t even get the chance to try this cream. I kept it in a dry cool place for a few weeks, while I was using a different facial product. When I went to use this cream, I saw that the tube was cracked along the seams. Not sure what happened and why it busted; protective film was still on the tube.This product should be in the different packaging. Will not re-order.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Feels so wonderful on the skin :) I love it and will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Definitely a let down compared to their coffee bean eye cream. This stuff is too greasy for my skin and it kind of balls up, making it difficult to put makeup over. I like this skin care line, however, this cream just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer. It is light and non-greasy and leaves my skin soft all day long. It has a nice light scent, too.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and recently I was having a lot of redness and burning/itching/tingling after having good luck with my skin for several years, so I switched up my skin routine. Now I cleanse with 100% Pure Organic Lavender Seafoam Facial Cleanser, when I get out of the shower I spray with 100% Pure Organic Rose Hydrosol Tonique, then combine two drops of rose-hip seed oil with 100% Pure Organic Acai Berry Antioxidant Facial Cream and smear that all over my moist face, neck, and chest. My skin has calmed right back down again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is light and has a very faint but pleasant berry scent. As soon as you apply the cream the scent is gone. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, but it moisturizes very well. I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and this alone isn&#x27;t quite enough for me, but with the two drops of rose-hip seed oil it&#x27;s perfect. This would be enough on it&#x27;s own if I used two pumps instead of one. It would just take a very long time to soak in.</li>
    <li> This had made my skin feel and look lovely! My eye area has become tighter along with the rest of my face. It has made my skin look great! I can&#x27;t wait to try all their other products.</li>
    <li> I like that this is more natural than others I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I used when I was pregnant and didn&#x27;t want parabens and other gross crap on my skin. Works just as well as any other that I&#x27;ve tried (smashbox, urban decay, arbonne)</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cream I met in about these 3 years. It makes my skin really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The container was usually a pump style, but the most recent one was in a tube (like a toothpaste style). I don&#x27;t like the pump style, because it always stops working with 1/4 left. So I was really glad when I get it in a tube. (The cream itself is totally same.) I hope they keep using a tube style container.</li>
    <li> It is extremely difficult to find a good organic face moisturizer that is not expensive. This face cream is great - organic ingredients and not expensive. It applies and soaks in very easily on my face.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; and anything with any type of odor - there are no artificial fragrances in this cream. I can smell a small amount of the ingredients when I apply the cream to my face, but the smell disappears in less than 10 seconds. Also, the cream moisturizers my face well.</li>
    <li> At 41, my skin needs a little more moisture than it did just a few years ago. After much research, and experimentation with green/organic moisturizers, this one emerged as the clear winner. I use it nightly and sometimes in the daytime, when the humidity in the weather is low. Feels fantastic when applying. My skin absorbs it instantly with no greasy feeling. Wonderful product. The tube arrived promptly and very well packaged, along with a couple of complementary product samples. I would not hesitate reordering from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product,great for using all year round. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking oily/shiny during the summer time. Got this product because my dermatologist said I needed to use an oil-free facial moisturizer. I read the other reviews and decided to try it, I have no regrets thus far. Even though it&#x27;s 1.6oz, it definitely lasts way longer than you would expect. Does not irritate around my eyes like products in the past have done. Scent is pleasant but faint and disappears in few minutes after application.</li>
    <li> Meh. This cream is just okay. No outstanding results or improvements.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my mom on her birthday. The moisturizer is inside the cute litte box which I don&#x27;t have to worry wrap around it. My mom love how it feels on her skin and it is perfect for her sensitive skin. Mostly other products contain harsh chemical which cause her skin irrititated easily. The fact this is also contain antioxidant substance for anti wrinkle as well and it perfectly used for women at her age</li>
    <li> This is not natural....It cannot be. It STINKS the scent of a product so far beyond natural it is annoying!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This made me instantly BREAK OUT within 1 use!!!! I do not believe this brand is 100% natural, I believe this is a scandal like most beauty products in the markets today.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry but I only use organic herbs and oils on my face. The only thing I use that isn&#x27;t 100% organic is Sheer transformation cream by Ole Henrikson. Which I LOVE, but&lt;br /&gt;it has 2 petro-chemical ingredients in it.... although it works great without creating any breakouts. I was hoping to update it with this lotion, hoping it would be ultimately organic.&lt;br /&gt;One whiff of this, you will know immediately it is not organic.</li>
    <li> Finally a product from 100% Pure that I absolutely love.  I&#x27;ve tried the green tea moisturizer before but didn&#x27;t like it, so I was apprehensive about trying the acai one- I&#x27;m glad I did because it&#x27;s amazing and it works for my skin perfectly.  Finally a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break me out and absorbs into my skin without any residue. Plus, the natural smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> A wonderful day moisturizer for my dryish, aging skin.  It&#x27;s heavy enough, without being too heavy for day wear.  I love this line of natural products and recommend them all highly!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, wonderful aromatic mixed berry smell - almost makes me want to taste it. Love that it consists of pure organic ingredients. Blends quickly into my mature skin and is not greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she likes it.  I like the fact its nature and she can use it on her sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the entire container of moisturizer. I apply it every morning under my makeup. I love this face cream!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Everything from this line is great. Continuous buyer. Light and smells great. makes my skin feel good</li>
    <li> I just wanted a basic moisturizer that I could use morning or night that had all natural ingredients and no sun screen.  This is the perfect cream. It&#x27;s not too heavy, but still moisturizing and I like the smell, but people with sensitive noses might find it a bit strong.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a natural facial moisturizer for a while. I ordered this particular one because a previous reviewer said that it had a mild smell and that her husband didn&#x27;t mind it. The smell reminds me of blueberry yogurt and it is mild and fades. It does not leave your skin oily feeling and gets rid of any tight feeling you might have after washing your face. I haven&#x27;t had much experience with facial moisturizers since in the past I&#x27;ve just used body and hand lotion on my face, which made my face too oily. I like this cream. The pump is neat and you can control how much you want to come out.</li>
