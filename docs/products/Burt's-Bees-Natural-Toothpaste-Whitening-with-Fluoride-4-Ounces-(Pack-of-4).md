      <li>It tastes very clean, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to get satisfying</li>
      <li>And the joke part is this: while so many companies brag how advanced their toothpaste is, they can&#x27;t beat this part of Burt&#x27;s Bees: you can drink orange juice 10 minutes after using this stuff.</li>

      <li>Your health is worth it!</li>
      <li>The Peppermint flavor is not overly strong, it foams nicely but not too much, and most importanly it left my teeth and mouth feeling very clean and refreshed.      </li>
      <li>It also makes my teeth feel clean and my mouth \\&quot;minty fresh.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I think that whatever abrasives are in it that made my teeth feel so clean</li>
      <li>This toothpaste works fine for me since most regular toothpaste contains Sodium Laurel Sulfate which I am allergic to.</li>
      <li>I have been using SLS-free toothpastes for years, and am happy there are multiple kinds available in stores if you look closely enough.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that the toothpaste is a ll natural as well.</li>
      <li>Right at the moment the product page says \\&quot;four available.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>only issue is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it to be able to speak and eat without pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now at first the price made me hesitant about buying it.</li>
      <li>I had received a free sample of this product and was pleasantly surprised.</li>

      <li>While on a mission to rid our lives of as many preservatives and excess chemicals as possible, I thought I&#x27;d try this toothpaste when eyeing it in a local big chain store recently.  </li>
      <li>So, I assumed this would be comparable to Squigle, biotene, or Natural Dentist.  </li>
      <li>Also, one of my teeth became sensitive to acid.  </li>
      <li>In an effort to reduce household chemicals I ordered a couple of boxes of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>The only down-side is that the price is more than regular store-brand toothpaste that I normally buy, but this is typical of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>

      <li>Who cares that it costs a small amount more than traditional brands?  </li>

<li> The only toothpaste I use due to hypothyroidism &amp; can&#x27;t use floride.</li>
<li> Though it&#x27;s a little bit on the expensive side (at least when compared to Crest or Colgate), it has a decent taste and my dentist seems pleased with the condition of my teeth.  </li>
<li> I was a little skeptical when I first used this -expecting something similar to Tom&#x27;s of Maine which I&#x27;m not overly fond of, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
<li> I did a little research and decided to switch to an SLS-free toothpaste, and I will never go back.</li>
<li> It is minty without being cloying and unlike other fluoride toothpaste it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a dry mouth.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find sizes larger than 4 ozs.</li>
<li> After doing so, 1/2 of the tube is flattened, i.e. empty.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpastes before and threw them out after one use.  </li>
<li> It has a slightly weird texture--it&#x27;s a little grainy and has the sort of stretchy consistency of very melted marshmallow.  </li>
<li> The tube is half inflated with air to make the 4 oz look twice its volume.</li>
<li> It is one of the few toothpastes that does not use sulfates which can encourage canker sores.</li>
<li> I also don&#x27;t like that the Burts Bees oozes out of the cap all the time.</li>
<li> I get horrible canker sores from sodium lauryl sulfate, which is in just about every single commercially available toothpaste.  </li>
<li> Since Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s gingermint was discontinued natural toothpaste has been a disappointment, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This toothpaste is SO condensed that it is hard to squeeze paste out onto the brushhead.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s quite thick, how I imagine it would look if I were the type to make this sort of stuff at home.</li>
<li> They were painful and gross, and they lasted at least a week each time.</li>
<li> I used to get awful canker sores at least once a month.</li>
<li> You&#x27;re crazy if you don&#x27;t start using this stuff!  </li>

    <li> In an effort to reduce household chemicals I ordered a couple of boxes of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Toothpaste.  Since Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s gingermint was discontinued natural toothpaste has been a disappointment, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some reviewers said the tubes are small and aren&#x27;t exactly packed with product.  But at the same time I love the density of the paste.  It&#x27;s quite thick, how I imagine it would look if I were the type to make this sort of stuff at home. It tastes very clean, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to get satisfying foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best, I noticed my teeth getting whiter - I hadn&#x27;t realized I had bought whitening formula.  A nice surprise!</li>
    <li> While on a mission to rid our lives of as many preservatives and excess chemicals as possible, I thought I&#x27;d try this toothpaste when eyeing it in a local big chain store recently.  I didn&#x27;t expect much b/c I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; toothpastes before and threw them out after one use.  Boy, was I surprised!  This toothpaste actually tastes, smells, and makes your mouth feel like the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; stuff you&#x27;re used to!  It&#x27;s amazing!  My mouth feels VERY clean and it foams easily and my teeth even look whiter!  BONUS!    You&#x27;re crazy if you don&#x27;t start using this stuff!  Who cares that it costs a small amount more than traditional brands?  Your health is worth it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on May 29th, and only today (July 6th)received an email that Amazon has cancelled the order because the product is unavailable. Right at the moment the product page says \\&quot;four available.\\&quot; The shopping process for this product or merchant leaves a lot to be desired.    It&#x27;s great toothpaste, though, if you can get it.</li>
    <li> And the joke part is this: while so many companies brag how advanced their toothpaste is, they can&#x27;t beat this part of Burt&#x27;s Bees: you can drink orange juice 10 minutes after using this stuff.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical when I first used this -expecting something similar to Tom&#x27;s of Maine which I&#x27;m not overly fond of, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The Peppermint flavor is not overly strong, it foams nicely but not too much, and most importanly it left my teeth and mouth feeling very clean and refreshed.      The only down-side is that the price is more than regular store-brand toothpaste that I normally buy, but this is typical of Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  While they do excel in quality their prices also reflect this which means I will not buy this toothpaste on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I had received a free sample of this product and was pleasantly surprised. I really like this toothpaste. It is minty without being cloying and unlike other fluoride toothpaste it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a dry mouth. It also makes my teeth feel clean and my mouth \\&quot;minty fresh.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been using SLS-free toothpastes for years, and am happy there are multiple kinds available in stores if you look closely enough.  So, I assumed this would be comparable to Squigle, biotene, or Natural Dentist.  When I used it the first time, I was impressed with how clean my teeth felt.  After a few weeks, though, I noticed my teeth looked more yellow, not less.  Also, one of my teeth became sensitive to acid.  I don&#x27;t know with certainty that this is the cause, but I suspect it is, because it is the only part of my routine that has changed.  I think that whatever abrasives are in it that made my teeth feel so clean the firt time I used it have actually stripped some of the enamel off of my teeth, resulting in the sensitivity and yellowing effect.  I&#x27;m now using Sensodyne pronamel to try to couteract the effect.    I also don&#x27;t like that the Burts Bees oozes out of the cap all the time.</li>
    <li> I used to get awful canker sores at least once a month. They were painful and gross, and they lasted at least a week each time. I did a little research and decided to switch to an SLS-free toothpaste, and I will never go back. I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and only had one canker sore that lasted two days. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t say this toothpaste makes my teeth any whiter (I drink a LOT of hot black tea and coffee so my teeth are not very beautiful right now), it does leave my mouth feeling clean. I also use this with an alcohol free, SLS-free mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it to be able to speak and eat without pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I had an issue with two of my tubes splitting open and leaking toothpaste all over the sink area. I sent a comment about it through the Burt&#x27;s Bees website and they immediately sent me two replacement tubes along with a free hand sanitizer. Burt&#x27;s Bees offers great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: The splitting of the tubes is definitely an issue. It happened to one of the new tubes, but not until I was almost done with it so there wasn&#x27;t a mess.</li>
    <li> I can brush my teeth now without inflammation from SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate). Many people do not know that their toothpaste, shampoo and skin care products are causing them discomfort at the very least.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It is natural, SLS free, and has Novamin (Calcium Sodium Phosphosilicate). This is far better than the regular toothpastes available at the typical grocery store. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find sizes larger than 4 ozs.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works fine for me since most regular toothpaste contains Sodium Laurel Sulfate which I am allergic to.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best toothpaste ever!!!! I struggled with Colgate &amp; crest leaving a film in my mouth.  My cousing told me about this toothpaste. Now at first the price made me hesitant about buying it. But just said what the hell and bought a tube at Walmart. Best decision ever. It doesn&#x27;t leave any film, cleans teeth beautifully, and leaves your breath fresh all day. I love the fact that the toothpaste is a ll natural as well. Great stuff. I prefer to use the Whitening Toothpaste with Flouride; I feel it works best then the Multipurpose Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> One of the best SLS free toothpastes.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I use due to hypothyroidism &amp; can&#x27;t use floride. I&#x27;ve tried several brands but Burt&#x27;s is THE BEST!</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of surfactant which sloughs off the inside of your mouth and teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t cause &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; to form that can be visually unsightly.  Thank you, Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I get horrible canker sores from sodium lauryl sulfate, which is in just about every single commercially available toothpaste.  One of the only toothpastes I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t include it is Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Though it&#x27;s a little bit on the expensive side (at least when compared to Crest or Colgate), it has a decent taste and my dentist seems pleased with the condition of my teeth.  It has a slightly weird texture--it&#x27;s a little grainy and has the sort of stretchy consistency of very melted marshmallow.  But it does the trick and I haven&#x27;t had a canker sore since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> a good product with less harmful and useless chemicals that are of no use to either the teeth or the body</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has fluoride but NO sodium lauryl sulfate(SLS), so it does NOT make the inside of my mouth burn and peel. The tube is half inflated with air to make the 4 oz look twice its volume. I had to use the gizmo that helps to flatten and smooth out toothpaste tubes to get the toothpaste out. After doing so, 1/2 of the tube is flattened, i.e. empty. I am talking about a brand new tube, never used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why put air in the tube to inflate it? Why not sell 8 oz in the same tube instead? Sure, the price would be adjusted but both manufacturer and customer will save in the end. Besides, it is a greener practice...This toothpaste is SO condensed that it is hard to squeeze paste out onto the brushhead. Certainly not for kids&#x27; hands or older people&#x27;s hands!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Toothpaste was recommended by my dentist and has done a wonderful job on my teeth and gums to keep them clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is very hard to get. It is one of the few toothpastes that does not use sulfates which can encourage canker sores.</li>
    <li> Excellent thick paste feels like it cleans my teeth much better than many more runny pastes. Has none of the sweeteners that have me thinking that sugar may be better.</li>
