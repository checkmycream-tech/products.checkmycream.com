### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are the best deal around.</li>
      <li>Just Perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to the new/old world of wet-shaving.</li>
      <li>Excellent price for this product.</li>
      <li>And from what I have seen &amp; researched there are), this is an excellent beginner Shave Brush to purchase.  </li>
      <li>Boar hair brushes are stiffer than badger hair and that&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
      <li>And, the Van Der Hagen is the best that I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
      <li>This brush is not the greatest.</li>
      <li>and am happy to use it until it wears out.</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>and it has softened up to where I am extremely happy with it.</li>
      <li>And boy did I LOVE it!!  </li>
      <li>Best cheap brush out there!</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor, instead of buying 3 of these for $20, buy a good one for $20 and you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
      <li>But now I know what I know, and ANY badger-hair brush is better than the best boar-hair brush.</li>
      <li>Good shaving brushes for the money</li>
      <li>And rub it in good, let the hair on your face have time to absorb it.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect brush to have on hand to quickly swipe over our equipment to help keep everything in top working order.</li>
      <li>This is an inexpensive brush that will get the job done, but please also consider spending a bit more for a superior Badger hair brush.</li>
      <li>I made my own hanger out of wood, with about 5 coats of paint to prevent water from damaging the wood.  </li>
      <li>I own this brush as well as the better-received [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>There are better brushes out there, but this one is quite good considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Makes my soap lather nicely and applies it.</li>
      <li>This budget shaving brush does the job quite well in working a nice soapy lather onto your face.</li>
      <li>Works great to get the dust and grit off quickly.</li>
      <li>months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that VDH customer service will replace them with a nice entry-level badger if you have the problem I had, but a boar is what I wanted (better for soaps as opposed to creams).</li>
      <li>HUGE PRICE INCEASE!</li>
      <li>It lathered the shave soap better.  </li>
      <li>It does what it was intended to do and MORE.</li>
      <li>I have used disposable razors and soap (hand lather) for many years.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, I love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, about how a badger hair brush is so much better than boar hair.  </li>
      <li>Shaving is so much better with a brush than with a can of foam.</li>
      <li>Want better?  </li>
      <li>This is a good brush and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I am very happy still with this product almost 3 years later.</li>
      <li>If nothing else, because of the stiffer bristles, it does provide a more invigorating feeling on the skin than a softer bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, some would make the argument that because Boar hair is a coarser hair, that it has an added benefit of providing better skin exfoliation while applying the lather.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with this purchase and when needed will get more of the same brush.</li>
      <li>Much better experience than lathering up with foamy shave creams, etc.  </li>
      <li>It will make a better lather than my boar brush, but it doesn&#x27;t make my shave any better.</li>
      <li>Better that is.  </li>
      <li>And who wants the hassle (though they are very nice about it, I must say).</li>
      <li>Once again, this is a pretty good item for the money.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it barely fits in the holder it was made for, which frustrates me as the most attractive part of the set</li>
      <li>Received these very quickly after ordering.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see paying the high prices at &amp;#34;shaving stores&amp;#34; when these are so darned good.</li>
      <li>I purchased a Straight Razor, Strope Strap, 2 synthetic brushes (The REAL CHEAP KIND), &amp; 2 pucks worth of shave soap of unkown brands.  </li>
      <li>Badger is certainly better than boars plus there are those beautiful handles and other considerations that make a shaving session feel like a luxury...</li>
      <li>It keeps my cell phone, Nintendo DS Lite, computer keyboard and tower, truck console dust free.</li>
      <li>Years later I&#x27;m still finding great uses for this brush.</li>
      <li>So I went back to using canned shave cream, never was happy about that.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not finding it available anymore.</li>
      <li>but it was exactly as cheap as the price I paid for it).&lt;br /</li>
      <li>$15 you can get an excellent Omega brush that would last a few good years and perform a hundred times better than these brushes.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t personally used it, but they look like great brushes for the money.</li>
      <li>The key to a good shave is making sure you apply soap/ cream, what ever your using .</li>
      <li>Well worth the money !</li>
      <li>No lost bristles, no cracked handle, I jam it into my Proraso soap container, jam it into my face, then jam it into the shower wall to clean it out.</li>
      <li>Considering that this is one of the cheapest shaving brushes available, I am very pleased with the price, and my initial experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;8/30/11:</li>
      <li>And it was able to spread the Shave Soap better than the cheap Shave Brushes that I had intially purchased for the same purpose.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>This is a nice boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush that is soft, convenient sized and durable.</li>
      <li>The bristles are still intack and the head is still full.</li>
      <li>so it might not hold as much water and might feel just a bit more prickly on the skin.</li>
      <li>These simple, no frills, nice &amp; stiff brushes are perfect for getting the intended benefits out of this type of shaving without wasting money on silver handles and mahogany brush stands.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
      <li>But the odor goes away very quickly after the first couple uses and the fragrance from your shaving cream will also mask and help elimminate any odor.</li>
      <li>I went through one of the synthetic brushes rather quickly</li>
      <li>This brush seems perfectly adequate for lathering and applying soap to my face.</li>
      <li>If you find one on the store shelf, I&#x27;d grab it quickly.     </li>
      <li>While I am very sure that there are other Shave Brushes that are far superior to this one (</li>
      <li>Also an excellent option for those new to the shaving experience and unsure if they want to invest top dollar into more expensive options.</li>
      <li>Now, in fairness, I soak &#x27;em in very hot water, maybe that was the problem.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is my first shaving brush, so it&#x27;s better than hand lathering, but not by much.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried these brushes you are missing a great experience in shaving.</li>
      <li>I was watching video&#x27;s of guys setting there brushes in a bowl full of hot water, while they showered.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame that good reviews intended to help other customers feed aggressive price increases.</li>
      <li>The bristles are perfect for working into the little nooks and crannies to dislodge anything that might possibly cause our weapon to jam or an equipment malfunction.     </li>
      <li>Try Omega brushes - a few more $$$ and a lot better.    </li>
      <li>When i use it , I set it in a bowl of warm water, take a shower, drain the bowl, add shave soap, mix, shave, rinse the brush when done and rub softley on a towel to dry.</li>
      <li>good boar brush is set such the bristles natural tips are \\&quot;even\\&quot; and the knot itself is trimmed.</li>
      <li>I like my brush a good bit stiffer, badger is a little too soft/floppy for my taste.</li>
      <li>The first brush began to shed after a month.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what it is, a $1 brush.</li>
      <li>My first introduction to the Van Der Hagen Boar bristle shaving brush was while I was in the Army.</li>
      <li>, but I definitely like this brush better.</li>
      <li>It would start shedding from the first shave and never stop.&lt;br /&gt;You will find hairs all over the place: on your face, sink, razor and of course on the soap or in your cream</li>
      <li>First off, the texture.</li>
      <li>Having rediscovered the art of shaving (nothing else really compares!)</li>
      <li>But for the $$$ I got 2 more to fall back on...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used mine for a week, it shed some at first, but no shedding now.    </li>
      <li>Update after one year and five months in service the first of the three brushes came apart yesterday.</li>
      <li>The knot size is 22mm, for anyone else interested.</li>
      <li>Run hot water over the bristle , not into the seat of the handle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used one of these for a pretty good 4 years, it lathers good, the price is right, and it doesn&#x27;t shed to bad.  </li>
      <li>a good &amp; solid first Shave Brush for the beginner, such as myself.  </li>
      <li>I then purchased a Van Der Hagen gift set at a local CVS (See my review on that) that contained a Shave Bowl, Deluxe Shave Soap, &amp; Natural Boar Shave Brush (as opposed to what?  </li>
      <li>Been using these brushes for a long time and absolutely love them.  </li>
      <li>Gets the job done right without the high price.</li>
      <li>B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]</li>
      <li>Having said that, it does allow you to make lather so for the price conscious or the new to wet shaving but not quite ready to spend a lot of money of a Badger hair brush, the Van Der Hagen is a good option.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While some say to get a badger, skip the boar it depends what you want from your brush. I like my brush a good bit stiffer, badger is a little too soft/floppy for my taste. Yes, it&#x27;s not a super expensive brush with a fancy handle, but if you are happy with boar it is a nice brush. I&#x27;ve used mine for a week, it shed some at first, but no shedding now.    Makes my soap lather nicely and applies it. That is all I need it to do.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t personally used it, but they look like great brushes for the money. I bought them to go with my all natural shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Around a year ago I bought this brush and then thought I was now King of Shavers, Esquire. I knew nothing! But now I know what I know, and ANY badger-hair brush is better than the best boar-hair brush. SKIP THIS BUY. Invest instead in a basic badger-hair brush like the Omega Stripey or the entry-level Tweezerman, and THEN get into wetshaving. Get these: Omega Stripey badger-hair shaving brush, Merkur #34 razor, Derby blades, and Taylor of Old Bond Street(TOBS)Rose shaving cream. Read the shaving forums. Buy badger. NOT THIS BRUSH.</li>
    <li> Each one has fallen apart after only a couple of uses. Handles are not securely fastened to bristles. Is nowhere near the same quality as what you would buy in the same packaging from a store - I have bought these from Rite Aid before and these ones were fine</li>
    <li> While these are not the high end shaving brushes they do the job well enough...After awhile I find the bristles start to get loose and fall out...But for the $$$ I got 2 more to fall back on...</li>
    <li> I got into straight razor shaving recently and decided to go with the low-end products to save money while I learned how to do things right. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a straight razor for only six months now and have gone through two of these brushes already. The first brush began to shed after a month. By 5 months I had to toss it in the trash and get another one. From the very first day the second one started shedding multiple hairs into the shave bowl and on my face while applying the foam.    It is possible that my maintenance practices are at fault, but I doubt it. I wet the brush by holding it under hot running water, bristles pointed down with the stream. When done I swish the brush in a cup of water to get out the soap and then hold it under running water again for a rinse. I then gently squeeze the bristles and shake off the excess. I store the brush standing up in my medicine cabinet.    Overall, I think this brush may be useful for someone new to straight razors. It is an inexpensive gateway into learning how to use the equipment so you won&#x27;t damage the more expensive, quality product you will buy shortly afterwards - as I am about to do now.</li>
    <li> The quality of this brush is subpar. It would start shedding from the first shave and never stop.&lt;br /&gt;You will find hairs all over the place: on your face, sink, razor and of course on the soap or in your cream jar.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even feel like a decent quality boar brush, there is simply no comparison. The bristles are somewhat crude and it seems that they were trimmed to even up the shape because it means that the tips would not split.&lt;br /&gt;A good boar brush is set such the bristles natural tips are \\&quot;even\\&quot; and the knot itself is trimmed. The natural tips start to split after 10 usages and then you really get a soft feel with a firm springy backbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the weirdest and overpriced deals on the web. Why buy 3 lowest possible brushes is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;For $15 you can get an excellent Omega brush that would last a few good years and perform a hundred times better than these brushes.</li>
    <li> Have you ever bought a $1 paint brush and painted something with it? This is exactly what it is, a $1 brush. It sheds hair like there&#x27;s no tomorrow and it&#x27;s as hard as a wire brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and it&#x27;s down to half its original size, not to mention how annoying it is to pick the hair off your face every time. And to make things worse, you&#x27;re stuck with 3 of them! Do yourself a favor, instead of buying 3 of these for $20, buy a good one for $20 and you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> Having rediscovered the art of shaving (nothing else really compares!) it is only natural that you will soon search for quality shaving brushes. Badger is certainly better than boars plus there are those beautiful handles and other considerations that make a shaving session feel like a luxury...however, like any type of grooming product they tend to get a lot of use and may have hygenic concerns. These inexpensive alternatives are of a decent quality, durable enough to last years but inexpensive enough to take along when traveling or just toss away should you feel the need for new/cleaner brushes. Also an excellent option for those new to the shaving experience and unsure if they want to invest top dollar into more expensive options. Gets the job done right without the high price.</li>
    <li> My first introduction to the Van Der Hagen Boar bristle shaving brush was while I was in the Army. It was recommended that we keep one of these with us and the PX always had these in stock. The recommendation was not for shaving but for keeping the dust, dirt and grime off and out of our weapons in between our regularly scheduled weapon maintenance time. It is the perfect brush to have on hand to quickly swipe over our equipment to help keep everything in top working order. The bristles are perfect for working into the little nooks and crannies to dislodge anything that might possibly cause our weapon to jam or an equipment malfunction.     Years later I&#x27;m still finding great uses for this brush. It keeps my cell phone, Nintendo DS Lite, computer keyboard and tower, truck console dust free. There&#x27;s enough stiffness in the bristles that they&#x27;ll get into all the tight places without effort. What will you use this little boar bristle brush for??    As far as shaving is concerned, it has not been too long since I decided to quit throwing away my money on outrageously expensive multi-blade cartridges. This budget shaving brush does the job quite well in working a nice soapy lather onto your face. It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to the new/old world of wet-shaving. Along with VDH soap, which I think is of excellent quality, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with it&#x27;s simplistic form and function. This is NOT the premium badger hair so it might not hold as much water and might feel just a bit more prickly on the skin. It is the hair from a real boar so there might be a slight smell in the BEGINNING and yes, some hairs will fall out at first but not to the point that it renders this little brush useless. The handle is solid plastic handle with a nice heavy feel and I don&#x27;t think the design has changed in years nor does it need to. I have purchased these in the past locally but I&#x27;m not finding it available anymore. If you find one on the store shelf, I&#x27;d grab it quickly.     At this price no one can really go wrong having a brush like this on hand. If you don&#x27;t use it for shaving I can guarantee you&#x27;ll find a use for it in some other way. It does what it was intended to do and MORE. In my opinion, I love it and I will never be without one. For me, IT HAS EARNED EVERY ONE OF ITS 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for over 6 months. Has only lost a few of the bristles in that time which has not affected my ability to use it at all. Excellent price for this product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice boar&#x27;s hair shaving brush that is soft, convenient sized and durable. Shaving is so much better with a brush than with a can of foam.</li>
    <li> VDH brush is a 6 out of 10 brush ... must hang handle UP to dry.  VDH last longer if it is in a rotation with other brushes.    Hairs fall out some over first few months - again, low cost brush.    Want better?  Try Omega brushes - a few more $$$ and a lot better.    Still, I am using my VDH in my brush rotation going on 4+ years!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased a shave mug and brush awhile back (years) and my brush wore out so I went looking for a new one in the stores. Could not find one so went to the internet and found the same one in a 3 pack. I am very happy with this purchase and when needed will get more of the same brush. I had used another brand years ago but only remember the brush being shorter and not as comfortable than this brand. So I went back to using canned shave cream, never was happy about that. Then a few years ago I came across the mug and brush kit with soap and went back to that. I may even get my old straight razor out and start using it again.</li>
    <li> First off I am brand new to brush and safety razor shaving. I have used disposable razors and soap (hand lather) for many years. I decided to try out a brush for lathering the soap. I am still using the same soap as before (Dove)) except I softened it and pressed it into a plastic cup. This brush seems perfectly adequate for lathering and applying soap to my face. I prepped the brush by rinsing it and then letting it soak in some hair conditioner. This seemed to soften the brush and gave me a chance to work out any lose bristles before use. Considering that this is one of the cheapest shaving brushes available, I am very pleased with the price, and my initial experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;8/30/11: Update after one year and five months in service the first of the three brushes came apart yesterday. It appears that the glue holding the bristles in the handle gave out. I must admit that lately I have been lax in rinsing and hanging the brush to dry. I think this contributed to the glue giving out. I am putting the second of the three brushes in service and plan to take better/ more consistent care of it and will see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;4/9/13: Another update. The second brush is just starting to loose bristles in big pieces. It remains functional but only so,so. This one I took better care to rinse out and hang upside down to dry, I am at one year eight months of service. I am going to hold the third one in reserve while I try some other brushes.</li>
    <li> Bought a set of these off Amazon last year and I am still on the first one with a long way to go. I use it with Gel, Cream and Foam...Just Perfect.</li>
    <li> I use for cleaning firearms. Works great to get the dust and grit off quickly. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> Been using these brushes for a long time and absolutely love them.  Just wet it, lather up with a mug of soap, brush it over my beard and shave.  Much better experience than lathering up with foamy shave creams, etc.  And, the Van Der Hagen is the best that I&#x27;ve ever found.  Lastly, the price from this vendor is much lower than Walgreens where I purchased them in the past.  Almost $2.00 less per brush.  If you haven&#x27;t tried these brushes you are missing a great experience in shaving.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to the whole Shave Brush &amp; Shave Soap scene.  I had gone to a place 2 plus years ago to get a straight razor shave on a recommendation from a friend.  And boy did I LOVE it!!  I have been wanting to get a straight razor &amp; related items since.  I purchased a Straight Razor, Strope Strap, 2 synthetic brushes (The REAL CHEAP KIND), &amp; 2 pucks worth of shave soap of unkown brands.  I went through one of the synthetic brushes rather quickly (It was a start but it was exactly as cheap as the price I paid for it).&lt;br /&gt;  I then purchased a Van Der Hagen gift set at a local CVS (See my review on that) that contained a Shave Bowl, Deluxe Shave Soap, &amp; Natural Boar Shave Brush (as opposed to what?  The Unnatural Boar Shave Brush?).  I purchased through Amazon the Shave Brush/Straight Razor holder &amp; stand alone Shave Brush holder to hold these items.  While I was still using my second cheapie synthetic Shave Brush, I had put the VDH Boar Shave Brush in the stand alone Shave Brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;  I finally gave the Van Der Hagen Boar Shave Brush a try to see how it compared with the synthetic cheap Shave Brush I had.  And it was a major difference in how it performed.  Better that is.  I lost some hairs from it (But it seems, through research AND from the reviews I have read on Amazon, that this seems to be a regular occourence with MOST Shave Brushes regardless of price, brand, AND/OR the type of animal hair that is used accross the board with rare exception) but not many.  It lathered the shave soap better.  It had a firm, yet giving feel when I spread the lather on my face.  And it was able to spread the Shave Soap better than the cheap Shave Brushes that I had intially purchased for the same purpose.&lt;br /&gt;  While I have limited experience with Shave Brushes (Synthetic &amp; now Boar Hair Shave Brushes), the Van Der Hagen Natural Boar Hair Brush is a good &amp; solid first Shave Brush for the beginner, such as myself.  While I am very sure that there are other Shave Brushes that are far superior to this one (And from what I have seen &amp; researched there are), this is an excellent beginner Shave Brush to purchase.  It doesn&#x27;t break the pocket book in price, it is definately of slightly higher in quality than its price would indicate, and allows for the beginner (Such as myself) to learn how to use a Shave Brush properly without having to worry about ruining a much more expensive boar/badger/black badger/ siilver badger hair Shave Brush.&lt;br /&gt;  I have purchased an extra three of these since.  As a back up while I am not only still learning, but to not have to worry about ordering or finding a new one at last minute.  Thank you Van Der Hagen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these for a pretty good 4 years, it lathers good, the price is right, and it doesn&#x27;t shed to bad.  If you&#x27;re just starting or you don&#x27;t want to drop a wad of cash on a brush this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very cheap relative to others you&#x27;ll find, but don&#x27;t expect to find a hidden value with them.  They are functional but I lose a couple of hairs every time I use it and the boar&#x27;s hair is rigid, making it difficult to get a really even lather.  I&#x27;m glad I started with a cheaper brush before diving in to a more expensive badger hair brush, but I&#x27;ll be upgrading soon and giving the two unused brushed to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these brushes for a couple years, buy can no longer find it locally. I can&#x27;t see paying the high prices at &amp;#34;shaving stores&amp;#34; when these are so darned good. The bristles are firm enough to whip up a great lather (Williams Shave Soap), but soft enough for not poke during application. I dropped it a couple times, cracking the plastic handle. The 3-pack should last many years into the future.</li>
    <li> This brush is not the greatest. It is my first shaving brush, so it&#x27;s better than hand lathering, but not by much. I got mine with the Van der Hagen 4 piece set. First off, the texture. I was expecting badger but this is boar, so it&#x27;s coarser and grittier. It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tear up&amp;#34; my face but it definitely was abrasive (err, &amp;#34;exfoliating.&amp;#34;) Next, it falls apart. I just used it for the fifth time and still at least 5 full length bristles fell out. This has happened every time. Lastly, it barely fits in the holder it was made for, which frustrates me as the most attractive part of the set was that it all came with a brush and blade stand. It topples out every time I move the stand and it&#x27;s just one of those bothersome details. In all, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> HUGE PRICE INCEASE! I bought this 3-pack a year ago for under $15. It&#x27;s a shame that good reviews intended to help other customers feed aggressive price increases. I enjoy my purchase every day, but I&#x27;m not sure I would buy at this price and I am hesitant to recommend to anyone else that they do.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moASUK2UZEXM26]]The Van Der Hagen natural Boar hair shave brush was the first brush I bought when I decided to go back to traditional shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boar hair is a coarser hair than you&#x27;ll find with the generally more expensive Badger hair brushes. Consequently Boar hair brushes don&#x27;t hold water quite as well which makes it a little more difficult to get a great lather from whatever shaving cream you use. Having said that, it does allow you to make lather so for the price conscious or the new to wet shaving but not quite ready to spend a lot of money of a Badger hair brush, the Van Der Hagen is a good option. Just know that you can buy a very decent Badger hair brush for around $20, such as the Escali (which is not sold on Amazon as I write this) or the Tweezerman Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, some would make the argument that because Boar hair is a coarser hair, that it has an added benefit of providing better skin exfoliation while applying the lather.  If nothing else, because of the stiffer bristles, it does provide a more invigorating feeling on the skin than a softer bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have an issue with the odor of the hair... well it&#x27;s animal hair so that&#x27;s to be expected. But the odor goes away very quickly after the first couple uses and the fragrance from your shaving cream will also mask and help elimminate any odor. I didn&#x27;t find it a problem or even objectionable at all. This is an inexpensive brush that will get the job done, but please also consider spending a bit more for a superior Badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with this particular shaving brush.  The reason that I gave it only 4 stars, is that this is the only non-synthetic shaving brush that I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty hard on inanimate objects.  Tools, cooking implements, shaving brushes.  Squeeze water out gently between fingers and hang upside down to dry?  Grasp the bristles only and gently swirl them into the shave soap?  Don&#x27;t mash the bristles into your face or the bristles will come out, the knots will untie, the handle will crack, blah, blah, blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I beat the hell out of this little critter for over a year now, and guess what?  No lost bristles, no cracked handle, I jam it into my Proraso soap container, jam it into my face, then jam it into the shower wall to clean it out. Sometimes, depending on how much in a hurry I am or how much I&#x27;ve been drinking, I leave the stupid thing lying in the shower until the next day.  Yeah, you shouldn&#x27;t drink &amp; drive, or shave, or use power tools, but my dad lived, and I have, so far.  No, I take care of my straight razors very well, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very powerful wiry beard, and used to have to shave twice daily until I began straight shaving.  Once again, this is a pretty good item for the money.</li>
    <li> Good shaving brushes for the money hardly any hair comes off the brush I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Hard to figure who would buy unless you need absolute rock bottom price. I had two of the three fall apart within six months (handle cracks in pieces). Now, in fairness, I soak &#x27;em in very hot water, maybe that was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself, when it holds together, works well. But for  few more bucks you can get either Semogue or Omega boar brushes (including here on Amazon), which are generally regarded to have a useful life in years if not decades rather than months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that VDH customer service will replace them with a nice entry-level badger if you have the problem I had, but a boar is what I wanted (better for soaps as opposed to creams). And who wants the hassle (though they are very nice about it, I must say).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews, about how a badger hair brush is so much better than boar hair.  How soft badger is and boar hurts my baby soft skin face. How the bristles fall out and everything else. Well your looking at this brush and reading the reviews because you are looking to wet shave without spending a whole lot of money. and not buying garbage, correct ? Well there is nothing wrong with the brush I bought. The bristle&#x27;s were a little on the stiff side when I first started using it. It wasn&#x27;t like I was using a wire brush on my face ! I have been using mine now for about six , maybe seven month&#x27;s and it has softened up to where I am extremely happy with it. If it was to get any softer it would be too soft. I also have a badger brush and it&#x27;s pretty much still new . It will make a better lather than my boar brush, but it doesn&#x27;t make my shave any better. The key to a good shave is making sure you apply soap/ cream, what ever your using . And rub it in good, let the hair on your face have time to absorb it. As far as the bristles coming out of the brush. Don&#x27;t throw your brush in a sink or bowl full of hot water, Its not necessary. Glue and heat are not a good combo if you want the glue to stay hard and hold what its supposed to hold. Run hot water over the bristle , not into the seat of the handle. And this brush should last you a long time. Also after rinsing the brush, rub it on a towel to get rid of excess water.  I was watching video&#x27;s of guys setting there brushes in a bowl full of hot water, while they showered. So I was doing the same thing ! Well every time I did, I would notice a bristle or two on my face while I was lathering up. When I stop soaking my brush, I did not have that problem anymore.  I Don&#x27;t know how long this brush is  going to last, but it&#x27;s doing just fine.  This is a good brush and well worth the money. I hope I was helpful ! Update:(11/11/2015) I am still using this brush with no problems. I bought it , I thick back in mid 2014. I maysee a bristle on face about every other shave. But yo couldn&#x27;t tell it is missing any. Well worth the money ! I would buy another one, but I have three other brushes I have not been using, because I use this one all the time. (4/16/17) I am still using this brush and it is performing well. The bristles are still intack and the head is still full. The bristle are not braking off and i am thinking this thing is going to out last me. I am happy I didnt spend a stupid amont off money on some badger hair brush. When i use it , I set it in a bowl of warm water, take a shower, drain the bowl, add shave soap, mix, shave, rinse the brush when done and rub softley on a towel to dry. I made my own hanger out of wood, with about 5 coats of paint to prevent water from damaging the wood.  I am very happy still with this product almost 3 years later.</li>
    <li> I own this brush as well as the better-received [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]], but I definitely like this brush better. It shed an insane amount of hairs the first time I used it and it was a little scratchy. However, these issues largely disappeared after the first few shaves. There are better brushes out there, but this one is quite good considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars due to other people&#x27;s worrying complaints of the brush falling apart on them. It&#x27;s worth spending a few more dollars on an Omega or Semogue brush just for durability, but I got this brush as part of the [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush)]] and am happy to use it until it wears out.</li>
    <li> The package came in with 3 brushes like in the description. The only difference from the picture is that the handle is white.</li>
    <li> These are the best deal around. Boar hair brushes are stiffer than badger hair and that&#x27;s perfect for me! The reason I shave &amp;#34;mug n&#x27; brush&amp;#34; style is the way applying the lather gets your whiskers to stand up. This provides a much smoother shave. Canned shaving cream just mats the hair down and badger hair is just to wispy; I feel like I&#x27;m trying to spread heavy cream around my face with a feather! These simple, no frills, nice &amp; stiff brushes are perfect for getting the intended benefits out of this type of shaving without wasting money on silver handles and mahogany brush stands.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This brush is ok, lathers well and bristles are neither to hard nor too soft. But ultimately I found that it lost a lot of hairs with every shave.  I got fed up with that and got a different brush</li>
    <li> This is your basic pork bristle shaving brush. The bristles start out feeling stiff, but soften up as the brush is used. The brushes are sturdy and durable. They are a pleasure to use. If and when one ever wears out, I replace the pork bristle knot with a Badger hair knot! The knot size is 22mm, for anyone else interested.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me after she made shaving cream for me. I was very surprised by how well it worked. The cream and the brush.</li>
    <li> Received these very quickly after ordering. As others stated, there is a smell to these when they first get wet, but a couple of washes with a shampoo and  they are efine. Great price.</li>
    <li> Best cheap brush out there! Get one for all the men in your life, it applies shaving cream as its supposed too.</li>
