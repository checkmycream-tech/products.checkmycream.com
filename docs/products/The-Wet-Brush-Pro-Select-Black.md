      <li>Love my new brush on my daughters hair</li>

      <li>She now brushes her hair multiple times a day on her own.  </li>
      <li>Leaves a smooth, soft, clean feeling and looking finish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other detangling brushes, but never one as good as this one.  </li>
      <li>To start off, I have very long, fine, baby fine, easy tangled, wavy, difficult yet beautiful (or so I would like to think!)</li>
      <li>Bought the brush with little expectation, ended up loving it!</li>
      <li>It DOES require a little bit more brushing than stiffer bristle brushes but those brushes are more damaging to your hair.</li>
      <li>Had huge tangles and knots on my hair from swimming and not drying my hair completely.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>

      <li>I have very fine long hair</li>

      <li>great on my straight hair when wet and dry.</li>
      <li>Works great on my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair</li>
      <li>Nice size - BIG enough to feel like you are getting hair dried faster - nice large size paddle</li>
      <li>This brush works better when your hair is wet, but works either way.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>she has curly hair and is very tender headed.  </li>
      <li>This helps so so much without making me wince with every brush stroke.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>She didnt make one sound when I brushed her hair.  </li>

      <li>Love this brush - it has been a Godsend to brush my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair (which is down to her waist).</li>
      <li>If your hair tangles easily, is fine, wavy and/or straight, and is not easily managed, give it a whirl.  </li>
      <li>The Detangle Brush Pro works better than the regular Wet Brush.  </li>
      <li>Like the name implies, it works a little better when your hair is wet, but either way it really minimizes breakage.  </li>
      <li>You just have to be a bit more gently with this brush than you would with a regular hard bristle brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This brush is awesome. My hairstylist introduced it to me and after trying it out I decided to purchase my own. It cuts about half the time it takes me to brush my hair normally. What I&#x27;ve done is brush my hair with a normal brush before showering, come through my wet hair with my fingers, and then use the wet brush to come through the rest. I have A LOT of hair so this may not be necessary for everyone, but it&#x27;s my method and it works just fine for me!</li>
    <li> Perfect as described. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that tangles easily.  This is by far the best brush I have used.</li>
    <li> I have very fine long hair so it get tangled very easily. This is by far the best brush I have used!</li>
    <li> Ok.  To start off, I have very long, fine, baby fine, easy tangled, wavy, difficult yet beautiful (or so I would like to think!) hair.  While we all know to start brushing from the bottom when our hair is wet, paddle brushes &amp; combs just don&#x27;t do the trick.  My stylist, whom I love, has always complained about how deceiving my hair can be due to how much it tangles.  A few months ago she broke out &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; and it was a completely different experience with minimal time &amp; no damage!  I had to purchase it and try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  The &amp;#34;Wet Brush Pro&amp;#34; is amaaaaaazing!!  The time it takes to brush my hair when wet is now minimal compared to what it used to be.  It also gets my tangles out super quickly, and does not turn into knots.  As well, I see that over the past few months my hair is breaking far less, I have a lot fewer split ends, and it seems overall more manageable.  If your hair tangles easily, is fine, wavy and/or straight, and is not easily managed, give it a whirl.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Love it! It doesn&#x27;t hurt or get stuck in tangles b</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Great at detangling. I have fine straight hair and this brush works great for me.</li>
    <li> Brush works well, is easy to clean, feels good on scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are farther apart than I thought they would be, not the best on fine shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t retain any water so you can&#x27;t uses it to wet your hair. Works well if hair already wet.</li>
    <li> This brush has been a life saver! My hair is severely damaged, and this has kept it from breaking off as frequently. I have definitely noticed a decline in the thinning of my hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush i&#x27;ve ever used. Feels so good when you brush (on your scalp) and gets right through tangles!</li>
    <li> Great Brush!!!  Works wonderful on fine thinning hair!</li>
    <li> works great on my extensions</li>
    <li> It holds up really well to my hair and the tips have not bended. The Detangle Brush Pro works better than the regular Wet Brush.  My hair looks soft and shiny. Love it.</li>
    <li> this is my wifes new favorite  brush.  majorly cuts down on her time in the bathroom!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes with the small ball ends on the brush tips. They are smoother on the scalp. Although on this particular brush the ball ends seem smaller than on another brush of the same brand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too soft for my curls. However, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great brush- hair feels silky and smooth after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are very gentle and soft so that your scalp won&#x27;t suffer.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is the brush is on the large side, so if you have thick hair this may be a little difficult to use...</li>
    <li> Nice for your scalp, but not too stiff</li>
    <li> It really is everything the other positive reviews make it out to be.  Takes a bit longer to comb through the hair though, but no ouchies for the girls.</li>
    <li> Seems to work better on dry hair (I have long, wavy hair). Good quality, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this brush - it has been a Godsend to brush my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair (which is down to her waist). I was about to cut it off because she cried when I brushed her hair after she got out of the bath and a hairdresser recommended it to me. It does exactly what it says it does. We call it our &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I tend to be one of the people that say, &amp;#34;this is just another hairbrush, nothing really special...&amp;#34; and, it is just another hairbrush, but, the bristles are very soft and pliable and it definitely makes for easier combing of my little ones long hair.  I think the design is as described and I definitely would buy again.  You just have to be a bit more gently with this brush than you would with a regular hard bristle brush.</li>
    <li> My second one somehow lost or forgot when traveling&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and it&#x27;s a torture to brush. This one been a life savior!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my daughter (and then one for me!) I absolutely love it! It is so gentle on my hair but is still effective. It DOES require a little bit more brushing than stiffer bristle brushes but those brushes are more damaging to your hair. My daughter who used to cry every time I had to brush her hair, now enjoys it. We both love this product.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long curly hair and this brush helps untangle with ease! No tears! Great brush!</li>
    <li> Bought the brush with little expectation, ended up loving it! First thought was it was a little flimsy but in reality, it&#x27;s perfect. Will never use another brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Brushes through hair with no problems.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used. Very soft and gentle on your hair. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is literally the best brush I have ever used.  Like the name implies, it works a little better when your hair is wet, but either way it really minimizes breakage.  My ex had one that I used all the time, and when we split up I immediately ordered my own.</li>
    <li> Love this brush--I really didn&#x27;t know what I was missing or the damage I was doing combing my hair wet with a harsh brush until I felt the difference with this one. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, started out with smaller version and now using this and love it. My stylist actually uses one too!</li>
    <li> I got the item I expected ;) very useful</li>
    <li> Best brush out there!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it much at first, but now I absolutely love it. Give it a chance</li>
    <li> It untangles my hair easily, but feels flimsy.</li>
    <li> I have a mane. People who say they have a mane, haven&#x27;t met me. It&#x27;s pretty manely. Seriously when I get highlights, people take 20 minutes trying to detangle my hair. Then when they dry it, it tangles again. My hair is thick. My hair is course. My hair is the worst. It is damaged. But this thing makes it MANAGEABLE. Seriously I used to dread combing through my hair after showers. Now it&#x27;s not as terrible. This helps so so much without making me wince with every brush stroke. I have to say because I have such thick hair I definitely have a TON of hair in the brush after, but I&#x27;ve decided it is hair that my other brush is missing, and it&#x27;s the hair that would have shed all over me throughout the day. So thanks, brush, for saving me that annoying feeling of hair on the back of my arm all day long. I like to use this on my wet hair when I get out, usually starting at the ends and working my way up. Then I use it as a paddle brush to blow my hair dry. It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair when I blow dry, it keeps my hair from getting matted and tangled, and I will never live without one again. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I&#x27;m saving the 5 star for a product that does not even pull my hair at all. This doesn&#x27;t hurt when it pulls, but I have a mane, so obviously it&#x27;s going to pull. Hope this is helpful! The picture is my hair after using the brush to blow dry and straighten.</li>
    <li> Works right through wet hair, doesn&#x27;t pull or rip at hair. Even massages the scalp. Great brush!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush and got 2 for my daughters, they love it, too.</li>
    <li> We recently ordered this product to help with our six year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  Every morning is battle that involves yelling and tears, just to get her hair combed.  She loves this brush.  She now brushes her hair multiple times a day on her own.  She is acting like such a big girl, and I credit this brush, due to it pulling less. After her bath last night it went through her thick hair in one swipe.  I am no longer dreaming of buzz cutting her hair!  I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from the morning battle of the tangles.</li>
    <li> I definitely don&#x27;t need this to de tangle my hair! I have short hair! I like this brush because the bristles give as I brush my hair! Most other brushes are very stiff and are a little to hard on my scalp even with light pressure. This brush is very comfortable no matter how hard I brush!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! Soft and leaves ur hair supple and fresh.</li>
    <li> as nice as my DryBar brush - and much less expensive.  Hoping that the tips stay on - and I don&#x27;t have to replace it for a long time.  Nice size - BIG enough to feel like you are getting hair dried faster - nice large size paddle</li>
    <li> This brush works great for my hair. Dry or wet it works perfectly for medium thick hair.</li>
    <li> Goes through tangles in such a way as to defy logic.  I&#x27;ve had other detangling brushes, but never one as good as this one.  It came recommended by someone and they weren&#x27;t lying.  If in doubt, it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know how this works. But it works.&lt;br /&gt;This brush straightened out a bird nest of hair. Had huge tangles and knots on my hair from swimming and not drying my hair completely. This brush took out knots with little pain and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a brush. This brush worked a miracle on my hair. Will buy another in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on my straight hair when wet and dry. This brush works better when your hair is wet, but works either way.&lt;br /&gt;Now I no longer need to bald myself when brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> Love my new brush on my daughters hair she has curly hair and is very tender headed.  She didnt make one sound when I brushed her hair.  I will soon try it on my own wet hair.  If you don&#x27;t have this brush and you are looking for something that will save you time and pain...go for it.</li>
    <li> Feels different than my first one :(</li>
    <li> I love the Wet Brush! It&#x27;s life changing for my long hair which is thick but fine and tangles easily when wet. I recommend the wet brush to EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> This brush works wonderfully on my daughters hair!  Takes many strokes to come out, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my daughter, which is the main thing I want from a deranged brush!</li>
    <li> A great brush I use on my daughter that helps with tangled hair. Works much better than any other brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The wet brush works great to get tangles out of long, thick hair. My only complaint is that the individual bristles became bent after only one use. I don&#x27;t know if the brush I get was defective in some way, but the bristles remain bent, all in a downward position.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!!!  Bought it for my pre-teen daughter because she has super thick hair and it works great.  I also use it on my fine/thin hair and I love it so much I&#x27;m buying another one!!!  Excellent price too - way cheaper than stores.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever!  Would be great for children with tender head.  Brushes tangles out so easily without breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a $50 brush for years (still needing replacement yearly) that I thought worked well, until I was at the salon and my stylist brushed through my elbow length, naturally curly hair with this.  Before this brush it would easily take me 5+ minutes to brush my hair out, now I&#x27;m done in under a minute.</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush for anybody that has hair.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;The Wet Brush is one of the BEST brushes I have ever used. I have thick, curly, coarse, frizzy hair and this was the perfect detangler-literally took strokes and I was done. Leaves a smooth, soft, clean feeling and looking finish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&amp;#34;</li>
