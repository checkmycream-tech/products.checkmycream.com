      <li>Staying power was great for me not a smudge in 6 hours .I</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE eyeliner!!  </li>
      <li>It is a very good price and the quality is there; will buy more.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s a generally good product.</li>
      <li>If you have light skin, this could be perfect.</li>
      <li>and she said it works really good for her.</li>
      <li>Super affordable and just as awesome as Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo liner!!</li>
      <li>For a first timer with liquid eyeliner, the felt pen was an excellent choice.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
      <li>Love the size, too!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>Jordanian bold felt tip is great.</li>
      <li>So easy to apply and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply and is somewhat waterproof!</li>
      <li>Not as good as Estee Lauder&#x27;s Eyeliner marker but better than what you can get at Walmart and available all year around unlike Estee Lauder&#x27;s marker.</li>
      <li>I have to say, this purchase is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever made regarding liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I also love Jordana lip brush glosses.</li>
      <li>I love felt tip liners.</li>
      <li>I am not 100% sure how well this would work for cat-eyes, but I also have darker skin.</li>
      <li>I really love this for the price.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Amazingly easy to apply, love it.</li>
      <li>Semi easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It easily washes off with my face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Applies easily and makes controlling the tip easy to do, and it also stays on all day and does not irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not intensely black like some liquid liners, which I think is a good thing, because I can layer on more for an evening look, or just one layer for daytime.  </li>
      <li>Liquid liners stayed on but if you don&#x27;t apply perfectly are a huge mess.</li>
      <li>do use a fabulous primer on my lids.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
      <li>Plus its super cheap.</li>
      <li>I was at Walgreens and saw this cheap Jordana bold felt-tip and for $3.99</li>
      <li>I was nervous about some of the less positive reviews, but the eyeliner arrived quickly and is awesome.  </li>
      <li>give it 10 seconds to dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>When wearing eye liner, I enjoy a thicker, bold line across the top lid only.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it to try it out at Walgreens to see if it works for you.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I am able to apply this product smoothly, and it is easy to fit up any small mistakes with a damp makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
      <li>That is why I like liquid - it is more precise, bold and once it is dry, it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: the tip is bold, but the color really isn&#x27;t that bold.</li>
      <li>And priced right too.</li>
      <li>Not only is this a cheap, easy product to get to..</li>
      <li>It works pretty good for the price but feels very watery and hard for me to take off but for the price it&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I have been looking</li>
      <li>Only complaints I have is that I wish it was blacker and that the tip was a bit more moisturized.</li>
      <li>In love with using this product definitely going to rebuy it when I&#x27;m done!</li>
      <li>You really must give this a try!</li>
      <li>but it is a nice bold black and looks very chic.</li>
      <li>Not a very dark black but still pulls off a great look.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use extremely pigmented and staying power.</li>
      <li>The pen is short and fat - easy to hold.</li>
      <li>I love this, thick and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Stays on really well throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake.</li>
      <li>Really worked well for the cat eye look.</li>
      <li>This felt-tip is so much easier- twenty times easier, yet stays put.</li>
      <li>I went on a bit of a quest for an eyeliner pen and after much research landed on this one.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m also using it on my whole eye socket, not just my lids.</li>
      <li>It gives me more control than other types of liners.</li>
      <li>Hey with the money you save you can get alot alot of other things :-)</li>
      <li>I like liquid liner, but most have whispy applicators that make it hard to get a clean, natural looking line without having to touch up!  </li>
      <li>I use it when I&#x27;m in my Batman Dark Knight costume and it holds up OK when I&#x27;m sweating a lot</li>
      <li>This is hands down my FAVORITE liquid eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I was extremely happy with this very dark black</li>
      <li>The thickness of the pen makes it easy to apply bold or subtle looks.</li>
      <li>so I was very surprised at how well it stayed.</li>
      <li>If you want a nice bold, thick black eyeliner this is a must have.</li>
      <li>the color is so dull, i had to apply more than once and still no color.</li>
      <li>Meh - kind of hard to control, not a big fan.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of liners over the years- high end, low end...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not great at &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; lines in general, and that is why I prefer a non-slanted felt tip, I feel they are more forgiving.</li>
      <li>I definitely like a natural look, but this liner is versatile.  </li>
      <li>The tip is thick yet precise.</li>
      <li>gates.&lt;br /&gt;The thin tip of the felt pennhelps to create precise lines and makes achieving the cat eye far easier than with a brush.</li>
      <li>although if it&#x27;s hot out you might find it under your eye a little smudge</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sooo easy to draw a thick cat eye with this pen!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just hoping it will not fun out fast.</li>
      <li>Also, I left off a star because sometimes by the end of the day if it&#x27;s hot out or after a workout, this sweats into my eyes and irritates them a little bit.</li>
      <li>a student, the black eyeliner helps to create a mature and sensible look, and can be used to create a more dramatic flair outside of school</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> worst item i ever brought ink was dry . Nothing came out ladies do not buy</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST eyeliner for a sixties cat eye look. All other eyeliners smudged, smeared, ended up under my eye or gone all together. Liquid liners stayed on but if you don&#x27;t apply perfectly are a huge mess. This felt-tip is so much easier- twenty times easier, yet stays put. I love this eyeliner!!!!!!!! There&#x27;s a reason you can buy it in a six pack. It is the best.</li>
    <li> Sharpie marker- like feel. Semi easy to apply. I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! If you want a nice bold, thick black eyeliner this is a must have. Stays on really well throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake. Plus its super cheap.</li>
    <li> Amazingly easy to apply, love it.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Try drawing your eyeliner with a dryed out marker.</li>
    <li> For a first timer with liquid eyeliner, the felt pen was an excellent choice. I am able to apply this product smoothly, and it is easy to fit up any small mistakes with a damp makeup brush.&lt;br /&gt;While wearing, even with sweat and rain being affecting factors, this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t smear or fade.&lt;br /&gt;As a student, the black eyeliner helps to create a mature and sensible look, and can be used to create a more dramatic flair outside of school gates.&lt;br /&gt;The thin tip of the felt pennhelps to create precise lines and makes achieving the cat eye far easier than with a brush.</li>
    <li> Super affordable and just as awesome as Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo liner!! LOVE THIS STUFF! I will never use anything else now!</li>
    <li> Applies easily and makes controlling the tip easy to do, and it also stays on all day and does not irritate the skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend of mine quite a while ago and she said it works really good for her.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Estee Lauder&#x27;s Eyeliner marker but better than what you can get at Walmart and available all year around unlike Estee Lauder&#x27;s marker. It washes off well with soap and water. Color can be a bit thin but a second application makes it plenty dark. I use it when I&#x27;m in my Batman Dark Knight costume and it holds up OK when I&#x27;m sweating a lot but I&#x27;m also using it on my whole eye socket, not just my lids.</li>
    <li> In love with using this product definitely going to rebuy it when I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> Jordanian bold felt tip is great. Goes on well and you can go thick or thin I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this purchase is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever made regarding liquid eyeliner. Not only is this a cheap, easy product to get to..but the eyeliner itself is really great quality. However, I am not entirely a fan of how thick the tip is on this liner.</li>
    <li> the color is so dull, i had to apply more than once and still no color. wish it was darker.</li>
    <li> When wearing eye liner, I enjoy a thicker, bold line across the top lid only. I have almond shaped Japanese eyes with a heavy lid, so eye makeup of all types smudges and smears and doesn&#x27;t last long. That is why I like liquid - it is more precise, bold and once it is dry, it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve scoured Sephora for all different types of eye liner, but my problem is the tips are all too skinny for me. I&#x27;m not great at &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; lines in general, and that is why I prefer a non-slanted felt tip, I feel they are more forgiving. I was at Walgreens and saw this cheap Jordana bold felt-tip and for $3.99, it&#x27;s worth a shot. I can&#x27;t believe how much I love it. The pen is short and fat - easy to hold. The tip is thick yet precise. It&#x27;s exactly what I have been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I draw the line, I do have to go over it a 2nd time, give it 10 seconds to dry, and I&#x27;m good to go. It stays there all day. It easily washes off with my face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the tip is bold, but the color really isn&#x27;t that bold. Like a regular felt-tip marker, the colors tend to be a little sheer unless you go over it a couple of times. I am not 100% sure how well this would work for cat-eyes, but I also have darker skin. If you have light skin, this could be perfect. Also, I left off a star because sometimes by the end of the day if it&#x27;s hot out or after a workout, this sweats into my eyes and irritates them a little bit. I wear contact lenses and take them out when I get home, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid $20 for eye liner...it&#x27;s totally worth it to try it out at Walgreens to see if it works for you. It&#x27;s so cheap. I also love Jordana lip brush glosses.</li>
    <li> Great eye liner. Makes applying easier since its thicker and faster to fill in. Not a very dark black but still pulls off a great look. Has not smugded. I&#x27;m just hoping it will not fun out fast.</li>
    <li> This liquid eyeliner is a must-have for make up bags. It is a very good price and the quality is there; will buy more.</li>
    <li> wont stay on... at all</li>
    <li> I guess not good for oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t last 30mins.lol</li>
    <li> It was horrible. Messy and didnt last.</li>
    <li> I went on a bit of a quest for an eyeliner pen and after much research landed on this one.  I was nervous about some of the less positive reviews, but the eyeliner arrived quickly and is awesome.  It&#x27;s sooo easy to draw a thick cat eye with this pen!</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner. Really worked well for the cat eye look. It came in perfect condition. Also seems to be alot of product in it. I really love this for the price.Staying power was great for me not a smudge in 6 hours .I do use a fabulous primer on my lids. Urban Decay. I swear your eye makeup will.not budge.I was extremely happy with this very dark black felt tip eyeliner. I will definitely repurchase this. You can get a thin line or a thick line. Very easy to use extremely pigmented and staying power. PERFECT!! And priced right too. I found this worked equally as well as my MAC brand. So if you want to be beautiful eyeliner this is A great dupe for MAC. Hey with the money you save you can get alot alot of other things :-)</li>
    <li> Meh - kind of hard to control, not a big fan. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my FAVORITE liquid eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever used. It is so easy to apply and is somewhat waterproof!</li>
    <li> Like a marker for your eye liner! So easy to apply and lasts all day! No touch ups required! Can we say &amp;#34;Awesomeness?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product. The thickness of the pen makes it easy to apply bold or subtle looks. I will be purchasing this Fabu liner again.</li>
    <li> it is just awesome. I liked it.It has very good quality. For beginners it is the best product to use.</li>
    <li> I love this, thick and easy to apply. Looks great..although if it&#x27;s hot out you might find it under your eye a little smudge but it is a nice bold black and looks very chic.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. It stays on basically all day. I have oily eyelids so I was very surprised at how well it stayed. Only complaints I have is that I wish it was blacker and that the tip was a bit more moisturized. This may sound weird, but I had trouble putting it on at first because it felt like the eyeliner was dried out. However, it&#x27;s a generally good product. Especially for the price. Go for it</li>
    <li> It works pretty good for the price but feels very watery and hard for me to take off but for the price it&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
    <li> Just received it. Tried it out and I like it. I love felt tip liners. It gives me more control than other types of liners. Love the size, too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This pencil is apiles</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE eyeliner!!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of liners over the years- high end, low end... everything!  I don&#x27;t like any pencils, because they smear.  I like liquid liner, but most have whispy applicators that make it hard to get a clean, natural looking line without having to touch up!  I bought this on a whim at Walgreens for &amp;#62;$5!  It&#x27;s not intensely black like some liquid liners, which I think is a good thing, because I can layer on more for an evening look, or just one layer for daytime.  I definitely like a natural look, but this liner is versatile.  You really must give this a try!</li>
