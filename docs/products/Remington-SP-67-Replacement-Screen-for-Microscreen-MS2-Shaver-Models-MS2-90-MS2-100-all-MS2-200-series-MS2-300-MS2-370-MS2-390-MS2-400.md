### Positive Reviews

      <li>but once in the groove, they work great!</li>
      <li>It is best to have a replacement set on stand-by, so when the foils wear out, you can immeadiatly replace them and not have to wait for the replacements to arrive.</li>
      <li>Perfect for the price I paid for  it.</li>
      <li>Good!  </li>
      <li>I bought this about 2.5 years ago for my Remington razor and it is still working great.  </li>
      <li>Even so I do recommend this product and Amazon&#x27;s price was a great savings.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with this product in San Ramon, Ca</li>
      <li>Received the screen in about 4 days in good condition.  </li>
      <li>For the selling price of around $6.00 was a good buy and would recommend.  </li>
      <li>Work and fit perfectly in my electric razor that I have had for 10 plus years.</li>
      <li>This replacement screen is easy to install and is a perfect fit.....</li>
      <li>Fit was good but quality not like OEM.</li>
      <li>A perfect fit and still working great after several weeks of use.  </li>
      <li>came quickly did the job good price</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S OK...</li>
      <li>Works great and puts off buying a new one for awhile.</li>
      <li>Nice economical shaver screen set.  </li>
      <li>But I couldn&#x27;t resist saying how easy this was to get, after two stores I went to didn&#x27;t have it in stock.  </li>
      <li>makes razor good as new.</li>
      <li>I installed the replacement without any problems and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>The product seems to be just fine and is what was promised.  </li>
      <li>They basically work okay, so if you go through them quickly to begin with these should save you money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no longer available when the need comes to replace the one I have.</li>
      <li>They fit and work as required.</li>
      <li>I checked Remington&#x27;s website and no instructions were available there.  </li>
      <li>and I can now comfortably shave again.</li>
      <li>ORIGINAL &amp;#</li>
      <li>just like the original.</li>
      <li>Some Remington SP 67 replacement screens are pictured in original Remington packaging.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much that can be said, except that if fit fine.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original screen when it was new, but it works ok.</li>
      <li>I love that Goodman&#x27;s ships JUST the parts - no ridiculous excess packaging.    </li>
      <li>These are the exact remington foils that the razor originally came with.</li>
      <li>My Titanium MS2 280 is working great but the little rubber piece on the on/off button is defective and won&#x27;t stay on the razor.</li>
      <li>REALLY GET A SUPER CLEAN SHAVE, (HAVE TO GO OVER AND OVER</li>
      <li>This was worth the cost.</li>
      <li>My time is worth something.  </li>
      <li>If i angled right i could use either one and compare the results.</li>
      <li>I am feeling lucky or such. :-)</li>
      <li>Price was quite good and fair considering that they are getting hard to find locally.</li>
      <li>thanks for the swift response!</li>
      <li>have purchased Remington screens many times before and these are not the same product.</li>
      <li>The real issue, though, is why was the original screen so fragile in the first place?</li>
      <li>If you still have and use this type of facial mower, Amazon is the place to purchase replacements for a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>Does not allow blades to cut very well.</li>
      <li>I would have appreciated instructions as I forgot how to remove the ones in the Razor.</li>
      <li>My order was received very quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I replaced only one screen and compared the original with this knock off.</li>
      <li>Quality was same as original screen,</li>
      <li>If I had been able to buy both the screen and cutters together for around $13 with free shipping I would replace both at the same time, but I couldn&#x27;t find both together for less than about $18.</li>
      <li>THE HOLES LOOK A BIT SMALLER THAN THE TRUE REMINGTON SCREEN.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this as an inexpensive replacement screen.</li>
      <li>I have nothing but high praise for the product and the seller.</li>
      <li>These appear to be cheap versions of the original screens, though it may be difficult to find true OEM replacements.</li>
      <li>I would like a new rubber piece if someone can tell me how to obtain it.    </li>
      <li>do not actually include the two blades that they will cover, so be aware of that,</li>
      <li>I knew from previous reviews that this product would not come in the original manufacturer-produced packaging.  </li>
      <li>As far as performance goes, they suck.  </li>
      <li>I took the old foil out and put these in</li>
      <li>They are repackaged in a small cheap cardbord box.  </li>
      <li>but I was worried about possibly damaging my new screen as I was learning how to replace it.  </li>
      <li>it creates to much friction with the standard blades and it doesnt&#x27; cut properly.</li>

<li> Otherwise the entire razor would have been no good.</li>
<li> The knock off worked but wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave and took a little longer to get all the hairs.</li>
<li> Must keep razor pressed firmly to skin to keep the screen assembly on the razor.  </li>
<li> so I cover them with two layers of narrow strips of masking tape.</li>
<li> Why go to the store when you can add stuff like this on to your textbook orders or whatever, and it comes in a few days.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> The holes are usually on the end of the screen</li>
<li> As with a couple other customers, I also was frustrated and wasted valuable time trying to find instructions about how to replace the screens in the quickest possible way without damaging.</li>
<li> and I had to go over the same area again and again to get them to shave, very uncomfortable to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not only is the product mediocre overall, but the service is horrendous; congratulations, Remington, you manage to alienate AND anger your customers!</li>
<li> Poor snap design results in the screen assembly to not be retained on the razor.  </li>
<li> Every once and awhile it would yank a hair or two while shaving, not a big deal if you go slow but very annoying.</li>
<li> They are a bit difficult to install</li>
<li> I purchased these on December 17, 2014 and was disappointed when I received what I believe are cheep knock offs.</li>

    <li> makes razor good as new.</li>
    <li> I love that Goodman&#x27;s ships JUST the parts - no ridiculous excess packaging.    thanks for the swift response!</li>
    <li> I purchased a set of these several months ago and just got around to using them.  They don&#x27;t come in the Remington package that&#x27;s shown on the Amazon site.  They are repackaged in a small cheap cardbord box.  As far as performance goes, they suck.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price I paid for  it.</li>
    <li> The product seems to be just fine and is what was promised.  I would have appreciated instructions as I forgot how to remove the ones in the Razor.</li>
    <li> This screen just just slightly smaller then the standard screen, because of this, while it fits on the razor itself (the MS2 100 anyway) it creates to much friction with the standard blades and it doesnt&#x27; cut properly.</li>
    <li> If you still have and use this type of facial mower, Amazon is the place to purchase replacements for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> These are the exact remington foils that the razor originally came with. Work and fit perfectly in my electric razor that I have had for 10 plus years. I have nothing but high praise for the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Very simply it worked.  I took the old foil out and put these in and I can now comfortably shave again.</li>
    <li> Some Remington SP 67 replacement screens are pictured in original Remington packaging.  The Remington manual says that screen installation information would come in the package.  The screen I ordered was pictured in Remington packaging but it came in a small blank box with no installation instructions.  I checked Remington&#x27;s website and no instructions were available there.  I tried to contact Remington through their site about instructions but got no response.  So, I had to figure it out myself which was doable but I was worried about possibly damaging my new screen as I was learning how to replace it.  I later found a reference on the web which implied that Remington was no longer making replacement screens so no matter where you buy your screen, you&#x27;ll need to figure out how to do the replacement!</li>
    <li> As with a couple other customers, I also was frustrated and wasted valuable time trying to find instructions about how to replace the screens in the quickest possible way without damaging. It is unbelievable that the company does not provide basic instructions. Not only is the product mediocre overall, but the service is horrendous; congratulations, Remington, you manage to alienate AND anger your customers!</li>
    <li> Have been a Remington Electric Shaver user for over 20 years.  The foils and blades wear out over time,so they need to be replaced. My replacement schedule is every  year to 2 years, they need to be replace.  The foils simply wear out with use and develop holes which will alert you with some discomfort and pain to your face. It is best to have a replacement set on stand-by, so when the foils wear out, you can immeadiatly replace them and not have to wait for the replacements to arrive.</li>
    <li> Screens were bent &amp; came apart when I attempted to install.</li>
    <li> I knew from previous reviews that this product would not come in the original manufacturer-produced packaging.  When I received it this was in fact the case.  However, the replacement screens appear to be identical in all respects to the ones on my current electric shaver with the exception that the end tabs are a slightly different shade of gray.  The descriptive information stated that the product would be shipped in about six days but I received it two days later.</li>
    <li> Poor snap design results in the screen assembly to not be retained on the razor.  Must keep razor pressed firmly to skin to keep the screen assembly on the razor.  Recommend purchasing a different razor in the future</li>
    <li> This was a screen I needed for my razor. There isn&#x27;t much that can be said, except that if fit fine.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e been using this Remington replacement screen for years for female facial and chin hair, but holes eventually appear in the screen and the blades scratch my face even though I always keep the screen cover on for protection. The screen needs to be replaced periodically. The holes are usually on the end of the screen so I cover them with two layers of narrow strips of masking tape. Works great and puts off buying a new one for awhile. Even so I do recommend this product and Amazon&#x27;s price was a great savings.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with this product in San Ramon, Ca</li>
    <li> This was worth the cost. Otherwise the entire razor would have been no good. Product arrived promptly and lived up to its expectation. Quality was same as original screen,</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the original screen when it was new, but it works ok.</li>
    <li> Why go to the store when you can add stuff like this on to your textbook orders or whatever, and it comes in a few days.  My time is worth something.  But I couldn&#x27;t resist saying how easy this was to get, after two stores I went to didn&#x27;t have it in stock.  (Speaking of stock, I should diclose that I am a shareholder of Amazon, the world&#x27;s largest internet retailer).</li>
    <li> Fit was good but quality not like OEM. Rough.</li>
    <li> A perfect fit and still working great after several weeks of use.  i highly recommend this as an inexpensive replacement screen.</li>
    <li> My Titanium MS2 280 is working great but the little rubber piece on the on/off button is defective and won&#x27;t stay on the razor. I would like a new rubber piece if someone can tell me how to obtain it.    [...]</li>
    <li> Comes in a little white box, and appears to be something that its not. Its like ordering a steak medallion and getting something the size of an actual medallion.</li>
    <li> My husband did not like this screen.  He said it does not shave as closely as the Remington Brand (still felt stuble after shaving).  We can&#x27;t find the Remington Brand in the stores anymore, so thought we would give this one a try.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get with an after market brand.</li>
    <li> These are the same foils your electric shaver came with.&lt;br /&gt;They do not actually include the two blades that they will cover, so be aware of that, but if your foils break while the blades remain sharp, this replacement will get you back in business while sparing your bank account.</li>
    <li> Not the retail packaging. Bought one previously that didn&#x27;t last too long. Do not know if these are OEM.</li>
    <li> We ordered this screen but when it came, it was dented and smashed due to the lack of protective packaging. Customer support called and offered a replacement.  The replacement came and this time was well protected. I will always turn to this company when I need products they have.</li>
    <li> These blades are a knock off, don&#x27;t expect the same results as a Remington product. The holes the hair goes through is not as big as the Remington screens and it seems to be made out of a different type of metal. I replaced only one screen and compared the original with this knock off. If i angled right i could use either one and compare the results. The knock off worked but wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave and took a little longer to get all the hairs. Every once and awhile it would yank a hair or two while shaving, not a big deal if you go slow but very annoying. I wouldnt recommend unless your strapped for cash</li>
    <li> Received the screen in about 4 days in good condition.  For the selling price of around $6.00 was a good buy and would recommend.  If I had been able to buy both the screen and cutters together for around $13 with free shipping I would replace both at the same time, but I couldn&#x27;t find both together for less than about $18.</li>
    <li> I installed the replacement without any problems and it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Parts are the correct items. They fit and work as required. Price was quite good and fair considering that they are getting hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> I purchased these on December 17, 2014 and was disappointed when I received what I believe are cheep knock offs. They pulled whiskers out of my chin when I shaved with them and I had to go over the same area again and again to get them to shave, very uncomfortable to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased Remington screens many times before and these are not the same product.</li>
    <li> Nice economical shaver screen set.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> came quickly did the job good price</li>
    <li> Get &#x27;em, Got &#x27;em, Good!  They are a bit difficult to install but once in the groove, they work great!</li>
    <li> One of the two included shaving heads arrived crushed, one shaving foil was folded. I took the two whole parts and discarded the two broken ones. As I needed only one shaver head  I am feeling lucky or such. :-)</li>
    <li> It works like a razor should</li>
    <li> Does not allow blades to cut very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2.5 years ago for my Remington razor and it is still working great.  Thinking of getting another just in case it&#x27;s no longer available when the need comes to replace the one I have.</li>
    <li> This replacement screen is easy to install and is a perfect fit.....just like the original. The real issue, though, is why was the original screen so fragile in the first place?</li>
    <li> These appear to be cheap versions of the original screens, though it may be difficult to find true OEM replacements. They basically work okay, so if you go through them quickly to begin with these should save you money.</li>
    <li> My order was received very quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband needed to rejuvinate his razor.</li>
    <li> SCREEN, IT&#x27;S GENERIC...IT&#x27;S OK...&lt;br /&gt;NOT ORIGINAL &amp;#34;REMINGTON&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T REALLY GET A SUPER CLEAN SHAVE, (HAVE TO GO OVER AND OVER AREAS)...THE HOLES LOOK A BIT SMALLER THAN THE TRUE REMINGTON SCREEN.&lt;br /&gt;NOT PAYING REMINGTON PRICES.</li>
