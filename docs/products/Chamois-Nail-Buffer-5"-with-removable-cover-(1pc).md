      <li>It work very well, and leaves a nice shine.  </li>

      <li>Shipping was fairly quick as well.</li>
      <li>left a nice sheen when used with the cream that was recommended.</li>
      <li>The cover is a nice extra too.</li>

      <li>I do and find it very beneficial and useful.  </li>
      <li>Before the advent of nail polish buffing tools covered in chamois were used to keep nails pretty.</li>

      <li>These old-fashioned nail buffers are still the best, but are almost impossible to find snymore, so I was glad to find this one at such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It accomplished nothing that I could see.</li>
      <li>THIS ONE HAD A REASONABLE PRICE</li>
      <li>Very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>The chamois is smooth and therefore doesn&#x27;t have the texture needed to properly buff.</li>
      <li>I like this buffer, but frankly I don&#x27;t have much use for the cover.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t shine your nails very well.</li>

      <li>I especially like the removable cover which keeps it clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not sure if its my nails, the buffer, or the cream, but i used to buff to high shine (compararable to clear coat) that lasted a week or more.</li>
      <li>Im wearing clear nailpolish!</li>
      <li>The cover keeps the chamois clean and protected between uses and the construction is sturdier than the other.  </li>
      <li>My nails are shiny and looks like clear nail polish.</li>
      <li>Handle is correct, easy to use as represented, and , as previously stated, it actually works!</li>
      <li>I used my store bought buffing block once and now, so far, I only need to use this buffer.</li>
      <li>Other than that I certainly recommend the product.</li>
      <li>The price is right, and I recommend it to anyone that wants to leave nail polish behind.</li>

    <li> This damn thing was a waste of money. You&#x27;re better off polishing your nails on the sidewalk</li>
    <li> left a nice sheen when used with the cream that was recommended.</li>
    <li> This is not crappy quality. Maybe some people got faulty ones but i really love it and it works great with Super Nail Buffing Cream! Purchase both for excellent results for shiny nails..Im not kidding people actually think Im wearing clear nailpolish!</li>
    <li> good buffer. Nice quality chamois</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buffing my nails for years - a tradition handed down in my family.  This buffer ain&#x27;t the best.  The chamois is smooth and therefore doesn&#x27;t have the texture needed to properly buff. The padding is hard, not cushioned as it should be. Would not buy again. However, the pink handle is pretty and maybe the cover has some use, but other than that the buffer has little use.</li>
    <li> It works exactly how I had hoped. Shipping was fairly quick as well. The only issue I have, and is not with the product itself is the shipping charges. It doubled the cost of the item and it became about the same price as I could buy it in the store. Other than that I certainly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> This is what a real buffer should look like.&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it has a cover to protect the chamois.&lt;br /&gt;Get your buffer cream and shine your nails with This buffer.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a lovely shine.</li>
    <li> too hard and the material does not feel like chamois rather some type of fabric.  i have an ancient one i believe by revlon that i wanted to replace, however it still does a better job than this one.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 buffers and prefer this one.  The cover keeps the chamois clean and protected between uses and the construction is sturdier than the other.  This should last a few years.  I consider this good value.</li>
    <li> Buffer gives almost as good of a shine as clear polish! Nice product.  Use daily with nail cream.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly and just as the picture claimed. I will save lots of money doing this at home. I get the same great results</li>
    <li> This one is sturdy and seems to be working well. I especially like the removable cover which keeps it clean.</li>
    <li> I realized sometime ago that the thumb nail that I tend to rub against my clothes or the chair arm while I read was shiny and the ridges had smoothed out. In that aha moment I realized that I had been doing some serious buffing on that thumb nail,but I have nine other fingers with ridges and no shine. Before the advent of nail polish buffing tools covered in chamois were used to keep nails pretty. I have the antique manicure set to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not find what I wanted at the only pharmacy I visit (the grocery store).  So, I took my dull ridged fingers to my iPad for a visit to Amazon where I found this buffer. I love it. I used my store bought buffing block once and now, so far, I only need to use this buffer. It&#x27;s a great way to fidget for the good of my nails and I don&#x27;t need polish, or special buffing creams. I highly recommend this buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found Czech crystal nail files. You will not believe the difference!</li>
    <li> Very reasonably priced and work as well or better than others that I have tried. Would recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> If I could give 0 stars I would.  Lousy material.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, practical item.</li>
    <li> Tried using this with a nail buffing polish. It accomplished nothing that I could see. The buffing blocks with 3 types of surfaces work much better. Not sure what someone would use this for. May work well with shoe polish.....but that is not what it was meant for.</li>
    <li> This did not perform as I hoped it would. I couldn&#x27;t see where it buffed my nails at all. My opinion: Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap so I thought I would take a chance on it but to my surprise it has been doing a great job. My nails are shiny and looks like clear nail polish. My nails look really healthy also. Great buy. :)</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for--leaves a nice shine and easy to hold!</li>
    <li> This is great.  I like using a chamois buffer, better than those plastic things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m told these aren&#x27;t used any more.  I do and find it very beneficial and useful.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Works good. Great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  However, I gave it 4 stars only because I thought the chamois could have been a little bit thicker, like my previous one.  This is a hard-to-find item in stores and am pleased I could find it online.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alternative to fingernail polish and this chamois buffer with nail wax is a perfect solution for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Very sturdy.  Easy to use and handle.  The chamois is of excellent quality.  The cover is an extra added bonus. Would definitely buy again, if needed.  Very pleased with this purchase and sellers response in getting it to me in a timely manner. Perfect.</li>
    <li> its a well made buffer, but the cushion is harder than some others i&#x27;ve tried. also, i used it with buffing cream and it gunked up pretty quickly. Not sure if its my nails, the buffer, or the cream, but i used to buff to high shine (compararable to clear coat) that lasted a week or more. i&#x27;m only getting a dull shine with this.</li>
    <li> It buffs the nails to a sheen. I like it and it has a cover for the chamois.</li>
    <li> Was not pleased at all with this buffer. Was so happy to receive this in the mail only to have it missing chunks of material after the first use.</li>
    <li> ...like the cover , like the handle , the chamois is some gross material...</li>
    <li> Works well and lasts a long time. Buffs nail to a nice polished look. I would recommend these to my friends.</li>
    <li> This nail buffer was exactly what I was looking for.  The buff head actually works, and more than once in a row.  Handle is correct, easy to use as represented, and , as previously stated, it actually works!</li>
    <li> These old-fashioned nail buffers are still the best, but are almost impossible to find snymore, so I was glad to find this one at such a reasonable price. The cover is a nice extra too.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shine your nails very well.</li>
    <li> did not work as well as one purchased in a beauty shop</li>
    <li> This is a good buffer for your nails. with the lid it will stay clean. I love your item you sent me.</li>
    <li> works best with buffing cream makes your nails beautful and hardly any effort&lt;br /&gt;i tried it and really am pleased</li>
    <li> It work very well, and leaves a nice shine.  I prefer it over using regular nail polish.  The price is right, and I recommend it to anyone that wants to leave nail polish behind.</li>
    <li> Item delivered as promised.  Works great with buffing cream and I am using this nail buffer in between visits to the manicurist salon.</li>
    <li> Multiple times a day I have to cut or file a split or peeling nail. Since I started buffing every other day for the past week I have only had to trim a nail a couple of times. It has also made my nail beds appear pinker and the tips whiter which I think is from increased circulation.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. Revived it on time. :) . Like it . It dose the job for buffing.</li>
    <li> I like this buffer, but frankly I don&#x27;t have much use for the cover.  Since I use with a cream to shine my nails, they get dirty and only last me a couple of weeks.  The regular is somewhat thicker than this one (the one you can buy as an add-on).  But if you don&#x27;t use cream, this one will last you quite a bit.</li>
    <li> works well buffs nails but is a bit smaller (maybe 2/3 smaller) than it looks.  To get 5&amp;#34; you have to measure the curves.  No problem though the item works just dandy.</li>
    <li> This nail buffer is best used with that little jar of clay you put on your fingernails for maximum shine.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well with the nail buffing cream I bought. Highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these buffers.  They are very hard and hurt my cuticles.  I don&#x27;t use them anymore.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT WITH A COVER THIS ONE HAD A REASONABLE PRICE SO LOOK CARE FULLY FOR PRICE ON IT EM</li>
    <li> Would give zero stars if possible, chamois piece is a piece of crap!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how good this is and the price was extremely reasonable.</li>
