      <li>colors are easy to match with the skin.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t budge once it&#x27;s set.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a free lance make-up artist trying to find a much more cheaper way of buying products without the quality being cheap.</li>

      <li>I normally use the L&#x27;Oréal True Match concealer crayon, and I find this palette to be just as good in quality if not a little better.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a better applicator other than that it was good.</li>
      <li>It is good for beginners and above.</li>
      <li>a full time student, mom and have a job.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> its not so good but since has darker shades good for contouring ..so i will say if u looking something v good than not this</li>
    <li> excellent quality product</li>
    <li> works great on my skin</li>
    <li> This is the only one star I&#x27;ve written as of yet. This thing is AWFUL. I expected a creamy consistency with full coverage. As others have pointed out, it&#x27;s extremely oily with very very little pigmentation. Since the good reviews outweighed the bad, I decided to give it a try. I won&#x27;t be doing that again. There is no sense in spending any money on this product. It&#x27;s absolutely worthless.</li>
    <li> My mom was really excited!!</li>
    <li> Comes wit damage other than that it&#x27;s really useful fr me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the colors</li>
    <li> WORST EVER !&lt;br /&gt;The product does not work the colors look nice but dont stay and come out a gross weird color&lt;br /&gt;Hate it.</li>
    <li> This makeup is terrible. Like others I received 2 eyeshadow applicators instead of the concealer brush.  I Only gave 2 stars bc of the one pink corrector. Do not waste ur $ or time for shipment.</li>
    <li> Pigmentation varies per color and made me break out like a mad man. Depending on your skin type I&#x27;m sure it could be okay, but my skin is in awful condition now. Good for contouring.</li>
    <li> My wife is expecting this because she wants to know if she could add more colour in a cheap way to my daughter&#x27;s make up. This cart is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> I was nervous that this would arrive melted, however it arrived totally intact! I have to say, I AM SO PLEASED. It is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t budge once it&#x27;s set. I can see it being a problem if you don&#x27;t wash your face regularly but the only makeup I haven&#x27;t had to say that about is Neutrogena skin clearing foundation.  Overall 10/10.</li>
    <li> ordered this for a friend and she says she loves how natural it looks on her</li>
    <li> i really like this pallette very convenient. colors are easy to match with the skin. the brush is perfect. im happy</li>
    <li> the pots keep popping out of the palate its made very poorly</li>
    <li> Good product is a concealer that makes you get the perfect tone.really covers up those saggy eye bags because it is a concealer palette not eye shadows people I emphasize this  because , I also tought it was an eye shadow pallette(big mistake) but dont regret buying it because man do I need it .So great conceler have nothing bad to say about it, thats why I gave it a 5.</li>
    <li> I liked the design, the color was exactly as I thought it was, I am satisfied with the product and quality is what I wanted thanks</li>
    <li> This product works really well. Now, is it better than any high end stuff? No. But that wasn&#x27;t expected. It&#x27;s amazing for the price. The concealer is very creamy and has light to medium coverage. It&#x27;s a great product. The only downfall for me was that (like it said) it took a long time to deliver. However, I ended up getting it nine days before the initial delivery date. I was supposed to get it between January 30th and February 18th. I got it on January 21st. Only one concealer had a small crack in it, but once I rubbed my finger over it, it was gone. The palette didn&#x27;t come with the concealer brush pictured. It came with two, small eyeshadow brushes (The foam kind you might get in a beginner eyeshadow kit) That was a bit disappointing, but it&#x27;s not like I was going to use that small concealer brush anyways. Overall, the product is very good, and definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> The concealer is really tacky and hard to put on. The color palate is okay. Some of them will never be used.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I wish it had a better applicator other than that it was good. The powder was creamy and I have a variety of colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Excellent product 100% recommend five star well deserved ....</li>
    <li> good afternoon I arrive in good condition is beautiful&#x27;m happy I will apply to makeup for the night .. thanks diay</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Wide range of colors so it&#x27;s great for a starting out MUA. Darker shades are great for contouring while the lighter shades are excellent for highlighting. The mint, orange, salmon and yellow are great neutralizing discoloration in the skin. The only complaint that I have is that it came with two eyeshadow applicators instead of a double ended concealer brush. Also some of the shades are smaller but that can seen in the picture. All in all great product!</li>
    <li> This is a decent product, well worth the money.  A great starter product for fun with kids, and more serious makeups.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product!! No problems at all with anything!</li>
    <li> it is a good product, great for begginers and its small enough to take it on a long trip. amazing!</li>
    <li> I love playing in makeup and this concealer palette is wonderful, I&#x27;m not a MUA AT ALL but I love to play as if I am,a nd this is great to learn how to conceal, highlight, contour, and color correct. Great product awesome price.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price although watch it with your face it gives you a reaction probably because its more like a face paint quality. Does give you results. Compares to not many starter kits in a bad way. But its worth the money if you wanna learn. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend MUA to purchase it though.</li>
    <li> This product is great!!!!I highily reccomend this product. Very nice for the price. The concealers are creamy and a fair amount of pigmentation the delivery is enh</li>
    <li> I just used my new compact concealer, it gave a bad chemical reaction my face turn red and started to itch, and immediately my face started to get swollen. I don&#x27;t recommend the this make up.</li>
    <li> None of the colors really matched my skin tone so I&#x27;ll have to experiment with mixing later. I have light skin but thought I would mention that if you have darker skin and you are buying this product there is only one really dark color... It&#x27;s pigmented but also thin so layering is needed at least in my case. For the price it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Most of the colors are not usable for women of color with medium to dark skin, the colors are ashy.</li>
    <li> Hello this product arrived defective, first is not the same product as seen in the picture is different brush they sent a brush applicator Eyebrow not for the paletta get broken, very upset with the product to get me</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shiping, tks!</li>
    <li> not what i was hoping for but it does it job</li>
    <li> I am not an expert and this kit is helping me tremendously. My skin appears so much more even than before.</li>
    <li> I recieved the palette in two weeks compared to the estimated delivery of December 4-20, and it was wrapped very well and was recieved in excellent condition. Consistency of the concealers is creamy and the colors mixed well, the small dark one works best if you want to do a bit of contouring with nose, cheeks, etc. To achieve my ideal shade I needed to mix two of the colors, that&#x27;s expected for a palette though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con was I did not recieve the dual ended concealer brush that&#x27;s shown with the palette. Instead they gave me two dual ended eyeshadow applicators. I tossed them in the garbage and used my own concealer brush, which fits perfectly in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great palette, I highly recommend it. I normally use the L&#x27;Oréal True Match concealer crayon, and I find this palette to be just as good in quality if not a little better. I will be using it everyday!</li>
    <li> no pigmentation at all.. and the colors have a white chalky undertone to it. It is also very greasy. You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Hey everyone...ok so I just got my pallette in the mail today and let me just say...This pallette is amazing! Seriously. I&#x27;m a free lance make-up artist trying to find a much more cheaper way of buying products without the quality being cheap. And this was perfect. Yes there are cons to it. But there&#x27;s a lot more pros...first my pallette arrived 3 weeks before the estimated delivery date, and the colors are so creamy and really pigmented. Some things I didn&#x27;t like is the pallette had a crack on the side of it...but for 6 bucks I can&#x27;t complain. And the colors on the corrector side are a bit different then in the picture...but other then that. It&#x27;s a pretty good pallette. Seriously buy it.</li>
    <li> Item arrives weeks sooner than the estimated time! Item is exactly what I expected! Easy to use, goes on smooth would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Gone to stores and prices are outrages couldn&#x27;t pass up on the price</li>
    <li> Worst makeup product ever.  Smells awful, doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d be good for your skin.  The colors are ridiculous, they come off completely white mostly and super greasy.  I threw it right away.  Do not purchase, waste of $7.</li>
    <li> I did not like the fact the the color presented is not the actual color. Not sure what the blue is for.</li>
    <li> The palette was a lot bigger than I thought which was a plus. The quality however was very inconsistent.  As soon as I put my ring finger or brush onto the product it immediately sunk to the bottom. It&#x27;s like a sample of concealers basically.  Some worked fine and others needed to b applied more than twice to get the desired effect. Over all it was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but for the price def. Worth purchasing</li>
    <li> This crazy cart has good price and great result. I bought it to practice how to do face contouring and I really like it. My advice is to use oil free foundation to avoid extra shine on your skin and rich moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a decent starting kit, but if you have any real interest in makeup and want to do something like contouring, just spring for the Lorac. It was actually decent at mixing custom colors, but it just has weak pigment and absolutely no lasting powder. This might be good for a portrait photographer to fix a few flaws before snapping a photo because it won&#x27;t stick beyond that.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding the right color foundation plus I like to contour with a cream before using a contour powder. I don&#x27;t have to use as much powder that way and my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dry. I wouldn&#x27;t say the lasting power is that much, but I touch my face a lot. I really like using the lighter pink for under eye corrector and blending it out into a concealer that matches my skin. I really like the outcome of this. I have to say it&#x27;s really good for under eyes. I have a few wrinkles under there and I don&#x27;t get a lot of build up with it. It&#x27;s not a challenge to get out either. I&#x27;ve used E.L.F. concealer and it&#x27;s hard to get product from the pot, no matter what you use. I don&#x27;t have that problem with this. The colors are pigmented. Especially the dark brown in the bottom right corner. I&#x27;m an ivory pigment and it&#x27;s so dark on my skin. the brown would be really good for costume makeup. I have acne and I really like using the various colors to blend in my acne. Also, it doesn&#x27;t get weird on my skin like smudging or weird caking from using different products. It mixes well with other products.</li>
    <li> I would like to point out that none of the 12 concealers matched my skin tone, I have light skin.  They were either too dark, too yellow or warm for me. They do cover blemishes pretty well. The smaller colors on the side are &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; at best. They don&#x27;t blend very well. The pinks or yellow don&#x27;t conceal my purple-blue under eyes, I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re supposed to do with the blue, it shouldn&#x27;t be for acne since you should use green. The lavender is used for sallow skin. The white would make a good base for eyeshadow. In fact, any of them would make good bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though this palette would be good for yellow or orange medium/tan or dark skin tones. The espresso brown would make a good brow color for someone with dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theae are cream concealers. They do have a greasy feel when you smudge them around on your fingers, but they are matte when applied to the face. These would do well as contour colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I would not repurchase this again for my personal use, but maybe for someone who would better fit the tones of the concealers.</li>
    <li> for concealing and highlighting,its great.It has every color for any problem,for any skin color.This is not a powderThe green for example,to cover a redness,I put the green on,powder it in.I do recommend it</li>
    <li> Love these concealers !!! I totally recommend(:!</li>
    <li> CAN APPEAR A LITTLE CHALKY ON DARKER TONES HOWEVER IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO HELP AN INSPIRING MUA TO LEARN ABOUT FOUNDATION MATCHING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten only a few good uses out of this palette so far, but so far, I love it! I do have somewhat oily skin, so I was worried about this making it worse, but so far, it&#x27;s no more oily-looking than usual. However, if you&#x27;re going for the &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; look, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this produce to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all very creamy and very easily blendable, super soft and light feeling on the skin. I&#x27;ve seen some people complain about it building up in the eye creases or smile lines, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem. Just blend it well enough and I don&#x27;t see why you would! My only complaints, however, is that I wish the palette itself was a little more sturdy, rather than the flimsy plastic, and that the brown tones were a bit darker! Other than that, I love it! Great buy, great price!</li>
    <li> Works great for concealer and for sculpting. Great price! Nice color.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Amazing product shipping was fast than I thought it would be. A lot of color choices Love it! Its a great buy!</li>
    <li> The colors are quite faint but it get&#x27;s you by when you have a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase this again though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for very light sling people it has nothing but light pink and light colors has not one dark to contour ... But I had my own dark and it did an ok job just that that it had nothing but light colors</li>
    <li> The darker colors don&#x27;t match when you put it on skin</li>
    <li> I like this concealer, The only thing is  in The small ones comes Few product. But for The Price is exellent</li>
    <li> Excellent sellers. I recommend 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neyeska.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more....the texture is very oily. The coverage was just not what I hoped. It looks better then it is.</li>
    <li> Really nice colors and a huge pallet for the price. I was a little concerned with ordering it from China, but it didn&#x27;t take longer than expected to arrive. It is good for beginners and above. They are all easily blendable and I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that this product is worth it because it really don&#x27;t cover much. I use the pink and blue concealers for my under eyes (which are not that bad) but this product didn&#x27;t do much to help me hide them.</li>
    <li> It covers all spots. Easy to use!! You can buy it and recommend it to all your friends!!! Cause it is PERFECT</li>
    <li> love it!totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> not what i expected, but it was cheap. creams smuge and are very light.</li>
    <li> when i first got this product  i loved it..well that because it was winter time and i want doing as much. now that its like 80 degrees here in cali and im a full time student, mom and have a job. ive notice with all this moving around and being out and about, this makeup dosnt last that long.. and when u sweat it tends to separate from the skin. so i still like it just have to do a couple touch up through out my day</li>
    <li> AMAZING COVERAGE. great verity of colors &amp;&#x27; amazing coverage. I love this product. I really recommend this product!! Buy it</li>
    <li> Thought I would try it since it was cheap. Very thick and smells like car chemicals.  Product comes from China.  I should have known better.</li>
    <li> Too much oli n just a waste of money.. I only used it once since I got it.. I might just gI&#x27;ve it away..</li>
    <li> Colors were much darker in the palate and it didn&#x27;t even come with the brush mentioned.</li>
    <li> I only use 4 of the big circles on the pad.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a normal white person.  So that&#x27;s 2/3rds&lt;br /&gt;of the big circles that are useless and all&lt;br /&gt;of the little ones.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;q-tip style&amp;#34; applicator I threw away&lt;br /&gt;after 5 minutes.  It fell apart.</li>
    <li> First of all, shipping was great! It came within a week, quicker than I thought it would and arrived well-packaged in bubble wrap, not one of the pots was damaged. I received a pristine product that I couldn&#x27;t wait to dig into it! As for the product itself, it is perfect for me. I have normal skin, rarely have blemishes but I do have undereye circles. I am an olive, beige tone and one of those concealer colors is my perfect match (I am an nc25 in MAC, for reference). I have not used the corrector colors (pink/purple/green) but they all have the same consistency, and the lasting power of this product is great, it stayed on all day, but I will note I use face primer (Smashbox Photo Finish) and also a great makeup setting spray (E.L.F). They were super easy to blend and I mixed the dark brown with one of the darker concealers and used it as a contour, which I set with one of my MAC bronzers. I used a lighter concealer color as a highlight on my cheeks and under my brow. The packaging is good and easy to clean, the brushes useless of course since I have a collection of great brushes to apply the product. All in all, I am super happy with these concealers AND the service, thank you!</li>
    <li> Not very good....Not for black people</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive concealer Kit. Nice range of colors and also customizable. Just what I need for my freelance mua kit. very pleased and product was as expected.</li>
    <li> I love it! Very nice and easy to apply. The darker pink is great for under eye bag and discoloration (African American). The picture has very warm tone but the colors are lighter in person but this pallet can be used on all skin tones. Blends well and very pigment and also not cakey either. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors but i wish the brush was larger, no matter I will use a larger one. the delivery was very fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Not to pigmented. Not much coverage. I need something with more coverage because I work behind the cameras and all types of skin</li>
    <li> Great product I use it for multiple things, concealing, contouring, highlighting, ect.</li>
    <li> Like this concealer pallette! The only dislike I have would be the smaller sized concealers on the right. Unfortunately the colors oxidized super quickly and now I have no use for them. But the other concealers work great and have long staying power!</li>
    <li> Not much coverage but good pigment and a lot of colors</li>
    <li> i really just bought this palette for the pink concealer ..saw it on youtube that it cover dark circles under the eye and it does..i pat it under my eye and blend in with my concealer..can you say sexy eyes..</li>
