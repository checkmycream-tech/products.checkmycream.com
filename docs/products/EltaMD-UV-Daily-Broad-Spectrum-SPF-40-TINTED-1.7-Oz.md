<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This sunscreen is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t break me out. It&#x27;s incredibly gentle, no stinging or burning sensations like with chemical sunscreens. There is no white cast, however this is due to the tint. The tint is perfect for me personally, though I have a fair skin tone. This might not work for people who are pale or have darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues wearing this under makeup. I do however have to wear an additional moisturizer if my skin is feeling dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it every day.  It has great SPF and applies smoothly without smearing.  You only have to use a teensy amount for good coverage. A tube lasts me several months, so the cost is very reasonable.  I have light light skin and have to be very careful of sun exposure and have used this product when outside for extended periods and never have burned.</li>
    <li> I referred it to my friend and she ordered it and is very happy with the sunscreen</li>
    <li> excellent replacement to expensive make up products, with the benefit of actually protecting your skin against uv.</li>
    <li> The feel is amazing, much better than all the re branded tinted sunscreen moisturizers (CC and BB cream) on the market. I recently tried the CC cream from the big &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; and it felt heavy and chalky. This is smooth and light.  Kids love it too. Buy it, you will love it. Your skin will look great.  I often mix a dab of EltaMD Melting Moisturizer just for added moisture, and glow.</li>
    <li> I really like this as the price is affordable and paula&#x27;s choice beautypedia rate it as &#x27;good&#x27;, i.e. no harsh irritating ingredients but lacks beneficial ones like antioxidants etc one needs everyday. i use a serum underneath to compensate for it. this is not very water resistant though. I am doubting the &#x27;40 mins&#x27; claim b/ the other la roche possey one i have (get this over that though) also claims 40 mins and that truly delivers without budging. this slips and slides and i dont think it ever sets. tint is good completely balances the dreadful white cast one gets from physical sunscreens. nevertheless the market for a high spf water resistant TINTED sunscreen is so poor i have settled for this for now.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause problems. Third product of the line I have used.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and have tried everything.  I really liked Bare Minerals but it was just too long of a process.  A co-worker of mine used this as her foundation and Physicians Formula as a powder and it looked really good on her so I tried this combo.  I have been using this for a couple of months and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and I have noticed that my redness has diminished as well.  This is now my only form of sunblock and foundation I wear.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some people said it makes their skin dry.  I have always put face lotion on before this so I haven&#x27;t had any dry or flaky skin at all.  It has been nothing but helpful to my skin and my rosacea.</li>
    <li> It is like creamy butter to apply to skin.  I like that it is tinted.</li>
    <li> This product has only two ingredients. My doc says that all the added chemicals in many SPFs are absorbed through your skin and harmful. It has a light tint which really just keeps it from leaving those white streaks on your face. It&#x27;s not greasy and stays on well.  I already was paying about $18 for a tube of face SPF at the drug store. It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks and it has full spectrum coverage. Love it !</li>
    <li> My daughter cannot use regular sunscreen because the ingredients irritate her skin.  This product uses natural barriers rather than chemical ones to block the sun.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Great sunblock tinted lotion. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is the best ever sunscreen I have ever tried.... It realy protects you from sun! Your skin looks perfect when you applied it! I&#x27;ve...being using it for almost 3 yrs now and I do not change it, has no oil...its perfect</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  It is easy to apply, never runs and blends well.  I also feel good about using it becaus of the SPF coverage!</li>
    <li> I was in Arizona: my sunscreen was back home in British Columbia. The winter sun was lovely, but it was playing heck with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want a different sunscreen, the sunscreen I&#x27;d forgotten at home was just right: chemical-free, lightly tinted, water resistant in the pool, and it didn&#x27;t sting my eyes when I was biking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the internet and folks at EltaMD, I received two tubes of my favourite sunscreen within a  couple of days. Great service --  and they included free samples of other skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this sunscreen whenever I can -- I&#x27;ve even given it as birthday gifts. And my calendar for next February says: Don&#x27;t Forget the EltaMD!</li>
    <li> Use this every day! Great tinted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; this is great, it comes off easy &amp; I have no problem with breakouts from it.  It goes on very easily under makeup.</li>
    <li> I use this every day as it absorbs wee enough to apply before foundation.  It prevents darkening of my light age spots.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I wear it daily as my &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; Perfect for me as it&#x27;s fairly sheer with just the right amount of coverage for day-to-day use. Water resistant but not at all greasy. Bought my 1st tube 3 years ago; just ran out and bought my 2nd tube!!!</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended.  Has helped with redness.</li>
    <li> First, my Dr. recommended this and gave me a few samples.  I really like this, its not too heavy and the tint makes it go on nice, even for a guy.  My Dermatoligist also suggested Blue Lizard, which is also good but thick &amp; not tinted.  Both do the job and thats what its all about anyway.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with protecting my face (roseacia  sp?)  but this product works miracles!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this sunblock for various reasons, but mostly, because I am allergic to chemical sunscreens. They irritate my skin and cause blotchy red spots that itch and flake for weeks. I also have mild Rosacea and sensitive/reactive skin. I read about physical sunblocks being a great choice for sensitive skin, and then started researching reviews. I decided to try this product due to it&#x27;s non-chemical active ingredients, it&#x27;s a tinted lotion, and there was large amount for the price (for a specialty facial product). This is really a skin care lotion, or at least it feels like one! I have no adverse skin reaction to it, and this is very gentle lotion sunblock. Today was the first day I used it, and I applied over my usual moisturizer. My husband noticed that my face looked a little \\&quot;dewy-er\\&quot; than usual, but otherwise could not tell I was wearing \\&quot;makeup\\&quot; so I will try without moisturizer tomorrow. I have tried a sample of a different physical sunblock that was green-tinted, and while it helped color correct the rosacea-affected areas of my face, it made the non-red parts look ghostly and washed out. This has a nice sheer tint that I thought would be too dark for my very fair complexion as it came out of the tube, but it blends into my skin invisibly, and gives me a soft wash of gentle color while calming the appearance of the red parts. As for the sunblock properties, I beleive it does an excellent job. I was driving with my husband in the afternoon and the sun was shining in just beyond the reach of the visor and directly onto the side of my face. I could feel my ear getting warm, but absolutely no burning sensation on the rest of my face where there is sunblock. I would highly recommend this physical sunblock to anyone with sensitive skin who wants a great value of UVA &amp; UVB protection in a gentle, lightweight, tinted lotion.</li>
    <li> I would give it 10 stars if the rating existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started having an allergic reaction to the chemical sunscreen in my moisturizer that left with me a bad, stingy rash and raised skin, especially when I sweat during a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist gave me a few samples of elta and after a couple of days I knew this was the stuff for me. No reactions at all and goes on really well. Also, it protects against both uv rays because of titanium and zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical because of the tint, but it actually helps even out skin tone and it&#x27;s not thick at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed with this product. As other reviewers indicate, it&#x27;s best to apply it and wait about 5-10 minutes to put moisturizer on (dermatologist recommended put sunscreen on first). I&#x27;ve been trying Caudalie Vinosource moisturizer (no sunscreen in it - very hard to find a day moisturizer that does not have sunscreen these days) and at the end of the day, even after a workout, the skin looks good, not too oily. It does not feel like a sunscreen at all. I&#x27;m really pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does give your skin a certain \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; quality as others said. Also, there&#x27;s a very faint \\&quot;smell of sunscreen\\&quot; that disappears after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product. I&#x27;m never going back to chemical sunscreens or moisturizers that contain them. Love elta.</li>
    <li> I like it especially because it has never burned my eyes, even-though I sweat. It cost less here then at the dermatologist office.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many chemical free sunscreens, and they all seem to have the same problem. Your face is left looking a slightly unnatural, chalky color. This sunscreen was the same. It is also very drying, so I would only recommend it to those with oily skin. However, on a positive note, I have very acne-prone skin and this product did not cause break outs.</li>
    <li> Amazing! By far the best SPF I have tried. I thought the tint was going to be too dark for my fair skin at first, but it blends perfectly-- so well in fact, that I&#x27;m able to use it in place of foundation. I am a lifer.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great if you have oily skin. Every titanium based sunscreen I have tried left me looking like the guy in the movie \\&quot;Powder\\&quot;. I sweat alot and the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t run off my face. The only possible downside is the sunscreen is tinted and being a guy it freaked me out at first, but I&#x27;m really pale so it actually gives me some much needed color. The color looks really natural and not like makeup at all.</li>
    <li> A bit drying for my skin (I guess I&#x27;m no longer combo?) but I love the fact that it was tinted and formulated for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  Found it here for less. Only used a few times so far, but like it that it has a tint, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product for several reasons. It is unscented, tinted, SPF 41, does not feel oily on my face and it doesn&#x27;t give a heavy feel like some makeup can. I plan to buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My sister has been using this product for a long time and has sworn by it, so I tried it and absolutely love it! I have extremely sensitive skin and use retin a, which sometimes causes sunscreens to feel irritating to my skin, but this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> works great, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product at a spa and instantly was wowed. Enough that i shelled out for the full size deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elta MD UV Physical SPF 41 is one of my top sunscreens because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it&#x27;s tinted with a good pigment level, saving you a valuable layering step in the moisturizer + foundation+ sunblock routine, and it&#x27;s neutral in shade. I vary between MAC NC 15-30 and i can totally wear this as tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) it&#x27;s matte and oil-absorbent---even if you have dry flakes, it won&#x27;t exacerbate them--i have retinol-treated skin which flakes like crazy, and this formula actually helps flakes ADHERE to the skin so you&#x27;re not peeling like a monster midday. i have fresh-as-a-daisy skin even at 5pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3), it&#x27;s long-wearing, most likely due to the absorbency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) it&#x27;s zinc and titanium sunblock at spf 40! how much better can you get, esp. with all the furor over chemical sunblocks. Quite simply, it&#x27;s a much better alternative to my previous HG of tinted spfs, MD Skincare by Dennis Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical sunblocks are the way to go. I&#x27;ll be wearing this all summer as my foundation + sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use daily and have stopped using coverup makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years now. Was originally recommended to me by a co-worker who received it from her dermatologist.I love the tint and the consistency. When I&#x27;m having &amp;#34;good skin days&amp;#34;, I can get away with wearing it as a light coverage foundation. It helps even out the skin tone and decrease redness. Also works great under additional make-up or powder.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; the fact that it&#x27;s 40+ SPF is a big deal to me. I wont use under 30 SPF as I am very fair and redheaded (skin cancer runs in the family).</li>
    <li> Terrific product!  Effective and does not clog pores.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  Feels weightless, has a nice light tint that allows me to go without makeup on casual summer pool/beach days and doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s a little tip that can save you some $$ - once you think the tube is empty cut it open and scoop out what&#x27;s left inside.  I get at least another week&#x27;s worth by doing this.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this stuff.  It covers perfectly and makes the skin look flawless. Good for my porcelain skin color.</li>
    <li> Nice color, good texture, doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes! It doesn&#x27;t smell funny. Provides good coverage and it&#x27;s almost like wearing a very light sheer foundation. I pat a little bit of foundation powder on top and good to go.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It took me 4 months to realize that this was giving me the worst acne of my life. After 4 months of crazy breakouts I was desperate to clear my skin, so I bought a Proactiv kit to tend to the acne. I never use a toner and Proactiv comes with toner. I had no idea that this sunscreen was so difficult to remove. I had layers on my face from months of not getting it all off. It took me 7 cotton pads with toner to remove all of this sunscreen after washing my face with Proactiv. Imagine months of build-up that was being layered on my face. Yikes! I used the sunscreen the next day (the very last time) so I could wash with the Dove Soap to test out my theory. Yikes again!! It took 6 cotton pads with toner to remove the sunscreen after washing my face. The acne that I have is like no other in my life. Hundreds of clogged pores. Seriously! My skin feels much cleaner and smoother from just 2 days of NOT using this sunscreen. This acne is going to take time to heal. This sunscreen was a complete nightmare. I really hope I don&#x27;t scar.</li>
    <li> I was expecting and hoping that this sunblock would be clear, instead of the tan color it has.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Hold Your Breath... Still waiting for my order to ship from DERMAdoctor. I placed my order on 04/28/11, and it is now 05/22/2011. I love the product, but I am very disappointed in the service from DERMAdoctor. I will have to find another source. Amazon: please do the same. I am out of the product now and have to find another source plus use something else in the mean time. Very very disappointed in this seller.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Works with just about any skin tone.  Lasts all day. All my friends now use this as a moisturizer and a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Wow, the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried! First of all, it is a physical sunscreen, so it just stays on your skin without getting absorbed in your skin, which is much safer than chemical sunscreen. And this is the only physical sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that does not leave white residue. It has a nice tint to it, too. I&#x27;ve also worked out while wearing this on my face, and it does NOT sting my eyes when the sweat gets into my eyes. Very happy with this sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> I like the tinted sunscreen for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation. Especially nice for when you are at the beach and need a little coverage without looking made up. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately the tint mixed with the SPF left an intense white yet pinkish sheen on my olive skin. No amount of rubbing would blend this product into my skin. While it did not work for me, I do believe that it might work really well on those with lighter skin complexions or cooler undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although more expensive, I found that the Josie Maran Argan Oil SPF 47 blends in beautifully and has the same two main ingredients that I look for: Zinc and Titanium Dioxide.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It does not irritate my sensitive skin and it makes your skin look nice, even and not so pale. My only complaint is that it is a little hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 3 years now. Love how it protects my face from aging rays of sun. Last year and this year we used it at the beach and we did not get one spot of sunburn.</li>
    <li> This is a great lightweight cream that provides strong protection but still gives you a natural look. With the tint, I now don&#x27;t need to apply foundation, so it&#x27;s been great for my skin, especially during summer.</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock.  Blends nicely.</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this brand until my mother introduced me to it. Mom always reminds me to wear sunscreen EVERY DAY, and given that she looks amazing for her age, I follow her advice religiously. I have tried so many different tinted moisturizers with SPF, but I never could find one that didn&#x27;t make me look oily, or didn&#x27;t smell funny, or didn&#x27;t contain nasty chemical sunscreens, or didn&#x27;t break me out....until this one! To me, this product is so much more than just a sunscreen. After cleansing, I just apply this using my fingers and then I finish with a light dusting of mineral powder, and my skin looks amazing. I will never go back to those cakey foundations. This makes you look completely natural, like you have no makeup on, except that your skin looks flawless. It is tinted, and at first I was concerned that it would be too dark for my fair skin, but it blended right in. My mom has medium skin tone and it works equally well on her, so it seems to suit a wide range of skin tones. And even though it&#x27;s tinted, I should also point out that this works great for men too - my husband uses it all the time, and you can&#x27;t tell that he has anything on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price considering that it&#x27;s a 3oz tube, and most of the products I&#x27;ve gotten from the drugstore are about half the size of this and not significantly cheaper. So you get a lot of product for the money. One tube lasts me almost a year.</li>
    <li> Light weight coverage with sunscreen</li>
    <li> Only sunscreen I&#x27;ll use on my face. I&#x27;ve had multiple dermatologists recommend this product and I can&#x27;t imagine ever using something else. The tint is really good and I don&#x27;t need make-up when I use it. Sometimes I&#x27;ll just put on concealer, blush/bronzer, and mascara and I&#x27;m good to go. It never causes breakouts. It is light and definitely not oily. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like the product from a sunscreen perspective... it seems to black the sun very well which is what I am looking for on my face.  ON the other hand, it seems like since I started using it I have been breaking out more.  I can&#x27;t tell if this is from the product or just a coincidence (hormones etc.).  If it is NOT causing breakouts, I would give it a 5, but because I am pretty sure it is, I am giving it a 3.  Although everyone has different skin and mine is sensitive and prone to breakouts with many products.</li>
    <li> Oily skin folks:  buy this one!!  No weird scent.  Sheer.  Don&#x27;t forget your hands!</li>
    <li> Non-irritating with a  small amount of tinted coverage. Works well on men because of this (no white caste unless you have very dark skin). Not the best consistency (could be more pigmented and feature a smoother application) but very gentle on sensitive skin. If you are a makeup user, works well under foundation or powder. If you are a make-up user seeking a shine-free, smooth, one-step type of BB cream, I recommend MD Solarsciences over this one.</li>
    <li> I happened to find this product when looking for the Elta MD Daytime sunscreen-moisturizer.  I love this product but don&#x27;t use it under makeup.  Instead I use it alone when I don&#x27;t want to apply foundation.  It&#x27;s not a good moisturizer like the Elta Daytime, however.  When applied it stays on all day, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying all my sunscreen products on Amazon now, as they have the best prices, and they deliver to my door, which is great when you have a busy life!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist highly recommended this facial moisturizer. She uses it also. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d get the tinted again b/c it would rub off on a white top, but then again, it&#x27;s nice to put it on as a base if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have skin that is easy to cover. I just stop at my jaw line if I&#x27;m wearing a high neck, light collared top. It feels nice and light and goes on smoothly. I will buy this again. It&#x27;s a good product and has the zinc and titanium that&#x27;s really imperative...and I trust her.</li>
    <li> love the product! it&#x27;s so easy to apply and blend like make up. i don&#x27;t have to use liquid foundation after using this. it&#x27;s not greasy and invisible after applying. i would recommend for everyone!</li>
    <li> I use it daily, simply amazing.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreens that has ZINC in it!  A fabulous product</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. My Dermatologist&#x27;s Spa recommended this product, saying a physical UV barrier would be better protection for my skin. I used a couple of small sample packs they gave me and I thought it was nice - so I bought this. Amazon has a much better price than buying from the Spa. While the product went on well and looked great under my Bare Minerals powder foundation, after a few days use, it dried my skin out terribly, leaving my face sore and covered with burning, flaking red splotches. I also found it very hard to remove. So, if you have sensitive skin - beware!</li>
    <li> Amazing light tint and perfect coverage&lt;br /&gt;Never oily&lt;br /&gt;Will always use&lt;br /&gt;A cheaper drug store product cannot compare to it. They are orange and oily.&lt;br /&gt;Plus this SPF is better</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen/make-up for summer or any time. Recommended by my dermatologist.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I actually really like this sunscreen.  I would use it only on my face because it is tinted.  I don&#x27;t usually wear any makeup at all, and this provides a subtle, light coverage.  I have skin that could be labelled &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;.  Not ivory and not beige.  This tint is transparent enough that it looks good on me.  If skin were &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34;, you might notice a darkening of your skin.  If skin were much darker than &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34;, you might notice that it looks a bit chalky (a lightening effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to it&#x27;s sun-protectant properties....  It works really well.  I actually get hives from most sunscreens, and I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one.  My skin is very sun sensitive--I burn after a 15 minute walk on a sunny day.  This provides protection to me for at least a few hours outside without reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my body, I use EltaMD 47 UV Pure Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen.  It works just as well, and it isn&#x27;t tinted.  I don&#x27;t think the texture is quite as nice as the facial, tinted cream.</li>
    <li> my fave facial sunblock ,love the tint to the cream</li>
    <li> Extremely drying for my skin. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Meets minimum requirement .</li>
    <li> This a tinted suncreen, not greasy -goes on smooth and it acts as a light foundation on my face and hands after laser treatment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now, daily. My dermatologist sold some to me because she wanted me to start wearing sunscreen everyday to protect my pale, sunburn-prone skin. I don&#x27;t wear makeup because I don&#x27;t feel the need to and I also dislike the feeling of it. However, I do want some sort of coverage to even out my skin tone during the day. This sunscreen provides just that! It makes my skin look less white while still matching my color. It protects my face well, especially in the water, as I am a swimmer. If you&#x27;re going to be outside all day (e.g. in the summer) I recommend that this sunscreen is applied at least 15-20 minutes before sun exposure and reapplied at least every two hours (just as the bottle says). If you use it in good amounts, not too much but not too little, it should be able to last you up to at least half a year. Great, great product!</li>
    <li> This product goes on easy and clean. No grease whatsoever. Highly recommend. A great alternative to foundation. My dermatologist recommended it and I never looked back.</li>
    <li> I have never experienced breakouts at all from this product (I&#x27;m in my forties and I have dry skin). I have tried every physical sunblock available, and none are as nice as this one. Starting around 1993, the only thing available was Neutrogena \\&quot;Chemical Free\\&quot; (later renamed to \\&quot;Sensitive Skin\\&quot;). I used that one for years, and never really found a suitable substitute until I stumbled across Elta MD physical about a year ago. I much prefer Elta MD because it is tinted (no white caste) and the consistency makes it easy to distribute evenly. I love this sunscreen and highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My latest tube seems a shade lighter, but I could just be imagining it. Has anyone else noticed that? It still works fine for me, because I have very fair skin.</li>
    <li> My Dr. recommended this product and I love it.  Not greasy!</li>
    <li> This product provides just enough coverage without feeling heavy or greasy, it actually feels better than many moisturizers on my skin.  Blends beautifully, covers well, I&#x27;ve stopped wearing foundation with this product. I will be using this for as long as they continue to make it!</li>
    <li> Best UV protection ever!  I can definitely tell a differnce in my skin.  I&#x27;ve changed to many Elta Items. Love em all.</li>
    <li> I like that this product provides a good physical barrier with a natural color (not white) zinc/titanium blend, but this is really heavy on the face.  It looks fabulous on very smooth skin, but if you have any imperfections, it will crease and look shiny.  I don&#x27;t know if this would work for people of color since it&#x27;s a buff color.</li>
    <li> I gave this product three stars because it will stain your shirts! Otherwise, its a great product especially for acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I was turned onto this product by my 5th avenue dermatologist as I was complaining about how shiny my skin was all of the time and the fact that my makeup was slipping off of my face every day through every season.  This product not only protects my skin from the sun but it has totally replaced my foundation and tinted moisturizer.  This goes on easy, matches all skin tones and I can last the whole day withoout any shine, including after a workout (if I didn&#x27;t get to remove my makeup beforehand).  Also, when purchased on Amazon and not at my Dr, this product is totally affordable and less than any foundation I have ever purchased.  I even turned my friends onto this product.  One of them is a light skinned African American and she can wear it as well - even the same color that I put on and I have fair skin and blue eyes.  She also threw out all of her other foundation products away.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with oily skin who also is active as the physical formula is good for sweat as well and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> This is a great zinc oxide and titanium dioxide sunblock with just enough color that you are not left looking ghostly.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.  Worked for me.  Not heavy with a light tint to protect you from the suns harmful rays.  For me it was easy to remove.  Then I used one swipe of my toner.  No extra cleaning need or residue left on my face. Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> my favorite skin care and best price here.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this sunblock after all the great reviews but I was disappointed. It left my tan skin with a hideous powdery looking white cast (even my husband noticed I look pale and this man wouldn&#x27;t even notice if I shaved my hair off). It also dried out my already dry skin. However, when I put it on it was a smooth application and didn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Overall, I would recommend this to a pale person with oily or combo skin.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, non-greasy and super light. Loses 1 star only because they don&#x27;t offer (can&#x27;t easily find) other color tones, I think this lightens up my natural Latina tones a bit...luckily it&#x27;s not super noticeable.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors and I faithfully use this product every day.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup but need the sun protection and moisturizing this product offers - plus it helps even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Great value and this size lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist after a photo therapy treatment (3).  I never really understood how important a sunscreen was.  Well now at 43, I am wearing this everyday.  The tinted version even allows me to avoid wearing base make up.  (I put a little on under eye my eyes).  I have ver fair skin and it seems to blend just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on so smooth it feels like a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Like the package size (tube).  didn&#x27;t realize it was TINTED!  still good UV protection and creamy, non greasy.  would buy again</li>
    <li> I love it. It is perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I do love this product. The coverage is fantastic, nice subtle tint. I like te fact that it&#x27;s a sunscreen and tint in one product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The sunblock works well and gives excelllent protection. It leaves your skin looking dry. And it doesn&#x27;t dry clear but leaves a white residue</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this sunscreen, but, after just two days of use, I had a face full of tiny breakouts.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product from my dermatologist so felt assured that it would be non irritating and a good sunscreen.  The surprise is that it also gives decent coverage as a makeup and the color is very neutral skin tone and blends with my own skin tone.  I use it daily without further makeup base except if I have a special occasion and want additional coverage.  In my teens I was a constant sunbather and have had many basal cell carcinomas on my face with surgeries and skin grafts.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every sunscreen on the market over the years and most had some type of negative effect - irritation, burning or even an almost chemical type burn (the ones with PABA).  This product feels very light, non greasy and does not clog the pores.  I am so happy to have discovered a product that has no negatives for me and gives me excellent protection from the sun.  I think I paid about $5 more than the Amazon price when I purchased it at the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I am out in the sun for 6 or 7 hours every day and this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t make me break out and looks like a very light foundation, evening my skin tone and hiding blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that it provides the sun protection promised. I originally purchased from my dermatologist at $60. a tube. I am VERY happy to find it cheaper but, honestly, would have&lt;br /&gt;spent that much since everything I have tried caused skin irritation and blemishes. Just to be sure though, I wear a hat too!</li>
    <li> As an Asian female with fair and extremly sensitive skin, I have been searching for sunscreen with high SPF that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or rashes for the past 15 years. I am so so glad finally the quest ended after i found this one on Amazon. It was light yet moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction or breakouts on my face AT ALL. Best of all, it is tinted so i can use it as a foundation, which really simplfy my morning regimen. And the color is just right, blending into my skin naturally. Not too pink or orange as most of the tinted sunscreen. If i can, i would give this product 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;So if Elta MD sees this review, please please don&#x27;t change this wonderful formula a bit for the next 100 years. I want to keep on using it till the day i die.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely brown/yellow! I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s bad??</li>
    <li> Great, my mom love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found for my acne-prone skin. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and it isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1: All physical sunblocks are very drying to my skin and this one is no exception. Even with my oily skin, using this (or any physical s.s.) for a few consecutive days causes my skin to peel. Moisturizing beforehand helps, but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2: It&#x27;s a tad to dark for my skin tone. I am very, very fair so for most this won&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you ARE super-duper white, my solution has been to add in a little [[ASIN:B003JUY38I Skinceuticals Sheer Physical Uv Defense SPF 50 Broad-spectrum Sunscreen Fluid, 1.7-Ounce]]. This is another great physical sunscreen but I don&#x27;t use it it alone because it&#x27;s little on the slick side and also too pricey for me to use alone every day. But it doesn&#x27;t break me out and since it&#x27;s white I mix up about  80% Eltamd to 20% Skinceutical in the palm of my hand right before application and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little extra work and investment but the combo leaves me with a little coverage and a nice matte finish. It&#x27;s what I wear instead of makeup.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation, I have never liked the feel of it so when I tried this from my dermatologist I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it but I was serious about blocking the sun on my face so I wanted to give it a try for it&#x27;s physical sunblock ingredients.  I loved it right away.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film or layer like I thought it would.  But, it does seem to provide just a hint of coverage without showing any signs of makeup.  It&#x27;s hard to describe but it works.  If you like regular foundation and use it, this will not replace that but if you don&#x27;t like foundation but could stand a little evening out of skin tone, this is a great product.  In addition, it spreads on easily and a little goes a long ways.  One bottle of this lasts me about 6 months and I wear it daily.</li>
    <li> This has a slight tint to it, but it&#x27;s a nude color and you probably won&#x27;t notice it one you smooth it out. I have some slight redness on part of my face and it pretty much does nothing to lighten that up. That&#x27;s ok, just pointing it out in case anyone was hoping it would be like a BB cream in that way. It does work really well and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or exacerbate my acne.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup anymore now that I have this product. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different expensive sunscreens for your face, and this is by far my favorite.  I played tennis for 3 1/2 hours with this on my face and did not get any sun on my face at all.  I am also a big time sweater, but this lotion really stayed on and did the job.  I also love the fact that it&#x27;s not oily, and easy to use daily.</li>
    <li> Looks like foundation but offers great sun protection.  Not at all greasy or shiney.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product, as well as getting it on Amzaon.  Love it.  Not greasy at all and I like the clear very light color.  I am an athlete that doesn&#x27;t fool around with a lot of makeup!  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Karen. Minnesota</li>
    <li> Love Elta products, especially that they have no parabens. Tint is very very light and doesn&#x27;t really give cover. But great sunscreen that does not go on greasy. I love that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated wearing sunscreen...the white residue, the greasy film, the obnoxious smell, the breakouts, the rash, the pimples, the eye irritation...That is until I found EltaMD tinted sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best sunscreen, specially for people with ultra sensitive skin like myself. It dries to a smooth matte finish, the light tint covers minor imperfections, make up or concealer go well over it, though you have to wait a few seconds until it dries. It does not run off or sting your eyes, even at the gym. And no more breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;Like others users mentioned, it may be slightly drying, which is not an issue for me. Thank  you EltaMD!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or rashes.</li>
    <li> This is the sunscreen I use everyday under makeup, it doubles as a primer. I have an oily t zone and this works so well for me! No break outs, I like to keep one tube on backup at all times. I never want to run out!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive acne prone skin! I could never use daily sunscreen because my face would always break out. I did a lot of research before I bought this product and it works excellent! I really like the tint it provides..hardly noticeable but it gives my skin a more finished look. Usually I just wear the sunscreen without makeup and it looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this tinted sunscreen!  I have used other Eltamd products (recommended by dermatologist) and have liked them all, but this one is the best.  I has excellent sun protection, never irritates my skin, does not sweat off in our Texas humidity and I love that the tint helps cover the redness from my rosacea. This is my second purchase of this product, and I&#x27;ll be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunblock.  Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes! Has just the right amount of color added to wear with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> My dermo recommend this to me.  It is slightly tinted so it doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking pasty white.  The zinc oxide level is high - which I guess is a good thing according to experts.  I doubt it can reverse the sun damage to my face, but hopefully it will prevent more.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I will put on my face. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all and provides a very light tint and cover, which is great.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product to me.  I did some research and read so many positive reviews that decided to try it.  I was thrilled when I found it was available through Amazon, and at the best price I found.  The product moisturizes without leaving any sticky feel, plus it is tinted just enough to act as a light foundation.  I no longer wear any other foundation.  I have foundation and moisturizer in one with the added bonus of a high SPF.  Living in Arizona a high SPF is very important, so I believe I have found the perfect combination of moisturizer, sun protection and foundation.  What more could you want???  I am thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> For a very long time I have been looking for just the right sunscreen. I was beginning to wonder if there was such a product for me. I was beginning to think my expectations were too high and that I would not be able to find everything I was looking for bundled up in one product. I&#x27;m pleased to say I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is everything I wanted: It&#x27;s easy to spread; it leaves my skin soft and without shine; I can wear it under my makeup, and it is better than even some of my more expensive moisturizers in that my makeup has a smoothe, even look to it when applied. And the best part is that even hours later, there&#x27;s still no shine! Oh, and I guess I should mention that it protects my fair skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an outstanding product and worth the cost. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for sheer perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a word about the tint: I thought at first it was going to be too opaque and make me look pasty, but it didn&#x27;t. I guess once it was absorbed, it was more a neutral shade than the way it first appeared. Which brings me to my next point. I found I got optimal results when I waited about 5 or 10 minutes before I applied my make-up. That allowed the sunscreen to sink in fully, and may be why there was no shine cropping up throughout the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I also bought the Elta MD UV Shield, SPF 45. That is basically the same product as the UV Phisical with regard to results, only without the tint. It performs equally as well. and is also oil free. All things being equal, whichever you choose probably depends on whether you want the tint or not.</li>
    <li> Living in Arizona, I need sunscreen everyday. My cousin who gets facials every 6 weeks at her dermatologist recommended, EltaMD UV SPF 41. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. I figured I would give it a try since I was running out of my usual facial sunscreen from Mary Kay. I got the tinted because it was slightly less expensive. I also figured since I wear foundation it wouldn&#x27;t matter what the tint was. I was surprised to find that the tint is great. I can actually wear this sunscreen without foundation when I am running short on time. It goes on very light and soaks in quickly. I will then put a little face powder on and I look decent. I do have to wait about 1 minute before I put on my foundation. If I put the EltaMD on and right away try to apply my foundation, the foundation doesn&#x27;t go on correctly. It smears and won&#x27;t blend in they way I want it to. All I have to do is wait for the Elta MD to settle into my skin for about 1-2 minute and then my foundation goes on smooth and blends nicely where I want it.  If I am busy getting the kids ready at the same time I am, sometimes I will forget that I already put the EltaMD on. I haven&#x27;t gotten sunburn yet. My freckles don&#x27;t seem to be getting any darker either. I started using it this past Spring and I am looking forward to how it will be in the winter when I have to add a tad of moisturizer since my cheeks get dry in the winter. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product has nice  coverage and yet is not oily.  The application is quick and easy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2+ years and love it.  It is the only product that I have ever put on my face daily that does NOT cause it to break out.  (I have very sensitive skin.)  I love the tint to the sunscreen and don&#x27;t put anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> Who the $#@! would think it&#x27;s a good idea to tint sunscreen, and a single tint at that? The shade of this stuff is far too dark for me and I would assume it would be far too light for a number of skin tones as well. A single shade that only matches a narrow range of people with medium skin tones is an incredibly stupid idea.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my daughter who plays sports and needs something that won&#x27;t make her break out.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a physical sunscreen that does not feel too thick and greasy. Finally realized I should buy a tinted one too since physical sunscreens don&#x27;t rub-in as easily. Did some research online and read about a bunch of sunscreens - this one had among the best reviews. I LOVE this sunscreen! It feels lightweight, not greasy, and I especially love the tint. It evens out my skin tone and I end up using less powder/foundation. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does not all come off easily. I&#x27;ve been using an oil-based makeup remover made especially for physical sunscreens, and it doesn&#x27;t really remove all of it, even after I use a cleanser too. So I&#x27;m still searching for a good cleanser/remover process. Otherwise, I love this product!</li>
    <li> this is the best tinted sunscreen I have ever purchased,and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve tried them all. It&#x27;s light and  doesn&#x27;t make your face shine like most.  My friend is now using it and also loves it</li>
    <li> A very smooth tinted light make up base with plenty of Sun screen protection. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It blends well with my skin.  I have fair skin with freckles and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or look like i&#x27;m trying to cover up my freckles....very natural.  I have dry skin so i do notice that my skin is more dry the next morning but i just up my moisturizer to compensate. Great product! I only wish it came in a slightly lighter color.</li>
    <li> Again, this item came in the box with the Avalon Organics Shampoo and both had come opened and leaked into the box.  I love this sunscreen, but only ended up with about half the tube.  Bummer</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen but not as cosmetically elegant as other formulations.  I have used EltMd for 8 or more years and I prefer one of their other sunscreen over this one.</li>
    <li> Have stopped using base! My face is so much better....had sensitivity issues to a lot of products. This is perfect!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good physical sunblock and alhamduleallah, I found it. This is really very good and it feels light in your skin. It is tinted, so you&#x27;ll not be or look like a day ghost while wearing it,</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is absolutely amazing.  I use it daily as my sun protection, and it has enough tint for my skin to go without makeup every day.</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily skin and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a cream, let alone a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t go on oily. This one does the trick! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and even in hot icky weather (ie. summers in Texas!) it feels very light. HIGHLY recommended. Plus, you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> My friend is in the derm biz and suggested I switch to this sunscreen for full coverage as my skin gets older.  This sunscreen is used in her dermatologists office after procedures.  This is a TINTED sunscreen and does leave a skin colored tint on your face, but it also is no problem putting foundation over the top of this sunscreen.  The coverage is light in color but a thick product like toothpaste thickness.  Still, after it is on, I still need to apply my foundation over the top to cover my blemishes, etc because the tint in the sunscreen is not a replacement for blemish coverage at all.  It also does not give me pimples etc.  I have had no problems using this product and know that I am using the best possible coverage available on the market according to my BFFL who is also a derm genius!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sun blocks over the years because my skin is really sensitive to some of the chemicals in them.  This one works great for me. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face like some products I&#x27;ve tried. It has a high enough SPF and it works well under makeup.  I&#x27;ve used one tube and I just ordered another one.</li>
    <li> Works really well but leaves a white cast on face.</li>
    <li> to pasty- can&#x27;t have a glow about you with this on</li>
    <li> It is a good sunscreen, I like the tint idea but it make my skin dry after an hour !! My complain is it was only half full when I got it!!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this product will need to be applied AFTER a good moisturizer.  If not, this will amplify any patches of dry skin.  And I mean makes them stand out horribly.  If the moisturizer is really rich, the product doesn&#x27;t apply evenly and beads up.  That means you have to moisturize, wait for it to soak in, THEN apply this.  It has been very effective against sunburn.</li>
    <li> It is good item. I like this item and I &#x27;m satisfied. I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously and purchased it through my dermatologist. I was happy to find it on Amazon so I can have it delivered to my home. I use this daily instead of powder or liquid makeup. It never makes my skin oily and I feel better about stepping outside knowing I have great sun protection. I have tried many sunscreens and this is the only one I have found that does not clog my pores or have a strong odor. I love that it is tinted as well. This tube lasts me a long time. It doesn&#x27;t take much to get full coverage on my face. It&#x27;s also nice that it is water resistant because I am out in the humidity and sweat. I have never had trouble with it running into my eyes or getting on my clothes like so many other products.</li>
    <li> I think this is basically what a BB cream is supposed to be. Broad spectrum sun protection in a very light, non-irritating formula that almost feels soothing as you apply it. It has a tint that is unfortunately best suited for light and medium skin colors; women and men of color lose out. I wore this during the Texas summer and it held up fine, especially after I set it a little with powder. Oddly, it can be a little bit drying even on my oily skin. Sometimes I put moisturizer on underneath and when I don&#x27;t I try to apply moisturizer at night.</li>
    <li> I apply a thin layer of this sunblock every morning, a couple of minutes after I apply my rosacea medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended a daily sun block, and she gave this one the nod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight pinkish/reddish tint which blends acceptably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues after three years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An 85-gram tube lasts about a year for me.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me - rosacea, seb derm, sensitive very fair skin - since I have used Elta Block for 10+ years ... just as a fairly new product that I might like -- and I was surprised at how smooth it keeps my skin, even hours later. It does add a bit of fair tint, but since I&#x27;m so fair already, it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; at all on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even just use this and a touch of mascara and gloss if I&#x27;m making a quick run somewhere, but it is a really great base for foundation wearability. I would not recommend a primer over it, though.</li>
    <li> I love this...I use retain-a and need a good sunblock, I love this way this looks so much I only use foundation when I go someplace special. Florida is hot and humid and this stands up better than anything I have ever used. Plus when my dermatologist uses it that tells me it works.</li>
    <li> Ill never buy another sunscreen. Ive put this on my face and chest and &#x27;something else&#x27; everywhere else and sure enough, my face and chest tan and the rest burns.</li>
    <li> I think I might have found my holy grail sunscreen.  It&#x27;s been only two days, but I love what I&#x27;ve seen so far.  I&#x27;m one of those people that suffer from oily skin (on the bright side, less wrinkles though, right? lol) Every product that I&#x27;ve ever tried has felt heavy and left my skin super oily after only a couple of hours, and while I still do get somewhat oily by the end of the day with this, it&#x27;s a HUGE improvement from what I was used to. (I blame that on genetics, though lol) There&#x27;s a bit of a tint to this, but once you start blending it in, you won&#x27;t even notice. What I love, though, is that although it&#x27;s a VERY  sheer coverage, it&#x27;s still enough to cover imperfections, and concealer will do the trick if you need a bit more coverage on certain areas.  It gives me a matte finish when I&#x27;m done applying, and it stays matte through out most of the day. As for removing this, it&#x27;s a physical sunscreen, so it can be a bit hard, but the cleanser that I use does the job. And since this does keep my oily skin in check, I&#x27;d recommend those with dry skin to use a light weight moisturizer underneath because it might be a bit dry on it&#x27;s own. All in all though, this definitely reminds me of a BB cream, but better. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, and for those with oily skin, definitely give this a go.</li>
    <li> This is adviced by my dermetologist and ever since I have been using it - this one really works for the Sun block.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist highly recommended this brand so I tried it. I use this on my face over my moisturizer in the morning and haven&#x27;t experienced any sunburn while using this. However, I do need to reapply about midday for effective sun protection.  I like that it is tinted and is a mineral sunscreen. It feels pretty light even though there is zinc oxide in it.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts using this product.</li>
    <li> The color is nice, but it can be a little drying, which can magnify little wrinkles….</li>
    <li> I love this chemical sunblock with a slight tint. Lasts all day and is not greasy! I had skin cancer and this product really helps to keep my face protected. One tube lasts me 6 months.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my dermatologist recommended the brand because it has Zinc or &amp;#34;physical blockers&amp;#34; which is desirable for sun protection. She said that although it has zinc which in the past ha been notoriously difficult to spread in and usually leaves white marks, this product did not do so. She was right it blends in smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in terms of how well it protect some from the sun but it has been wonder since I purchased it so I haven&#x27;t tested it out  in harsh conditions much.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize it was tinted when I initially purchased it and was disappointed when it arrived when I noticed it was tinted. I decided this was my error so I kept it. The tint doesn&#x27;t really match my skin tone and it looks weird when it comes out of the tube; kind of like the tint is separating from the sunscreen portion. I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to explain it but it comes out appearing like the bottle needs to be shaken well before use. I don&#x27;t know if this is because I got an old batch or something. I wont be buying this exact product again but I am not turned off by the brand in general since they are one of the few brands that uses blendable zinc and is reasonably priced. I think once this bottle is through I will break for Invisible Zinc.</li>
    <li> The sun block works just fine, It doesn&#x27;t have too much color of its own and is a very good product. The reason I gave It three stars is because the tube is half filled with AIR there is not as much cream in the tube as one would expect, which is a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> A great tinted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It has a pasty look when applied and I wanted something that could be used a foundation but this is not it.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time today, and am thoroughly impressed. This tinted sunblock is easy to apply and provides just enough sheer coverage for my very fair, dry skin. It&#x27;s better than almost any of the BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll be keeping this on hand as my go-to everyday makeup base.</li>
    <li> Gives me the protection I need... The tint is a plus...</li>
    <li> I love this creme.  Goes on smooth, however, I wish there were some other color choices, as this one is quite light.</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my face. I picked it because it has zinc oxide and titanium dioxide physical sunscreens. Other sunscreens (even other physical sunscreens) caused me to break out. I&#x27;ve had absolutely no trouble with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that it is tinted. I consider it a plus, but be aware that the tint will rub off on tissues or anything else really. Fine for your face, but obviously a problem on other parts of your body.</li>
    <li> This really works to block all UV without any chemical irritation.  My skin is calmer after using it.  I would give it 5 stars if the color was less grey.</li>
    <li> This product was one of several products recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have used this sunscreen, daily, on my face for one year.  It is a physical sunscreen (not chemical).  Physical sunscreens are much more effective in blocking the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.  I am usually fine with this product being tinted, just put on, add a bit of blush and off I go.  However, I am an avid outdoors person and sometimes having tinted facial sunscreen seems a bit &amp;#34;over the top.&amp;#34;  I am still looking for a non-tinted facial sunscreen that is as good as this tinted one for my more rugged outdoor adventures.  I had utilized one of my former chemical based sunscreens, SPF 65, especially formulated for faces, for a weekend backpack in the desert recently.  Even though I applied it generously (as you should all sunscreens) and applied it several times a day (as you should all sunscreens) and wore a hat (which you should do too) I got sunburned.  I will never use a chemical sunscreen again, they are not as effective as the physical ones.</li>
    <li> I put some on my back, and then put on a tee shirt. I had a large brown area from the product where it touched my tee shirt. Lucky it washed out.</li>
    <li> I like the way that the products goes on but I don&#x27;t care for the fact that is leaves my face looking ghost like in appearance.  I don&#x27;t know if my skin is just dark enough that it does that or what.  Maybe if they left out any of the tinting it would work better.</li>
    <li> like the lightness of the product and think it does a good job, but wish it could have a darker tint as it tends to make me look pale and find it drying.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product in an article interviewing a well known dermatologist about which products she uses. Now I have to try the rest. This is the best facial sunscreen I have tried in my very lengthy search. It has a physical barrier, not a chemical barrier, goes on with incredible smoothness, has an amazing texture, covers my skin imperfections better than makeup. This is one high quality product. I am very pleased and impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Added 10/7/12&lt;br /&gt;My initial review does not do my experience with this product justice. Forgive me, but I must shout. This is the BEST SUNBLOCK OF ALL!!!!! Seriously. This sunblock is perfect in so many ways: (1) Works well - I&#x27;m a Californian - Southern Californian - of a certain age - that means I grew up sun worshiping, knew nothing about skin cancer or wrinkles or any of the little fun surprises life saves up for you. At some point, I had to let the dermatologist have a go at my face, a few peels, freezing spots, but they kept coming back. Especially on the left - the driving side of my face. Once I started using this sunscreen, I stopped getting additional damage. I stopped getting tan. I stopped getting sunburnt. I have been using Olay 15 SPF for many, many years. Everytime I tried other sunscreens on my face, I broke out, got pimples or little bumps or allergic reactions or my face turned into an dripping oil slick. No more. I am sunblocked and pleasantly so. (2) As I hinted in #1, this sunscreen does not cause any adverse effects on my extremely sensitive skin. (3) Looks good. I&#x27;m so busy or lazy or not vain enough - but I never wear foundation or powder or well anything at all. But this sunscreen has a slight tint which gives my skin a natural even tone without appearing to even exist. Wow. I mean if I was looking for foundation, this would be it. People literally tell me that my skin looks good. HA! (3) Physical sunblock. Do you know what that means? NO CHEMICALS PENETRATING YOUR SKIN. Yep. It&#x27;s physical. It sits as a barrier on your skin. Think of the surfers of the 70&#x27;s with their white goopy noses. Except it&#x27;s not visible. Bless innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should I share this brilliant product with you? I don&#x27;t know. I could keep it to myself and have the best skin around. But go figure, here I am blathering on. I don&#x27;t even get a commission. All I get is great skin. You might too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s still not clear BEST SUNSCREEN !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back in another year and tell you how I really feel. Since I&#x27;m holding back so much now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one more tip from my excellent dermatologist, regular peels at the dermatologist (I know you can learn to do it on YouTube), help your skin get rid of cells that might become skin cancer. Yes, that&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s not just about beauty. Of course, insurance could give a crap about prevention and won&#x27;t pay. But I had to hear it from the dermatologist, so I&#x27;m sharing it with you in case you don&#x27;t know. Wear your sunscreen. Physical barrier is better than chemical barrier (ok that&#x27;s opinion but I&#x27;m right). And get peels at your dermatologist. This is especially true if you are fair skinned with light eyes. Sadly, people I care about are beginning to die of melanoma. I may be using a light tone, but this is incredibly serious. Do not go outdoors without sunscreen. If you drive a lot, replenish your sunscreen on the left side of your face and your left arm (and anything else that you have exposed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to tell you the rest. There&#x27;s more. This sunscreen goes on silky smooth. It feels like liquid silk. It is so smooth and blends easily and simply disappears. When I touch my skin during the day, it feels incredibly soft and silky (don&#x27;t touch your face, it&#x27;s not good to spread bacteria from your hands). My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily all day long. It feels like a baby&#x27;s behind looks. Clean and smooth like a baby product commercial. It&#x27;s hard to believe a product is this good. But it is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy oneof every product on every pharmacy shelf every year looking for the sunscreen that is going to help me. It can&#x27;t be oily. It has to work well. It needs to spread evenly. It has to last. It can&#x27;t have nano chemicals. I don&#x27;t need a pharmaceutical firm deciding for me when I&#x27;m going to have nano particles mixing with my personal particles. And this stuff is the shit. And if I can find the lady dermatologist who revealed that she used it in some obscure article, then I will share the link. But now I have to go wash my face and prepare it for another safe day of brilliant sunshine by applying this awesome sunscreen.of every product on every pharmacy shelf every year looking for the sunscreen that is going to help me.

    <li> Highly recommend. Have recommended to dozens of people who ended up purchasing.  Very light,  tint light but medium skin tone friends use it underneath bronzer or foundation. My mom has medium skin and it was too light for her but she&#x27;s a no makeup kind of person, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles thus far and i really like it.  I just don&#x27;t like the fact that you must reapply after 45 minutes if you&#x27;re swimming.  It becomes annoying.</li>
    <li> Faster than promised and just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product that protects against UVA &amp; UVB rays. Recommended by my physician. I have been using Eltamd physical sunblock for years &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist is world renowned and highly recommends this lotion. She sells it at her office. I love it. Only a slight tint with no burning or greasy feeling. I hate face lotions and love this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s two-fer for me! The perfect moisturizer with a hint of tint I use as my foundation.</li>
    <li> I really like this tinted sunscreen.  I am a very minimal fundation user as I believe I need to let the skin breathes, especially in the steaming summer time.  This sunscreen has a perfect tint that it goes a little bit white&amp;#34; at first, yet, you cannot detect anything once it is absorbed.  The reason only four starts is because of the price, I know it is cheaper consider to other pricier options on the market.  However, as a religious sunscreen user, the more money i save the better.  PS it has very low hazard ingredients according to the SkinDeep, my go to product check up app.</li>
    <li> Amazing product , excellent protection, mate finishing , no shinning , and the best ingredients ( zinc , titanium oxide).  I can&#x27;t buy anything else !</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a sunscreen for my face that felt weightless and was also a physical block.  It has a high safety and efficacy rating on the EWG (cosmeticdatabase.com) and was reccomended by a dermatologist for me.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all.  The tint is so sheer, it works on several skin tones.  I&#x27;m fair olive skinned and it blended perfectly, my sister has dark olive skin and it blended perfectly as well.  Gives a light almost goldish healthy glow that looks great.  Let it set in before you dress and it shoudln&#x27;t get on your clothes.  It is paraben free and even has retinol in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!! BUY IT!!! BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I rotate this with other EltaMD sunscreens depending on my skins needs and the look I&#x27;m going for.  The tint looks very dark, but it blends well into my fair skin.</li>
    <li> Great for daily use. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and the tint is great. Does require touch ups if you are wearing for 10-11hr day</li>
    <li> I have an aversion to chemical sunblockers. They give me break out like I&#x27;m a cheap prison. This product keeps my skin calm, and has a &#x27;foundation&#x27; effect as bonus so my face looks less blemished. They do mean it when it&#x27;s water proof. It is kind of tough to wash off, but I guess that&#x27;s kind of what you want in a sunscreen. I would wear this thing every two hours if it wasn&#x27;t so damn pricey.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I use as a sun screen and light make up.. Tinted the right color for me...make up in the summer is hot.  This is not hot.  Great cover up. Great sun protection.</li>
    <li> This has a nice texture, and good coverage, the color is very light, so makeup with color over it works well.</li>
    <li> product as advertised.  very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have been using it instead of foundation (unless going out for dinner or party) for over two years. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry it out, provides sun protection. Tip: In the summer I mix it with a little liquid bronzer before applying.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. My dermatologist recommended it. Good price and fast shipping. I highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I had to change my review on this, because I just don&#x27;t love it and I&#x27;m hoping someone will post an alternative that is equally safe and contains no silicone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely fair with red hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I don&#x27;t wear any foundation with this. I have good skin and this just evens things out a bit. It&#x27;s very sweat proof. Offers great protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s so heavy! It&#x27;s really difficult to remove when I wash my face and if it&#x27;s been a hot day, I&#x27;m very aware it&#x27;s on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any alternatives that they love, please let me know. Until then I&#x27;ll keep using this.</li>
    <li> Works great. Not greasy. Acts like a light foundation. Doesn&#x27;t break out my skin like other sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non greasy, great physical sun protection without the chemicals. Better than Laura Mercier in my opinion. Have never used another sun cream since my dermatologist recommended this one to me.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff.  I use it most of the time in place of makeup.  I dust a little minerals face powder over it and I am ready to go. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I know this may seem like a long story about my battle with melasma...BUT I know how many people suffer with it and need help preventing it from coming back...I cannot say enough about this product. I have been battling a melasma for years....a brown &amp;#34;butterfly mark&amp;#34;  on my face that went across my nose and onto my cheeks...It came on suddenly when I hit my 40&#x27;s...I don&#x27;t know if it was just hormonal or if it was my heart med hormone combo...but it was a nightmare....For someone like me who has never abused the sun and has light skin this was  a shocking  never ending battle. I would use lighteners for months during the winter and they would work until I went outside and the dark patches would re develop almost instantly.. I was using 110 spf and nothing worked I know that 110 was useless but I figured I would try them anyway......Then I read an article in my trades about using a physical sunblock with Zinc oxide and Titanium...I tried them all...and MANY made me look like a greasy white ghost...LOL the melasma looked better than the white...I then did a few peels to get that skin off...it was a process this time I tried this sunblock....OMG the melasma has not come back!!!! I got this at the height of the summer season last year....I am an avid gardener I can go out there for 12 hours a day no problem...I am always outside and for the first time...I do not have this ugly brown patch growing darker across my face...&lt;br /&gt; Once I tried this one...I never bothered with any other product. I have tried so many and I am thrilled.  It leaves my skin soft. I like the tint in it as it acts as a nice foundation base and the best part is it does not have crazy scary carcinogenic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to my clients especially for those with sensitive skin or have discoloration like I do...sure I could sell them stuff that I could get, pro stuff....that may or may not work the same...I have not found one that works as great as this one..... i wouldn&#x27;t just sell them something and then not be responsible for it....I know how heartbreaking it is to be promised a solution and not get it...Take it from a pro with over 30 years experience...someone who has made her own products and is a total....product lover....This is one item I would highly recommend!ll them something and then not be responsible for it....I know how heartbreaking it is to be promised a solution and not get it...Take it from a pro with over 30 years experience...someone who has made her own products and is a total....product lover....This is one item I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is great as a moisturizer as well as strong sun screen and has a nice light tint that blends well and evens out blotches.  I have red skin and this tones the red down.  I have used this for years and love it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite facial sunscreen. I had been using a different brand but they changed suppliers and the quality suffered. This product is slightly tinted, but as a nearly-porcelain-skinned person, it still shows up as slightly lighter than my skin tone. I&#x27;m ok with that, as it is completely non-irritating and goes on very smoothly. It&#x27;s lovely on its own or under makeup. The price is very reasonable given the quality of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: after a year of using this product it&#x27;s now darker than my skin tone (but still invisible once it&#x27;s rubbed in.)  It&#x27;s so pleasant to use that for the first time in my life I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen every day, and my skin has lightened. That wasn&#x27;t what I was going for but it&#x27;s not a bad thing, because I have a bit of the redhead/freckled coloring, and a history of various kinds of skin cancer in my family. I ordered this and another fairly expensive (for me) sunscreen after developing a few big brown blotches on my face. Sun damage in my 30s, even though I&#x27;ve never tanned and rarely (as an adult) burned. I still have the brown spots but I&#x27;m hoping I won&#x27;t develop more now that I&#x27;m using daily protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice added benefit is that the redness from past acne scars fades a lot faster when I&#x27;m not getting UV exposure on my face.  I&#x27;m enjoying my clearer skin. Oh yeah--I&#x27;m acne prone with sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
    <li> I developed a skin condition on my face and a friend recommended this particular sunscreen.  It is gentle, moisterizing, light, slightly tinted; and I&#x27;m able to use daily without any adverse reaction on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love how this Eltamd UV Physical SPF 41 tinted sunblock goes on: smooth and silky - never clumpy or dry! I&#x27;ve tried other tinted sunblocks that for some odd reason, go on leaving my face peppered with dry, white clumps that take a few minutes to work into my skin. UGH! By contrast, this product has an almost whipped consistency. I can easily smooth it on without a thought before hopping out daily to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only caveat: I think this tinted sunblock is really for FAIR skin! I am very fair-skinned, and I get decent coverage, but if I want a really &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; look, I simply have to use regular foundation mixed in the palm of my hand with sunblock. Even so, I feel that I get a good SPF protection for minimal effort and at least SOME decent coverage/color with this tinted sunblock. Will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Works great as a daily. I have roseacea and have to protect my skin everyday. I really like the tinted cream. It works well under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen if allergic to regular sunscreen.  No irritation or tears.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist for my fair skin.</li>
    <li> Love this tinted sunscreen; I use it as foundation during the winter to help moisturize my skin.  During the summer, I use the Elta SPF 45, which is more drying and helps keep oil shine down.  Both are very creamy and absorb right in, no tightness or heaviness on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is on my face at all, and easily removed by soap or cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best makeup.  The moisturizer works very well and keeps my face moist all day.  What I really like is the tint -- I put it on with some creme blush and I&#x27;m all set.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost three years and I still love it!  My dermatologist recommended it.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this. I saw it recommended in some literature from my dermatologist. I wear it every day under my face powder. I haven&#x27;t used it while at the pool yet, but I expect to reapply frequently when I do. Absolutely no break outs and I have very sensitive oily, acne prone skin. So many sunscreens out there have chemical blockers only...those always rash me out and cause break outs. I&#x27;m beyond impressed with this product so far. For those who complain about air being in the tube, it doesn&#x27;t matter, the oz of product in the tube is the amount of oz stated on the label.  Not that I measured it to check, but just because the tube is larger than the amount of oz sold to you doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re getting jipped. You get what you pay for and this sunscreen is worth the price!</li>
    <li> i love the tint and the SPF 41 is always a plus when trying to avoid sun exposure at the beach or just for everyday use. goes on smooth, not oily, just a really nice finish.</li>
    <li> Works great.....looks like makeup while protecting your face</li>
    <li> I used this product once, washed it off immediately and never used it again. This is not made for people of color. This product stayed white on my face (ghostly white), which is unsightly for my dark skin tone.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to most skin care products, but have been able to use EltaMD. Would recommend as a sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this daily under make-up, goes on lightly. Not greasy and has tint to it as well.  Love it !</li>
    <li> You will love this chemical free tinted moisurizer, with SPF 41.  I have been using this for about 4 years. I use this after I put on my moisturizer, as it adds a really nice sheen , and it makes your skin glow, not really a shiny glow, just a fresh dewey glow.  I wear my foundation over it when I feel I need more coverage.  If you have any redness on your chest, and neck from sun damage, this cancels out that reddness and makes your skin look flawless.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> This product is not sticky, greasy or smelly. It goes on smoothly and I like the tint.  I will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Comprehensive physical block, light coverage! Doesn&#x27;t oil out - looks great all day! I highly recommend Elta Md!</li>
    <li> works great, has a little tint and glides on easily with good physical sunblock. That was important to me to be a physical block that is not greasy.</li>
    <li> It does not give a good cover , especially after laser treatments. The redness continues to exist. It is very greasy in the sun exposure. I think it must be reformulated immediately .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other tinted sunscreens (La Roche-Posay Anthelios and Revision Intellishade matte - both highly rated, but not for me), this is the best color and texture.  Expensive, but worth it.  I&#x27;ve had two skin cancers removed (melanoma) so have to use sunscreen now, will only use this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect sunscreen, not greasy and  u dont feel it on the skin. It&#x27;s tinted , provides coverage .  Goes well with any foundation ((if u need it), and that is very important to me, i use it under bare minerals. Would recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product. It was recommended to me by a friend who has been using it for a while. My dermatologist suggested that I switch over to a physical (chemical-free) sunscreen due to recent European studies that show cases of cancer caused by chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, we were out in the sun all day. I put it on my face, chest, neck and hands. I re-applied mid-day and didn&#x27;t get burned. But what I did get was an itchy red rash on my chest and lower neck. It was also very difficult to remove. Not being sure if it was the sunscreen or just heat rash, I tried it again a week later - rash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not consider myself to have sensitive skin. I am a fair Ginger, but I never have to use products for sensitive skin. This product is even marketed for sensitive and post-procedure skin. I can&#x27;t imagine using this on delicate post-procedure skin, given the amount of effort required to remove it. Very disappointing...</li>
    <li> Love this product, Plenty of protection, non oily feel (all Day), and the light tint is perfect to wear as is or under regular foundation.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist. I find it easy to apply and find that the subtle tint actually smooths out the complexion.</li>
    <li> This arrived via USPS today, Sunday, with other products I ordered from Amazon. I&#x27;m giving it a low grade based on the deceptive package.  I ripped off the foil protective covering over the tube opening and squeezed out most of the air. I put a teeny dot on my hand, and the color is nice for Caucasians. I don&#x27;t know about the sun screening ability, but the packinging is disappointing. After I took the pic I squeezed out more air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like I have sandwich stand, you order a yummy looking sandwich for twenty bucks based on the menu photo, and you get about 1/3 of a sandwich.</li>
    <li> I was in love with this product because it was high enough SPF and it felt so light and not sunscreen-y, but Consumer Reports recently tested a bunch of sunscreen brands and EltaMD was one of the brands that did not live up to it&#x27;s SPF claims. It was determined that EltaMD is actually less than SPF 30 (They weren&#x27;t the only brand, I suggest looking up the full article). I had also given a bottle to my mom, who burns much easier than I do. When I told her about this article, she remarked that she thought she was burning too easily when she used it (compared to what she used previously), but she wasn&#x27;t sure if she was imagining it or not. Now we know she wasn&#x27;t... very disappointing.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dermatologist....works great, most reasonably priced. I will order this stuff again &amp; would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Finally - I found a sunscreen I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin white!  This sunscreen has a wonderful, smooth, creamy texture that goes on easily, blends in quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make your face look caked on.  Perfect under make-up or alone.  Even my 12 year old son loves it because it doesn&#x27;t leave him looking white.  Great sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> Love the light tint color!  Can use this alone without makeup! Love it!  I would recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I has some very light color that is like having some light foundation on. This is the only sunscreen I will use on my face.</li>
    <li> A very lite facial colored cream, healthy for the skin.</li>
    <li> love the tint, I apply a little powder over it for a nice matte finish.  Never get a burn when I wear this.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and I loove this stuff. It&#x27;s not irritating, doesnt smell, isnt sticky or greasy. Plus it acts like a tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a tinted sun screen.  My first purchase of this was from my dermatologist office.  I buy it online for convenience.  I have used several tubes.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  This is an excellent tinted sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth when you apply, not greasy or oily but wish the tint has more coverage.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product---just the right shade of foundation coupled with excellent protection.  I&#x27;ve been using Elta MD products for years now at the recommendation of a dermatologist and they are effective, smooth, and non-greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, good sunscreen and nice coverage. My skin feels so good and protected. Good value too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I still love it.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with finding a good match for my skintone (fair to light) and this blends perfectly.  I can build as needed in areas that need more coverage.</li>
    <li> I love this product because of my sensitive skin. It breaks out easily, but this product does not make it oily, does not make it break out, and provides a very sheer coverage.  I still have to put on mineral powder (the coverage is VERY sheer), but it works well.  I do not get sun damage (tan/sunburn) when using this product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on very smoothly. It has a slight beige tint so that it doesn&#x27;t look white. It actually replaces foundation for me. My skin is very fair, however, so it may not look good on darker skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with this product so far.  I have been trying to use a daily sunscreen that has better coverage than the one just in my moisturizer.  But I didn&#x27;t want one that felt like I was going to the beach.  This one does the trick of feeling more like a cosmetic, and less like a beach sunscreen, without being too whitish too.  After a minute or two, I think it sinks in and looks pretty natural. I don&#x27;t love the tinting as much as I thought I would, its sort of on the whitish side to me, but its not bad.  Would purchase again when I finish this tube.</li>
    <li> Great sunblock for high sweat activities.  The tint makes it so I don&#x27;t get that ugly ghostly cast that physical sunblocks often give people of color.  No stinging of the eyes either.  I run 3-5 miles wearing this 5-6 days a week and I love it. A keeper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and love it.  It was recommended by my doctor.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and have had melanomas.  It&#x27;s lightweight, covers nicely, and chemical free.  I wear it daily with some loose powder over it.  I like it so much I bought it for my two sisters and girlfriends.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and creamy.  Gives enough coverage I do not need foundation. This is a great product and was recommended ny by dermatologist</li>
    <li> This is a nice sunblock.  Not too much tint to it so it goes with most any skin color.  Applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen.  It has a bit of a tint so no makeup required.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily either like some other products.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It is a great sunscreen with just enough tint and coverage that i do not generally wear foundation with it.</li>
    <li> Does not burn near eyes, feels great, blends well, excellent base for a light power foundation.  I have medium olive skin so it would be too pale for me in summer by itself so I like to use mineral makeup over it my tan shade.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday in place of foundation.  Great for the pool and outdoor sports too. It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many facial sunscreens and this is the only one that has worked for me. I have acne-prone sensitive skin and this product does not cause my face to break out at all. The tint is for fair skin but easily blends with other makeup (I have medium complexion). I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for years and it&#x27;s fantastic!  As other reviewers have noted, it is very difficult to remove due to it being waterproof, but I&#x27;ve found that if you use an oil-based cleanser like DHC Cleansing Oil, then rinse and follow with your regular cleanser, it removes the sunblock without any harsh scrubbing.  Oil-based cleansers are fantastic for &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblocks (zinc &amp; titanium dioxide) as well as for waterproof makeup).  This sunblock can also double as a BB cream.  It&#x27;s very silky when applied and makes your skin look flawless for hours. Love this sunblock - please don&#x27;t ever discontinue it!</li>
    <li> love the way my skin responds to the tinted sun screen..</li>
    <li> Awesome SPF. Not oily/greasy/shiny, doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;ve got dark olive/tan skin, so it does look slightly pale/chalky on my face. However, a) this fades pretty quickly and anyway b) it provides a good base for a mineral powder, almost like a liquid foundation, and definitely evens your skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s mineral and free from most &amp;#34;nasties&amp;#34;, like most of the EltaMD products seem to be.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an SPF product that contained a good amount of titanium dioxide for maximum sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;I then follow with a face primer to provide a little moisture (without shine) before applying my make-up&lt;br /&gt;Even though this  product is slightly tinted I found that my foundation still needs to be a couple of shades darker as another reviewer mentioned..  .</li>
    <li> After being recently disappointed by my former favorite tinted sunscreen, I decided to give this one a try. It&#x27;s perfect! I am PALER that PALE, and although the tint seems like it would be too dark coming out of the tube, it actually blends very nicely, and I end up with a bit of a glow. It is matte, absorbs into the skin almost instantly with no stickiness, and evens out the skin tone/minimizes pores a bit too. It wears well under foundation. I went on an emergency road trip and wore well for about 48 hours despite a lot of face rubbing, wind, and teary eyes. I haven&#x27;t even finished my first bottle yet and I already repurchased because I don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
    <li> Made my face sweat but I have friends who love love love it. So, don&#x27;t go by me.</li>
    <li> Best facial sunscreen hands down!!! Blends into any skin color, doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin and diersnt sting or burn like most sunscreens!</li>
    <li> I use this instead of make-up rain or shine. Goes on smoothly and protects my face from sun damage.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and everything I&#x27;ve tried to put on my face either makes me oily, itchy, or breaks me out. I put this on and it feels like nothing is on my face all day! I will definitely repurchase this when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product and I have been using it for years on my face and neck to prevent sun damage and therefore slow down the aging process.</li>
    <li> This is great, not greasy.  I recommend to everyone, I wear it everyday.  My dermatologist got me hooked on it.  The product sells it&#x27;s self.</li>
    <li> I keep searching for a better sunblock, but haven&#x27;t found one to compare to this one. I&#x27;ve been using this for, at least, the past seven years. I require a few things in my sunblock. First, it needs to be safe. For example, I never use chemical sunblocks, and I evaluate the physical ones carefully. If you go to the EWG site, you can view an enormous list of sunscreens and every one of their ingredients has been rated as to how hazardous or not hazardous they are. All of those ratings add to an overall rating for the sunscreen. Nearly all the sunblocks I have looked for have been present on that very reputable site. Anyway, this is one of the very top safe ones to use. Next, it can&#x27;t smell off or bad in any way. Next, it cannot irritate my skin, which is super sensitive. Also, it must look presentable and not feel as if I am caked with something. The only problem I have with it is that it does tend to form some crumbs, so that can be annoying. But honestly, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and it works for me.  I would readily recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> i love it ...I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I would give this more stars if I could. I was looking for a sunscreen that I could wear under mineral makeup without it getting wet and clumpy and too thick. This stuff is perfect. It goes on very sheer and almost dry, so when I put on the mineral foundation it&#x27;s just like putting it on my bare skin. It&#x27;s very slightly tinted but you can&#x27;t tell under makeup. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love Eltamd product line. I have rosacea and can&#x27;t use a lot of the products that&#x27;s out there. I&#x27;m also allergic to sun screens and have to use sunscreens with only the physical blockers Zinc Oxide and titanium dioxide and my dermatologist recommended this product line. The only thing about the sunscreens with physical blockers is that it white and it looks really white on your skin. this has a little tint to it so it helps some. I use a little moisturizer underneath because it will dry out your skin and it will start flaking and start smudging when I sweat. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have rosacea but I can&#x27;t just use a little thin layer because if exposed to the sun, I will break out. This is the only product that has protected my face from the sun so I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Performed as described - I use this cream for face protection</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage.  Not greasy.  I use it rather than foundation makeup!</li>
    <li> I kind of like this, it&#x27;s smooth when you apply on your skin, color is good.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I hate heavy make-up. It is good for natural make-up.&lt;br /&gt;It covers pores and blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love all the Elta MD sunscreen products!  They provide lightweight protection without clogging pores.  I live in a humid climate and have never had issues with sweating this off or anything.</li>
    <li> protect and cover without looking like a ghost.work well with out make up</li>
    <li> Great sunblock and a great price.  It&#x27;s slightly tinted so your face won&#x27;t look like Marcel Marceau&#x27;s.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I used to use Shiseido (which I still like).  But it&#x27;s more than double the price and I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s more than double the better.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  As long as I swipe on some translucent powder, I can wear this over my chemical sunscreen with tinsorbs.  I have very fair skin, and I love the tint.</li>
    <li> Ive tried so many face lotions and love this one. It is so light and the tint is perfect. I use it everyday and love that it has sun protection!</li>
    <li> Contains zinc and titanium dioxide ~ natural sun blocks rather than the typical sunscreens that contain chemical substances that are absorbed into the skin.  Has a nice tint, making it useful for the face.  Does not leave a chalky after application appearance.  Goes on easily and feels great.  Can use in place of makeup or moisturizer.  Much more economical than other brands.  After finding this product I no longer need to search for  any other sunblock.</li>
    <li> i love this moistorizer awsome product this a good my face little bit improvement look amazing i love it !!!</li>
    <li> Most sunscreen are bit oily but this SPF 41 is not greased at all and is the best sunscreen I ever used.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested this and I finally purchased a pro SPF. It has a tint, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I loved that. but it&#x27;s not bad. I just make sure to wash my hands before moving on to touch anything else. It goes on light and it feels good not greasy. packaged well and delivered within the week.</li>
    <li> better than arcona reozone&#x27;s old formula.  the new arcona is just awful.  love this.</li>
    <li> So far I have quite enjoyed using this sunblock. It has a nice consistency when it comes out of the tube (not too watery) and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy either. It has not resulted in any major breakouts on my sensitive skin which is always something I demand from the products I use. When applying to the face, it can be a bit streaky, so it&#x27;s important that you look in the mirror and make sure to blend out/rub in any streaks that may have appeared (it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to do it either). I noticed that the amount of pigment in this product is darker/more than the Paula&#x27;s Choice (PC) super-light wrinkle defence spf 30 (which is another tinted physical sunblock), but it&#x27;s not noticeable on the face. My skin is quite fair, so I was a bit worried when I squirted this out and it looked darker than the PC one, but again, it&#x27;s not noticeable when applied. I like this one more, simply because of the higher SPF, and the amount in the tube is 30ml more than the PC one (despite the same price). Otherwise, I feel like the two products are fairly comparable, although the PC one might perform better as a base for makeup because of it&#x27;s uber-matte finish. This one serves as a good base for makeup too, as it also has a matte finish but it may not be as good as controlling shine throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important that I state clearly that shoppers shouldn&#x27;t expect to get any significant coverage from this product. I&#x27;d say that the coverage is lighter than your average dedicated tinted moisturizer. Simply think of the tint/pigment in this product as a means to counteract the whitecast that most physical sunblocks tend to have.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve EVER used!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once--but it was great.  I was in the water at Lake Tahoe for at least 1/2 hour and I had no burn at all.  The tinting is pleasant--not too much.  I&#x27;m fair skinned, and it didn&#x27;t look like bronzer--thank Goodness!  I love all the EltaMD products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I use this product as my make-up as well as my sunscreen.  I love it.  It was much cheaper buying it through Amazon so I will be it through Amazon every time.</li>
    <li> I have officially switched sunscreens to Eltamd!  I was a devout Neova fan, until I tried this.  Both are good, but I prefer the color of Eltamd-  Neova has a more peachy tone, and this works better on my very fair but actually olive based complexion.  This stuff is all the make up I want, in addition to being a really effective sunscreen.  I love the fact that it is an actual physical barrier sunscreen.  And the final difference:  this stuff is actually less expensive!</li>
    <li> Excellent Sun screen.  It is not greasy and once applied you don&#x27;t even notice that you have it on your skin.  Resists perspiration and stays on all day.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and I depend heavily on this product year round to protect me from harmful sun rays and to help condition my skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is my version of a BB-cream! It provides a wonderful light coverage that matches my light skin perfectly. It blends in naturally -- I&#x27;ve never once noticed it. It definitely adds a bit of shine, but sometimes I actually like the dewy effect. Other times a soft dusting of powder more than does the trick of mattifying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing about this sunscreen, however, is how effective it is. I&#x27;ve done hundreds of hours of research on skincare and wrinkle-prevention, and I&#x27;ve learned that UV damage is responsible for a huge majority of the aging we see on our skin. Natural aging (getting older) causes our skin to become lax and loose, but fine lines and wrinkles result almost entirely from sun exposure. I read a study that claimed that humans would not develop wrinkles until age 70 if not for UV exposure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I put a lot of time and effort into finding a good sunscreen. I have super-fair skin that burns after minutes in the sun, and no sunscreen, no matter how high the SPF, was doing the trick for me. But when I switched to a &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; zinc-oxide sunscreen, suddenly I could spend hours in the sun with no burning! There is also controversy around chemical sunscreens and whether they actually increase the amount of free-radicals in your skin, so I&#x27;m happy to use a physical sunblock. My crazy Holistic, all-natural hippie friends refuse to use anything but physical sunscreens. Me, I would slather any chemical on my skin as long as it prevented wrinkles! I&#x27;m all about clinical research and results, and this sunblock wins on both those counts. Great ingredients, great protection, nice natural coverage. Recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite, not too greasy. Great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for four years. I like the color and the high SPF.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear tinted lotions, but the texture and light coverage this one provides works well for me. I am very fair, but the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; formula gives me just enough coverage without darkening my skin awkwardly.</li>
    <li> It dries my skin out and hard to wash off at night.</li>
    <li> I was a little afraid to try this sunscreen at first, since it is a tinted product and I am a pale girl. I honestly would rather deal with a white cast that I can put make up over most days, rather than have a tint, but my options are very limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this product. It looks very dark when I first squeeze some out onto my hand, but it blends in pretty well into my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me shiny. I&#x27;ve had other sunscreens that left me so sticky I had to put on insane amounts of powder to balance it out, which left me looking cakey. This one works well under makeup and dries pretty quickly, even when putting the proper 1/4 of a teaspoon on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a little bit of trouble getting the full amount applied without looking streaky at first, but then I starting applying it half at a time, and that fixed my problem. I think a better sunscreen is out there, but for now, I&#x27;ll be sticking with the EltaMD Physical.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is better than any I have used before. I have acne prone skin and this product has never made me break out. All other sunscreens I have tried have clogged my pores, even when they say they won&#x27;t. But Eltamd UV Physical actually doesn&#x27;t clog pores or cause extra oil production. The tint is not noticeable at all on my skin and I am very fare.</li>
    <li> Light weight and just enough color to smooth out my entire complexion. I was hesitant to use this because I couldn&#x27;t choose the color I thought I&#x27;d need. What a surprise when I saw how smoothly the color mixed with the moisturizer on my skin. It feels light, not overdone. Sometimes I add a blusher/bronzer to make the color richer. It&#x27;s so nice to get compliments on my skin even from people I know well. I started using this product at the advice of my dermatologist. Now I recommend it to all my fans.</li>
    <li> Have to use physical sunscreen as chemical sunscreens cause my eyes to sting.  Complained to dermatologist that I was tired of having a chalky white face and he gave me a sample of the Elta MD for the face.  It was not chemical free and stung my eyes (also SPF only 30) but I loved the smooth micronized formula.  So did some research and found the Elta MD UV Physical SPF 41.  Not as smooth as the other formula but still a big improvement.  And the tint is not too dark for my fair skin.  Since it is expensive, I just use it for my face and neck but put Blue Lizard (another good product)on the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> I use this after the gym.  It soaks nicely into my skin without feeling chalky or greasy, it&#x27;s just pleasant.  It gives me a light coverage to help even out my face (especially post-gym red face), and I appreciate that when I leave I&#x27;m also protected from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is between fair and medium but this blends so lightly that I imagine it working for a wide range of skin tones without giving you the look of wrong-colored foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only need a small amount so it seems like it will last awhile and definitely give me my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give Elta MD&#x27;s UV Phys SPF 41 10 stars!!!  I have searched forever for a sunblock like this.  I&#x27;ve tried Jan Marini, Neova Ti-Silc, Neurtogena, Anthelios--You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  None of them hold a candle to this sunblock.  First of all, the fact that there are no chemicals, make this wonderful for sensitive skin that is being treated with Retin-A, or other skin care products that make skin irritated/sensitive, but require that you use a daily sunscreen.  I also suffer from Melasma that requires a physical block with high percentage of zinc oxide.  This fits the bill there, too.  It&#x27;s tinted, which is a nice change from the chalky white associated with physical sunblocks.  I have light olive-toned skin and it&#x27;s almost like wearing a tinted moisturizer with a slight sheen. After applying it, i use a powder to \\&quot;set\\&quot; it and that&#x27;s it.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about this, don&#x27;t hesitate.  You won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Really good one.&lt;br /&gt;It is priced very reasonably, has great texture (tinted and smooth).&lt;br /&gt;It is a good choice if you need mineral sun protection for an outdoor day and do not care for make up for this day.&lt;br /&gt;Not so good if you&#x27;re planning to combine outdoor activities and some fancy activitites that involve make up and glam. I guess this is the problem for any mineral sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, of all mineral sun protection products - this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I discovered this sunscreen/ nice makeup base three years ago.  Now all my daughters use as well!  Fabulous!</li>
    <li> Awesome sunscreen, purely physical. Goes on well under makeup. The tinting is pretty light/fair, but it is much better than having a white-cast and after a few minutes it isn&#x27;t noticeable at all. I&#x27;m definitely going to reorder this and more eltaMD products in the future.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my face as melasma is new to me. This works great when in the sun. So great in fact, that my body ended up with a tan and my face did not (nothing makeup can&#x27;t handle). Of course, I&#x27;m sure you can use this wherever you want. It works for what I need it for and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time,I love it!</li>
    <li> No breakouts. Tinted and nice moisturizer. Lasts Long time. Wish a little higher in SPF and choice of slightly darker shade, however, still Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Always had trouble with breakouts using similar products.  Not from this one.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried countless facial sunscreens and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I have sensitive acne prone skin. It appears highly pigmented when you squeeze it out, but blends in very nicely. I&#x27;ve been using the same tube for several months so it seems like the amount of product is a good value, too.</li>
    <li> Great facial sunscreen! It was recommended by a doctor. It costs quite a bit, but I must avoid the sun and with this cream and a broad brimmed hat, I can venture out. When the tube seems empty, cut it with a scissors and get the remainder.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now. I absolutely love it! While I have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin, this does not irritate my skin. I would not even consider using another product!</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen, minimal coverage from tint. Goes on smooth with no fragrance. Have purchased several times and given as gifts. My mom uses it as well. Great for FL summers</li>
    <li> This tinted sunscreen is great.  I usually wear it as foundation and sunscreen together.  It saves a step of putting foundation and I know I&#x27;m protecting my skin.  It goes on smooth and disappears.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff recommended by my dermatologist.  So glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> This product tends to separate (the pigment from the oil) and it sat on top of my skin and didn&#x27;t blend well.  It does have great sun protection though.</li>
    <li> The latest tech says SPF plus titanium is the best. Elta md is all that. It has colorant in it that matches skin tone so you don&#x27;t appear &#x27;ghostlike&#x27; .  Does the job for sun protection for long hours in the sun.  Love the lite feel and protection. Have a tube at home and in the golf locker.  It&#x27;s the best for face protection.</li>
    <li> Use this every summer after learning about it from my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I use in place of foundation in the summer so I have protection and light coverage too.</li>
    <li> Reorder of a gift for my mother in law.</li>
    <li> NOT greasy, applies easily, and prevents burn with chemical and oil free antioxidants.  Don&#x27;t let the &#x27;tinted&#x27; deter you from purchasing this product.  The &#x27;tint&#x27; disappears when lightly massaged into skin.  My skin is light and slightly oily.  One of my friends used this product but didn&#x27;t have the same good results for her skin.  Purchased in 2014, expiration date 2017.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have used many different brands of sunscreen, this is by far my favorite!! Can be a little clogging, but use astringent after cleansing and not a problem. Definitely a must have</li>
    <li> If you are trying to keep sun damage at as minimum this is a great product to buy. I have very sensitive skin and this is pretty much the only sunscreen that I can wear on my face without getting an adverse reaction.This one is lightly tinted which is nice if you want a natural look. This product will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It is slightly tinted and does not cause any acne.  However, the tint does come off on your clothes if you rub any fabric across your face.  It sweats off.</li>
    <li> The product feels good but the color is too mild and leaves my skin with an even lighter color, dull to me more precise. I have a light to medium skin tone, it might works well for those with super light skin tones. Quite disappointed to be honest, especially after reading all the great comments.</li>
    <li> Great product because of the Tint color. High amount of Zink which is most important.</li>
    <li> Bought this instead of my usual Physical Obagi sunscreen to save on cost.  I like the tint, it matches my already tan face.  Also I like that it is waterproof, which is great in a hot humid climate.  It is also not as thick as the obagi</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and I like the light feel, great coverage and tinted look.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I put on daily.  It has a light pigment in it that somewhat covers some of the sun spots and other skin damage on my face. This product protects my face as I stand on the sidelines of outside sporting events each weekend.  I do put on a heavier SPF 70 zinc sunscreen when I know that I&#x27;m going to be in the direct sun all day.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have had no reaction. Seems to provide protection even in high altitude. Wasn&#x27;t quite expecting the tint.</li>
    <li> I use this cream to go out or party. work as BB CREAM and water and sweat prove for 40 mins. Most of all looks so natual.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It moisturizes, protects from sun, and adds a tint of color that for me suffices as foundation.  Love this product. I am 60 years old with sensitive skin, large pores, and rosacea. This is truly the only kind of foundation-ish stuff that doesn&#x27;t settle in my pores.</li>
    <li> I thought I would let others know that as of today (3/28/12), the ingredients in this newer formulation do not match those listed on the website.  They have taken out the retinyl palmitate (probably because of the fears that it is a dangerous substance in sunscreens, though I don&#x27;t think there is a definitive consensus on that).  But at least for me, this formulation is very drying to my skin, and, as others have mentioned, a bit hard to get off.  I used it on my kids for a week and I could see their skin get drier and take on an \\&quot;ashy\\&quot; look (especially at the neck).  Otherwise, it seems to work fine as a sunscreen.  The tint is non-obtrusive.  I think you will have to try for yourself to see if it works for you.  FYI, the new ingredients (off the back of the box) are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active: Zinc Oxide (9%), Titanium Dioxide(7%); Inactive:  Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, iron oxide, isopropyl palmitate, lecithin, linoleic acid, methicone, octyl stearate, octyldodecyl neopentanoate, oleth-3 phosphate, perfluoronyonyl dimethicone, phenoxyexthanol, polyacrylate 13/polyisobutene/polysorbate 20, purified water, quercetin, sodium hydroxide, thioctic acid (alpha lipoic acid), triethoxycaprylylsilane.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, love it, will use it forever!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my skin absorbs the product,  it&#x27;s so light and non-greasy!!</li>
    <li> After trying multiple physical sunblocks (those with titanium &amp; zinc oxides), this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Due to melasma, physical sunscreen is an absolute must.  This one has a nice consistency coming out of the tube.  Its tint seemed too dark at first...but it blends in very well, for my very fair skin.  I can wear it with or without makeup all day long with no sensitivity, irritation or oily feel later in the day.  And the price is good for a large tube...compared to other products that are only a few dollars cheaper, for a much smaller tube. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this great product.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. it&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin and also gives and little coverage like a tinted moisturizer.The only drawback is that it gets a bit yucky when you reapply often.</li>
    <li> By far the best sunscreen on the planet!  I&#x27;ll never use anything else...  I use it as my foundation make-up since the tint is perfect and the protection lasts all day even in the hot Arizona sun.  I pray they never discontinue this product (bite my tongue!).  Thanks, EltaMD.</li>
    <li> The idea is great, but this doesn&#x27;t blend very well on the face (leaves white marks). It&#x27;s hard to blend with other producers as well. I found using a small amount works better, though I like being more liberal with sunscreen (sun damage is the #1 cause of premature wrinkles!). The tint barely hides anything. My search for the perfect facial sunscreen is not over.</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely and as quality as the same product I get from my dermatologist and pay double for. Have ordered twice and will continue.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Face doesn&#x27;t appear white as it does with other zinc products</li>
    <li> This is such great stuff. Perfect coverage, not too thick and perfect tint. So happy I discovered this!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist a couple of years ago.  Really like it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the first sunscreens I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause my eczema or bumps to break out on my face. Love the slight skin tint it has to it also!</li>
    <li> Great physical sun block for those, like me, who prefer this to the sun screen.  My skin can be sensitive to the chemicals in the sun screens.  This sun block feels light, not too oily, goes on smoothly, blends into skin well.  I find the tint to be so light as to hardly be noticeable, but my daughter finds it enough to use as light makeup on a casual day.  I use it daily on my face, throat, and arms and legs as well.  I have been using it for over a year now.  Love it, and I think the price is reasonable for such a good product.</li>
    <li> Love! My dermatologist recommended this product to me and I was happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very good recommended by my dermatologist and it works good for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for many years and love it.  However when I opened this package I had great difficulty squeezing the cream out, and for the first few days I used it, it came out dry and not creamy.  After several more uses when that the tube was already less than half full, I realized that I had been sent a tube that was only partially filled and was dried out.  I think that I should be sent a replacement.</li>
    <li> This worked well because of the light tint in the formula.  It isn&#x27;t greasy.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for my skin.  It goes on a little light (for my skin color) and has a matt finish. It is not greasy but best of all it does not run into my eyes!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve gone through so many sunscreens but all of them either sting my eyes or turn my face white (especially when jogging). i purchased this product after reading all the positive reviews and i could not agree more - this sunscreen has titanium and zinc oxide, doesn&#x27;t turn your face white like the other brands.  prior to this, i was using the neutrogena baby sunblock, which was great but left my face looking like a sloppy geisha.  i&#x27;m east asian with medium skin tone (mac nc45) and although this sunscreen can be a little pale/ashy, don&#x27;t use too much and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does not bother my sensitive skin, and the tint looks natural. The tube has a lot in it, and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s great by itself or under makeup - not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> So glad to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting my ultra sensitive skin.  More expensive than I&#x27;d like, but after noticing my cabinet full of partially used bottles of other &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; sunscreens, this looks to be a bargain.  Item was shipped quickly &amp; is not at all close to the expiration date.</li>
    <li> This sunblock is like wearing nothing!  Love the fact it has a little color, goes on very easy, and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This is soothing, light and airy on the skin, slightly moist, and gives a very light neutralizing finish to the skin-not like foundation, more like a BB or CC cream.  You need very little, like a small pea size for face and neck.  If you&#x27;re really oily you may want to use an oil-control moisturizer/oil-absorbing powder with it, but it&#x27;s really quite a lovely product-I don&#x27;t think I would use anything else on my oily/sensitized skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this sun screen for 2 years, this is a good and natural one.,.</li>
    <li> This is great sunscreen, my new favorite.  It is very lightweight on your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like sunscreen - I know you know what I mean.  It is very lightly tinted.  I have pretty pale skin and it is not too tinted for me to use, my husband even likes it.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I love the tinted moisturizer. Just a small amount is needed to protect the face, neck and chest and even out skin tone. It is the only sunscreen my daughter can wear that does not cause a break out.</li>
    <li> I use this product instead of foundation, and have never gotten sunburned (even in 100 degree weather or snowboarding in the mountains of Colorado.) Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and has a nice light coverage that is very natural. Doesn&#x27;t smear or get yucky as the day goes on. Wish they had a full makeup line...I&#x27;d buy it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen and you can get 2 in 1 product because it&#x27;s slightly tinted, so you don&#x27;t have to wear make-up.</li>
    <li> Has good content for your skin works beautifully.</li>
    <li> All in one moisturizer, broad band sunscreen and foundation. I love this product so much!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for high altitude sun protection due to the ingredients which don&#x27;t break down. I know I got sun tanned while using the ATHELIOS SPF 60 last year when I was  at high elevation and he said that the sunscreen I had used wasn&#x27;t good for trekkers or climbers.  I am hoping this one works!!!! When I sampled it at the office, it was not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will write a post after I&#x27;ve used it in high altitude.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This product is very mild to rosacea skin, and it lights up my facial tone as well. The formula is non-greasy, and thin. It is comfortable to wear the whole day long (with one re-apply at noon time). I would recommend it to both healthy skin and acne/rosacea skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I could live without this. I don&#x27;t like wearing a lot of makeup, but I need SPF (the more the better). This tinted sunscreen is light but has good coverage. I layer it over a Korean BB cream like Missha, so it&#x27;s great on vacation (fits in the security 1 qt bag, better than sunscreen and foundation or coverup together). And best of all, it&#x27;s affordable. Originally became aware of it at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. Can&#x27;t get a better recommendation than that.</li>
    <li> This feels nice going on and doesn&#x27;t make me look whitish from the zinc oxide.  However it itches and irritates my skin after half an hour.  It contains citric acid which is probably why I feel so itchy</li>
    <li> not much to wwrite home about really, best to buy the cheaper ones</li>
    <li> this product goes on smooth and silky</li>
    <li> I love this product! The tint is just right for my skin so I can actually use it instead of a heavier makeup foundation. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like some other products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and expected. And a convenient way to get it delivered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toss up between this and Clear Choice.  Clear Choice smells amazing and is super light weight.  EltaMD has no scent, is not greasy, but does have some weight to it - works almost like a nice foundation!</li>
    <li> i use this as part of my daily routine after putting on my moisterizer. the tint is perfect. non-greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
    <li> Good if you want a tinted UV Block.  Doesn&#x27;t adhere to skin or sink in as easily as EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46, at least in my experience.  Useful product for a good price though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m already on my second tube of the year. Really glad I stumbled upon this. Doesn&#x27;t leave white marks and blends in easily. Five thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I prefer the tinted, you really don&#x27;t have to apply alot of makeup</li>
    <li> I like Elta&#x27;s products, but I don&#x27;t love this sunscreen.  It leaves a slightly chalky feeling on my skin, and I feel as though I need to be careful not to get the tint on my clothing throughout the day.  I also don&#x27;t feel comfortable working out and sweating a lot in this sunscreen as I don&#x27;t want a mess of color on the clothes around my head and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you need to be careful about blending when applying this, also, as color will stick in eyebrows and around any area of your face that has fine hairs.  Seems to work best to apply 15-30 min before getting dressed or applying makeup so that it has a chance to dry and set onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is okay.  I&#x27;m trying to use it up quickly, and I will order the UV Physical non-tinted next time to see if that&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Elta product that I love is their Elta UV Sport for outdoor sports/activities.  It&#x27;s extremely waterproof and long-lasting, but prob not for everyday, under-makeup use.</li>
    <li> Serves a dual purpose.  As a makeup and sunblock</li>
    <li> Great facial sunscreen!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It irritates my skin as soon as I put this on my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to those who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best zinc titanium sunblock I could find. Costs much less then cosmetic store ones. All the good stuff in it.</li>
    <li> I love all Elta MD products - and they make the best sunscreens on the market.  This product is an extremely effective sunscreen for the face.  It is lightweight and goes on evenly.  However, it is not my favorite Elta facial sunscreen because it makes my skin look pasty and sallow, even with the tint.  So I prefer the UV Clear and the UV Shield for me.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite sunblock!  It goes on creamy and light, but never oily.  It absorbs quickly and has a little tint which enhances my skin when I don&#x27;t have time to put on make-up.  This is the brand my dermatologist recommends, too.</li>
    <li> This certainly worked well but know that it&#x27;s not the best for those of us with very oily skin. There are better sunscreens out there for us. But for the average person with combo skin in need of a good sunscreen, yes, this will work very well for you.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was a sunscreen moisturizer with a slight tint to it. It&#x27;s more like traditional foundation. Not sure how well it prevents sunburns since I didn&#x27;t use it long. It made my skin really dry and I did experience a breakout.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for after laser processes.</li>
    <li> This is positively the best Sunscreen I have ever used and I have used many brands.  I putit on in the morning and go out for4 hours in the hot Arizona sun and never get even pink. I have used many Sun Screens that I think cause my skin to burn but Eltamd  UV Physical SPF 41 protects my skin. I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> the very best  sunblock there is,,, medical grade also which I trust my skin to, non irritating and chemical free which is a plus for me..</li>
    <li> Such a nice \\&quot;finish\\&quot; that I often use it as my foundation even when I&#x27;m not going out into the sun. I have fair skin with a pink tone and it is neutral but does help tone down the pink nicely. Since it has a little color to it you really can only see if it works for your skin tone by trying it. Oh yes, and it works great as a sunblock.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, no muss no fuss, gives my tinting so I don&#x27;t have to wear make-up and pretty much blocks out the sun completely on my face.</li>
    <li> I tend to have combination skin that is prone to breakouts. This product doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It dries to a soft, dewy finish with just a light tint. (I have very fair skin.) I love that it&#x27;s oil-free, paraben-free, fragrance-free, and chemical-free. It&#x27;s a brand I trust. I would definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/13 update. I have reordered. I&#x27;m seriously addicted to this product. Still no drawbacks to use--no irritation or breakouts. I love that it doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate like chemical sunscreen can, and it does a great job protecting my skin from sun exposure. The only time I use a chemical sunscreen when I&#x27;m out running or biking for extended periods of time. The EltaMD says you should reapply after 40 minutes of sweat, etc. My chemical sunscreen gives me 80 minutes.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  No chemicals, light tint helps hide imperfections, and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out.  High percentages of titanium and zinc for excellent UVA and UVB coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this before and wanted to re-stock my supply! It&#x27;s smooth coverage and great protection too.  A nice product!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products. My mom is now in love with this too.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Recommended by our dermatologist.  Something my husband will actually use!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Not oily has a tint so can worn as a moisturizer, base and sunscreen !! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sunblock. My dermatologist sells it, but it is cheaper on Amazon. It&#x27;s tinted which helps you see the spots you&#x27;ve missed. Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. It&#x27;s a physical skin block which I feel more comfortable about as opposed to chemical blocks. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried an immeasurable amount of different types of sunscreens in hopes that one day I would find one that wasn&#x27;t greasy, too-dry, etc. It&#x27;s true that one should always wear sunscreen, but it was so hard to apply it daily when it felt so WRONG. All of the other products felt like I had this disgusting additional layer on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came Elta MD. I love this sunscreen to the point where I get excited to apply it each morning. It&#x27;s lightweight, is the perfect balance between greasy and dry, has a flattering tint, is longlasting, and overall makes my skin feel healthy and vibrant. I use it over my rich face cream and my skin feels like there&#x27;s nothing on it. I am a huge fan of all Elta MD products and sincerely believe that they have created the best skincare line.</li>
    <li> Awesome sunscreen for those needing non-irritating, non-chemical sun protection! I love that it is all natural and non-chemical protection with a tinted base.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever. I originally found it because my derm reco&#x27;d it. I wear it almost every day and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Fantastic,,,,, I will never wear makeup again</li>
    <li> This product has given me more skin irritations than I have had ever.  It also kind of stings after using it for a week.  I can not recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.  I have had serious basal cell carcenoma, so what do I use now.  I find it hard to believe the recommendations of anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it has two important ingredients most helpful for blocking the sun&#x27;s rays. It is lightly tinted and does not give the white appearance that most sun blocks give.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin, so any chemical sunscreens make my skin break out, this one didn&#x27;t, tinted cream looked good on my skin and gave it a glow, the only problem I have now is future health concern as many issues around zinc and titanium particles arises being carcinogens.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s tinted.</li>
    <li> love the Elta products and this is no exception - at a very good price.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite, been using it for years.  It was difficult to find, but now buying through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect for using at the beach or somewhere that you really don&#x27;t want to look like you have makeup on.  Made my foundation look cakey on top of it.</li>
    <li> I have been a sunscreen fanatic for 30 years, but have had difficulty finding sunscreens that don&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts. I have also been challenged to find a foundation that matched my lightish, pinkish, beigeish skin, and didn&#x27;t settle into my aging skin. This product has been the answer to all my problems! It also seems to act as a primer, and makes my face and neck appear smoother. I first bought it at my dermatologist&#x27;s, but it is less expensive on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat: I think it is best for fairly light skin.</li>
    <li> I like it. recommended.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for outdoor activities. Very mild on sensitive skin. No scent which is good.</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, makes my skin glow while protecting it without harsh chemicals and the ONLY spf out there that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!!!! love it!!!! use this instead of BB cream or makeup sometimes!!</li>
    <li> I got to try a sample of this form  a dermatologist and was hooked ever since. The best one ever, plus it is lightly tinted. Even if you don&#x27;t wear any powder after the moisturizer your face doesn&#x27;t shine or look oily. Best price here in amazon too!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen with a nice tint. Very moisturizing, unlike other high end sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I had tried a few samples from my dermatologist and thought I&#x27;d like a tube of this.  I am disappointed in the color and feel.  I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula since my sample or what?  It is a good product - just don&#x27;t like it as much as I thought I would.</li>
    <li> My skin cancer had a sample of this product and I tried it and was hooked. I recommend it.  It has a nice tint and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover your face.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with an oily t-zone, and find that almost all foundations (even oil-free ones) cause break outs. Murad&#x27;s tinted sunblock worked well--but was of course discontinued. This sunblock  does a lovely job of evening out skin tone (it needs to be reapplied during the day, but you should reapply sunblock), has a good SPF--and does not make me break out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great sunscreen and the light tint allows you to wear it without a foundation. Also because it is light if you wanted to wear your foundation it doesn&#x27;t  have the heavy look of toouch makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this product !!! It&#x27;s not sticky or shiny and it makes a great under makeup cream . It has a slight whitish finish due to the zink in it and that can actually work as a brightened under foundation  I will never use any other uv block on my face again</li>
    <li> This is what I use on a regular basis, I have purchased it for years. No aroma, tinted and good consistency. My dermatologist told me to make sure Im using a physical sunscreen (as opposed to a chemical one) and this does have zinc oxide in it, which blocks the harmful rays. Normally those kinds are super thick, white, etc. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Excellent light coverage and tint. It was recommended by my dermatologist after laser treatment. Economical because this is a large and long-lasting tube.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday face sunscreen.  It is very light weight, and the slight tint is nice - barely noticeable.  I wear it over my moisturizer - either under my make up or with no make up.  It also works well on my arm surgery scar, and the light tint helps to blend it in.  It was recommended by my dermatologist, but less cost on amazon than the doctors office.</li>
    <li> I learned about this sunscreen while researching the best sunscreens for melasma. I really love this. It has a slight tint in it which seems to even out skintone without really seeing the tint on your face. I have light/medium skin though so I don&#x27;t know for sure if it would show on very pale skin.</li>
    <li> Great product not as heavy as other products I have tried. Like that it is tinted</li>
    <li> I use this tinted sunscreen daily on my face-neck-chest and gave up foundation. Great stuff. Goes on smoothly and makes the skintone look even. Does not clog pores or smell bad. It makes your skin a little shiny so you need some powder. It also makes sun spots on the chest less noticable. I never burn with this product and i only apply in the morning.</li>
    <li> Tried the sample at Dr office and love it. No too grease, easy to absorb, a little tint, just right!</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years. I break out easily and have allergies. This product  works as promised.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it is very satisfactory.  I really like that it has color added and I can use it as a foundation.</li>
    <li> I read an article where several female dermatologists used this sunscreen, so I thought I would order it.  It blends okay and has a tiny sheen, if you are wearing it bare-faced.  However, it does not blend very well if you are wearing it over moisturizer (which is a must for me) and/or under make-up.  It causes the make-up to separate--not an attractive look.  So, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product.  It is very lightweight and has a bit of a tint.  It&#x27;s nice to wear when you go swimming and can&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Tinted version for when you are wanting light coverage, and are running errands without a lot of makeup.  Does not streak if you sweat,</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, with the tint already in it, I don&#x27;t use foundation on certain days.  a little goes a long way. I saw some of the reviews about how it made them look white or chalky.  I do not have that problem.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, blemish-prone, dry-patchy skin.  I changed a few things in my skin-regiment including switching to this face sunscreen and now my skin is much more manageable.  I got this tinted one because I was hoping that I&#x27;d be able to wear it alone on some days.  But I found that it does initially leave a white cast and does not cover much of anything (I have a little redness in the nose area and a few acne scars here and there).  I mix in a little of a light-medium coverage foundation and that seems to do the trick.  It gives me a natural even-tone that&#x27;s protected from the sun&#x27;s effects.  I wear this every day.  Next time, I may try the untinted one since it&#x27;s a little cheaper and the tint in this one doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> Great Natural sunblock.  It does make the color of your skin look a little off but after you apply your powder it works.</li>
    <li> Love it! Natural looking</li>
    <li> I bought this product on recommendation of a doctor friend who is in the skin care industry, and absolutely love it.  It goes on so smoothly and leaves your skin with a nice texture, albeit light color given the physical blockers it contains.  But this is my go-to now, and a great value vis-a-vis other products out there.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have super sensitive skin and this works for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I&#x27;m a red-haired man with the skin tone of copy paper. Before this, I was using Lubriderm SPF 15 moisturizer once a day. She suggested SPF 30 or higher, and that a physical barrier sunscreen like this with titanium dioxide would be preferable to the conventional kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In brief: I like it. It&#x27;s flattering. Men generally don&#x27;t wear makeup, but we&#x27;re not all above vanity. The tinting in this sunscreen softens three decades of sun wear and freckles. It also doesn&#x27;t sting if your face is tender from some sort of skin treatment. The only catch is that it tends to pill in areas with skin flaking. Before I started using a retinoid, that was my nose. Moisturizer helps if applied first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it solely on my face. It spreads very thinly. Three ounces doesn&#x27;t seem like much, but each of the 0.07 ounce sample packages my dermatologist gave me lasted for three days of use on my face. I use conventional sunscreen (Walgreens Sheer 55-- excellent stuff) for my arms and less easily-damaged areas. The trick here is to buy a formulation that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a swimming pool. This EltaMD doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial sunscreen that is moist, has a light tint, and water resistant. My favorite sunscreen has been Ti-Silc for years.  unfortunately Ti-silc has been changed over the years.  Though EltaMD is OK, it is not as good as the original Ti-Silc.</li>
    <li> Love the product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This suncreen (EltaMD UV PHysical SPF 41) does not contain the irritating fragrances/chemical odors that many sunscreens contain, so I don&#x27;t get the headaches I usually get from sunscreen.  I like the look of the slight tint on my face.  However, it is very difficult to remove and seems to be drying to my skin. In addition, it seemed to worsen my clogged pores.  I have switched to EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 and am much happier with it.</li>
    <li> As I expected , just a little tiny drop covers a lot ! Nice clean feeling  , non grasy at all</li>
    <li> Finding this product made me into a goddess as far as my sensitive-skinned husband is concerned.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tinted sunscreen (and I have tried many).  BB creams are too greasy for me.  This is very lightweight and provides great sun protection without really being visible.  It is gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good physical sunscreen, since chemical sunscreens tend to make my skin red and irritated. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the one for me. The tint is too dark and made my skin look orange. &amp;#34;Lightly tinted&amp;#34; is not an accurate description; the coverage was almost foundation-like. I&#x27;ve tried BB creams that are less tinted. It also caused some cystic acne. So if you&#x27;re acne-prone, I highly recommend that you skip this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good aspect of this sunscreen is that it didn&#x27;t cause the irritation that some other sunscreens do, but getting cystic acne instead is not a good trade-off.</li>
    <li> This tinted sunscreen is my new make-up.  It works best for light-skinned women, especially the freckled type.  I put it on my face and neck right after my shower with a blotted dry but still hydrated face.  After I&#x27;m done doing my hair, etc., I add a bit more to my nose, put on some blush and SPF lipstick and I&#x27;m ready to go.  I live in Arizona, so this is important all year, but perfect for summers anywhere.  If I&#x27;m going to be doing more than shopping trips, a quick in and out of the car, then I wear a hat, like the&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000EIU3QE Adventure Hat by Sunday Afternoon Hats]]&lt;br /&gt;This is a physical-blocking zinc and titanium product, so no need to wait 20 minutes to go outside.</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality physical sunscreen.  Because it is tinted, it does not turn my face white like others of it&#x27;s type.  I do wish it came in a darker shade.  I have a light olive complexion and this is just a little too light.</li>
    <li> Love this product, love all of EltaMD&#x27;s products. It has just a hint of tint, so on some days it&#x27;s all I wear. I also use EltaMD&#x27;s &amp;#34;MELTING&amp;#34; moisturizer. It looks and feels like vaseline but after a few minutes your skin feels well hydrated and it melts into your skin. Because it does hydrate so well and it&#x27;s not expensive, I use a small amount on my feet - makes them look summer fresh.</li>
    <li> I really like the color and consistency of this product. It has a matte finish and helps even out my skin tone. I have fair skin ( irish polish Hungarian) It would probably not work well for an African American person or a dark Italian. I am just assuming because it matches me well. I use it on my face and neck everyday. I only gave it 4 stars right now because I noticed that  I have some dry patches on my cheeks. This is the only thing I changed in my skin care regiment in the past month BUT I was in florida for a week and the water there is harsher than I am used to so I will give it another month and see if that is all it was.  If it continues to dry my skin I am going to have to look for other options but I think this is a great sun block.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality but product in the tube does not last very long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about 9 months, this is my second tube. A little sunscreen goes a long way. This is a tainted sunscreen, when applied it does make the face slightly pale but after about 5 minuted it will blend in with the skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle, low toxin sheerly tinted sunscreen that leaves your face looking effortlessly flawless.  I apply it after using serums and daily moisturizer, since it doesn&#x27;t contain moisturizer itself, it is simply a mineral type barrier in liquid form - doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny film or white cast after absorption either.  If you have oily skin, you may appreciate it&#x27;s matte-ifying properties, for me if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer first, it does dry out my skin.  Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> The tint is perfect to get rid of the blue tinge that often happens with this kind of formula. I won&#x27;t use any other sunscreen. This zinc/titanium oxide formula offers the best coverage, superior coverage over chemical based sunscreens</li>
    <li> I have been using Elta for a long time but I can only find it at dermatologist offices. I purchase from here in between visits. This stuff not only gives me the daily sun protection I need but it stays in place all day. It won&#x27;t even budge underneath my glasses on my nose which is a real issue I have with all makeup. It looks super natural and never breaks me out.</li>
    <li> A favorite of mine and my daughter&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s tinted sheer enough to not resemble foundation and it does a great job at sun protection.  I like the consistency better than the Tizo I used prior to this.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it everyday its like my new BB cream.  I have really sensitive skin and this product does not have any strong odor nor does it cause any kind of irritation to the eyes due to the SPF.  I would highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has exceeded my expectation of the product.</li>
    <li> A co-worker recommended this product to me. We work in a greenhouse so really need good protection from the sun. Its still early in the growing season, but so far I have liked the lightness of this product. It goes on well, protects, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Love ,this product it is so light and adds that little bit of color eliminating the need for foundation.Much better than other products tried</li>
    <li> I never go out without sunscreen.  I use to buy this from my Dr., was so happy when I found this on Amazon.  It has a nice tint, so you can wear it and not wear makeup, goes on very thin and smooth.  Love it</li>
    <li> My skin is super sensitive, my dermatologist suggested I try it. It&#x27;s great, I haven&#x27;t worn make up since I started using this. The light tint serves as foundation my skin looks fresh all day. My make up never looked as fresh or light as this sunscreen  does. I swear my face looks really young and flawless.  I don&#x27;t like wearing make up in summer now I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> Love this face sunscreen.  Has a little tint to it so you do not have to wear anything else. It does appear a little white at first but as you rub it in that quickly goes away.  Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. i use it every day.  it gives good protection from the sun and has a nice tint that evens out skin tone. it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Because I  need SPF Broad Spectrum 41 for my Rosacea.  This works for me.  It also has a nice tint of color so I do not need any makeup.&lt;br /&gt; Bonnie</li>
    <li> I was researching this among other physical sunscreen products (they use zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide as the active ingredients, which are much safer than chemical sunscreens like Avobenzone and Octinoxate). The third ingredient of this sunscreen (ingredients are always listed in descending order of magnitude--the first ingredients listed are the main ones) is Aluminum Hydroxide, the same active ingredient in antiperspirants and probably used for that purpose in this sunscreen. Unfortunately, aluminum accumulates in the body has been linked with various serious diseases, including Alzheimer&#x27;s (aluminum can cross the brain-blood barrier and can accumulate in brain tissues) and various forms of cancer. Use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best physical sunscreen I have found, which continues to be my favorite one even after trying many (many!) others, is Livestrong. It is 20% zinc oxide, leaves no whiteness and leaves your skin nicely hydrated, not oily and not dry/cakey either.</li>
    <li> The best sunblock you can find. The right amount of tint that makes it easy to blend. Non greasy so you can count on a shine free face all day</li>
    <li> Creamy, coverage + SPF 41 &#x3D; perfect combination.  I use it daily and have recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> this one is great because i always seem to have a problem breaking out when it comes to sunscreens, even the ones made for sensitive skin, which i really don&#x27;t think i have. you only need a tiny bit</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the version without the tint, but I actually prefer this one. Tint is very sheer and absorbs well into skin for a very natural look that gives just a little bit of coverage.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for in a great, light weight, tinted sun screen. There is no scent so it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> has good spf, quality company but it kinds makes my skin dry and it kinda feels heavy with the extra sunscreen products</li>
    <li> I need only a tiny amount and it is fine on my very fair skin.  It doesn&#x27;t show dry areas of skin, as do other foundation products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brand! I am 51 with plenty of sun damage from sun worshiping. I use this product instead of foundation. Not so heavy and doesn&#x27;t settle into any wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist used to carry the EltaMD skincare line and this is one of the products that I used to buy from her.  I like that it&#x27;s tinted.  The coverage is very light but it usually evens out the tone of my skin without needing to apply foundation over it.  I like that it goes on smooth and that a little goes a long way.  I guess my only complaint is that just like other sunscreens, you will notice a white tone on your skin after application.  This effect can be easily fixed with a pat of matte powder.</li>
    <li> have been using this for quite some time and have tried other products in between but always come back to this one. Will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> This tinted moisturizer gives you light coverage. I had to set it with mineral powder. I don&#x27;t wear any foundation so I need a great tinted moisturizer. This one was just so sheer. I have light skin with olive undertones so the color wasn&#x27;t right for me. This is perfect for pink undertones with light skin. If you are olive and have darker skin tones this wouldn&#x27;t work. 3 stars for the higher SPF but I&#x27;m not happy with the lack of color options and it&#x27;s very sheer. You need to have flawless skin for this product. The texture is nice because its like a mouse. I never wear foundation and have tried all tinted moisturizers. I like other brands that have more color options and better coverage. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now, recommended by my dermatologist. Not heavy and greasy and provides everyday protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping, but I was less than excited to see I&#x27;d ordered the SPF 41 with a tint.  Yes, it&#x27;s in the middle of the bulleted list.  That&#x27;s my fault, but it really should be in the name, ie:  Eltamd UV Physical SPF 41, 85-Gram (Tinted).</li>
    <li> I live in the desert southwest.  Professional responsibility is to develop business in communities that are one to four hours from my office.  So, lots of windshield time and sun exposure.  Malignant Melanoma (mole not sun caused) diagnosis in 2006.  In and out of remission.  A bunch of clinical trials and other treatments.  Previous trial drugs and treatments did not cause sun sensitivity for me, yet others experienced sensitivity.  I am experiencing a high level of sun sensitivity taking the current trial drug.  Immediately, I began wearing driving gloves made with sun block material and a hat that is in combination with a face and neck protection wrap and also made with imbedded sun block material.  Became too warm wearing the hat and wrap during the summer.  Asked my dermatologist for alternatives.  Her clinical focus is treating patients with conditions of melanoma, dysplastic nevi, Cutaneous T and B cell lymphomas, Appendageal tumors and basal and squamous cell skin cancers.  She told me to try a product with specific levels of zinc and titanium oxides.  My clinical research nurse recommended Eltamd UV Physical SPF 41 because it has those amounts and combinations of oxides and it is effective for her (fair complexion).  I tried one other sun block of my own choice before the referrals but it did not have the recommended levels of oxides.  My face looked like the Joker&#x27;s in Batman after application.  The effectiveness was not good enough.  I have no margin for error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elta works for me under tough and trying circumstances.  I buy a couple of tubes, one for home and one for the office/travel.  I apply Elta about 15 to 30 minutes before leaving the house and again every two hours when traveling.  Okay, tell the truth to shame the devil.  Sometimes I forget and remember as I&#x27;m opening the car door  or soon after and must apply on the fly.  If I work all day in the office I apply in the morning and before I call it a day.  (I must work with the blinds shut and my clients accommodate me by moving our meetings away from sunlight.)  When running weekend errors I apply before leaving the house and after two hours, if I am out that long.  The product has a slight tint and blends well with my skin tone.  I would continue to use the Elta even if my face looked like the Joker&#x27;s because it is all about effectiveness and I do not give a rat&#x27;s you know what about appearance. I did notice that my face felt dryer than usual after I began using Elta.  My fix?  Use a recommended dry skin lotion and switched to a gentler soap. Not perfect but better.  Once in a while, I notice a slight stain on the inside of the shirt&#x27;s collar.  The stain comes out easily with pre-soaking.  Washing Elta off my face is easy.  I do use the product without the sun protection garb but I make sure to apply about 1.5 to 2 times the normal amount and strictly follow the two hour re-application.  I probably use more in an \\&quot;normal\\&quot; application than the other reviewers but that is what makes me feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is laced with personal information but it is important for you to know why I use the product and how it protects the Desert Lab Rat.  Regularly examine your moles, limit exposure to the sun and use Elta Sun Block.  Take care.clients accommodate me by moving our meetings away from sunlight.)

    <li> I use it every day and I love it. It is not greasy at all. Is a must have .</li>
    <li> My favorite tint sunblock</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen with tint. It goes on smooth as butter and the tint is quite subtle. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and it isn&#x27;t greasy and goes on easily.  It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m glad I was introduced to it.  It actually goes on like a tinted moisturizer.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The tint is perfect for evening out my reddish skin tone.  I still turned a little pink if I was in the sun for an extended period of time and the tint does rub off on things.  My issue though was that it is very drying.  Even when mixed or spread on top of a moisturizer or grapeseed oil, my skin was flaky within a few hours, every time.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pros: non-comedogenic, staying power, fragrance-free, all-physical sunscreen, non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: a bit chalky, a bit drying (works well over a moisturizer but I would recommend letting the moisturizer absorb before putting this on to prevent pilling), clings to my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; (but I have this issue with a lot of powders and foundations... I usually don&#x27;t wear foundation).  I&#x27;m pale but olive-undertoned and though the color is really nice out of the tube I look a bit purpley when it&#x27;s rubbed in.  I&#x27;m not sure how darker skin tones would fare with this sunscreen tbh... I&#x27;d recommend getting a sample first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this all-physical sunscreen less than the Solar MD physical gel sunscreen, which has a smoother texture.  Unfortunately they discontinued the tinted version of the Solar MD gel sunscreen, so I figured I&#x27;d try this one.  It&#x27;s a toss-up between the two.  I much prefer the texture of the Solar MD, but it leaves a very slight white cast so not ideal for daily wear.  For daily wear Elta Md UV Shield is a good option (untinted); but my favorite daily sunscreen might be Elta MD UV Clear.  It&#x27;s a mixed physical-chemical sunscreen, so if you&#x27;re open to that look into it.  That one has no tint and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast.  Has a nice does of niacinamide in it too; great for acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you don&#x27;t have dry skin and want an all-physical sunscreen, you may want to give Elta MD UV Physical a try!  Though I wasn&#x27;t 100% pleased with this sunscreen, it is a solid sunscreen and I&#x27;d give it a 3.5 star rating.</li>
    <li> The only tinted, water resistant sunscreen that is reasonably priced. All the others seem to be almost $40 for only 1.5 to 1.75 ounces. (Coola, MD Solar Sciences, La Roche Posey, Jan Marini, even Cotz -- $20 for only 1.5 ounces for crying out loud!!! and it&#x27;s not even water resistant!!)  The tint works for my light to medium skin tone. The Beautypedia review wasn&#x27;t so great on this one, but I use Paula&#x27;s Choice antioxidant serums underneath to counteract the lack there of in this sunscreen. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it, because I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Love all the sunscreens from Elta, great price on Amazon. Wonderful for sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very fair and this does not show up darker on my skin, the slight tint from the minerals blends nicely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tinted sunscreen for over a year now and I love it!  I have very fair, sensitive skin, so I wear it daily--face, neck and chest.  It only gives a slight amount of color, but for casual outdoor activities it is all the &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; I need.  My Bare Minerals foundation goes on nicely when additional coverage is desired.  I always use a light foundation first, let that soak in for a minute or two, then apply sunscreen followed by make-up.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product unless the color is too light for your complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I provide sun coverage with a little tint.  I am always rushing to get ready and I use this product as my lotion, sun screen and founation.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it glides wonderfully and protects my skin very well.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the tint is a little off but it still looks good without makeup...if you don&#x27;t cake it on or anything.</li>
    <li> Second purchase of this item, which was recommended by my Dermatologist, and I love it.  It is very light weight but gives you some coverage...will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I think what I like most about the Elta MD UV Physical is that it is tinted.  I blends well with any skin tone.  To take it off at night, I use a face cleansing wipe first and then use my face wash.  It is scent free and does not leave my skin shiny at all and I have issues with oily skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend this, it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Non greasy tinted sunscreen that feels great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for 3 years and it is great.</li>
    <li> Kept my face well protected from sunburn at the beach during a two-week stay!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin, but I&#x27;m not particularly acne prone. This sunscreen agreed wih my skin and at first I liked that it had a tint because that gave me a bit of color, but ultimately it didn&#x27;t work for me, because the tint rubbed off on my work clothes. Still a good product, just don&#x27;t use it around your collar or rub your face on your sleeve.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. Most face products make me breakout, but this is the exception. Smells nice and even has a little bit of tone. Recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> The tint of this sunscreen is a pretty light color.  During the summer I tend to get dark due to being outdoors.  I&#x27;ve being using the the nontinted sunscreen and like it so well that I decided if I bought the tinted I could use it as a BB creme, but it is too light for me.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen &amp; face cream, but I do not love it as much as TiZo40 which goes on smoother. I still plan on re-ordering because it is half the price of TiZo.</li>
    <li> Nice light smooth feeling on the skin. The tint is just the right amount of color for a bit of coverage.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does not feel too thick on my skin and coverage seems to work well. Dont be surprised that its a tinted cream, appears clear once its used on your skin</li>
    <li> I really like this sunscreen.  You can wear it under makeup and it&#x27;s not shiny and has a tint so you can wear alone.</li>
    <li> I just got this and have used it 3 times.  I like the look and feel of it and cannot see it on my face.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have sensitive skin and use Atralin and this sunscreen helps to protect my skin.  I like the tint on days I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup but still gives a little color.  I buy it often!  My derm recommended it too!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this suncreen.  Live at the ocean, was looking for a high SPF&amp;lt; a tint &amp;lt; and a good safety rating on EWG.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives me all three and a beautiful mat coverage to wear either alone of under make-up.  A total winner!!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for my face I have ever tried. Its light, smooth and covers just enough so you feel like you are wearing makeup. It looks good on your face. I put on a moisturizer under the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;All my friends that have tried it loves it.</li>
    <li> This is like wearing a light foundation with the benefits of a very strong sunscreen.  I wear Almay TLC light/medium pressed powder over the sunscreen.  Its nice because i dont have to put sunscreen on, then liquid foundation.  Real timesaver! The color seemed perfect at first, but now it does seem just a little light when i put it on but my pressed powder makes up the color difference then.  I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection, not geasy and if you sweat you don&#x27;t have to worry that it will burn your eyes.  Been using it for several years now.  It&#x27;s great if you have an allergy to other products because it doesn&#x27;t contain all those seed oils.</li>
    <li> Great SPF cream with just enough tint to use every day and not have to use makeup.  Love it a lot.</li>
    <li> Product is tinted like using foundation. It is not oil base and your face won&#x27;t look shinny after applied the product. Most important my skin is very sensitive, I&#x27;ve tried numerous type of sun screen, this one is truly for sensitive skin, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...especially for those days I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup because I get the sun protection PLUS the tinting hides skin flaws and gives my face a much better look to face the day!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this sunscreen before and used it during pregnancy.  Love this product so I continue purchasing it for daily uses.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and recently ran out.  I usually buy it at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, but they really charge a premium for it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the formulation has changed, or this was a counterfeit.  The sunscreen is rather thin and watery compared to what I had before.  It had been thick and creamy, this is thin.  This version, tinted though it is, looks white when first applied.  I quickly learned to use much less than before to counter that effect, but now I worry that I don&#x27;t have enough on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The printing on the bottle looks over saturated which makes the text appear larger than before.  Maybe I am being too picky, but this is a medically necessary product for me that really needs to work or my condition will get worse.</li>
    <li> This is now my go-to, HG sunscreen. It has a decent score from EWG, protects decently well from UVA and UVB and is a physical sunscreen, which hopefully means that it will last longer than other chemical options, though I still re-apply later in the day. The tint works well enough for my skin tone (it&#x27;s a little dark in the winter and a little light in the summer), but at least it evens everything out a bit. I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen and is very easy on my skin overall. Seriously, this sunscreen has made a huge difference in allowing me to wear protection everyday, rather than when I feel like I have to because of so much sun. My face isn&#x27;t greasy-looking, white cast or chemically-smelling. It just works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is like sunscreen and make-up in one.  It covers your skin well but is very light.  It protects against the sun but gives you a little bit of color and makes your skin look smooth.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best sunscreen product ever.  Went on weightless, did not clog my pores and was a nice gentle cover.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this because I started using the non-tinted EltaMD sunblock/moisturizer and it has been a Godsend.  I have rosacea which causes me terrible breakouts.  This sunblock has a decent amount of zinc in it and totally calms down rosacea.  The tint it perfect- just a nice amount.  I am very pale and its not too dark at all.  It also doesn&#x27;t have that annoying greasy feeling like most sunblocks.</li>
    <li> Love this tinted sunscreen. Wish there were more options than this color, since it&#x27;s a little too light colored on my face. Works well and I like that it&#x27;s a little water resistant too.</li>
    <li> Seems like a very good sunblock.  It sinks in fast, the tint is subtle but does cover up some of my skin&#x27;s array of spots and tonal irregularities.  I assume it does its job as a sunblock. My dermatologist recommended it.  It&#x27;s expensive, though.  Before buying it again I think I&#x27;ll check EWG (Environmental Working Group) to see what if anything they have to say about it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite facial sunscreen.  It has physical sunscreens without the chemical ones.  The product has a slight tint, and it is the most &#x27;invisible&#x27; of all the sunscreens I have ever tried.  (I&#x27;ve tried almost everything from the drugstore to the mall.)&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I&#x27;ve used this for years, and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;Let me dispel some of the bad information in some of these reviews. This sunscreen is matte - it has zero shine. It is somewhat opaque, but all physical sunscreens are. Also, the color descriptions are all over the place. This is by no means dark when you consider the entire population. If you have trouble finding a foundation light enough for you, it may seem dark. But it is actually between fair and medium. I&#x27;m normally a cool, medium tan, and it lightens me slightly. (I wear EL powder foundation over this when I want to look more polished.)&lt;br /&gt;The lotion feels very lightweight, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem removing it with my water-based cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a dry climate or have dry skin, you may have a problem. In the winter, I need to apply two drops of rosehip seed oil to my cheeks before applying this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who sometimes breaks out from products with a lot of silicone, I have no problems with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I wold not consider any other product for my face.  It feels and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that is does not include chemicals and does include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  Goes on easily and because it is tinted sometimes I do not need to apply makeup over the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great product, good value and great seller!</li>
    <li> Recommend to anyone looking for physical sunscreen with a little tint.</li>
    <li> Light and non-greasy. I like it!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product after I had skin cancer, The shipper was quick and had no problems.</li>
    <li> Good product. I love it.</li>
    <li> Ella MD is a brand well endorsed at several dermatology offices(CA, TX ) that I&#x27;ve seen so I looked at all its sun protection products.  Physical sunblock is better than chemical so I bought this tinted version, loved it, and have been wearing it everyday since 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned/mid-forties and get compliments all the time on my nice facial skin, which I attribute to good sunblock ( and hats)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: physical blocker, the tinted cream covers mild imperfections/discolorations but looks natural/doesn&#x27;t make me look like I caked on foundation like the BeBe creams.  I don&#x27;t look pasty and don&#x27;t need face powder when I wear this. I apply this after Cerave moisturizer because this sunblock doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: wish it were non-nano zinc only and didn&#x27;t have any titanium dioxide.  May be too light for darker skinned individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more extreme sun conditions like the beach/water sports/skiing, I would not wear this.  I would wear Livestrong Think Baby/Sport physical sunblock which I put on my girls&#x27; faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to wear this forever and hope it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> My holy grail face sunscreen for rosacea and dry skin in winter. Must use soap and a wash cloth or other gentle abrasive to remove at night but it is so, so worth it. I don&#x27;t use it in summer because if you sweat a lot it can get weird and repel it, so when it&#x27;s hot out I use &amp;#34;La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 50 Mineral Ultra-Light Sunscreen Fluid Tinted&amp;#34;. Definitely worth the price for how long it lasts, even with ritualistic daily use.</li>
    <li> Like others stated, this is the best SPF out there. I love that it has no oxybenzone, oil, or octinoxate. I like the slight tint as well. It evens out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning - it does not really moisturize, so if your skin is dry you probably want to use something else. In general, my skin is not dry, but on the occasional dry days I use something else.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second tube of this.  The one I have now lasted almost a year!  A little goes a long way if you are only using it on your face.  I have very fair skin and it evens my skin tone out well.  I set it with my Gabriel Dual Foundation Powder and my skin looks great.  It is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy.  I read a review on here that the formula changed so I&#x27;m hopeful it doesn&#x27;t change how it works for me.  I would be so sad because this is one of my favorite products.  I&#x27;ll update my review if I see a big difference.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that does not break me out. I love this product and will always choose it over other highly rated, more expensive products (such as SkinCueticals). I usually buy it through my derm for much more expensive than what I can get it for on here. It is a physical, which means no harsh chemicals absorbing into your skin and reacting with it. The tint in it is perfect, and I find the product to be highly moisturizing without the weight that some &#x27;screens will have. Never runs when I sweat, and does not affect my makeup application.. in fact, it usually helps to enhance my foundations and when used alone, gives me skin a brighter, clearer complexion. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular (not tint) Eltamd sunscreen since my dermatologist recommended it and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  I purchased this product not realizing that it was tinted - but it&#x27;s working for me.  I have a light olive complexion and this tinted sunscreen disappears and just makes my skin look a little more smooth and even toned -- and I still get the 41 SPF sunscreen.  I am only going to purchase this tinted sunscreen going forward - I really like it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product every day for a few years now and love it. I use it under my make up and it works great.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, gentle on the skin.  May need a little mineral make-up to cover the slightly chalky tone.</li>
    <li> It protects my skin well for the sun plus the tinted skin color allows me to go without any makeup over this sunscreen...and my skin looks radiant.  My skin doctor recommended it and I love it. Have used it for over 6 months.  This order was a refill.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Amazon is the cheapest place to purchase too.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I particulaly like that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t leave my skin with a whitish tone.  It blends with my own skin color quite&lt;br /&gt;easily.</li>
    <li> I love EltaMD UV Physical SPF 41! I discovered EltaMD about a year ago, from dermatologist at the ocean (when I ran out of my other prescription sunscreen). I&#x27;m near 60 - most people guess I&#x27;m about 45, blond, very, very fair-skinned and have battled eczema my entire life. This entire line of products has protected my skin beautifully. I use the tinted SPF 41 on my face DAILY with no drying or blemish problems. I use my regular facial routine, including moisturizer and the EltaMD last, which I &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; with Jane Iredale&#x27;s SPF sunscreen powder and a wee bit of blush on my cheeks . It doesn&#x27;t take much to achieve total coverage and it blends well. I agree it takes some work to remove it in the evening, but I&#x27;m thrilled that it stays on so well during the day. HINT: I first use a warm washcloth to gently remove as much sunscreen as possible - then I use my Clarisonic to finish the removal process. 2 minutes is all it takes for all day sun protection. I also use the EltaMD water resistant sunscreen for my body when I&#x27;m at the ocean and I&#x27;m constantly in/out of the salt water. It lasts all day and I DON&#x27;T BURN - IT&#x27;S A FANTASTIC LINE.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologist. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a forth year for me using this product. Absolutely love it, and can&#x27;t without it. I am very sensitive, and breakout so easy, but not with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Love the tint. On a good clear skin day , I don&#x27;t need to apply makeup over it. And when going to vacation, this is my makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have used Eltamd for years upon the recommendation of my Dermatologist (my husband and mother now use it too).  The only complaint I have ever had is that the traditional kind makes my skin look a little chalky initially.  This one completely solves that problem and does not cause me to break out (I have very sensitive skin).  I love it!</li>
    <li> I usually have breakouts for other sunscreen, but this has very light texture and I had no breakouts at all!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  First of all it goes on smooth.  The color is so good that I no longer use foundation.  It is light enough that it could probably blend with several skin tones, but is enough to cover up my dark under-eye circles.  The color looks very dark out of the bottle, but it goes on lighter.  I have very very fair skin that is \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot; like and it is just slightly too dark.  However, if I blend under the jaw and wear my hair down, it is not really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/14: Lately this product has been drying out my skin. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because of the product or a change in my skin from treatments at the dermatologist. It has also been severely irritating my eyes when I use it to cover my dark circles. However, this has more to do with my recent development of eye problems that have nothing to do with this product. If you have very sensitive eyes, this may cause irritation.</li>
    <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin.  Most effective sunscreens and tinted sunscreens are too heavy, greasy, and cause burning, and orange or yellow looking skin.  NOT THIS ONE!  It evens out any imperfections in your skin tone and does not feel heavy or cakey on my skin.  It is the only one I have found that is not too dark, orange, or yellow looking on my skin.  My husband even uses it to avoid the white sheen that he normally endures to have sunscreen protection on his face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Elta md UV Physical SPF 41 cream for several years.  It has a very light feel and I use it as my foundation and love the fact that I do not have to use a separate sunscreen. I also love that it uses minerals for the UV protection and works well on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;I use EltaMD and Cotz. Both are recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist due to the high risk I have of skin cancer including malignant melanoma.  I ride motorcycle and so I sweat a lot and, while i reapply it regularly, this does not come off with sweat and has NEVER melted and dripped into my eyes.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen on my fair skinned 6 year old and 8 year old to protect from south Texas sun at the beach all weekend. It gives great sun protection but they both broke out in a red, itchy rash. Their skin is flaky and my 6 year old&#x27;s face is swollen!! I&#x27;m not sure what is in this for the tinting, as they&#x27;d used zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in the past... But beware.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist prescribed this to me. It is a must have product for all we oily skin girls out there. Not only protects me from Sun burn but also acts as a foundation below makeup. I was having a hard time figuring out how to wash it off my skin after use since it appears to be a little tinted. But after using it for 2 months I do not see any harm washing it off just with regular facewash. Remeber to use a little everytime else your face will look white like a ghost. Spread it evenly all over your face and neck and leave home. I am going to buy it again and again. Protects skin from acne eruptions too.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever for not fading!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love the color on my skin.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to wear make-up.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I recommend it to others who wish to keep the sun from damaging their skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and really like it.  I no longer use a foundation as the tint on this helps to even my skin tone.  Also, it&#x27;s great for the sunny states where you should apply sunblock on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Just recently found out I have a lot of contact allergies. I can only wear 2 sunscreens and this one. I received the product quickly and found it to be good.</li>
    <li> And if I were to put anything over it, like a dusting of a darker powder, I&#x27;d break out.  This seems like a good product but my face just looks too pasty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while now and recommended it to all my friends.  It&#x27;s one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.  I no longer use any makeup base, just this.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Good protection from the sun, a hint of well blending color and light weight. This product is great and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen ever for the face... it is flesh tinted so it doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; cast that zinc leaves but provides the same kind of protection.  My husband uses it on his nose for mt. biking... It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> It works just like zinc oxide did when I was a kid. It looks great because you cannot see it. My skin is very sensitive and I used to only be able to use lip sun block on my face without burning my eyes and skin. It stays on in water! My only suggestion for improvement would be different shades or a tint that you could mix in and adjust color to suit your own skin color.</li>
    <li> Works better than normal Banana Boat 45 SPF for every day. No strong odor. Blends in well. Will stain light clothing if not allowed to dry for 10 mins or so.</li>
    <li> Never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> Love using this as my summertime daily moisturizer/sunscreen!!</li>
    <li> I am medium-fair skinned with a small tan and freckles, and this cream does not match my skin tone at all. Usually over-the-counter toners in medium are perfect, but the inorganic sunscreen dominates and gives me a ghostly appearance like I don&#x27;t know how to put on make-up. Granted, it is hard to combine a strong sunscreen with color, I won&#x27;t be using this unless I will be in the sun all day.</li>
    <li> Excellent sun protection! Do you have any skin problem and like to enjoy outdoors? go for it!  I love all the products from Elta. The color is not my skin tone but in 5 min it&#x27;s transparent. I also like the one with Hyaluronic acid. I think it&#x27;s even better for dry skin.</li>
    <li> very happy with product</li>
    <li> The tube is half empty (or half full )&lt;br /&gt;The tube is not sealed&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is not different from I used before</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it has become my tried and true sunscreen for my face. (I use neutrogena for body because its less expensive).  Elta MD has a light tint and no fragrance, and does not make your face white.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It doesnt have a heavy feel, as many others do.  It does rub off on light colored clothing so be careful when donning and doffing your clothes.  It washes off easily, though.  I have dry skin so in the winter I use a moisturizer first before applying Elta. I use this product everyday and have not had a break out or any skin irritations.  My young children use it as well.  i found other suncreens too greasy for their skin.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product but my order said that I would receive 6 oz and I received only 3oz.  And there was no packing slip and so I had no recourse.  I paid more for the 3oz tube plus shipping than I do at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I thought that 6 oz for that price was a good buy.  Won&#x27;t try that again.</li>
    <li> I am used to buying zinc and titanium sunscreens that are greasy, because they tend to spread evenly and at the end of the day, I would rather be a little greasy than burned. But with a picture-heavy event coming up, I didn&#x27;t want to look utterly shiny once again, since not even a ton of powder can help. And this was the solution--the cream dried and felt so smooth and powdery without any makeup on top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: for the very pale (I&#x27;m white... white white. White like everybody assumes I must be sick all the time), this is too darkly tinted. I know that this is a bonus for those who don&#x27;t like the whitening effect of other physical sunscreens, but I&#x27;m not used to having color and when I couldn&#x27;t rub it in well, I had very visible streak lines like I imagine a bronzing lotion might do. I would rate it down a little except that I know this is a welcome thing for most and at the end of the day, I was able to blend the lines enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup goes on great with this under it, too. I use powder foundation and it wasn&#x27;t left chalky with the powdery finish of the sunscreen anyway. And with the makeup I was able to get a little closer to my natural color :D It could even be used as a primer itself, since it did help to cover imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regards to ability as a sunscreen, I would have to say that it does its job. I felt like I&#x27;d been out in the sun after using it during the entire day (you know that feeling), but I didn&#x27;t have any red marks. And really, this is what I bought it for. So you go, Eltamd... you&#x27;ve convinced me to try other products too!</li>
    <li> Recommend by dermatologist.  It&#x27;s great -- no skin issues ... Very gentle.  I use as base before apply powder makeup.</li>
    <li> As a redhead who grew up at the beach, I have spent a lifetime searching for a good sunscreen. Most irritate my skin, make me breakout, look super-greasy, smell weird, can&#x27;t be worn under makeup, require re-application every 2 hours, which is fine if you&#x27;re at the beach, but if you&#x27;re at work, it means reapplying your makeup every 2 hours -- crazy.  I have tried every new product, even those unavailable in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally my search for the perfect sunscreen is over. I rarely write reviews, but I&#x27;m writing this one because this product is amazing. I now wear it all day long instead of foundation.  It&#x27;s non-irritating, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, works all day long, covers skin imperfections, has no scent, and protects your skin like crazy. Plus, it seems to blend in with a lot of skin tones, so it works for me (very fair) and for friends who are not so fair. Finally, oddly, I tend to get compliments on my skin when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I tell everyone about this product.  To the people that make this product, please, please don&#x27;t reformulate it or discontinue it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Incredible sunscreen. It was recommended I use it after my melanoma diagnosis. It is by far the most cosmetically elegant facial sunscreen I have come across that is also safe to use. This sunscreen passes the EWG skin deep list which is a must for me. I am particular about the chemicals I will put on my skin, which makes it harder to find a good sunscreen. This sunscreen does not run into my eyes when I swim or play tennis. It is sheer, lightweight and my go to. I wear it with and without makeup. I love it so much I bought additional bottles to put in my purse, swim bag, and car. You will not regret this purchase. Just get it.</li>
    <li> Really nice tinted sunscreen! Love the color and I use it as a foundation- looks fab!</li>
    <li> As bought at my local Derm office, same exact thing at a much less cost! great product, I use it daily!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> looks big,seems i can use it for a long time.The texture likes ice cream,when i put it to face,feel it wet and it can be easily scribble.i didn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable or allergy.i think it‘s better than clinique.the only defect is not white enough~晗</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the package carefully but it is tinted.  Fortunately it blends well into my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t feel or look like foundation.  I like it because I know I&#x27;m protecting my skin from UV and preventing premature aging!</li>
    <li> Love this product and so does my husband.</li>
    <li> This is light enough to not appear shiny when it is absorbed.  I like the slight tint.  I&#x27;m a daily user!</li>
    <li> For a long time i didn&#x27;t use any spf because i did not like it how my makeup looks with it but i have to say that eltamd spf is great and it look very good with the makeup.</li>
    <li> Excellent coverage and protection. Light weight. The zinc oxide and titanium dioxide ingredients  does not leave a white residue. Love it</li>
    <li> ive gotten two tubes of these and on the third tube i just recieved today they added some new fun stuff to the list: antioxidants!! Now this stuff has the same great coverage, same color and all that jazz...but it keeps your skin hydrated and keeps away the free radicals. This stuff is better than the jan marini stuff..i just bought a tube of that too a couple of days ago and after applying it i instantly went back here on the ol&#x27; amazon and bought this stuff. To my suprise they just made my favorite sunscreen even better.</li>
    <li> Best purely physical sunscreen that I have found. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and is very wearable even for my sensitive skin. Has a silky texture and can be worn well under makeup.</li>
    <li> The coverage of this product is great.  There is no SPF&amp;#34;y&amp;#34; smell to the lotion and the coverage is great.  I could use as a foundation.  I was concerned about whether the color would be too light.  I am super fair skinned with red hair so it&#x27;s hard for me to find a good match for my skin. This one does the trick.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome sunscreen.  I wore it in the hot 100 degree renaissance fair weather all day, one application and came home with no burns.  It&#x27;s blends in well, feels very light, has safe ingredients for  sensitive skin.  My cancer doctor recommended this after I has a basal cell removed from my face an I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist &amp; I love it!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a fair skinned friend that works at a dermatologist office. Every sunblock that I&#x27;ve tried has caused blocked pores. This provided protection and didn&#x27;t cause a breakout. Buying again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for me and my kids, but it is not good for kids because of a tinted thing.</li>
    <li> Would like this to come in higher SPF broad spectrum  cream and just the tint just a bit darker and less pink undertones. Otherwise this product is great for the very very fair acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this product to many friends.  The tint in the cream is really nice for just going outside and gardening.  Keeps those dark spots from getting darker in the sun.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Great UV protection and non-irritating, but it dries my face out when I use it alone. I am going to try applying a moisturizer to my face first, let it soak in, and then apply this on top of it. This may do the trick.</li>
