      <li>OK - Feel I have to give a little to stay more natural.</li>
      <li>I would rate no worse and perhaps slightly better than the Curly Girl Volumizing Foam as i  doesn&#x27;t leave my hair at all crunchy (CG does until I scrunch it once dry).</li>

      <li>I really like this product.  </li>

      <li>I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not usually big on hair products, but this is pretty dummy-proof for even the novice user!  </li>
      <li>It is OK, but if you need a styling tool with more refined hold - say, less frizz - you might have to go with something less natural.</li>
      <li>This works very well for my naturally somewhat curly hair.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser introduced me to it (he had been at a hair show) and it&#x27;s the only styling product I am using in my hair right now...</li>
      <li>It produces soft, bouncy curls that are not stiff.  </li>
      <li>and this creates fantastic, bouncy curls without leaving your hair stiff.</li>
      <li>It almost kind of &#x27;helps&#x27; you hair curl, without being &#x27;crunchy&#x27; or &#x27;stiff&#x27; like a lot of other products make your hair feel.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine, but thick and naturally curly.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and thick, and frizzy.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly in the back, but the sides are stick-straight.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t use other products except occasional jojoba oil on the ends.</li>
<li> Sadly, it only worked for my frizz if I used an extreme amount of product.</li>
<li> Not for dry climates.</li>
<li> does not make your hair greasy and dry at all</li>
<li> It makes my hair smooth and my curls don’t go crazy.  </li>
<li> It turns crunchy if too much is used, and useless if not enough is used.</li>
<li> It does reactivate when wet, so I just wet my hands and scrunch.</li>
<li> I have spent thousands of dollars on products for curly hair.  </li>
<li> I have given up fighting the curl and now actively encourage it, and this product assist in that goal, as well has helping to define the style and keeping it in place.</li>
<li> because it doesn&#x27;t weight things down or build up, I like it</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like heavy products because it weighs my curls down.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday.  </li>
<li> I have very dry, curly, thin hair</li>
<li> For $15, this is a very small bottle.  </li>
<li> The only bad thing is the price.  </li>
<li> However, the reason I gave it only three stars instead of 4-5 is because the smell of the product is horrific and almost makes me gag.</li>
<li> Just very unhappy with this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say even if you&#x27;re skeptical, just give it a try!!  </li>

    <li> I like this very much! It is a nice, silicone free gel for my 3c curly hair! Very light but does the job. Rinses out easily. Great for those following the Curly Girl Method.</li>
    <li> great for my super kinky curly hair. leaves a nice curl pattern and no frizz with a soft feel. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Keeps your curls tight nice and bouncy</li>
    <li> I was really excited about trying this product after reading a lot of great reviews for it. Sadly, it only worked for my frizz if I used an extreme amount of product. It did not have a seal on the lid when I recieved it and was almost like it had been diluted. Just very unhappy with this product. Since then, I believe I have found the problem to my frizz in the first place. I am quite sure that,the cause of my frizz was sulfates and silicones. I am now doing the curly girl method and encourage anyone with curly, frizzy hair to give it a shot. I live in humid Florida and my frizz has literally disappeared!</li>
    <li> truly keeps my curls manageable</li>
    <li> I have spent thousands of dollars on products for curly hair.  Thousands!!  I really like this product.  My hair is fine, but thick and naturally curly.  I don&#x27;t like heavy products because it weighs my curls down.  I don&#x27;t like stiff/crunchy products either.  This is perfect.  It provides great hold without the heaviness or the crunchiness.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  It&#x27;s great.  The only bad thing is the price.  For $15, this is a very small bottle.  I can&#x27;t imagine it lasting more than a couple weeks, but I will order it again.</li>
    <li> This really works! My granddaughter has red very curly hair and this works perfect on making the curls soft and relaxed.</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE this product!!! I have very dry, curly, thin hair and this creates fantastic, bouncy curls without leaving your hair stiff. It is a must try!</li>
    <li> amazing curl on my daughter&#x27;s hair. The only downfall I&#x27;ve noticed is her hair gets tangled in knots easier when we use this product</li>
    <li> This product is better than some, but not really very good.  It turns crunchy if too much is used, and useless if not enough is used.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as cheep off the Walmart shelf products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I use it everyday.  It makes my hair smooth and my curls don’t go crazy.  Well worth the money and I’ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This is the best curl product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried plenty of them! Love this stuff! I even have my husband using it. Bought a sample, then a quart!</li>
    <li> This works very well for my naturally somewhat curly hair.  I have given up fighting the curl and now actively encourage it, and this product assist in that goal, as well has helping to define the style and keeping it in place. It produces soft, bouncy curls that are not stiff.  I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Must have for humid climates! Although I use a ton (without anything else besides leave-in conditioner) when I DO use it. Perfect size for a week trip to humidity.  Not for dry climates.</li>
    <li> Any girl with curly hair needs to own this and a good place to purchase is right here on Amazon!  A product I swear by, a must have!</li>
    <li> This is OK. It does reactivate when wet, so I just wet my hands and scrunch. Still, I find my hair is still lacking moisture in the colder weather - and I use Accure brand shampoo and conditioner for moisture retention - and only wash my hair 2x/week. I don&#x27;t use other products except occasional jojoba oil on the ends. I have moderately wavy to curly hair - but a day in a pony tail straightens it out. My hair is fine and thick, and frizzy. This product aids in about 50% reduction in frizz, but because it doesn&#x27;t weight things down or build up, I like it OK - Feel I have to give a little to stay more natural. I&#x27;m neutral on this product. It is OK, but if you need a styling tool with more refined hold - say, less frizz - you might have to go with something less natural.</li>
    <li> very good product. does not make your hair greasy and dry at all</li>
    <li> I would recommend for curlytops</li>
    <li> Helps keep my curls and limits the frizzes after touches/running hands through.  I still frizz in the rain, but who doesn&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for all the curly girls out there</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!  My hairdresser introduced me to it (he had been at a hair show) and it&#x27;s the only styling product I am using in my hair right now... no extra mousse, gel, oils etc.  My hair feels lightweight yet the curls are defined not frizzy.  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually big on hair products, but this is pretty dummy-proof for even the novice user!  My hair is naturally curly in the back, but the sides are stick-straight.  I just put about a quarter-size drop in my hands, rub them together, then finger-comb them through my hair, and it makes my hair look beautiful!
