### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I am very happy.</li>
      <li>but if you can then it looks great.</li>
      <li>i was happy with how easy it was, I didn&#x27;t get it looking perfect the first time</li>
      <li>This is a nice product.</li>
      <li>His customer service was superb and he was very apologetic regarding my experience.</li>
      <li>but this one seems to be the best so far.</li>
      <li>The nail polish on its own is pretty good.</li>
      <li>I love this product and have lots of compliments on y nails...</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the whole kit, I love the nail polish and it is the Maximum Growth kind, which was a bonus for me.</li>
      <li>I strongly recomment this product.</li>
      <li>The colors are perfect, clear is a great base and top coat, and the lights color is nice light, transparent nude.</li>
      <li>It may not be as cool as it is when you get it done; but I like it just a well..</li>
      <li>The nude color is not pink but more orange and brown!</li>
      <li>but I got super close.</li>
      <li>((On a sidebar about the product pictured, if you can get your hands on the real thing, the polish is fantastic and well worth the $6 you pay after shipping charges.  </li>
      <li>However, this French manicure kit allows me to do my own nails at a fraction of salon cost.</li>
      <li>This works really well!</li>
      <li>and as such- mine was not an isolated case, but Joe&#x27;s efforts to rectify the matter helped me feel much better about the issue as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Joe.</li>
      <li>I am exactly the opposite of a sure-handed, crafty, or otherwise artistic person.</li>
      <li>here&#x27;s hoping for at least good customer service &amp; an ethical seller!  </li>
      <li>The pen worked really well, you just have to push down on the tip to get it full of ink, after that just shake it really well and make sure to keep the cap on nice and tight.</li>
      <li>The color polish doesn&#x27;t really make any sense though.</li>
      <li>And the white has started to chip in just 2 days - even with 2 coats of clear top coat.</li>
      <li>, it looks exactly like a professional manicure!))</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they sent me a brand new one today at no additional charge and this time it was packed very well</li>
      <li>It dried fast and I love it.</li>
      <li>It lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
      <li>This set was decent.</li>
      <li>I like to use the natural color over my whole nails and use a true white for the tips</li>
      <li>Wish it was a little more natural looking</li>
      <li>I live out on a farm where is isn&#x27;t any nail places close..</li>
      <li>I read here that several others have shared the color-related/product age issue I described in my first</li>
      <li>But the purpose of this kit is clearly to use the manicure pen.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the pen and strip, applying the white tip is a breeze.</li>
      <li>I love the colors of the polish so much that I wanted to repurchase &amp; unfortunately picked Amazon to do so.  </li>
      <li>wanted everyone to be aware of that , if anyone finds the actual pink clear polish, please let me know</li>
      <li>It also came with a sticker set, the old way of doing an at home french manicure.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t even opened the container (because I was so grossed out by the condition of the product) to see if the stickers were included or to see if my pen was dried out (as many previous customers have noted.)  </li>
      <li>The pretty sheer pink color shown in the picture was a sheer pee color and the natural pink shown in the picture came as a mustardy-tan color...</li>
      <li>want to start believing the clear pink translucent part of this french mani kit has been discontinued and been replaced with the nude looking color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Totally not the one pictures and not clear and pink translucent.</li>

<li> What&#x27;s worse was the product inside...</li>
<li> Well, the pen thats used to get the french tip is bad !</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed because the base color was an ugly brownish yellow color</li>
<li> Its difficult to use</li>
<li> Emailed the seller, they apologized and send a replacement, which sadly was also not the product</li>
<li> When I opened my shipping envelope I was disgusted to see a dirty, foggy, plastic container with permanent marker writing on the outside of a torn &amp; weathered Sally Hansen box.  </li>
<li> but it didnt look too bad when I used it.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> Terrible.</li>
<li> I HATE it!</li>

    <li> I have written to the company about my purchase and am hoping for a response but until I hear back I remain completely disappointed with this product.  I actually have the set that is pictured and know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like;  I love the colors of the polish so much that I wanted to repurchase &amp; unfortunately picked Amazon to do so.  When I opened my shipping envelope I was disgusted to see a dirty, foggy, plastic container with permanent marker writing on the outside of a torn &amp; weathered Sally Hansen box.  What&#x27;s worse was the product inside... The pretty sheer pink color shown in the picture was a sheer pee color and the natural pink shown in the picture came as a mustardy-tan color... Definitely nothing I would ever put on my nails.  I haven&#x27;t even opened the container (because I was so grossed out by the condition of the product) to see if the stickers were included or to see if my pen was dried out (as many previous customers have noted.)  The back of the box has the correct color polishes pictured on it, so I don&#x27;t know what reason is cause for the funky looking yellow &amp; brown stuff that&#x27;s actually in the bottles.  I&#x27;m writing this not only as a warning for future buyers but also in hopes of getting the sellers attention, this was unacceptable to me, no matter the cost...here&#x27;s hoping for at least good customer service &amp; an ethical seller!  ((On a sidebar about the product pictured, if you can get your hands on the real thing, the polish is fantastic and well worth the $6 you pay after shipping charges.  I like to use the natural color over my whole nails and use a true white for the tips, it looks exactly like a professional manicure!))</li>
    <li> The nail polish is fine but the white pen is difficult.  As others have said, it&#x27;s watery, it gets underneath the strips, and the consistency is like the felt tip and not smooth.  Tried it twice and have thrown it in the trash.</li>
    <li> This set was decent. Its a little difficult to get the white in a straight line but if you can then it looks great. The color polish doesn&#x27;t really make any sense though. Especially since its tan.</li>
    <li> I am exactly the opposite of a sure-handed, crafty, or otherwise artistic person. However, this French manicure kit allows me to do my own nails at a fraction of salon cost. Thanks to the pen and strip, applying the white tip is a breeze. I strongly recomment this product.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the color polish as seen in the picture</li>
    <li> Although I placed an earlier negative comment about how disappointed I was with the quality of my order, I must say that within TWO MINUTES of sharing my comment with the company, the owner emailed me and refunded the cost of the product. His customer service was superb and he was very apologetic regarding my experience. I read here that several others have shared the color-related/product age issue I described in my first review- and as such- mine was not an isolated case, but Joe&#x27;s efforts to rectify the matter helped me feel much better about the issue as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Joe.</li>
    <li> The nude color is not pink but more orange and brown!</li>
    <li> I searched for the clear pink see through coat as part of this french manicure kit all over town and was so excited to finally find it on amazon, however when I received it it was the very common pink natural looking lotion.

    <li> OMG! The nail polish is so watery! I HATE it! Not getting it again! I do not really know what to say..............</li>
    <li> Well when I first received this item I was kinda disappointed because the nail color had leakage from the side. I contacted the company and they sent me a brand new one today at no additional charge and this time it was packed very well so I am very happy. When it comes to applying well you gotta get used to it but you will in no time. It is easier to apply with the pen. I don&#x27;t necessarily twist my finger I just try to apply without shaking my hands. I don&#x27;t use the stickers it came with it because i find it more difficult with them. Trust me I had other french manicure sets before but this one seems to be the best so far.</li>
    <li> I got the polish in and it DIDN\\&quot;T HAVE THE PEN. Just some little french tip stickers. Very disappointed. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. I like the quality and colors. It lasts for a decent amount of time. I would purchase again or recommend.</li>
    <li> Where do I start. Well, the pen thats used to get the french tip is bad ! Its difficult to use and it wears off after one use. The nail polish on its own is pretty good. But the purpose of this kit is clearly to use the manicure pen. So I wouldnt buy this again EVER and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone either.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed because the base color was an ugly brownish yellow color but it didnt look too bad when I used it. Wish it was a little more natural looking but it will do. Wouldnt order it again though.</li>
    <li> This works really well!</li>
    <li> The pencil for the tip is dry. Terrible.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have lots of compliments on y nails...It may not be as cool as it is when you get it done; but I like it just a well..I live out on a farm where is isn&#x27;t any nail places close.. So I do them myself...</li>
    <li> I bought this because I want french manicure at home, but it can be hard. I thought this pen might make it easier, and it did. I was pleased with the whole kit, I love the nail polish and it is the Maximum Growth kind, which was a bonus for me. The colors are perfect, clear is a great base and top coat, and the lights color is nice light, transparent nude. It also came with a sticker set, the old way of doing an at home french manicure. The pen worked really well, you just have to push down on the tip to get it full of ink, after that just shake it really well and make sure to keep the cap on nice and tight. i was happy with how easy it was, I didn&#x27;t get it looking perfect the first time but I got super close. It dried fast and I love it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The white is too watery. I had to apply 3 coats. I don&#x27;t use the stickers - they just created wierd lines. And the white has started to chip in just 2 days - even with 2 coats of clear top coat.</li>
