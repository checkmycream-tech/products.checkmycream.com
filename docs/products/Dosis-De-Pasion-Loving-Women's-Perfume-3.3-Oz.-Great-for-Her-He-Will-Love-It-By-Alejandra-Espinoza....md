    <li> I bought this as mother&#x27;s day gift for the mother in law and she loved it. Great perfume at a great price .</li>
    <li> Dosis De Pasion is a great name for this lovely flirty fragrance. Truthfully,awakens your six senses and leaves you feeling desirable and people are asking whats that lovely smell. You can tell them that iits Dosis De Pasion. They will answer where did you find that treasure? Won&#x27;t your answer be in the Amazon or will it be on Amazon?  The rhinestone ring was missing. The fragrance was all there and its beautiful. Don&#x27;t pass this up.</li>
    <li> It smells good but my three stars are given because it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It wears off fast and I got NO comments. I used it as an air refresher...lol..  won&#x27;t buy it again no matter how cheap it is. Should be a freebie 😊</li>
    <li> Love it very much, Will recommend</li>

    <li> Great scent. Seems like notes of grapefruit are most prominent. Just took off one star because the scent isn&#x27;t long lasting on skin or clothing. Great price!</li>
    <li> Heavenly scent. Good price very good service.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great to put into a glass lantern and use remote to adjust the lighting.  I have purchased about 10 of these!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells INCREDIBLE! It was such a random find, but I assure you... The scent description is spot-on. This is now my new go-to.</li>
    <li> This is a unique fragrance very fruity &amp; very sexy at an ultimate price for people who LOVE sweet and fruity perfume&#x27;s. I love the compliments I get all the time.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. Fruity but in an inviting/spring-time way</li>
    <li> I am extremely picky with my perfumes, I have tried so many other brands out there, but nothing beats Dosis De pasion!! BEST PERFUME EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I got it as a gift for 3 of my friends...EVERYONE loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice go only with Dosis De Pasion!  I am a perfume expert!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfume smell Nice, sweet and very pleasant. It is a quality perfume -  Smell lasts for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck!!</li>
    <li> Last all day  its  a great value  you will definitely  enjoy the scent  !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a lot of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intoxicated !</li>
    <li> I hate this literally! I cannot wear it. It has caused me to develop eczema and now I have to be using Eucerin lotion constantly because of the burn it has given me on my skin. I am not pleased at all. Be careful when buying this!</li>
    <li> is wonderful. to my girlfriend is a great gift. she like so much and i love when she use</li>
    <li> Way to fruity....Makes me sick</li>
    <li> I fail me nor returned the money</li>
    <li> Looking for a nice perfume, light and flowery&lt;br /&gt;this one may be a little strong for everyday wear&lt;br /&gt;but is great for an evening out</li>
    <li> I like the smell for 11 dollars not bad at all.</li>
    <li> This smells very good for such an inexpensive perfume. I&#x27;ve bought more expensive perfumes that smelled a lot worse. I think this perfume is perfect for adolescent girls. The bottle is super cute. The fragrance reminds me of a lemon or lime lollypop. This is a gift that I think a teenage girl would really like (if she&#x27;s &amp;#34;into&amp;#34; the girly rituals of primping -- ha).</li>
    <li> The description above is for Dosis de Amor which is wonderful! I was disappointed with this scent:&lt;br /&gt;  *DOSIS de Pasi&amp;oacute;n&lt;br /&gt;The effervescent top notes of juicy orange and lemon combine with tropical pineapple. Refreshing melon and apple intermingle with fresh peach for an energy boost. Ripe strawberry and plum are enveloped with fresh cut rose for a unique floral heart. Rich balsam and creamy vanilla are kissed with musk in the background.*&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a Hawaiian pineapple air freshener for the bathroom, would be great for a juvenile, but not sexy at all.</li>
    <li> I guess I expected more not happy</li>
    <li> this is just awesome!  great way to make your valentine fee special!</li>
    <li> The bottle is very nice, packaged good. It smells really fruity and I like it. Although the scent does not last more than a few hours. Overall a good buy for the price. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Such a sweet smell. Brightens any occasion. Not to heavy either. Beautiful bottle</li>
    <li> I love the smell but the smell won&#x27;t stay longer, I love the perfume that stay longer to my body . I won&#x27;t recommend this item</li>
</ol>
