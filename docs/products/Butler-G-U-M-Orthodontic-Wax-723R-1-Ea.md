### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So I was very happy to find this.</li>
      <li>A happy teenager with braces is a happy house.</li>
      <li>Now that&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
      <li>or I use a hair dryer to warm it</li>
      <li>I wish I knew an effective way to remove it from the trays, though.</li>
      <li>but if you warm it up by rolling the wax between your fingers</li>
      <li>This is by far the best wax.</li>
      <li>I have applied one piece of wax, and it has lasted for many hours of wear.  </li>
      <li>so I am sure to have it around when needed.</li>
      <li>Better than what they gave me at the dentist office.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is better, moist.</li>
      <li>I love the Butler wax.</li>
      <li>As 3 people in my household currently have braces this amount of wax is perfect for us.</li>
      <li>Wax works great and the quantity should last for a while.</li>
      <li>Great wax stays put for a long time</li>
      <li>Easy to use, this wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the packaging like I experienced with other brands.</li>
      <li>The wax is pretty malleable, but it does seem to harden and crumble easily as others have pointed out in their reviews.  </li>
      <li>Nice to have enough and not have to worry about it.</li>
      <li>Within about 60 seconds it would get VERY soft and easy to work with, then it would harden up to the right level once I had it in my mouth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as soft out the box as other wax, but the price is great, so the downside is minimal to the good pricing.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t melt away when I drink hot tea.</li>
      <li>This is saving me right now with my new Invisalign.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>On time &amp; better than I expected</li>
      <li>really, it&#x27;s still over priced anyway, but it&#x27;s not like I can stick a crayon in my pie hole, so this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of wax but this one just works better.</li>
      <li>This is the very same good quality wax that I was buying at the drug stores and its about half the price I was paying.</li>
      <li>I have previously bought this product and it seems to me that it sticks better to my bracktes</li>
      <li>I found that it was easier to work with the wax without it separating in to individual strings if I first warmed the piece up with a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I have clear brackets on my teeth and have been using wax for over a year now.</li>
      <li>My son says its way too soft and doesnt stay on.</li>
      <li>As an adult with braces this is the wax to buy.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit harder than most cheaper waxes but it will last and stays on the braces for the entire day.</li>
      <li>I pointed my blow dryer on the wax with low force but high heat.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had braces or a retainer before and my first set of trays a month ago rubbed my mouth raw.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have previously bought this product and it seems to me that it sticks better to my bracktes</li>
    <li> This is saving me right now with my new Invisalign.  I&#x27;ve never had braces or a retainer before and my first set of trays a month ago rubbed my mouth raw.  I was using orajel and it turned my trays yellow! So I was very happy to find this. Once I mastered the application, it made my life a lot easier.  I wish I knew an effective way to remove it from the trays, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure of how much you can say about Orthodontic Wax, but I will give it a try.  The wax is pretty malleable, but it does seem to harden and crumble easily as others have pointed out in their reviews.  The wax in each container is just shy of 2&amp;#34; long and just over 1&amp;#34; wide.  It is scored (lengthwise) in to 5 pieces that tend to want to separate with you start bending the piece.  I guess that is because some people use apiece the width of a piece of string.  But I wanted to mold the entire piece in to a sort of mouth tray.  I found that it was easier to work with the wax without it separating in to individual strings if I first warmed the piece up with a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have clear brackets on my teeth and have been using wax for over a year now. This is by far the best wax. It doesn&#x27;t melt away when I drink hot tea.</li>
    <li> Great wax stays put for a long time it is harder then the wax from the dentist or even the local store but if you warm it up by rolling the wax between your fingers or I use a hair dryer to warm it so its easier to use. will be buying again for myself and my daughter.</li>
    <li> Having gotten my braces in a cold month (Feb) I had a heck of a time working with this wax.  I finally figured out that the temperature of my fingers was making it become harder as I attempted to work with it to make it softer.  Once I figured out the problem I pointed my blow dryer on the wax with low force but high heat.  Within about 60 seconds it would get VERY soft and easy to work with, then it would harden up to the right level once I had it in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason why I&#x27;m giving it only three stars is that when I remove the wax, it has a faint smell and taste like moth balls.  I thought this association with moth balls might be my imagination until I read tonight another review which points out that it is made in China.  I will try other brands once I use up what I bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not as soft out the box as other wax, but the price is great, so the downside is minimal to the good pricing.  I mean, it&#x27;s just wax and really, it&#x27;s still over priced anyway, but it&#x27;s not like I can stick a crayon in my pie hole, so this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Wax is too hard. The mint is soft, but I don&#x27;t like the faint mint taste in my mouth all day.</li>
    <li> Wax works great and the quantity should last for a while. I put a package in the car, at work, in my backpack and camera bag as well as carry one in my pocket so I am sure to have it around when needed.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the product.  I am using it for my retainer which has a cracked piece that cuts my lip.  I have applied one piece of wax, and it has lasted for many hours of wear.  I would recommend this product for retainer needs.</li>
    <li> This wax was too hard to work with.</li>
    <li> A happy teenager with braces is a happy house. Definitely have made GUM Orthopedic wax our go-to wax treatment.</li>
    <li> finally a wax that sticks and stays ! As an adult with braces this is the wax to buy.  It is a bit harder than most cheaper waxes but it will last and stays on the braces for the entire day.</li>
    <li> Wax is harder than other Waxes I have used, but kneading it a few times softens it up a bit.</li>
    <li> Using it to blend some of the edges on my Invisalign, smooths out the spots that have been irritating my tongue.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for wax when braces rub.  fast shipping.  Lots of wax to last me over the next year.</li>
    <li> This is the very same good quality wax that I was buying at the drug stores and its about half the price I was paying. And it was delivered promptly. Now that&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> On time &amp; better than I expected</li>
    <li> Product was old and hard.</li>
    <li> Sorry i bought in bulk. My son says its way too soft and doesnt stay on.</li>
    <li> I love the Butler wax. I could not wear my braces without them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of wax but this one just works better. Easy to use, this wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the packaging like I experienced with other brands. As 3 people in my household currently have braces this amount of wax is perfect for us.</li>
    <li> Extremely hard wax. So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Product ad descibed. Better than what they gave me at the dentist office. The consistency is better, moist. Nice to have enough and not have to worry about it.</li>
