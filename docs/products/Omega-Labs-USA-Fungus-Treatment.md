<li> The last product was the Black Salve for skin cancer that really works!</li>
<li> First of all it taked at least 3 weeks to see tangible results but by the 3-6 weeks the affected nail should improve, it did to me</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if it solves my problem.  </li>
<li> Been using it and seems to be working - will update later - it&#x27;s a long process!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly (although not every single day) and the fungus is gone from my toenails.</li>
<li> My nail lady has used this in her shop for a long time.</li>
<li> Wow this really worked, I was actually skeptical about the product</li>
<li> its a little less than half of my whole nail.  </li>
<li> The cost is minimal, so we will see.</li>
<li> Only been using it for a few weeks</li>
<li> Other stuff didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
<li> this being so cheap compared to the other treatments, i was very skeptical.</li>
<li> No surgery just put it on and if it tingles or burns a little bit it is skin cancer and will bubble up and bring the root out fully leaving a small hole that will fill in over short time.</li>
<li> They are slowly growing back fungus-free (it&#x27;s winter time</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a waste of mony and time.</li>

<li> I will update my review in a few months, but I like the ease of use and feel it may be working.</li>
<li> did not slove the issue but did slow it down, still needed a doctor.</li>
<li> My toe is a bloody mess right now.</li>
<li> Disappointing after reading other reviews.</li>
<li> It has stopped the fungus from getting any worse, so I am hopeful it works over time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and my fungus got WORSE.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
<li> Smells bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have used three time a day for two months , going on 3rd bottle not&lt;br /&gt;much change in appearance.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a few weeks but it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working...great price</li>
    <li> It does take time, but it is working. Other stuff didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> Been using it and seems to be working - will update later - it&#x27;s a long process!</li>
    <li> think I&#x27;m getting some positive results from this. I realize the healing is not overnight so I&#x27;ll continue applying the  solution. It has stopped the fungus from getting any worse, so I am hopeful it works over time. The cost is minimal, so we will see.</li>
    <li> This product is cheap and it really does work!!!! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now and I could see my new nail growing fungus free!!! I recommend this product. I place 2 drops on each affected nail every night and wash it off in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great product!  No bad smell and works well.  You have to be diligent but it works!  Best time to apply is before bed so it really gets to work undisturbed.  It took about 3 weeks for the fungus to go.</li>
    <li> This product has far exceeded my expectations. It started working within the first two weeks and before I finished the bottle I was able to get my first pedicure. I&#x27;m over 50 and I was too embarrassed to sit for a pedicure. My toes look great and I can&#x27;t wait to wear candles. This works better than the prescription medication that damages your liver. So incredibly and unexpectedly worthwhile. You won&#x27;t have to wait around for months to see if it works. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> i have waited to write my review until now because i wanted to give it some time to see its effectiveness.  after putting it on once in am and once at pm since march 27, 2015, i can see it really has worked and worked quickly.  Right now i can see my new nail growing in is pink and healthy looking. its a little less than half of my whole nail.  i&#x27;ve had fungus on three toes each foot for years.  my nail beds were starting to thicken and push the nail out and one had a ridge, so i wanted to rid myself of it once and for all. this being so cheap compared to the other treatments, i was very skeptical. but i figured i&#x27;d only be wasting $5.00 if it didn&#x27;t work.  the package arrived quickly and with the results i&#x27;m getting i couldn&#x27;t be happier or ask for more.  very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT AND TRANSACTION!&lt;br /&gt;HUBBY&#x27;S TOENAILS ARE LOOKING MUCH BETTER AFTER JUST 3 WEEKS!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing promising results 1/2 way through the first bottle. Much better then the Walmart brand which was pretty ineffective.</li>
    <li> works real well!  Used twice daily for 3 weeks, all cleared up</li>
    <li> I got it quick, its a bit bigger that it looks in the pic ill let you know in a few weeks how it goes, I hope its good and works great.</li>
    <li> Helps to clear up the fungus over time. It must be used both day and night for it to be most effective.</li>
    <li> Need more time to know if it holds fungus under complete control, but I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have not made an opinion about because I am using the product and I am in the treatment stage.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination but I think I see a change in the nails.&lt;br /&gt;Discoloring is abating and nail bed is healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to lose a lot if in fact the product doesn&#x27;t work because it is so cheaply priced.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at my nail shop and ran out of it. I thought I would see if I could get it on line. It is starting to work, is better than the lamisil stuff that burned my skin.</li>
    <li> My nail lady has used this in her shop for a long time. Now, I can use at home as well.</li>
    <li> A+ transaction! Good product!</li>
    <li> did not slove the issue but did slow it down, still needed a doctor.</li>
    <li> seriously no improvement after 2 months. wrong bottle for this liquid product which just pours out of the dropper top.</li>
    <li> really great!!! thanks for the quick service!!! A+++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month, and my fungus got WORSE. Not any better</li>
    <li> Okay I waited until I needed to reorder to give my review. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly (although not every single day) and the fungus is gone from my toenails. They are slowly growing back fungus-free (it&#x27;s winter time so my hair and nails grow more slowly) so I am reordering the same product. :-)</li>
    <li> It does seem to work, but you have to use it religiously multiple times daily to get it working properly. Overall, it&#x27;s better than the pills they prescribe which work more reliably, but put your liver and other organs at risk....</li>
    <li> The product does not work for me, need to try something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a waste of mony and time. Don&#x27;t even think about trying it</li>
    <li> I had tried a number of products for a nail fungus, including prescription medication.  My nail technician recommended this product and it worked in 3 weeks.  I had been treating for over 6 months prior to that.  This product is both affordable and effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff did nothing to help me. Disappointing after reading other reviews.</li>
    <li> I am saying it is okay because thes types of meds usually take months to work. So it will be a while before I see any results. I am hoping I will.</li>
    <li> Keeps my nails healthy. Smells bad but it works</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine if it solves my problem.  I will update my review in a few months, but I like the ease of use and feel it may be working.</li>
    <li> Wow this really worked, I was actually skeptical about the product but it was cheap so I decided to buy it. First of all it taked at least 3 weeks to see tangible results but by the 3-6 weeks the affected nail should improve, it did to me and it was my toe nail. After 5 weeks it was completely cleared. It is important to have clean dry nail before applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure nail is clean and completely dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. File the infected nail and/ or use toothpick to slightly open the nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the product, just one drop should be enough.  I found the application bottle easy to use by myself, but someone can also help you apply it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 2 months everyday and it has not worked at all. My toenail still has cloudy spots and cracked last weekend. My toe is a bloody mess right now. I would recommend everyone to try something else instead. Don&#x27;t fall for this item just because it&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
    <li> It actually works. Thanks! for this</li>
    <li> Really works. The way to to get rid of your toenail fungus is to make sure you dry your nails with a hair dryer after getting out of the shower or getting them wet however. Also, in order for the product to fully penetrate your nail use a file and rub the tops, sides of infected nail, then apply this product. Make sure you wash your file afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Omega Labs for a few products in the past this product worked great. The last product was the Black Salve for skin cancer that really works! No surgery just put it on and if it tingles or burns a little bit it is skin cancer and will bubble up and bring the root out fully leaving a small hole that will fill in over short time. Really works FDA banned this product about 10 years ago but still can buy it to be used on animals! That&#x27;s why I have no trust in the FDA because run by federal gov&#x27;t ! Look what they have done to our health care!? I rest my case !!</li>
