<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very happy with the lamp.  I was also excited I finally found one, since CND didn&#x27;t have enough through many salon distributors.  I paid $50 more for it, but needed to get started adding the shellac manicure to my business, so I was willing.  I was however, diappointed that anyone could buy it.   There was no professional protection and I feel it should only be sold to licence professionals, proving a Nail or Cosmetology Licence #. The lamp does the job well curing the shellac though.</li>
    <li> Exact lamp used at the salon. Works great. Easy to use and replace bulbs. No bubbling of the nail polish. Great investment great uv power. Would recommend</li>
    <li> There are several lamps on the market to use with shellac nail products. This was more expensive than most, however, it has professional qualities which helps produce a superior result.</li>
    <li> Before making this investment I went to a salon and got a shellac manicure, which does in fact last two weeks looking intact.  Application is just like with regular nail polish and of course the second it is cured it&#x27;s ready to go (much quicker than nail polish).  I used 91% alcohol (available in Target) and it worked just fine.  Also, as I don&#x27;t know long term effects I got a pair of cotton gloves ($1.50 including shipping at Ebay), and cut the tips of the fingers off --- I apply the manicure with the glove on so that when I put my hand within the machine, only the fingernails are exposed.    I am very happy with this machine, and I know it will pay for itself within a year - the bulbs last 100 hours!  As for manicurists dissapointed that it&#x27;s available to the general public ... First of all, so is regular nail polish, so I don&#x27;t know the technical difference (unless people then should not be trusted to blow dry their hair either), and one more thing - though the manicure lasts 2 weeks, I don&#x27;t understand why it costs double - it should be $5 to $10 extra not double - That&#x27;s why you&#x27;d lose the business!   One more thing, to remove polish - put pure acetone (available at Sally Beauty Supply) and fill a tiny container ... dip your finger for 2 minutes and it&#x27;s ready to scrape out!</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to purchase a CND UV Lamp for quite some time, but didn&#x27;t really want to spend this amount of money for one.  However, after spending hard earned money getting shellac manicures only to have the technician not use the correct light, or the correct time, or the right products; I decided to go ahead and invest in the UV Lamp myself.  I am thrilled with the outcome and so very glad I went ahead and purchased it. By doing my own manicures it will pay for itself within weeks.  The only thing with the CND UV Lamp is that the instructions are lacking.  I had to get on the CND website and watch the video to see how they got the cover off to install the lights.  I was worried about breaking the cover trying to get the silly thing off.  But after watching the video I was able to get the cover removed and the lights installed.  I am so very pleased with the ease of use, along with the automatic timers. Well worth the investment.....I Love It!!</li>
    <li> I like this lamp a lot. It is great to have the timer on it -  you don&#x27;t want to fry your hands in UV without needing it, and that is inevitable with a lamp without a decent timer. This is the only lamp I would use for shellac. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> High quality lamp. Some of the great features:    - slotted tray to hold fingers in place during curing. No bumping.   - the tray is removable to accommodate toes.  - compact    It feels heavy duty. The only downside is that I had to ask someone else to open the lid for me. I couldn&#x27;t get it off myself to plug in the bulbs.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to use with the CND Shellac nail polish (gel). Although it is pricey, I really didn&#x27;t want to take a chance with buying a lamp that didn&#x27;t cure Shellac products. So, I decided to keep my investment with CND. The lamp works great and is easy to use. Plus, it is small enough to store out of sight. I am very happy with my entire CND purchase. Gel nails are the way to go, and so easy to do at home!</li>
    <li> This is a quality lamp!! Its works as advertised. my CND Shellac and other gel polish manicures always turn out perfect. This was a quality product at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great lamp. I was using the original CND lamp and although it still works, I decided it was time for an upgrade. My clients comment on the look and how the sleek design inside guides their hand into the lamp. It also seems to reduce the heat transfer while curing having the built-in automatic fan.</li>
    <li> I love love the CND Shellac nail system.  My nails would not grow...no matter what I did or what product I used.  A nurse at the hospital where my husband was having a test had CND Shallac nails because they are not allowed to have false nails on at work.  Her nails were beautiful and I asked about them.  I went home and looked them up on line and ordered everything I needed to get started including the CND UV Lamp. That was last summer and now my nails are hard and growing.  The gel protects your nails and keeps them from peeling and cracking.  You are supposed to use acrylic polish remover to remove the polish every two weeks or so.  I did this two times (a pain and time consuming) until one day one edge of my polish started to come loose and I pulled the entire polish off of the nail it was so easy and did not damage my nail. I then worked the edge of each of my nails on both hands and peeled the polish off.  No more soaking the nails in harsh polish remover....and you are ready for your new set of nails....hard strong and shiny for two weeks....I will never use another product....plus you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I tried another lamp before investing in the CND lamp and it just didn&#x27;t work out.  With the CND lamp I felt that since it was made for the Shellac it would be best for the job...and it is!  There are so many amazing features to this lamp I can&#x27;t believe I would have cut corners with a non-CND lamp before this.  The fan inside cools off your hand which is nice, the 4 timer settings are pre-programed and ready to go (10 sec., 1 min., 2 min., and 3 min.) the digital display counts down for you and turns off when it reaches 0, and it tells you when to replace the bulbs.  Overall, this is hands down the best uv lamp if you&#x27;re doing CND Shellac nails.  Super easy to use too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take too long to receive and it came in perfect condition.  Great lamp, works great.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> I got the same lamp that the ladies at the salon I got to have. I used to do my nails a lot and sit for 2 hours watching a movie so I wouldn&#x27;t ruin my nails. Not any more! I do my own no-chip manicures at home and I am able to do stuff around the house in less than an hour. I love the colors I&#x27;ve purchased and will be buying more colors in the future! Definitely paid for itself, since I was paying $45 plus tip every time I&#x27;d go.</li>
    <li> If you use CND Shellac on your nails this is truly a quality light that they make. If you use other brands, they also cure in this light. The seller was prompt, early shipper, and came new with correct instructions. I highly recommend this for someone who may not have access to a professional beauty supplier.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I bought the name brand because I wanted the specific timers and I just wanted everything to be the CND brand. It works well with your feet as well. The only compliant I have is getting the top cover off. I dont know how one single person can do it alone? I had to have my husband hold down the bottom and pull out while I had to pull the top off and hope that we didn&#x27;t break it. And he even said \\&quot;how do they expect a woman to get this off\\&quot; because he even had trouble with it! That is my only issue, but other that than its great. Thanks</li>
    <li> I know this is suppose to be a review, but I need help.  The shellac is peeling and doesn&#x27;t seem to harden like it did when I got it done in the salon.  What are your drying times?  Any other suggestions?</li>
    <li> Using the entire Cnd shellac nail system and this uv lamp make doing your nails at home look professional and it is so easy to use.  I don&#x27;t think I will have to go to a salon to get toes or fingers done again this is so fast and easy my daughter can use it too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate the product I ordered over a month ago as I am still waiting for it&#x27;s arrival...</li>
    <li> Ordered several CND things from several people.  NailEtc got its package to me the quickest.  The order was correct, something I can&#x27;t say for two of the others.  The price was good.  I&#x27;d used this vendor again without question.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced, this product along with the CND nail polish just saved my day! It worked exactly as described, the nail polish dried in less than 10 minutes, and it shined for over 14 days!   I highly recommend this product, if you really want to do your nails at home, go for the original good quality lamp, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my own nails with shellac. I spent a long time reviewing other lamps and ended up going with this one from CND. I liked the feature of the muliple timers that I can program myself. Multiple timers on top that are easy to use.     I read in another review that one negative is that there are no instructions on how to set up the lamp; otherwise I would&#x27;ve been looking all over, thinking I was missing something. Once getting it open and getting the bulbs in, I was ready to go and love it.</li>
    <li> I use this with the shellac nail polishes.  It works great!  I&#x27;m not going to the salon anymore and paying those high prices for a polish.  It cost $25.00 each time you have your nails done.  Why pay those prices?</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with high expectations and they were all fulfilled!  Instructions were easy to read and it works perfectly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just found out how wonderful and long lasting Shellac Manicures are - they last a minimum of 2 weeks, BUT they were really expensive at $40 + tip per each visit to the salon.  When I found this product I was hesitant because it IS NOT inexpensive. But am so happy that I got it and I do consider it an investment.  It is very easy to use, it&#x27;s the exact same one that they use in professional salons. In the long run, I know it will last for years and I will save a LOT of $$$ in manicure costs.    The UV lamps were tricky to insert into the base of the unit. I was so afraid I would break one. But once I figured it out it was easy.  I have to say I LOVE this product.  Just make sure you buy the right kind of nail polish to use with this UV Lamp.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use product!  Although pricey, I see it as an investment as I will save on salon manicures in the long run.  I get lots of compliments on my nails!  Comes with a storage bag.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to having this lamp.  This is the UV lamp my cosmetologist uses, so I knew it would work.  However, when I received the lamp, there was a defective light. (I knew it was the light, because I placed it in each outlet and still did not work.) This would not have been a big deal if I could send it back and get a replacement. I have sent e-mails for the past 2 weeks and the company will not respond back!! I am in the process of digging deeper to find a better way to reach this company!</li>
    <li> I love this lamp.  It has expedited my time in applying gel on my clients. They in turn absolutely love the quick time.  I would definitely recommend to other nail technicians.  And the cost was great as well.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Nicely packaged.  Did have a problem opening case to insert bulbs.  TRICK: Follow the instructions for opening the case but make sure to put your thumbs deep inside the opening and push on the sides of the case, not the edge of the opening.  Once I did that, the case opened easily.  Really loving the Shellac system</li>
    <li> I wanted to get the same results as the salon that I had been going to.  I feel like there are no instructions at all for the novelist.  At the salon my nails were totally dry in 50 seconds...so far I have had to do 4 to 5 mins per hand and I still don&#x27;t feel like they are rock solid dry.  I can&#x27;t help but feel that I&#x27;m not using it right, but I have no instructions other than what each button is for.  I hope that I can get it figured out because it was an expensive investment and I want it to pay off....I would like to hear if anybody else has had this problem or any suggestions as to what I need to do to make it work right</li>
    <li> This was the same machine as my girl uses at work and performed perfectly at a fraction of the cost that we would have paid anywhere else. Now she can do nails at home too... Great Xmas gift.</li>
    <li> LOVE this light! I had a cheaper one and was doing shellac with it and it did the job ok, but this one is WAY better!</li>
    <li> Got my 1st Shellac mani in December.  Loved the stamina of the product, but don&#x27;t enjoy someone else doing my nails.  Although the initial investment is pricey, it pays for itself in a few months.  My nails are strong and having a lasting french manicure is worth the effort!  I have had barely a chip with any of the 4 polish changes I&#x27;ve done since I purchased and I am hard on my nails.  That said, when doing this on your own nails, it CAN take much longer on the front end (about double time I&#x27;d guess) because it has several key steps and since you have to do one hand at a time (including soak off - I can&#x27;t seem to wrap tight enough when my free hand is already wrapped).  It could also be that I&#x27;m more anal about following the instructions (shaking each bottle 2 min., etc., thinness) but with no dry time (or touch up time!)it all evens out.  Either way, I have no regrets.</li>
    <li> When I bought this lamp I knew nothing about Shellac or Gelish Polish, except that a relative of mine really likes it.  I have NEVER had a professional manicure done or a pedicure or acrylic nails. I have always done my own nails with regular polish or stick on polish and I have nails that are far from \\&quot;always nice\\&quot;. In fact about 1-2 years ago my nails started to peel as soon as they got a little longer making it extremely hard for me to keep polish on them and keep them looking nice. I was afraid to put my hands in my jeans pockets, because I had to worry about the polish chipping and peeling off them. I am also not good with sitting still for a long time mostly due to the fact that I am busy and have lots to do, so I don&#x27;t just like to sit and wait for the polish to thoroughly dry, which often caused smudges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story shorter, my relative suggested I look into Shellac and so I ended up on Amazon where you seem to be able to get just about anything. I read a few reviews and even though I was still confused on how it all works I purchased the lamp along with Shellac Base Coat - Shellac Moonlight and Roses - Shellac Top Coat. In the description of the lamp it told me how long I needed to keep my nails under the lamp (cure the nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaped my nails...and used the base coat, then the color coat, then another color coat, then the top coat. I always prefer a french manicure, but at that time my nails were pretty bad so I figured a good light color would help them grow a little and since everyone speaks so highly of the Shellac product I was hoping it would help stay on better, while my nails grew some and keep them from peeling. It only lasted for about 5 days before it peeled, but I think I had put the Shellac on a little to heavy (it blisters and doesn&#x27;t work as well if you put the products on to heavy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove the Shellac you can purchase wraps (a cotton patch with strips attached, for wrapping the acetone soaked cotton patch around your nail, thus soaking the Shellac off your nail).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime I had watch some YouTube videos on shellac and gelish and I recommend you do this for helpful tips and ideas. I liked what I heard about Gelish Polish, which is just a different brand of Polish that is also used under the UV Lamp. I got some Gelish Polish here on Amazon and have since then done some French manicures on my hands and toes. It does not last me the whole 2 weeks on my hands, that it says it will last, but I am certain that&#x27;s partially my own fault. I am very active like cooking and cleaning and work and gardening and sometimes I forget to be a little more careful. I do wear gloves most of the times but sometimes I forget. It has started to last a little longer and I believe this is also because my nails are looking better :-). BTW, last time on my toes it looked great for 3 weeks and I only changed it because the nails were growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails still peel a little, but definitely not as bad. I keep Gelish on them (I think Gelish and Shellac are both equally good) and they are looking so nice and shiny for so much longer then they used to. Like I said before I never had a professional manicure or pedicure done, but at our local salons they charge $72 for a Shellac French pedicure and $44 for a Shellac French Manicure. Yes, the initial cost for this system was quite a bit (I spent about $200 to get started), but it last a long time. And the shine is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove and prepare your nails for the next time, takes quite a bit of work and time. First soak off the polish 10 - 15 minutes each hand)...then remove the polish by scraping it off the nail completely and carefully (5 minutes) then shape your nails....clean the cuticles...buff lightly...rehydrate by putting some alcohol onto a cotton pad and wiping your nails with it (or use Gelish ph bond/recommended). Last night I removed the Polish with the soak off wraps and cleaned and shaped my nails. This morning then I did the polish on my hands and nails...and now I am good for hopefully a week or two  :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: For removing polish, I actually do one hand first, then I slip the wraps off my nails and remove the polish, then i drop some more polish remover inside the wrap onto the pad, and i slip the same wraps on my other hands nails. This works great and cuts the cost of wraps in half. So you only use 5 wraps rather then 10 each time you remove polish. The same works for the toes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and you know almost nothing about professional manicures, if you decide to get the lamp, you also need the base coat - a top coat - and a color (Shellac or Gelish brand is great). The colors can also be layered for different shades...for example...a base coat followed by a pink coat...followed by a glitter coat...followed by the top coat. Or you can do a purple underneath with a almost transparent sparkly pink over top...see what I mean :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update...almost 1.5 years later. i am still using this lamp and it is still going strong. i use it once or twice every 2 weeks. if you put pH-bond, put out by gelish, on your clean nail before applying the base coat, it will without a doubt adhere much better and last longer. i often peel the polish off my nails, instead of using remover wraps, and it works good for me, but might not be so good for your nail. i do this because its faster and more convenient (and saves a lot of money on the wraps), like i sometimes do this with my teeth when i drive down the road lol. but sorry i know this might be bad advice. anyways, i only use shallac polish and have a non stop french manicure.....on my fingers and toes......and shallac is the best thing that ever happened to my nails!</li>
    <li> Just received my CND 36W UV lamp and did my toe nails.  Everything worked just as it did at the shop with my nail tech.  The great thing is I can now do this at home when and how I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews where people state that their nails aren&#x27;t drying with this lamp.  I strongly believe that if you bought the genuine product and followed each of the preparatory steps then it should all come out just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base Coat 10 seconds each hand/foot&lt;br /&gt;Color coat 2 minutes each hand/foot per layer&lt;br /&gt;Top Coat 2 minutes each hand/foot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many videos on YouTube for proper application and troubleshooting if the Shellac is peeling off before the 2 weeks.  Thin application of the product is also key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note, I am very happy with this purchase and can&#x27;t wait to do more nails!  I&#x27;ll have to see if my friends and family will let me do it for them.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and don&#x27;t settle for imitation lamps if you want Shellac to work properly.</li>
    <li> I use to go to the salon to get my nails done but now I do them myself. It seemed expensive to buy this at first but it pays for itself in three uses. I had another uv lamp when I started doing my own nail but didn&#x27;t cure the polish very well and would peel off in a couple of days. I like the CND lamp because is quiet and has multiple settings for time.  I have been using this for 3 months now and I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Powerful and easily adjustable, it also has programable timer buttons which are very convenient. It was a little pricy, but worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This lamp may seem a bit pricey, but it is well worth the price, and this is the lowest I&#x27;ve seem this lamp priced.  It has to be used with CND products, which are outstanding, and is an extremely durable, professional lamp. Worthy of the salon with the highest standards and services.</li>
    <li> perfect lamp, excellent quality, this works perfect with shellac i am very happy, i use this one in my salon</li>
    <li> Reviews said this is the one to get and the wife is extremely happy with it! It is the same product the salon she would get her nails would do. For the price, it will take less than 6 months (including tip for services) to pay itself off! Recommend it for any woman who loves shellac or any man wanting to make their significant other VERY happy!</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I purchased a less expensive uv lamp which claimed to work with the gel nail polish. In all honesty, it did work but took forever to dry the gel polish. Finally, I decided to invest in a CND nail dryer and have cut the dry time to less than half. It works great. Remember with the gel polish that it will feel \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; to the touch even after drying. Follow the directions and wipe nails with a lint-free wipe after dry-time to remove the tacky overcoat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and I really recommend this uv lamp for all types of gel color products. Easy to use and portiable.</li>
    <li> I updated to this from my 9Watt… SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE!! love it!!! I’m DIY’er so buying professional grade was definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> Bit expensive but works great! Used it a couple of times. Sturdy and reliable. Would recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I chose this particular product after reading at least 100 reviews.  Now that my Creative Nail UV Lamp arrived and I have given it a test run I can say to myself, &amp;#34;here comes my savings&amp;#34;, since I have been spending $30.00 plus tip every 2-3 weeks, for awhile now.  I should be able to recoup my money in no time.  I used it tonight for the first time (I also ordered shellac base, color and top coat from the same company).  I have never done my own shellac nails before.  It was so much easier than I thought.  I feel extremely satisfied with my decision.  I am now saving time, too.  No more driving to the salon, waiting (even with an appointment), sitting watching some show I don&#x27;t like on their TV or making small talk, when I just want to get home after working all day.  I did my nails, including taking off the old shellac in 1 hour 15 minutes....not bad for my first time!  It was still much quicker and in my own environment.  I will get faster as time goes on.  Go for it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This lamp is breathtaken...the clients love it and its high quality. Optimizes your work time and cures really fast! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Plug does not stay in the back of the lamp. Had to buy a new plug after just 6 months. Called cnd they did not help or care...:(</li>
    <li> Came on time and worked fine</li>
    <li> I am not good at all with nail polish and did the salon manicures, but they are pricey and I can&#x27;t always go when I need to, so invested in the CND UV Lamp and CND shellac base coat, CND shellac color, &amp; CND shellac top coat.  I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful it turned out my very first time.  Just research a little and you will find out the procedure &amp; how long to use the lamp for each coat, etc.  It didn&#x27;t take me long to find out what I needed to know. I read reviews and from those I was able to make a really good smart investment. But what I want to help others with is HOW TO OPEN THE UV LAMP TO INSTALL THE BULBS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no luck with the pamphlet, SO CALLED THE PHONE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THE BOX and the lady was so very nice &amp; helpful. She said the instructions were not the way to go and then she proceeded to help me and walked me through 3 different ways--the 3rd one worked for me, which is &#x27;cradling the lamp in your arm like a baby&#x27;.  Just call--they really can help, as I was so afraid I was going to break my brand new expensive lamp.  Good luck and enjoy![[ASIN:B003ULT3H2 Programmable UV Lamp, 08200, Creative Nail Design, Shellac / Tools and Implements]]</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this purchase, so I opened it as soon as I received it. I attempted to follow the instructions to open the lid, remove the protective plastic, and insert the bulbs. Nuh uh. Not happening. I&#x27;m no weakling, but this thing wasn&#x27;t budging. Okay, no big deal, I thought when I looked inside to see that the bulbs were already in place and there was no protective plastic to be seen. Curious. At that point, I turned the lamp around to insert the detachable cord. Unfortunately, the black receiver that is supposed to be on the back of the lamp to receive the cord was rattling around inside the lamp. But I could see it, so I grabbed a pair of tweezers, fished around for it, and tried to pull it back through the hole. Complete success. Yay me! But the cord didn&#x27;t fit. It was too big. I tried until I tried so hard that the black receiver slipped back into the hole to rattle around inside the lamp again.&lt;br /&gt;Hmmmm. Lid won&#x27;t open, no protective plastic, bulbs already in place, cord receiver broken, and cord was the wrong size for the receiver. I packed it all back up and placed it into the original box in preparation of making a return. And that&#x27;s when I saw it. The shipping label on the box showed that the package came to me from the &amp;#34;returns department&amp;#34; of the salon supply store.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea I would be getting a not-new or refurbished product, or really a product obviously defective and not refurbished at all. I would not recommend purchasing this item. This is a fairly high-cost item that should be new and working properly. Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Shellac is a process that does not harm your nail beds.  I love the look, stamina and shine.  What I didn&#x27;t like is the price at the salon.  The cost is similar to having a new set of acrylics every 2-3 weeks anywhere from $30-$45 dollars per visit (depending on single, french, type of salon, etc.)  I found less expensive UV lamps, however I knew that this lamp worked well and the two salons that I did attend used the same lamp.  I had some difficulty removing the cover to insert the bulbs, but finally managed to push it open. I have purchased 4 different colors and now shellac my own nails every 2 weeks. Love it!</li>
    <li> I got this a few years ago now and it is still working great. I was debating buying a less expensive one when I bought this lamp, but I am really glad I got this one. Is seems to work better than the ones at the salons sometimes. Reliable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used my CND Nail Lampt three time since I purchased it.  WOW is all I can say.  Product description was excellent and Amazon delivery was exact. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more. EXCELLENT SERVICE</li>
    <li> Flimsy construction, but has held it together for over a year now and still works well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything from this person or company, they are scammers. I bought four (4) creative shellac lights, they send me just one (1) light, and they claim that they send four (4). They took my money and I never get the rest of my order.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am one who has gone to the salon every two weeks for the past 4 years (acrylics) and paid $55 each visit with tip. I finally decided to purchase the CND products and do my own nails for several reasons. I am tired of my nails being filed down to nothing and being damaged, I am tired of trying to work appointments around my work schedule, and I am tired of paying over $100 a month for nails! I soaked the acrylics off in acetone nail polish remover several weeks ago, and have let my damaged nail grow most of the way out. Of course, they are very short and will be until the damaged nail is totally grown out. I decided to use the CND products today after 9 weeks of growing the damaged nail. It was so much easier to do than I had even expected! Nothing more than just painting your own nails. So fast and easy! I am able to quickly do them on the weekends in the convenience of my own home... and FOR FREE! Obviously the initial investment... but I just bit the bullet and paid up front. In no time it will pay for itself. After I finished my nails, I realized I only had 70 percent alcohol, so I used it and it worked perfectly fine! I got up and went and cleaned up dinner dishes, astounded that there is not drying time involved! After I finished the dishes, I looked to see if I had dented them... NOTHING! JUST AS PERFECT AS WHEN I FINISHED THEM!! I then went and told my Husband just how much I loved the new CND products I had just purchased, and he looked at my nails and stated... \\&quot;They look professional.\\&quot; I LOVE THE PRODUCTS AND COULDN&#x27;T BE MORE PLEASED!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use my lamp.  I followed the instructions and did my first set of fingers flawlessly.  Unfortuntly the second time I put the lamp to use it shorted out and nearly caught on fire.  Not cool, CND....not cool!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and has a nice choice of settings to pick from.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I too decided to pay for brand name and am glad I did, I&#x27;ve heard that generics for 1/3 to 1/2 the price were hit or miss.  I love that it comes already programmed for both the 10sec and 120 sec that you need for CND (there are 2 others as well)  and you can re-program it.  It also has a lamp usage meter that you can reset when its time to change the bulbs.  It was perfect right out of the box (remove the film, plug in the bulbs and go.)  I followed CND directions and got a perfect cure the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To do the CND shellac process on yourself requires a little more time than to have someone else perform, but I really don&#x27;t see the need for a larger 2 hands at once version.  Like other reviewers have said... it&#x27;s small enough to put in your linen closet, and really you need to paint and cure 1 hand at a time to have a neat manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that your nails stay &#x27;sticky&#x27; thru the process (even after cure) until the final step of wiping the top coat with the alcohol.  So when working on your mani by yourself...avoid lint filled towels, or any type of cotton ball/pad.  Buy the lint free stuff and keep a neat area or you are doomed to have hairs/fuzz get into your nails.</li>
    <li> Made noise really loud</li>
    <li> It took two days to get to me from the day I ordered. Looks amazing and works perfectly. It was difficult to open the very first time but once you do and you figure out how to do it it&#x27;s a piece of cake. ❤</li>
    <li> I purchased the ThermaSpa with my initial start up of doing Shellac at home. I read enough reviews that convinced me a lamp is a lamp and decided to not spend more than I had to.  I used ThermaSpa for almost a year and was not satisfied with the outcome of my manicures-- they chipped with in two days (never peeled just chip like a regular nail polish) I also found that with the ThermaSpa my nails did not always cure in time (I knew this when wiping the sticky residue with alcohol and finding faint traces of nail color on the pad).  Sometimes something strange would happen and I could not get that shinny effect at all after applying the top coat and wiping with alcohol (this was inconsistent and I&#x27;m still not sure what happened during those times)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that my pedicures did last for weeks with the ThermaSpa lamp. I cured for the same time as my hands so I just assumed this was the nature of Shellac-- they didn&#x27;t really last on hands for as long as promised. For me regular pedicures last a long time too. Eventually it became a drag and very time consuming to use Shellac with no lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already owned a bunch of colors and didn&#x27;t want to waist them all I decided to listen to (what I though was) CND propaganda and purchase the Creative Nail UV Lamp. It made a big difference. My manicures actually last now. I have only used the new lamp a few times but so far had no issues with non curing. As long as the lamp continues working like this I&#x27;ll be very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note the CND UV Lamp is also more solid looking and appears better quality than ThermaSpa</li>
    <li> I was paying almost forty dollars every two weeks for a shellac manicure. I decided to bite the bullet and purchase this lamp bc I figured it would pay off in the long run. I am incredibly happy with my purchase. It works incredibly well and shipping was prompt. I actually prefer doing my own manicure bc I know what I like. My home manicures stay just as long as the professional ones. I&#x27;m saving money by now doing my own!</li>
    <li> This lamp is supposed to be high quality.  Well, the directions for removing the lid don&#x27;t work.  After 2 hrs and 2 people trying to remove it, we finally tried another method.  Press down on the top of the unit, then pull straight out.  Then remove the blue film, which has no places to start the removal process.  After struggling with these steps, the bulbs were difficult to insert.  Once the unit was reassembled for use, it worked fine.  But what a disappointing start.</li>
    <li> The programmable lamp is great!!!!  Easiest I&#x27;ve ever used.  Preprogrammed with 4 different lengths of time and then just push start.  It doesn&#x27;t get any more user friendly.</li>
    <li> I have been using my CND lamp to cure Shellac for about a year.  Suddenly the machine alarmed and then keeps shutting off.  We changed the bulbs.  This did not make a difference.  Every time we turn the light on it alarms and shuts down. I have called CND hot line over 15 times and left as many messages.  I wrote the company, no response. I like the product but customer support and professional service is none existent.  My only choice at this point is to buy a new lamp or change to OPI lacquer...they answer the phone.  [[ASIN:B005ETAVU6 CND Shellac Light Official UV Lamp - (Use with CND Shellac Color Coat Gel Nail Polish)]]</li>
    <li> Wonderful, completely what I was looking for with everything in the box.</li>
    <li> Great! Would purchase from you again. Came just like it was described. Works excellent. Also, it came in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purchase by far! I use it all the time for me, my daughters and my neighbor.  Cannot say enough good things about it.  WORTH THE MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice lamp, it is the same one my nail tech uses.  Deciding to do my shellac nails at home is going to be a very good choice for me.  The upfront cost of the supplies is a bit much but it will pay for itself as I can now do this myself at home.  No more time spent in the salon during the evening or on a nice weekend afternoon.  I am very glad I made this choice.  If you can \\&quot;do\\&quot; your own nails at home with traditional polish then you can shellac.....</li>
    <li> When I received this Creative Nail UV Lamp, I was hoping not to have a hard time assembling it like some of the other reviews said about that.  I did not have a hard time at all, in fact, it was very easy to assemble.  I have not used it yet due to the fact that I need to give my nails some time to heal up from splitting and cracking after months of having gel nails applied in a salon.  I decided to invest in a UV lamp and use shellac nail polish instead because it&#x27;s supposed to be much better for the nails, and this way I will be able to save a ton of money doing my nails myself.  Thank you Creative Nail for a great solution and product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After waiting almost 2-3 months for my nails to stabilize and not crack anymore from the damage done with the gel nail manicures I had been getting done for 6 mo at least, I just used my new Creative Nail UV Lamp for the first time. But the day before I did this, I stopped in to see the woman who had been doing my nails to explain why I hadn&#x27;t come back.  I also wanted to see if she would give me just a manicure to clean up my cuticles and nails.  She did do that for me and then told me that my nails wouldn&#x27;t crack with shellac on them.  Then I told her I had bought my own nail lamp and would be doing my own shellac nails from now on.  She of course made sure she gave me all the necessary precautions about the \\&quot;lamp\\&quot; I had purchased and doing the shellac properly to work. After she shared about the nails will not split with shellac on them but will make them stronger, that&#x27;s when I decided it was time to use my new machine here and do my nails for the first time on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I did what I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; was right to do, i.e. wash my hands beforehand to get off any and all particles on my nails, I then applied the base coat, and put my hand under the UV Lamp for 2 minutes, and followed the same procedure for the color and top coats (2 ea) using the UV lamp 2 min per coat, I still had sticky nails! So, I kept trying to cure my nails 2 or 3 times more and they were still sticky. I finally decided that I must be doing something wrong here, so I came onto amazon.com to check out some reviews of the UV lamp I bought. After reading thru a few, I realized that I hadn&#x27;t shaken each of the bottles for 2 min prior to application (which helps to put on thin coats to help them dry faster), and I hadn&#x27;t applied the alcohol with a cotton ball or pad (either will work fine) after the final cure. When I did that, wella!! My nails were nice and shiny and no stickiness whatsoever! I am so excited that it finally worked and I&#x27;m glad I came on this site to read some reviews. If I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews, I was almost ready to remove all the polish I had just applied and start the whole process all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These reviews that people write are so helpful! Thank you everyone for writing out your reviews so people like me can see and learn how to do this right. So far after only a few minutes of cleaning my nails off with the alcohol, they seem to have a nice lasting finish. Now I will hopefully wait and see how long my shellac nails will last and write another review to that effect, and hopefully a positive one :))kept trying to cure my nails 2 or 3 times more and they were still sticky.

    <li> I recently purchased this CND dryer to use with my recently purchased CND shellac.  In order to receive any results, you must use this dryer for the CND shellac polish.  I tried using a dryer from my local beauty salon that noted it can be used for any UV product and it didn&#x27;t work with this polish at all.  I read reviews that the lid on this dryer was hard to open and it definitely is.  I was very concerned I would break it.  Please make sure you pull forward and lift when opening it b/c there are 2 tabs at the top in the back that could break if you just lift up.  The dryer is wonderful with 4 settings..10sec for your base shellac...2 mins for your polish and top.  There are also 2 other settings, 1 and 3 minutes.  You can also reprogram the settings to whatever you want.  This dryer has a timer countdown as you are drying your polish.  Another fine feature is you can also push a button to know how much bulb life you have remaining so you can be assured of receiving your next set of CND (only) bulbs before your current ones run out of life.  This is a very nice product and works as it promises with the CND shellac polish.  Just a reminder, after you apply your top coat, rub each nail with alcohol.  I used the 91% and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> love it, it works great and does what it is supposed to do and the price was great better than anywhere else</li>
    <li> This UV Lamp is poorly constructed, and the components are made of cheap materials.  The outlet on the base of the lamp is poorly constructed, and easily detached from the lamp.  Currently, I am not able to use this lamp at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.  It is not worth the high cost..  Other lamps are better constructed, and cost more than 75% less.</li>
    <li> Love this product love being able to just do my nails at home when it&#x27;s convenient would recommend it to others who are confident in their nail abilities</li>
    <li> Have been searching for the perfect lamp to do my gel nails. I purchased this one and it was exactly what I expected it to be, it&#x27;s a great product, and assembly is quick and easy.</li>
    <li> A+++ Service and product! Thank You!  (NOTE; the one I received has a pink area, not white, where the buttons are. Didn&#x27;t bother me, but thought id give the heads up either way)</li>
    <li> Highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve started doing my own manicure to save money so I bought this heat lamp to start doing my own manicures. Great investment. Took a little practice but it has paid off. The cost of the lamp and supplies was the cost of two professional manicures. !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this nail lamp process - easy to assemble and use. The instructions took a bit of study, but once figured out with a little patience, it&#x27;s very easy to use and works great.</li>
    <li> This lamp works perfectly to cure CND Shellac polishes. It seems sturdy and well-enough-made to last quite a while. I had no trouble installing the bulbs or figuring out the various timers, etc. The only (minor) complaint is that the power cord could have been a bit longer. I can plug it in and set it on the table a couple of feet away -- you do have to be reasonably close to an outlet. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this UV lamp recently and the CND products needed to do my own at home gel manicure.  I LOVE the lamp and the products. There are many UV lamps out there. I read many reviews and did alot of research before deciding on this one.  I know this lamp is a bit more expensive than other UV lamps on the market but honestly, I feel that it was worth the few extra bucks.  The quality is fantastic and I love the 4 different timer settings.  It&#x27;s already programmed for use with the CND Shellac but you can re-program the timers for use with other products.  It was super easy to put the bulbs in (I had read another review where someone said it was difficult) but not with this lamp.  LOVE it, have used to many times already and can&#x27;t wait to continue to use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> Terrible lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Fans leave all sorts of bubbles under polish. Plus company has terrible customer service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve saved so much money on manicures and pedicures. It&#x27;s easy to use and works very well. My polish usually lasts anywhere from 1-2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I started doing my own nails because my nail tech&#x27;s business was slowing down and she needed a steady income. This lamp makes doing my own nails easy. I love the preprogrammed settings. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve only had it a few months but i&#x27;m sure it has already payed for itself.</li>
