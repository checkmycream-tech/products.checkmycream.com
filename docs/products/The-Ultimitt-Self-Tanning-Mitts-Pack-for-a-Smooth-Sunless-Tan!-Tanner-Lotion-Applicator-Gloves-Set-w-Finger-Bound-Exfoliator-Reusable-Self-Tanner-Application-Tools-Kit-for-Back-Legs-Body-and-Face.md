<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really helps tanner go on evenly and comes with a mini mit for face tanning  application.</li>
    <li> I  very pale &amp; burn easily.  So I am a big user if self tanning products to give me a healthy, burn free, sun free glow!  I was delighted when I was offered a coupon code for this mit &amp; even more excited when it arrived!  It arrived super fast!  It&#x27;s very soft &amp; perfect for applying my sunless tanning products.  It makes the application process streak free &amp; keeps your hands clean &amp; clear!  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product to have especially if you are an avid tanner. I really like this product because I don&#x27;t like touching the tanning lotion and end up with weird tans on my hands and it looks funky. With this I am easily able to apply the tanning products to my skin without getting streaks weird tans on my hands of the weird tanning oil feeling on them. The mitt itself is well made really thick durable and easy to slide your hand in and out of the mitt. You can easily move your hand in the mitt and it makes applying my self tanner so much easier since I have been using it. The mitt will last a long time and comes with a great little box you can always fit the mitt back into for storage. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.</li>
    <li> I love this mitt! I had no idea how much easier and faster it would make the application of sunless tanning products. The tiny face mitt is a bonus, and it is very useful..I use these mitts every day, wash them by hand and hang them to dry. Quick, easy and effective.</li>
    <li> This mitt is great and you get a smaller one to use on your face.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this tanning glove. Really good quality. Fast shipment. Exactly what it describes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and all my life, I have never had problems with being too pale. Never in a million years have I ever thought that I would turn to self tanning products but when I moved to the US...I realized I had to after the winter and spring season. I love the slightly tanned complexion that I used to have...so rather than mope about it, I just use self tanning products to solve my issues with my complexion. This Tanning Applicator Mitten is a godsend because it makes self tanning so much easier! Now I get to apply my self tanning products evenly - minus the discolored hands! It can easily be washed so you can use it over and over again - for a long time! Well made, well priced - I could not be happier with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I love using the Ultimitt to apply foam sunless tanning products.  The two sizes are good to have; I really like having the smaller one for my face.  Application is smooth and even.  Each time after use, I wash both out with soap, hang up to dry, and they&#x27;re ready to go the next time I need them.  The quality has been fine - no problems.</li>
    <li> I feel like I waste product by leaving some on the mitt. I prefer the gloves.</li>
    <li> Love this mitt! Very durable. I had purchased another brand that would split at the seams. This is made from fabric and likely will not tear. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This mitt is incredible! I&#x27;m apprehensive by nature but I was wonderfully surprised! The mitt is so large and covers such a large area at once without leaving streaks. Also, the plastic liner inside the mitt is great too; no lotion on my palms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tan looked so natural that my friends and family thought I had just come back from vacation! I haven&#x27;t used the mini mitt yet, only because putting tanner on my face makes me nervous. But if  the mini-mitt is anything like the larger mitt and if you&#x27;re brave enough, it&#x27;s sure to be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quick and easy way to apply self-tanner lotions with maximum results.</li>
    <li> This serves the purpose.  No complaints.  I think it is great.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this. She says it applies the lotion perfect</li>
    <li> The problem I had with other mitts is my hands are always covered with the tanner after. When I used these two mitts my hands were completely clean. The company does give you a small mitt that can used on your face. The mitts are very soft and give me a streak free tan. The big mitt is double sides. I did wash both mitts and let them dry before using them. When you are done using the mitts just put them under water and a little bit of soap to remove the tanner to clean the mitts. When I clean the mitts I twist out the water and the mitts are not cracks or damaged by me doing this. With other mitts I notice after a few uses they are cracked and worn out with this Ultimitt I don&#x27;t notice that problem. Overall I really love these mitts because my hands are clean after using them and don&#x27;t give me streaks. I was able to get Ultimitt for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I have to say it really does make putting on tanning cream a whole lot easier and smoother looking.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!  I had been using self tanner and constantly having streak issues around my hands - the mitt fixed it, and also made for smoother application everywhere else.  The mitt is super soft too.</li>
    <li> Happy with this mitt. Tanning solution goes on evenly. Much better, easier to use than latex gloves. Mitt rinses out easy, dries quickly. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Such a great idea! And much needed! I hate having to scrub my hands over and over after self tanning, but I LOVE self tanning! The package came with a little surprise, with another little mitt, made just for the face.. All in a neat carrying case. Which, is awesome! I can get more control and better results with the little mitt. Also, they are both amazingly soft. I used mine with the self tanning wipes, and since the mitt has a microfiber type feel on it, the wipes did not slide around. They applied evenly, and I did not have any trouble with getting too much on my hands for once. They are also really easy to wash. I just rinsed them well, then threw them in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> Excellent, it makes so easy to apply the selftanner. Love it.</li>
    <li> The fabric is nice and smooth and the perfect texture. It&#x27;s easy to hand-wash in the sink after you use it (I use regular hand soap to wash it). This mitt air dries quickly after you clean it (I would not recommend putting it in the dryer). I have used this twice and I plan to use it many more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this mitt because the Maskcara beauty blog recommended it. After using it, I would highly recommend using a mitt to apply tanner, regardless of whether or not you use this mitt. My hands aren&#x27;t orange (yay!) and the application of the tanner onto my skin was much smoother with no visible streaks or dark spots. And if you&#x27;re going to get a mitt anyway, you might as well get this one since it&#x27;s a safe bet.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest mitt I have ever used. Thank You</li>
    <li> Works well but wish it would reach the center of my back.</li>
    <li> Never do fake bake without this girls!! Talk about smooth..easy and even coverage!! Get one now!! Trust me!!</li>
    <li> I heard a rumor that summer is right around the corner. Eventually it has to be summer right? With summer comes my trying to have that sun-kissed look. I&#x27;m smarter  now than my younger sun worshiping days. No more laying out in the sun slathered in baby oil. I&#x27;ve been lucky so far and missed having any form of skin cancer; not so with the wrinkles and age spots from sun damage. So, self tanners here I come. My main complaint about the sunless tanners has always been the stained hands and streeks. Even if I wash them immediately after applying the tanner I still manage to have stained hands.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to be chosen to write a review of the The Ultimate Tanning Applicator Mitt . This is a great tanning accessory. The mitt arrives in it&#x27;s own carrying poly bag so that I can take it with me when I travel without worrying it will stain things in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;The mitt itself is amazingly soft, with an almost velvet texture. (Does Thermalabs make a blanket in this stuff??) It&#x27;s also large enough to fit any size hand; resting easily on your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Before I tan I make sure to exfoliate really well. I also only go over my knees and elbows only once to keep those area&#x27;s from &#x27;tanning&#x27; too dark.&lt;br /&gt;To apply my self tanner I simply apply about a quarter size dollop of tanner on the mitt and apply everywhere I want color, moving in a circular motion. The inside of the mitt is slick so I found that when I apply tanner I spread my fingers wide to keep the mitt fitting tightly. The mitt is thick enough that the tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t seep through to the inside of the mitt.&lt;br /&gt;This is a well made mitt, after almost 3 weeks this mitt hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s shape in the least, it hasn&#x27;t stretched or cracked anywhere. The Tanning Mitt is still as soft as the day it arrived. It&#x27;s even guaranteed for a FULL year!!&lt;br /&gt;Also included is a smaller mitt specially for your face. Such a great added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;The mitt truly helps the tanner smoothly glide over my skin. This mitt keeps the tanner from streaking, my tan looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readerstt keeps the tanner from streaking, my tan looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.

    <li> This mitt is totally worth the extra money!  I was hesitant about spending so much on a mitt, but after using it this morning I am so glad I did.  It made my tan go on much more even than the other mitts that I&#x27;ve had and it didn&#x27;t leave any streaks.  I like that my hand doesn&#x27;t slide around in it because that&#x27;s always a pain.  Plus the cute little face mitt is awesome for the face!  So happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It works&lt;br /&gt;I am very pale and never seem to tan.  I got some self tanner (again this summer to try)and this mitt.  It works.  No streaks.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Works great with lotion but I don&#x27;t like it with mousse.  It seems hard to rub the mousse in with the mitt but it&#x27;s fabulous with lotion!  They even include a tiny (2 finger) mitt which is great for your face, ears, etc.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I&#x27;ve used other mitts and this is by far the best. Doesn&#x27;t take as much product and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this item twice a week for a month so far and love it.  I has not fallen apart or bleed through and stain my hands.  It is made very well and it smooth when putting on my tanning lotion.  The face mit is a plus as well.  Worth the money</li>
    <li> Nice size mitt and your hand inside does NOT slip and slide around I Love It .I glad I finally found this one</li>
    <li> It is the best mitt I have ever used, and I have used many. It applies the product evenly.</li>
    <li> So totally worth the buy. I will never go back to using gloves. I will only use this mitt. It&#x27;s super soft and helps spread the lotion evenly. The mitt also helps protect your hands from getting stained.</li>
    <li> Makes a huge difference getting the lotion on more evenly!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Best way to apply their self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;No streaking, no staining, just a wonderful glow!&lt;br /&gt;The glove fits wonderfully and is easy to manage, doesn&#x27;t fall off easily and doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin. The mitt doesn&#x27;t leak, the self tanner doesn&#x27;t seep through. It is very soft on the skin and applies the tanning lotion evenly.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning mitt along with a self tanning product and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a small mitt to use just for your face. (That was a little bonus I was not expecting)&lt;br /&gt;Just put a small amount of self tanner on grab the mitt and rub it in.  No streaks and no messy hands.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and highly recommend the Ultimitt.  Review done for amztrader.</li>
    <li> pretty good, just wish the edges were smoother.</li>
    <li> I love all the products I get from amonzon.com</li>
    <li> The glove is very large and tends to slip and move awkwardly when I used the glove to apply self tanner....it pretty much kept twisting and it made it difficult to keep it in one location so I could rub the lotion correctly on my body...the inside of the glove is lined with something that seems to be cellophane in nature and made the glove constantly slip on my hand. At one point I just held the glove in my fist and used it that way....</li>
    <li> Finally!! A product that actually works to make your self tanner apply evenly and streak free.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of very sift microfiber, and it double sided.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a bonus small one for use on face and a nice zip top carrying case for it.&lt;br /&gt;It covers your entire hand (down to just past the wrist on me) - no more stained palms!&lt;br /&gt;The smaller one is great for not missing any spots when applying to your face and ears.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to clean - just a little bit of a light soap, hand wash and stand up to dry (at least that&#x27;s how I do it).&lt;br /&gt;You can use this with the self tanning lotion, foam, or mist/spray.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with streaking or getting too much tanner in one spot with this! I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It makes application a lot quicker.</li>

    <li> I bought a bronzer/tanner a few months ago and was happy with the product but not the residue it left on my hands and nails.  This was recommended to me and I ignored it...dumb.  This mitt is great!  It&#x27;s not too big for my smallish hands and easily switches from left to right during application.  I was concerned that it would use more product by way of absorption but it didn&#x27;t.  I rinsed it out before using it the first time and it dried very quickly.  I was very pleased with the even application and happy to report that it didn&#x27;t not leave any streaks or weird splotches.  Washed it out with a gentle detergent and hung it up to dry.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived early and works as described-stops streaking with sunless tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> This glove Is amazing! The tanning mouse went on smooth and steak free. It left no terrible dark marks on my hands, unlike the gloves I was using before. It came with a small glove as well for smaller areas and let me tell you. With the other glove it left a terrible tan if I were to use it on my face. $20 seems a little pricey for a glove. But it is hands down worth it.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning mitt -- perfect application and easy cleanup. Best of all, it isn&#x27;t tearing into pieces like my last one. Kudos on an excellent product! I have used it with both lotions and spray-ons (applied to the mitt first) with great results in both cases.</li>
    <li> These are a must for self tanning.  Most mits has a top (back side) that tanner leaks through and gets on hands.  Not these!  The same on both sides so no stained hands.  I bought two so I can use both on both hands which not only protects both hands from unwanted tanner but makes application go so much faster.  Only thing I  can recommend is to blend but not over blend when applying.  If I rub too much in one area it almost seems like the mits take some of the tanner off?</li>
    <li> Awesome item! thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect tool to get that all over even tan! It comes with 2 mitts one for your body and one for your face, if you like to throw a little self tanner on over your tan this is the perfect tool to make sure it is streak free!</li>
    <li> perfect applicator for tanning. no streaks etc</li>
    <li> I really like this glove, after reading reviews,  its the first one I have ever bought. Its super plush and soft, fits my hand good, (could be a tad smaller, i have tiny hands). I thought it would absorb the liquid instantly but it doesnt. You have to cup your little glove, put the solution on there and wait a brief couple seconds. But ysing it is noce, the material almost feels like fleece. Its super smooth, and I have to say it REALLY evens out your spray tan. I just set up a whole tanning spray &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; in my home to save money on tanning so Im new to spraying myself. With this glove, i immediately ran it over my whole body, contours very very well to any body area, and my FIRST tan looked solid and very good for a novice! Just have to get my ankles, feet n wrists some practice.  I love it, i highly recommend this product. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with a self tanner.  The first time I used the self tanner I used rubber gloves since I was experimenting with application.  It did not work well. The 2nd time I used this mitt and it was like night and day - the mitt really works to blend easily and keep your hands clean.  Glad I got it</li>
    <li> Smooth and evenly applies the tanning product ~ great idea!!</li>
    <li> Works great! I was it after I use it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mitt! So much worth spending a few extra bucks on over the in-store versions I have tried (that ripped after a couple of uses). This mitt works great with a lotion or mousse type sunless tanner. I do wear disposable gloves underneath as a precaution. I also wear them to hand wash this mitt with my shampoo and then hang it to dry. Works like a charm. Would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this mitt because I when I switch hands, I don&#x27;t have to worry about changing a glove under it, so much quicker.</li>
    <li> A must have for a self tanner</li>
    <li> Yay, just got this in the mail and had to try..... I used it Sarah McNamara Miracle Body Transformer tined beauty balm and it was absolutely the perfect application. I have used SMMBT with my hands and fingers and it just didn&#x27;t blend well, so much so that I have had to jump in shower again and take off......this mitt is so perfect, no streaking, no blotching just even, smoothe application. This is only a review for this particular product but judging from the perfect blend of this cream, I can safely believe it will work with any and all self tanners!!!</li>
    <li> Since I have stopped going out in the sun I have been using self-tanners.  My biggest problem was getting the tanning lotions on my hands.  This mitt is fabulous.  Not only does it protect your hands but also allows a more even application. The only problem I have with this mitt is care.  There are no instructions as to keeping it clean.  Since I didn&#x27;t get any instructions I don&#x27;t wash it but I figure all that&#x27;s on the mitt is my tanning product and so far, I haven&#x27;t had a problem.  All in all,  I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Type of suede-type material. This absorbs a lot more than other mits. The more foam-like ones work better.</li>
    <li> A must have for self tanners, works perfectly!  Washes &amp; dries nicely.</li>
    <li> This makes applying my self tanning lotion so easy and fail proof when it comes to streak free application. It seems to make the lotion go further than it would just using my hands and I never have to worry about washing my hands so I don&#x27;t have tan palms :)</li>
    <li> This is perfect it truly helps the lotion go on nice and smooth</li>
    <li> seriously beat glove ever! Iv been using awlf tanning for a ling time and im so happy i found this product.  It goes on evenly and looks good. Def recommen this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been self tanning for years and thought I had it down to a science but I was dead wrong. Once I  decided to buy this mitt it changed everything. My tan looks SO much better because you kind of buff the spray/lotion on to the skin. Some reviewers say they wash with soap and water but I just rinse really well with warm water and hang dry which seems to work just fine.  I highly recommend you buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works very good . Easy to use , easy to clean . The only reason I didn&#x27;t put 5 stars is it smells like plastic very Strong.</li>
    <li> stains bad on my skin</li>
    <li> So soft! I love putting on self-tanner without having to worry about my hands.  Plus, it feels like a bath because the sponge is so soft.  It comes too with a mini one for your face.  I love self-tanner now! And I&#x27;m thinking of other ways to use this because it&#x27;s so comfy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and evenly distributes the self tanner - no dark blotches and no stained palms.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mit! It&#x27;s thick but not stiff and nicely bends around my curves when I slather up, and it&#x27;s long enough that it stays put as I on my hand as I rub my tanning mousse back and fourth and up and down, circles and zigzags, when I&#x27;m a maniac in a big ole hurry and slinging product from one side of the room to another.....it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;The protective plastic inside is heavy enough that it DOES NOT seap through, not even in the least bit, even after being submerged with way too much product probably. No matter how soaked the outside is during use....my hands stay color free!!&lt;br /&gt;Also the texture of this one is extra smooth and not only does it glide on my skin with ease and no traction, but it helps to leave me completely streak free.....and not because I&#x27;m so careful. This mit is idiot proof really.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best one that I&#x27;ve ever had so I make all my friends and clients buy it too :)&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again......and again.&lt;br /&gt;....the price is perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, take the plunge.</li>
    <li> Awesome mit! It helps get an even application and rinses out easily with wanter. Other mits I have had flake pieces off after time and this one seems to be holding up well!</li>
    <li> Great mitt! Works better than my Ulta one</li>
    <li> This mitt is amazing! I used it with my St. Tropez  mousse and I love it ! The mitt doesn&#x27;t soak up as much product as the flimsy foam ones, so you can use less tanner during application. It is also longer so you can reach more surface area and spend less time applying the tanner. As for blending, it is phenomenal! It did an excellent job of making everything look uniform. Anyone that self-tans needs this mitt! I love it and you will too!</li>
    <li> Good tanning mitt.  Good quality.  I wish it was a bit smaller, or came in sizes.  I would prefer it fit my hand a little more snuggly so I fell like I have more control while applying tanner.</li>
    <li> Wow. Soft and great quality. Gives even coverage</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products ever - so soft and made with high quality materials.  I used to apply my tanning lotion without a mitt and this mitt has made the process twice as fast and I don&#x27;t have to worry about streaks on my body or my hands - it makes all the difference in achieving a flawless tan every time.  I also hand wash mine after every use and it cleans very well - product doesn&#x27;t seep through at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used self-tanners for 10 years.  I have very fair skin and find a mitt with a self tanner is a must for an even application.  I tried this mitt as a gample rather than picking up whatever Ulta was selling on their shelves.  It is much much better than every mitt I&#x27;ve used.  The best part is it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak-up&amp;#34; all my product.  I always hated the waste of the mitt soaking up the tanner and then watching wash down the drain when I rinsed.  This mitt is also more durable and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great mitt!  Much better than the thin ones.  Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive - for a much better product that will last a long time.</li>
    <li> just as described and much better than ones I have bought in past that fell apart</li>
    <li> I am SUPER excited about trying this product and sharing it with my family.  My husband and I are tanning bed tanners and love the sun and this may be the HEALTHIER WAY!</li>
    <li> Works great with any lotions.  NO STREAKS! Nice even tanning.</li>
    <li> Does the trick with my Jergens tanning mousse 😊</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this tanning glove.  I have no problem keeping it on my hand.  I&#x27;ve been using it to apply a mousse type self-tanner and I feel that it gives a very even coat with no streaks or splotches.  It does absorb some of the tanner but it&#x27;s much better than applying by hand.</li>
    <li> I did NOT receive this free like everyone else in these reviews, I paid full price and would do so again because this really is a great tanning mitt. The guarantee alone is worth it but the mitt itself is really made well. The bonus finger mitt is nice but leaked thru to my fingertips &amp; nails so I&#x27;d recommend using finger cots or cut latex glove fingers with it. The edges of the mini are kind of uncomfortable around the eye area so I ended up just using the big one instead. I highly recommend this mitt and will definitely purchase another next year. Fast shipping... I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use and easy to clean and best of all -  no more tan palms!</li>
    <li> After buying THERMALABS Natural Self Tanner lotion and their GLOW 2 GO TOWELETTES,  I read the reviews for THE ULTIMITT!!  All the reviews were &amp;#34;GLOWING&amp;#34;. When I tried to order it Amazon said it was out of stock and didn&#x27;t know when it would be available. I called Thermalabs and they e mailed back saying it was now available at Amazon!! I received mine 3 days later and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it! I have small hands and was worried it would fall off...it didn&#x27;t. The mitt is two sided, very soft and lined to keep the lotion from seeping thru. If you&#x27;re new to self tanning (like me), or you tried it and were not exactly thrilled with the results, try THERMALABS products. I am thrilled with the results!  The customer service is outstanding!</li>
    <li> Excellent mitt for putting on sunless tanner. The other one I had became quite thin and I knew it was time for a different type. This one is so much thicker and really does a better job.</li>
    <li> Great idea, just was awkward for me to use</li>
    <li> I have used this mitt for two different types of self tanners: loving tan and million dollar tan. It was worked wonders with both.  This mitt ensures a even application, and it works like a charm at blending, especially around the ankles and wrists. It is very soft and soothing, so it never irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works well with the Norvell mousse!</li>
    <li> I have tried many tanner mitt&#x27;s. This one is high quality for a great price. Soft and helps the lotion apply smoothly ! Love it!</li>
    <li> Yes, this looks like the best-quality tanning mitt out there, but I&#x27;m not spending $20 for a mitt no matter how good it is! (with s&amp;h). Especially since I like to use a mitt on each hand when applying sunless tanner. IMO, $10 should be the max charged for any mitt.</li>
    <li> The best tanning mitt ever!  Thick and strong. Works great.</li>
    <li> This mitt is now my holy grail! I was pleasantly surprised when I received this mitt: it is large, good quality, nicely packaged, and you get a free mini mitt for your face.&lt;br /&gt;I have been self tanning for many many years and a proper mitt at a good price is always hard to come by. But the current mitts I have at home got funky  and I desperately needed a new one. For the price, I figured I&#x27;ll roll the dice.&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived, I expected it to be in some cheap bag and for it to be flimsy. (Sometimes ordering online is a swing and a miss, unfortunately). To my surprise and delight, the mitt came in a really nice package, with the company name and website on it and it included a little mini mitt for self-tanning the face. It also included care instructions and some discounts for tanning products. The mitt was big and the material was soft and thick, and had enough of a plastic coating on the inside of the mitt so that the tanner doesn&#x27;t leak onto your palms. This is obviously the point of using a mitt - a fact that seems to be lost on some companies that make these, as they are made so small.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I was excited to use the mitt so I hopped in the shower, exfoliated, shaved.. the usual pre-self tanner routine.&lt;br /&gt;I used mine for the first time with the Norvell Venetian Sunless Solution. I actually bought a huge bottle and just poured it into a small spray bottle I had. So I sprayed the mitt and went to town.&lt;br /&gt;The mitt is incredible: soft, doesn&#x27;t streak the product onto the skin, and of course it fits my palm properly so that the palm and wrists stayed nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Basically what I&#x27;m saying is, I have found my tanning mitt. The price is right, the product is well made and does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Go get your own!</li>
    <li> I love using this tanning mitt. It makes is so much easier for me to get the tanning lotion evenly all over my legs with less streaks or missed spots. I also love that I do not have to worry about my hands being streaked and stained from the lotions anymore. This mitt is super soft and very easy to use. It spreads the lotion effortlessly on my legs. It even comes with a tiny mitt for your face. So now, you can apply tanning lotion to your face without having to get it all over your hands. I also feel by using this mitt, I am able to get a better, evenly looking natural tan with a lot less streaks than when I use my hands. It works great. Now that I have this, I do not think I will ever go back to using my bare hands again. I love it and it&#x27;s so easy to use and a lot less messy. This mitt is well made and I expect it to last a while. It has a generous size that covers my wrist but does not fall off. I highly recommend this tanning mitt for applying tanning lotions!</li>
    <li> the package was definitely new to me, inside was this plastic pouch that you can use for every day travel and inside that was this soft as silk even softer mitt, usually when you use a mitt for self tanners they leave a streak across your face and that drives me crazy to no end! this one doesn&#x27;t at all its soft and smooth and apply&#x27;s everything evenly, Washing it was easy too baby shampoo and water and it came clean, i like to use a skirt hanger on mine and hang it up to drip dry and that works amazing with this, it didn&#x27;t fall apart or get all wrinkly and crack on me after one use, I&#x27;m so glad i got to try this for free, definitely going to get another just to have on hand!  No Streaks, no yellowish orange hands, no falling apart when using it who could ask for more!</li>
    <li> Works great! no streaks at all!</li>
    <li> I really like how soft the mitt is.  It is made with top premium microfiber and I really like that. Its big enough to fit both mine and my husbands hands comfortably without being too lose or too tight. I didn&#x27;t realize it came with a finger mitt for your face either, so that was a welcomed surprise! It comes in a traveling bag that plastic with a zip up seal which I find very useful and helpful. You can travel with it knowing if its dirty it wont damage anything or it wont get lost. The tanner did not sink in and get all over our hands what so ever. The mitt didn&#x27;t rip or break or stretch even with my husband using it. Its big enough to cover full areas on our bodies and we were able to self tan with no streaks at all! It gave us both a flawless tan. I would really recommend this for people who need to self tan quickly and still have a flawless tan or for people who are new to self tanning and do not want to look streaky. Another great thing about this is there is a one full year guarantee, so for any reason something happens or you don&#x27;t like it, you can get your money back or get the item replaced. You can use this mitt with  mousse, gels, mists, and lotions. I highly recommend this product, it truly worked for my husband and I!!! Im really glad I got this free to review, I am completely sold!!</li>
    <li> First thing to notice about the Ultimitt is it&#x27;s construction. This self tanning mitt is made very well. The Ultimitt is also thick &amp; plush. The surface of the mitt will help you to have a smoother application of whatever self tanner you may use. Have used this mitt 3 times now. Love also the inside of the mitt as self tanner wont sink through &amp; stain your hands. Thank you Thermalabs for making the Ultimitt. Finally someone made a self tanning mitt that wont let your self tanner seep through onto your hands. Just as important is how easy it is to clean this mitt. Another thing to know is that the Ulitmitt is durable &amp; it should last a very long time. The size of the mitt will fit just about anyone hands even my brother who is 6&#x27;3, and has big hands. Love the extra mini Ultimitt that you can use for the smaller areas of your face. It was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
