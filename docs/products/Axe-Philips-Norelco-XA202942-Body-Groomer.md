      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So happy with this purchase.</li>

      <li>Best product of this kind I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Great battery life.  </li>
      <li>Very effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now, onto the happy good things about this body groomer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, cuts both directions, holds a charge, and has been good to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;5: lasts a good while between charges.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it was for $30.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just be honest, it shaves my junk better than anything else that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>it was very lightly.</li>
      <li>This groomer is a great shaver and worked very well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes shave my chest hair in the summer, and it is real quick for that.</li>
      <li>Bought this grommer to do some personal trimming and it works just great!!!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Would get the 5th star if there were more length options</li>
      <li>I love mine.</li>
      <li>Was good for first 3 weeks but the screen broke while trimming hair on my fingers..</li>
      <li>Great charging cradle that you don&#x27;t have to plug directly into razor.</li>
      <li>This works really good, fast, clean.  </li>
      <li>, all things considered, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this body groomer; I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied, too.</li>
      <li>The guards that come with the replacement blades don&#x27;t fit the axe version.</li>
      <li>Great value and solidly made.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t enjoy the fussy ritual anyway, and</li>
      <li>Super easy to use even the shower.</li>
      <li>Just GREAT !, no irritation, works exactly as advertised, I got it from amazon for about 30 $, it is cheaper than the exact relevant model without the Axe branding, but it is the same.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this much but so far it seems to be great.</li>
      <li>It kept me clean for years.  </li>
      <li>Having the foil shaver with the trimmers gives me a clean shave, without needing to follow up with a razor.</li>
      <li>Does a good job on back hair, but does yank quite a bit regardless of length.</li>
      <li>Also not a bad face trimmer.....</li>
      <li>Charges quickly, compact and waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Better than my normal hair clippers so thats</li>
      <li>Never hurts and works very well !!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s two cons (each worth half a star) to this otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll take patience, but the payoff is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(You&#x27;re going to want to replace the foil it comes with pretty soon, but that can really be said for most electric shaving products that come with stock replaceable heads, so that&#x27;s not so much a con.</li>
      <li>This is just right for me--</li>
      <li>It works like the micro touch trimmers but only much better and quicker.</li>
      <li>I bought this very same product at Walmart, but I figure more people are going to look to reviews here before purchasing this groomer anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t interested in spending $80 just to re-open the playground.  </li>
      <li>50 minutes, which can be 10 shaves if you only take 5 minutes at most.</li>
      <li>but the Axe actually worked better than $80 Braun.</li>
      <li>Even  with that said, this does a pretty close shave and didn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation.</li>
      <li>This is my first body groomer I have bought, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
      <li>Works exactly as I intended for, trimming body hair below the neck.</li>
      <li>Still overall the best non-razor shave I have found and stays fairly short for a lot longer than I expected (maybe thats the yanking out part, I dont know).</li>
      <li>Just pop out the shaving head, rinse both the head and that place it clicks into, let them air dry, and you&#x27;re good to go for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very versatile.</li>
      <li>does the job really well, im i heary guy, baby skin</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all that really irks me.</li>
      <li>: it does what you want it to do, and it does it very well.</li>
      <li>dropped the first one and plastic wasn&#x27;t damaged but a piece of metal teeth broke off from waist high on concrete.</li>
      <li>/&gt;4: simple to maintain and clean.</li>
      <li>Shaves groin almost bare and legs as good as an electric razor can (visibly shaved but not smooth to touch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off: the only reason this groomer doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 star rating from me is because it takes 8 hours to fully charge.</li>
      <li>Decent.</li>
      <li>You can use it with no guard which cuts super short, or use the guard.</li>
      <li>: Can pull on hairs, not easy to take apart head to clean and only able to reach that which you can with your hand.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This works good, not great.  </li>
      <li>First razor of which I have ever been a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tree-trunks on my chin wreck a standard blade after two uses</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m left with no guard or to buy a whole new body groom.</li>
      <li>It works good, but frustrating that there is only 1 guard.</li>
      <li>This is essentially the same exact product in a new package.  </li>
      <li>It grew until I could barely see what was in the jungle</li>
      <li>down-- close enough to look fresh shaven, but not so close as to burn or allow them to become ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s 10 days, and if you shave every other day, it&#x27;s like you get almost a whole month for one 8 hour</li>
      <li>If you use it wet, let the whole unit air dry between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
</ol>

<li> so its tough to judge.</li>

<li> For the price, I promise you, you can not go wrong with trying this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product shaves as advertised.  I have previously owned a &amp;#34;Phillips Body Groom&amp;#34; which I had purchased at Target for around $40.  It kept me clean for years.  When it finally gave up I also gave up.  I&#x27;m not a big shopper and it&#x27;d had been years since I allowed my jungle to grow.  So why not?  It grew until I could barely see what was in the jungle and my wife finally asked me why I had become &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told that the playground was closed until it was cleaned up so I went in search of another product.  This is essentially the same exact product in a new package.  I checked Target and they had a Phillips brand body groomer, but it was $80.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in spending $80 just to re-open the playground.  This was around $40.  Playground is once again open for business.</li>
    <li> Best product of this kind I have ever used. Beats shaving or using a conventional trimmer.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just be honest, it shaves my junk better than anything else that I&#x27;ve used. Also not a bad face trimmer.....I should probably buy a second one.</li>
    <li> First razor of which I have ever been a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tree-trunks on my chin wreck a standard blade after two uses and I don&#x27;t enjoy the fussy ritual anyway, and a &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; leaves me with ingrown hairs.  This is just right for me-- my only other real option is to wear a goatee, which I sometimes do, but usually go clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the extension attachment for when I wear a goatee, but want it kept &amp;#34;3-day&amp;#34; short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for fun, I cleared the beard and went with a &amp;#34;pencil thin mustache&amp;#34; for a couple of days.  This was a great tool for that precision work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers (which flank the screen) cut the chin hair down so the foil section can grind them further down-- close enough to look fresh shaven, but not so close as to burn or allow them to become ingrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had mine for a year and half by now-- it travels well (I sometimes shave in the car-- Don&#x27;t judge!), cuts both directions, holds a charge, and has been good to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes shave my chest hair in the summer, and it is real quick for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this very same product at Walmart, but I figure more people are going to look to reviews here before purchasing this groomer anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off: the only reason this groomer doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 star rating from me is because it takes 8 hours to fully charge. That&#x27;s all that really irks me. Well, that and the head of the groomer (where the foil clicks in) is incompatible with the trimming guards that come with replacement foils. (You&#x27;re going to want to replace the foil it comes with pretty soon, but that can really be said for most electric shaving products that come with stock replaceable heads, so that&#x27;s not so much a con. You can find replacement heads cheaper than the store prices here on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s two cons (each worth half a star) to this otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the happy good things about this body groomer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: it does what you want it to do, and it does it very well. Shave your chest? You got it! Shave armpits? No problem! Shave anywhere else below the neckline? Not even a challenge! All you need is to take your time trimming down the long hairs, (you don&#x27;t even need the trimming guard,) then slowly shave back and forth with the foil across the areas you want shaved. It&#x27;ll take patience, but the payoff is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: works wet or dry. I use mine in the shower. If you use it wet, let the whole unit air dry between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: works with shaving cream and gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4: simple to maintain and clean. Just pop out the shaving head, rinse both the head and that place it clicks into, let them air dry, and you&#x27;re good to go for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5: lasts a good while between charges. 50 minutes, which can be 10 shaves if you only take 5 minutes at most. That&#x27;s 10 days, and if you shave every other day, it&#x27;s like you get almost a whole month for one 8 hour charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all things considered, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this body groomer; I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied, too.</li>
    <li> Works great on everything below the neck</li>
    <li> Decent. Does a good job on back hair, but does yank quite a bit regardless of length. Still overall the best non-razor shave I have found and stays fairly short for a lot longer than I expected (maybe thats the yanking out part, I dont know). I am not disappointed I bought it, but not sure I would necessarily recommend it either - on the other hand, I dont know what else is out there so its tough to judge. Better than my normal hair clippers so thats a positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Charges quickly, compact and waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can pull on hairs, not easy to take apart head to clean and only able to reach that which you can with your hand.</li>
    <li> This groomer is a great shaver and worked very well.</li>
    <li> Was good for first 3 weeks but the screen broke while trimming hair on my fingers.. seriously cheap foil, waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;And, can&#x27;t find a replacement screen for the bloody thing just puts icing on the cake..</li>
    <li> Great value and solidly made. Very versatile. I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it was for $30. Great charging cradle that you don&#x27;t have to plug directly into razor. Great battery life.  I use it for groin area and legs only. Shaves groin almost bare and legs as good as an electric razor can (visibly shaved but not smooth to touch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped the first one and plastic wasn&#x27;t damaged but a piece of metal teeth broke off from waist high on concrete. Bought an $80 replacement to hopefully get smoother shave on legs but the Axe actually worked better than $80 Braun. So returned it and bought another one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy with this purchase. Would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I&#x27;ve not nicked myself with this but only a couple times and it was very lightly.</li>
    <li> does the job really well, im i heary guy, baby skin</li>
    <li> Works great and still holds a charge after using for 6 months. A lot of other shavers I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t hold charges after a while but this one does. A+</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much but so far it seems to be great. This is my first body groomer I have bought, so I have nothing to compare it to. Even  with that said, this does a pretty close shave and didn&#x27;t cause me any skin irritation. I will update my review after I have used it for a while. For the price, I promise you, you can not go wrong with trying this. The price of this item keeps dropping. At $21 you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Super easy to use even the shower. Never hurts and works very well !!</li>
    <li> I love mine. It has lasted me a year and a half thus far. WORD OF WARNING: I lost the guard that came with mine. The guards that come with the replacement blades don&#x27;t fit the axe version. So I&#x27;m left with no guard or to buy a whole new body groom. Next time I&#x27;m getting the version that has an adjustable length guard on the opposite end.</li>
    <li> This works good, not great.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close as a shave as the Norelco rotating heads, which I used on my body, that razor does take longer to shave with.  This works really good, fast, clean.  However, I think it could be a bit closer shaver.  Overall would recommend.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job shaving. Gives a smooth non irritating shave.  I am very pleased with this shaver and the price was excellent</li>
    <li> It works good, but frustrating that there is only 1 guard. You can use it with no guard which cuts super short, or use the guard. There is no in between...&lt;br /&gt;Would get the 5th star if there were more length options</li>
    <li> The best body grooming tool I ever used. Having the foil shaver with the trimmers gives me a clean shave, without needing to follow up with a razor.</li>
    <li> Bought this grommer to do some personal trimming and it works just great!!! Works exactly as I intended for, trimming body hair below the neck. It works like the micro touch trimmers but only much better and quicker. A very good buy!!! Just remember that it is not intended for facial hair, only below the neck and it works in the shower if you are so inclined.</li>
    <li> This thing cut me  from the day I got it</li>
    <li> Just GREAT !, no irritation, works exactly as advertised, I got it from amazon for about 30 $, it is cheaper than the exact relevant model without the Axe branding, but it is the same.</li>
    <li> Great price. Very effective.</li>
