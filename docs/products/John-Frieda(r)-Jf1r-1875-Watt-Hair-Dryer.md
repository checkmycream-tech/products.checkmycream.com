<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This dries my hair really fast so that&#x27;s the biggest plus.  However, it also has a tendency to make my hair a big tangled mess in a way that other dryers don&#x27;t do.  I still like this dryer but that&#x27;s definitely a drawback</li>
    <li> I NEEDED A GOOD BLOW DRYER BECAUSE I&#x27;M GOING NATURAL AND THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED TO KEEP MY HAIR HEALTHY.THE QUALITY IS NICE AND THE PRICE IS NICER.</li>
    <li> I am so happy for my choice! This Hair dryer is very good. I read all the reviews before deciding what to buy and it&#x27;s worth doing that. John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer is exactly as mentioned by most of the customers - powerful, with many options for heating and power and it dryes my hair for less time!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is as advertised. I only gave it four stars because the buttons on the handle get in the way when holding it to dry my hair. The first few times I used it, I was bumping them enough to change the temperature/speed of the blow dryer. I&#x27;ve changed up my grip now so it is no longer a problem. It is a fairly heavy blow dryer as well, but is worth it as it works better than the cheaper ones I was using before.</li>
    <li> The only negative thing I can find is that the buttons are awkwardly placed. But it&#x27;s not a problem-great product!</li>
    <li> Pros: It definitely lives up to it&#x27;s promises. My hair does look and feel less frizzy and is more shiny. Drying time was considerably shorter. The heat settings are exactly as described. Hot is hot, warm is warm and cool is cool. Great cold shot. Nice diffuser attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I know what other reviews mean by high pitched tin sound. On the low setting it doesn&#x27;t sound quite right. Like it has a whistle that sounds concerning. It is a little heavier than my old dryer, but not bad considering drying time is shorter. The buttons are in a strange place, you do have to make an effort to not touch them while in use.</li>
    <li> So I open up the package and out comes this shiny thing that looks a bit like a sci-fi ray gun.  The Frieda JF1 hair dryer works very well.  It blew my hair dry in just a few seconds.  It comes with various attachments, including two different concentrators and a diffuser, but at the moment I don&#x27;t see myself needing those.  Of course this dryer has other uses around the house, including melting ice and making your own homemade shrink-wrap.  (For the latter, all you need is plastic wrap and an object you want to shrink-wrap.  Don&#x27;t do this around young kids, though!)</li>
    <li> This is one sweet Hairdryer, stylish, well made and looks well built. I got the whole family to try this out and everyone likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They loved the attachment that helps with frizzled hair and another attachment that seems to give a \\&quot;flat\\&quot; blast out of the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It has great controls, hot and warm, with three speed for the fan. It can also be used to blow cold air with a trigger type button under the blower section.&lt;br /&gt;The cable is long enough and also worth mentioning is the neat box it came in. The style is quite interesting but not overdone and it sure catches the eyes of my kids friends who frequently come over to help each other with their hair styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite pleased with this hair dryer, it does what it should with ease, style and power!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is a powerful unit!  Very impressive compared to our old one.  My wife complains that it&#x27;s a bit heavy and awkward but if you can handle it this unit gets the job done fast!</li>
    <li> Really loved this hair dryer. The temperature and the wind are comfortable. Really feel happy to have it with this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned drugstore hair dryers, so I jumped at the chance of getting this hair dryer for almost half the price in a lightning deal.  I have thick long hair.  My previous dryer would dry the outside of my hair, and even though it would feel completely dry, the roots would still hold some moisture and my hair would eventually go flat.  The John Frieda dryer works great, and dries my hair faster and more completely.  My hair looks like it has more volume and it will hold thoughout the day.  That being said, the cons would prevent me from buying this again.  The first thing is that it is heavy.  The second, the most annoying thing, is that the controls on the handle are exactly where you hold it.  You have to make a concerted effort not to accidently press the levers that turn it from high/low/off and hot/warm/cold.  It is not unusual to have to stop in the middle of blow drying my hair to readjust the levers.  It&#x27;s hard to understand why they would place the controls on the side of the handle, and also why they would use those type of buttons. I&#x27;ve tried to hold it below the levers, but it&#x27;s so heavy that you need to hold it higher to get a good balance.  The function of the hair dryer does not outweigh the inconvenience of the handle.  I would not recommend buying this unless it was at a deeply discounted price.</li>
    <li> Great dryer. The only cons are the heaviness and noisiness of the dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 7 months and it&#x27;s all but dead. Makes funny noises, smells like burning, changes strength. I&#x27;ve kept hairdryers for years and years before this one and have never had this problem. I feel like I&#x27;m going to be electrocuted!</li>
    <li> Have had this blowdryer for less than 6 months and it&#x27;s already quit working :( Bought it at Ulta for around $45 to replace a cheaper dryer I&#x27;d had for 6 years!  Very unsatisfied and disappointed!  I would NOT recommend buying it!!!!</li>
    <li> The John Frieda JF1 does all it says it will. Shiny hair with no static. Dries quickly without the high pitched roar of other dryers. The overall look is very nice. Just one major problem...its very heavy. If you are in it for the long haul,as with long thick hair styling,you better be young and strong. I am over sixty and have medium length fine hair and I find it easier to just use the curling Iron on most days. If you are not using the blow dryer for styling it works just fine and comes with several heads for specific drying.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m wary that the dryer may go out in the next 8-10 months or start to develop a strange scent (per previous reviews here and on other sites), I am for the most part happy with my purchase ESPECIALLY for the price of $20 for a hair dryer that is still being sold in Ulta and other stores for up to $55. The dryer does have side buttons, which for many people was an issue, but the dryer I had prior had the same feature and it doesn&#x27;t get in my way now as it didn&#x27;t then. The hair dryer is light/medium weight. The swivel cord hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me either. This is after 1 use but I believe it is going to work out wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;(Also note: make sure you dry your hair 1-2 inches away from the hair itself or else this or ANY dryer will burn out quicker than it normally would!)</li>
    <li> Love it and its attatchments too.</li>
    <li> I liked the hair dryer. It&#x27;s  1875w the same as my old hair dryer but the air seems to come out with more force. It&#x27;s not too heavy which is good because I&#x27;m a weakling, the cord is long enough, it&#x27;s easy to hold and dries hair very quickly! The only problem for me was the switches on the side instead of in the front because they were right where I hold the dryer and I was accidentely hitting them the whole time changing the setting which was very annoying! Overall, it was a good powerful hair dryer if you are able to deal with the switch placement.</li>
    <li> Over the years these hair dryers have given us greater control over the speeds and heat. The construction quality is just first class. Super powered and very nice accessories. The latest generations of dryers is definitely gentle to one&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> This is a first class hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Well built. Looks good and performs better.&lt;br /&gt;The 1800+ watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units.&lt;br /&gt;The only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn&#x27;t very portable. No retracting power cords, no folding handles. But it isn&#x27;t meant to be portable. Most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two. It has three attachments, one is a diffuser (T3 charges an extra $20-30 JUST for their diffuser alone) to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance (works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then \\&quot;fixing\\&quot; your hair in that position. I find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction. Some have criticized it as not having a metal body. It disagree, A metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present, which is where many people use their hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom. Pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician, not yourself, so the dangers are minimized a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices ($120-200) they cost, this is the dryer for you.</li>
    <li> love the product great service</li>
    <li> This hair dryer left my hair a tangeled mess each time I used it.  I will be returning and going back to a conair or revlon hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Nice hair dryer, way more powerful than my old dryer.  Makes my hair a bit tangled, though, when I don&#x27;t dry it right away before my mousse begins to dry and set.  Still a nice dryer for the price!</li>
    <li> My son loves it, dries quickly and is very strong!</li>
    <li> Takes a few minutes to warm up and the full force setting creates tangles in my hair but I am working with it and getting used to it. The medium setting seems to work well with fine hair, the jury is still out on this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is relatively thin, fine, and will take over an hour to dry if I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer or sit beside a fan. It&#x27;s very annoying when I just want to shower before work in the morning and not leave the house with wet hair, so I was on the lookout for a good, affordable dryer that dries fast. Thankfully, I ran into this one. I don&#x27;t have to turn the temp up high in order to dry my hair quickly; the low fan and medium setting is enough. My hair is about midway down my back right now and I dry my hair in about 10 minutes, versus 20-25 with other hairdryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design isn&#x27;t great; the buttons are exactly where you grasp the handle. After a few uses I got used to it and don&#x27;t hit the buttons accidentally anymore. I don&#x27;t find this hairdryer heavy. The cord is of a decent length but could be longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer actually makes my hair look nice, and is the only one that will allow me to dry-and-go. My hair also gets static-y very easily and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in that since switching to this dryer. I used to carry dryer sheets around; it was that bad. I will continue to use this hairdryer happily until it burns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/28/16: Still using this dryer every other day, still going strong.s I&#x27;ve tried look kind of tacky. That&#x27;s not the most important aspect of a hair dryer of course, but I could see a guy with longer hair owning this and it not being something they&#x27;d feel like they have to hide in the back of a shelf somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually haven&#x27;t tried the attachments so this might not be a helpful review in that case, but I was really impressed with just how fast and well this can dry my hair without making it look like straw. This blow dryer actually makes my hair look nice, and is the only one that will allow me to dry-and-go, no fiddling around with a straightener necessary. My hair has honestly never looked better, which is amazing since my hair breaks like mad when exposed to heat, normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being a hairdryer that actually dries hair fast without killing it at the same time, this deserves 5 stars. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/19/13: Still going on strong. I use this every other day, but I still often get compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair is. My hair is longer now, near midway down my back, but I can dry it completely in 10 minutes. Because I use this so often, I do always use some heat protectant(Tresseme) before blow drying my hair. That&#x27;s it, still highly recommend this!mend this!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace an old cheapo Remington hair dryer that I bought. The Remington didn&#x27;t last me long (less than a year) and in general was a mediocre hair dryer but it got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the cons: I have thick long straight hair with a natural wave, my day to day hair style is scrunched. I have a universal diffuser that I love to use, it&#x27;s huge and has high sides that are easy to scoop my long hair into. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed about the John Frieda Hair Dryer is the unusual shape of the nozzle. It is big and short and my universal diffuser does not fit it, nor will any universal diffuser on the market (at least I haven&#x27;t found one yet). So I&#x27;m forced to use the attached diffuser that came with it. It does the job but it&#x27;s not as easy to use as my old one. The buttons are also in a very awkward place, right where my thumb sits when I&#x27;m holding it so I&#x27;m constantly turning the temperature down by accident. I also end up hitting the cool shot button all the time. It takes some adjustment to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this hair dryer is excellent, it&#x27;s extremely powerful. It has cut my hair drying time down by half. Most of the time I don&#x27;t even use it on full heat. If you don&#x27;t use a diffuser or aren&#x27;t married to using a larger universal one, I would definitely recommend this hair dryer. If it wasn&#x27;t so awesome, I would probably return it for not fitting my diffuser but I think using the included one will be an okay compromise for me.</li>
    <li> Really love the cold setting.</li>
    <li> I finally replaced my old hand-me-down Conair dryer with this John Frieda dryer, and it has been like night and day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The significant differences are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- faster drying - I am pretty busy so I often find myself needing dry hair ASAP (to pick my kid up, to head outside, etc.). I haven&#x27;t timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I&#x27;ve had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn&#x27;t erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don&#x27;t worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I&#x27;ve spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don&#x27;t use a brush, don&#x27;t use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It&#x27;s too bad that a month before I found this I&#x27;d already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won&#x27;t be needing any of those tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I&#x27;m petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it&#x27;s a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

    <li> I thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me. Nope. Almost every time I dry my hair I hit the temp or speed button... at least 2-3 times. It&#x27;s does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that I would recommend to keep looking. I like it but can&#x27;t wait for it to break and find a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I got this and was excited because of the reviews. It does dry my hair but takes longer than my drugstore dryer, but might be healthier. The attachments do NOT stay on making them almost useless. I tried to return it but my husband threw away the box, so I&#x27;m stuck. I can say it&#x27;s pretty and I like the cool shot, but it does NOT lock as described....you have to hold it down the whole time. Also, the plug is too narrow. It keeps coming unplugged because it&#x27;s too loose. It&#x27;s easy to accidentally change settings or turn it off when in use because of button placement, but starting to get use to it.</li>
    <li> How does one review a hairdryer?  I had to think a minute beyond the obvious.  So I set out some pretty simple criteria.  Comparing it to my $9.99 Revlon bare-bones hair dryer from Walmart is my strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s two things I figured needed to be addressed:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Is there any discernible difference between my $10 hair dryer and this $50 one?&lt;br /&gt;2.  Is the difference (if any) justify the additional expense, especially in this economy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To preface my review, note that I have average hair in average condition, with no curls and no extra time for primping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the results, and the reasons behind the 5 star rating I gave this Frieda hair dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Looks:  the Frieda dryer looks like a BMW, silver with a blue/purple trim and is slick and aerodynamic.  Feels solid but not too heavy.  My cheapie feels cheap, is overly light plastic.  But what do looks matter beyond performance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Performance:  I don&#x27;t know the volts of the Revlon dryer, and didn&#x27;t realize how awful it was until I compared.  The cheapie sounds like a high pitched \\&quot;tin\\&quot; whine and didn&#x27;t feel all that powerful.  The Frieda has obviously more power, but is not as noisy.  Still loud, but more of a hum than a whine.  The barrel is longer on the Frieda but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  The Frieda came with three attachments:  a diffuser for scrunching or curls, and two sort of \\&quot;aiming\\&quot; attachments to shoot directly at a portion of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Frieda also has a cool shot setting that my cheapie lacks, and I used it to lock in volume that really made a difference.  With the cool shot and a shot of hair spray immediately before I released the hair spray, the curl stayed well enough I didn&#x27;t need my curling iron.  And three hours later the curl was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three heat settings (only two on my cheapie) which was nice because I could dry my little boy&#x27;s hair with LOW and he didn&#x27;t get annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Timing:  The Frieda dried my hair faster than my old dryer by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Hair:  I don&#x27;t know what the ions mean in the Frieda, but my hair was fluffier and softer.  Strangely so.  Enough so that someone even commented on it, thinking I had a new haircut.  Very full and natural, and with the cold shots to the roots it looked like I had more hair than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Misc:  I think it&#x27;s odd that the Frieda doesn&#x27;t have a retractable cord.  When I bought my last hair dryer, almost all the models for sale across varying price ranges all had a retractable cord.  This doesn&#x27;t, and maybe it&#x27;s not a big deal (possibly just something to break).  But it does have a neat little strap that allows you to tie up the cord when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a little metal key chain/fob thing that says \\&quot;Frieda\\&quot;.  Do they seriously think I want a key chain to remind me of my hair dryer?  Also, the instructions state that I&#x27;m free to use any hair products I wish for cleaning and styling my hair (I assume as opposed to Frieda products only).  Really?  For real?  I didn&#x27;t need to be told that...duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Wish list:  Given all the bells and whistles on this model, a carrying case would have been cool.  Sure, few hair dryers come with one, but for $50, a case for travel would have really clinched the sale if I were purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the results:  Is it worth $50?  Yes, I believe it is.  It exceeded my expectations, but if I went back in time to when I purchased my Revlon cheapie, I couldn&#x27;t have afforded it so wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, even with the 5star rating.  So if you can afford it, great...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  IF food on the table is an issue, go cheap.  Also, after doing some research online, there are many Ion dryers that are MUCH more expensive than this, so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, I think this would please you at a savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this review helpful!rieda dried my hair faster than my old dryer by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.

    <li> If I am to be honest, I have NEVER found a hair dryer that I truly loved.  I have VERY think and VERY long hair, so finding a dryer that lives up to the task is hard to find.  My hair dryer runs for a good 30 minutes straight which means #1. By the time I get through drying my hair I am sweating due to the heat needed to accomplish this task and #2. My arms are really tired by the time I&#x27;m done. Which brings me to the 2 things I absolutely LOVED about this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It didn&#x27;t take 30 minutes to dry my hair. It took about 15 and my face never felt the heat from the dryer. I&#x27;m not exactly sure how this happens, but I found myself on several occasions actually reaching my hand up in front of the dryer to make sure it was blowing hot. It was. All I felt was a cool breeze on my face while my hair took the brunt of the heat.&lt;br /&gt;*Even though it looks really heavy (I kind of freaked out at it&#x27;s size when I pulled it out of the box) it&#x27;s actually quite light and balanced, so it doesn&#x27;t put a lot of stress on your arm while you are styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... here are the features that I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It has 3 different speeds &amp; temps allowing you to mix and match according to your hair type. (these are toggle switches)&lt;br /&gt;*It has a locking cold button so you don&#x27;t have to struggle while setting your style &amp; holding down a button at the same time&lt;br /&gt;*It came with 3 different attachments, 2 directionals and a diffuser&lt;br /&gt;*The \\&quot;ion\\&quot; actually made my hair shiny, so much so that I DIDN&#x27;T need to use my flat iron when I was done drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall quality product. A little pricey, but well worth the money if you have difficult/think/hard to manage hair.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not too much to say when you like a product.  This hair dryer is a durable and solid piece of equipment.  All the settings functioned well and, well, it dried my hair without frizzing it.  The only drawback is that it might be a little heavy for some people.  Cheers.</li>
    <li> I purchased [[ASIN:B004Q6JL04 Joico K-PAK Quadraion Pro-Dryer]] about 8 months ago, and thought it would be the answer to my needs. Well, to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I purchased this one. I really like it! It is a little louder than the Joico one but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, this one works great. The buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren&#x27;t a deal breaker. It dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one, makes it shiny, and has multiple heat settings. The cold shot works great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really is a great deal for a quality dryer, I tried the best and had nothing but issues...so I would rate this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend [[ASIN:B004Q6LVAW Joico K-PAK Quadraion Blowdry Spray, 5.1 fl. oz.]] it works with any dryer :)</li>
    <li> Wow this really does live up its expectations based on the consumer reviews... It dries my hair in less then 5 mins! Great dryer!</li>
    <li> I saw this dryer in Good Housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try, even though I was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer.  This one really is better!  Dries faster, and seems very gentle.  The cooling feature is great for setting curls and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a second dryer for my daughter, but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed.  I knew this wasn&#x27;t right.  I contacted Amazon about the defective product, return shipping was free and easy, and a replacement arrived in two days.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great price...retail is actual.  Works great, lots of options and attachments.  Love it and would recommend</li>
    <li> i love this hair dryer, decided to get a replacement hair dryer because my other one was dying and it took me forever to dry my hair.  this hair dryer is not only great quality but it actually dries my hair in half the time.  it looks good and very easy to use.  the motor in the dryer is not loud and annoying like some hair dryers. my only complaint is that i keep pressing the button while drying my hair. but i think once i get used to holding the dryer from the bottom, it will be fine.  if you want a good hair dryer for a great price, this is it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact it has many settings. I can blow dry my hair without frying it. My son loves it, because it looks like a &amp;#34;ray gun&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I originally used this hair dryer at my sister&#x27;s house and decided not to buy it because of the cost. Months later, I finally broke down and bought one and I&#x27;m glad I did. I haven&#x27;t used the attachments because I&#x27;m terrible at doing my own hair beyond the basics, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great for those that aren&#x27;t styling challenged like myself.</li>
    <li> It is a good one but I did not feel too much difference between it and the one I purchase from walmart with ion function (~$20.00). Since I purchased this one with a big discount ($27), so I guess I am ok. If the full price I think I won&#x27;t buy it. The buttons are not placed in the right position. One may easily mis-push it and change the speed or level.</li>
    <li> Eh. Plastic, won&#x27;t fold. No biggie on the controls, either. \\&quot;Works\\&quot; is good but finally, nobody in the house wants it since it is so light on space and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better. Everywhere.</li>
    <li> Best, most powerful hairdryer I have ever owned. I love it</li>
    <li> If aliens ever invade our planet, I suggest stocking up on this new hand held death ray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait, it&#x27;s a hair dryer? Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, against my better judgement I actually pointed this thing at my head and turned it on. I still have a head, so that&#x27;s good for 5 stars right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer is pricey, but it&#x27;s very well made. It&#x27;s nicely balanced and fairly light for its size and power, even with one of the 3 included attachments. If you have this much to blow (get it? blow?) on a hair dryer, you&#x27;ll be happy with this one. It looks nice, is easy to use, and even has a circuit breaker on the plug. Well made, well designed.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Still working great, but I wish there was a cord management piece to help with storing it.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer, but its a little too heavy. It dries very quickly and does not harm hair.</li>
    <li> Initially really liked this dryer, but after about 6 months it started to smell - kind of a burned odor - which made me leary of continuing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a short life for a fairly expensive blower.&lt;br /&gt;Going with a revlon as a replacement ... will see how that holds up - at least it was less expensive.</li>
    <li> It dried fast enough but still some frizzing, probably because I&#x27;m impatient. I love the fact that it came with a diffuser! This is one fancy hair dryer..  A little heavy but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I loved my Babyliss blow dryer, but it had a design flaw.  The housing, between the handle and nozzle, where the motor is, was very round.  When I set it down on the vanity, it would sometimes roll off and crash on the floor.  Eventually the housing started cracking, so I started looking for a new dryer because I didn&#x27;t want to shock myself or start a fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a long time shopping, comparing features and prices, before deciding to purchase the [[ASIN:B004YZMKKU John Frieda JF1 Full Volume Hair Dryer]].  My two highest priorities were wattage and price.  I don&#x27;t want to spend a long time fussing with my hair, so I wanted power.  And I didn&#x27;t want to spend $150 or $200 because I&#x27;m not convinced that those dryers are any better than mid-priced ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power:  It&#x27;s possible to find a less expensive dryer with 1875 watts, but the reviews tend to be negative and less expensive dryers offer fewer features.  This is mid-priced and has plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  Mid-level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments:  A concentrator with two openings, the one that attaches to the dryer, and one for outflow.  A concentrator with four openings; this has vents on its sides and is my attachment of choice.  I can direct flow to an area to dry and build volume, and begin styling, and a little bit of airflow is diverted.  This makes it easier for me to control styling, and speeds the drying process vs the other concentrator.  A diffuser.  My hair is straight, and I rarely use a diffuser, but I&#x27;ve tried this one.  My hair dries slower when I use it but WOW! does it build volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switches:  Low, medium, and high heat.  Off, low, and high speed.  Cold shot button.  High/high dries hair really fast.  High/low is fantastic for styling while getting done fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord:  Non-retractable with GFCI feature.  Where I live, building codes require appliances that draw heat to comply with GFCI.  I do not wind the cord around the dryer.  I have a space in my bathroom cabinet for storing the dryer, and just fold it a couple times.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with the cord tangling or twisting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dust vent:  The dust vent stays on, but can be opened easily.  There is an inner dust vent to further filter inflowing air.  Good protection for the dryer, but not an obstacle in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size/shape/weight/noise:  A natural feeling grip, conical (not round) housing, not travel weight but not an arm breaker, loud.  I expected loud with 1875 watts.  If it matters to you, this dryer is a good-looking appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for two months every day.  It performs flawlessly, and I&#x27;m very pleased to have found the features I want at a price point I find acceptable.  I&#x27;m giving this the HB stamp of approval ;)times.

    <li> Why is this hair dryer better than your average cheapie dryer? Well, most importantly, it&#x27;s 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly. I have shoulder length, straight, fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes. I was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first, but I have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer. What I like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities. One controls the high/low/off settings and the other controls the hot/warm/cold. It&#x27;s nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices. I usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings. (Some day I&#x27;ll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute, but until then, I need a dryer like this!) It also has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button so when you&#x27;re styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first, and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it. This works so well and so quickly, that it&#x27;s one of the first hair dryers that I can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple/blue racing stripe down the side. The cord is gray. I guess what my hair dryer looks like isn&#x27;t that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz? It comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow. The size of this dryer is pretty substantial, but it isn&#x27;t too heavy, it&#x27;s just a nice weight. I would say it&#x27;s about average as far as noise goes. I&#x27;ve actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one. All in all it&#x27;s an excellent dryer that does exactly what I want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full.</li>
    <li> Better than expected- really great value to price ratio. Did not find any of the issues regarding control buttons. Love the settings, cool setting a big + and a cold button for a burst of chilly air. 2 speeds, 3 setting plus cold button, fantastic air flow, does what it says for a fraction of the price of high end salon brands. Would gladly buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and I&#x27;ve been limping along all my life with cheap, drugstore hair dryers that that don&#x27;t do very much and don&#x27;t last very long.  And my hair is getting increasingly problematic as I get older.  So I jumped at the chance to own this salon-style dryer.  And what a difference!  It took a little while to learn to use the diffuser and the targeting nozzle but once I got untangled and learned to work with both hands, it all went very well.  It worked as advertised for me and it is a beautiful item to boot (even though it lives in the hall closet). So I give this a positive review - I just hope it lasts longer than the others.  I&#x27;ll be back to update this review if it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I liked it at first. But it does Tangle long hair, bought this and it didn&#x27;t even last for 2 years.  Burnt out.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer!  I would recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I got this dryer and immediately turned it over to my wife. She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn&#x27;t too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer. I can confirm this as well, it feels softer to me and I notice it is less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the brushed-nickel look of this dryer. Yeah, it&#x27;s a hair dryer and nothing to get too thrilled about but it sure looks cool! This is definitely a \\&quot;home\\&quot; dryer and not something I&#x27;d expect to see in a salon. It has a standard-length cord, hot/cool settings, the standard accessories (a diffuser and a narrow nozzle for more targeted styling), various levels of air flow (with the highest setting being pretty strong). As an added bonus, it has an \\&quot;advanced ionic generator with titanium ceramic coating\\&quot; which apparently provides \\&quot;superior conditioning and shine.\\&quot; Frankly, I&#x27;m not sure I buy into all that....I didn&#x27;t notice my hair looking more fantastic than usual but perhaps I wasn&#x27;t doing it right? Oh, and while this is advertised as being lightweight for home or travel, it&#x27;s actually heavier in the hand than most home dryers and probably not ideal to take on flights. I found the weight pleasant as it made the dryer feel more solid and well-constructed when compared to some of the cheaper models out there. But some folks might not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this is a decent hair dryer...works fast and seems durable, well made. Again, not sure I buy into all the marketing fluff but overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good hairdryer.  It is solidly constructed, has three (not two) temperatures.  The little door on the back for clearing the filter is hinged rather than detachable.  It is nicely balanced in the hand.  It comes with the usual attachments, which I don&#x27;t use so can&#x27;t judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried my short hair in about 15 seconds.  It dried my visiting sister&#x27;s long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.  This is partly attributable to the 1875 watt motor, but I&#x27;ve had another 1875-watt dryer that was less powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The virtues come with two possible vices - this thing is heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a retractable cord.  Only the first is a problem for me, as retractable cords add yet more weight and the storage area for them unbalances the dryer in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it is on the expensive side.  You can get a cheapo hairdryer for $15 or a good one for $30 - $35.  You&#x27;ll have to decide whether the quality and the features are worth the extra cost.  This one will last longer than your $15 jobbie, and it really does a better faster job.  It&#x27;s also fashionably pretty if you like the current vogue for shiny chromy things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mske your own judgement on cost/benefit, but I can testify that you won&#x27;t be wasting your money.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo20UFHT4C35874]]The John Frieda JF1 Full Volume Hair Dryer is one heck of a hair dryer. It is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine. While it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Heats up very quickly&lt;br /&gt; - Long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet&lt;br /&gt; - 3 speeds and three heat settings&lt;br /&gt; - The back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor&lt;br /&gt; - It is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star&lt;br /&gt; - Nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap&lt;br /&gt; - Three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators&lt;br /&gt; - 1875 watts (watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - This is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years. What some of the features are quite common this is still a hair dryer that should be seriously considered by anyone looking to make a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 Stars</li>
    <li> John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works has major flaws and I do not recommend it. The first and most major problem is that the on/off power levels are right where your hands go, so it is constantly changing power levels. The only way around that is to hold it awkwardly. It is also very heavy and loud. Finally, I use the diffuser attachment and it constantly falls off. Today a chink of the diffuser fell off and broke. Into the garbage. I a, going to buy a new blow dryer and this junk will be thrown out.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair fast and I have thick hair. It&#x27;s light weight. A great price! My hair feels amazing after.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that doesn&#x27;t like to be styled. Using this dryer, I have;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Volume&lt;br /&gt;Body&lt;br /&gt;Curl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, I don&#x27;t have to use any product to get it that way. I believe the key is not only the dryer, but, the shampoo you use. I use a Keratin infused shampoo with Ion ultra light weight conditioner. Bottom line- this blow dryer is incredible!</li>
    <li> The controls are a little weird, like people are saying, but they&#x27;ve never given me any trouble. Heat is good and it&#x27;s very powerful. I don&#x27;t use the tools much but I like that they&#x27;re there in case I ever learn lol</li>
    <li> The reviews I read said it worked well &amp; dries hair quickly. Not in my case. I have thick hair &amp; it takes a long time to dry it. The Hot setting doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this hair dryer, and I do except for one thing: the placement of the control buttons is terrible! I constantly turn off the dryer and switch the heat settings with my hand while I&#x27;m drying my hair. It is pretty annoying.  Besides that, the dryer is great. It helps to smooth my hair and dries it quickly. It also looks really nice. Overall, it is okay, but I don&#x27;t think I would have purchased it had I known about the problem with the control buttons.</li>
    <li> When shopping for a hair dryer, a light-weight dryer was what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is definitely not.  It&#x27;s heavy and bulky.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer based on a recommendation from Good Housekeeping and other Amazon reviews.  It&#x27;s powerful, dries and styles my very thick and long hair in a fraction of the time my old hair dryer did.  Only drawback - it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> This dryer is way too heavy. My arm feels like it is going to break off before I am done.  It also has caused so many tangles in the back that I have had to actually cut them out! I am so mad that I spent $53.00 on this. My store wouldn&#x27;t take it back because I had thrown away the box.</li>
    <li> I have never really bought anything online and this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written. That said, I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase. I didn&#x27;t know a hair dryer could *style* my hair. This product is much more powerful than my previous $15 drugstore purchase. That feature helps tame cowlicks! Overall, I have no complaints. I am very happy!!</li>
    <li> Excellent power with easy to use temperature change contol.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace my Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, which started smoking and sparking after less than a year of use. The John Frieda is much more powerful, and overall a great product. It is so strong that I can use the low setting on hot heat to get my long hair (mid-back length) dry in only a few minutes (5-10). The high setting is very, very powerful. It is relatively lightweight too. It has a nice look - the silver and purple together look sleek. The cord is very long. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair dryer finally died after - well, I&#x27;m not sure how old it was... maybe 25 years?  Read many of the reviews on this and decided to give it a try.  EXCELLENT hair dryer; it has a \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; button to set the curl which I forgot about.  The first time I used it I styled half my head and suddenly remembered this button - which is actually very easy to use, takes less than 10 secs - the first time I tried it the curl was definitely MUCH better then what I had just using the heat.  I had to go back and redo the first half and was so pleased.  The blow dry was excellent; it didn&#x27;t fall during the day; the bounce was still in my hair the next day (after sleeping on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had this good a blow dry with any of my older dryers, so the new construction really does make a difference.  Dried my hair in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4-stars is the design of the handle.  It&#x27;s much narrower than my old dryer, making it difficult to handle and difficult to get to the \\&quot;cooling\\&quot; button.  I&#x27;m hoping I get used to it over time because it kinda keeps slipping in my hand.</li>
    <li> Dries hair in half the time. Easy and lightweight to use. Speed and  heat selections  are obvious and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a hair dryer that was fast and easy. This one fits the bill. I have long hair and I was pleasantly surprised when my whole head was dry within 10 minutes. I also found that I do not need to straighten my hair afterwards because it smooths it out so well. The switches are a little annoying, but nothing you cannot move past. If you are like me and do not want to spend hundreds on a blow dryer, but still get a great one... this is it!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for an affordable hair dryer. I saved an article in a magazine that recommended this one. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer. It has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly. The price was just right.</li>
    <li> The placement of the switches on this blow dryer is a major FAIL.  Why they would put them right where your hand is supposed to go to hold the dryer properly is beyond my comprehension.  The dryer shuts off at least once during my drying session.  Certainly doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a complaint, but it&#x27;s truly annoying.  Had I kept the box, I absolutely would have returned this item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a CHI before but this cuts my dry time in half. Button location is initially annoying but I got used to it fast.</li>
    <li> The John Frieda JF1 is a powerful, well-made hair dryer. Although the casing seems primarily plastic, it is a heavy-duty molded plastic that feels very solid (and thus keeps the unit&#x27;s weight down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a relatively inexpensive dryer for a while now (a $19 drugstore unit). The JF1 is definitely more powerful, is more ergonomic and has better features. My hair-drying time has been cut by 50 percent, maybe more. It actually took me a couple of uses to figure out how to deal with the extra air volume and heat as compared to my cheaper unit. The \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button works well and is easily found while using the unit as it sits just where your index finger rests. And the back-end filter is easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer also goes from heat setting to heat setting very quickly. Push the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button while on hot and the unit almost immediately serves cool air. No waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are small ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button actually provides cool air, hence the name; however, the air from the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting on the unit actually isn&#x27;t as cool as the air using the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button. I would&#x27;ve liked to have had the cool setting -- where you don&#x27;t have to keep holding a button while using -- provide the same temperature air as that provided by the button. That being said, the cool setting and the \\&quot;cool button\\&quot; are not that different regarding temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The unit comes with three attachments -- two concentrators and one diffuser. The two concentrators look very similar in shape and even after a few usages I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between the two is as the instructions don&#x27;t say. Also, it took me a minute to figure out how to get the attachments on and off the unit; initially, I was afraid of snapping one of them into place in such a way as it would get stuck; turns out, the attachments just snap on the front end and pull off, but I was initially looking for some sort of release clamp and there isn&#x27;t one. (Again, this isn&#x27;t mentioned in the instructions.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The JF1 comes with a four-year warranty, which isn&#x27;t bad as a lot of dryers have similar warranty windows. I&#x27;d feel a bit better if the warranty lasted six years or more as that&#x27;s how long I think a dryer like this should last, especially if you&#x27;re using it just once a day as most people do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, a good product. I&#x27;m not really convinced the whole \\&quot;ion\\&quot; thing -- which the manufacturer says results in \\&quot;smooth, frizz-free hair\\&quot; -- is real (the science is iffy to say the least), but even if it isn&#x27;t, the unit is powerful, lightweight and attractively designed. If you spend a lot of time in the morning getting your hair ready, day after day, then over time the extra money for this dryer is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have thick or curly hair, special styling needs (e.g., your particular hair style requires a bit of work to maintain) or if you only occasionally use a hair dryer, this unit is probably overkill. You could get something for half the money that would probably serve your purposes. But if you need something between a $20 budget dryer and a professional model, the JF1 will fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve only had this dryer for a couple of weeks. If the unit breaks down or malfunctions at some point, I&#x27;ll come back and update this review.mentioned in the instructions.)    3) The JF1 comes with a four-year warranty, which isn&#x27;t bad as a lot of dryers have similar warranty windows.

    <li> This is one fancy looking hairdryer. I&#x27;ve now used it a half dozen times on my own hair which is baby fine and about 4 inches past my shoulders.  I have quite a lot of hair but like I said, baby fine.  I did not think this hairdryer was louder than my former $19.99 model, but it did wake up my husband and he did complain.  Sound is not everything, but I had to mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this dryer and the heft of it is sturdy and quite stylish.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s heavier than my other hairdryer and my arms prefer a lightweight model.  But...the real deal on this dryer is the speed at which it dries my hair.  Must faster.  I timed this too.  My old cheap hairdryer takes 14 minutes.  This one, 10.  Are those 4 gained minutes going to change my life?  Not every day, but on those day&#x27;s when you&#x27;re late for work, YES YES YES!  But on my baby fine hair, it tangles it into a knots nest if I do not blow dry with the use of a brush and the 4 minutes that I&#x27;m saved are now spent detangling it with a comb or monkeying with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to reach buttons,&lt;br /&gt;cool button to blow cool hair&lt;br /&gt;Longer than average cord&lt;br /&gt;Comes with cord keeper twisty type holder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so nice features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavier than average hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;No retractable cord&lt;br /&gt;Tangles my baby fine hair into a knotty mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweaks that would make it perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Cord keeper&lt;br /&gt;More grip/rubber on handle to prevent wet hands slipping&lt;br /&gt;Quieter motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this hair dryer should have done what it claimed to do.  If by volumne they meant \\&quot;knots nest\\&quot; then it does.</li>
    <li> I got this dryer for my wife as she has fine, relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage (in the past I heard many complaints). Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn&#x27;t had that problem with this dyer, and to me that&#x27;s saying A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It&#x27;s well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it&#x27;s designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here&#x27;s my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The only really &#x60;con&#x27; with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it&#x27;s not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won&#x27;t cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It&#x27;s an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!and effective dryer, that won&#x27;t cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It&#x27;s an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!</li>
    <li> Just a really nice hair dryer for the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for the price. Yes, it is louder than some of the more expensive ones, but it performs as expected and comes with the attachments I wanted. I read other reviews about the placement of the buttons, so I was not surprised by that. I only find it to be an issue when my hands are slippery from product and my fingers tend to slip over the buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ulta had this model for $50, and I was debating between it and a $200 T3 model. Once I saw this one on Amazon for only $25, I decided to go for it. So glad I did!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer for a couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It has a super long cord which is awesome&lt;br /&gt;2.  It had not only high and low but you can adjust the heat level as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some things I don&#x27;t like as well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is a little heavy but nothing that would sway me from buying again&lt;br /&gt;2.  The buttons are in a bad spot and I occasionally bump them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for a year and a half.  I love the settings and how quickly it dries my hair.  It didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped, however.  It just started popping and shooting fire out of the end.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is much better than any I have owned.  Dries my hair very quickly.  The only draw back is that it is not a cord keeper dryer.</li>
    <li> I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It&#x27;s made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer! It really does seem like I have more volume, I got mine on sale otherwise I don&#x27;t if the price is great if you&#x27;re tight on money but I would buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is my first non-$12 drugstore hairdryer and I think I&#x27;m satisfied.  The difference isn&#x27;t as miraculous as I was hoping it would be but it&#x27;s still a very good hairdryer.  When I used it with no attachments it blew my hair into oblivion but dried my very thick hair in record time.  Not a hairdo I could leave the house with though.  But when I used the curly hair attachment (the one with the prongs) it worked perfectly (albeit taking longer to dry).  My only complaint is that the buttons are placed right where my hand holds the dryer which means that until I got used to adjusting my grip, I would constantly be turning it off or changing the settings inadvertently.  I don&#x27;t really like the way that I have to gingerly hold the thing to avoid this.  Overall, if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade to a grown-up hair dryer, this one is a good one.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer!  I have long, fine hair that tangles easily so I use the low setting.  The high heat really isnt that hot but seems to dry my hair quickly.  The size and weight feels good in my hand.  I love the cold shot!  this is the first dryer that I have owned where cold shot means cold and not just air temp.  It sets my steam rollers in a second which again saves me time!</li>
    <li> This is the fastest drying hair dryer I ever owned. I love it!  my friend had one and I was amazed. Had to have it!</li>
    <li> I rarely use a hair dryer to dry my hair but lately, I am tired of waiting for it to air dry.  When that happens, I use my handy dandy John Frieda Full Volume Hairy Dryer.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this product, I quickly accepted.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I actually received this product almost 2 years ago.  I use it when I want my hair dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer features frizz-fighting technology, 3 heat and two speed settings. I can add volume and shine to my hair with just a few minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair takes just a few minutes to dry. The hair dryer is very lightweight in my hands, so it doesn’t take a lot to blow dry my hair.  I use the cool setting most of the time since I don&#x27;t like to use heat on my hair.  The cool setting comes in handy in the summer time.  Who wants to blow hot air on their hair in the dead of summer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda Full Volume Dryer comes with 3 attachments, but I choose to use the dryer without any attachments. I just want to dry my hair, so I don’t bother with the attachments.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it usually only takes a few mins to dry... this hairdryer took twice as long on the high setting than my other (cheap) hair dryer did. If you&#x27;re right handed, the buttons are where your thumb lays and it constantly kept switching off. It&#x27;s also VERY heavy. I&#x27;m surprised that more people aren&#x27;t annoyed with this dryer. For the price, you could get one that is far less frustrating! It&#x27;s certainly a very pretty dryer, and my hair looked nice afterwards, but constantly re-positioning my fingers so that it wouldn&#x27;t switch off was just too annoying.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this hairdryer, my hair looked much better the first use. I have many dead and frizzy ends, but switching to a new dryer really helped. I feel that this dryer specifically helped because of 1) the attachment nozzle that is flat, 2) multiple settings (cool and hot) and 3) fast heating and cooling when changing heat settings. The dryer has an almost professional level of speed but I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is fried or damaged and it looks healthier at the same time. I would certainly recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this blowdryer about three months ago and still love it every time I dry my hair and my daughters hair. I previously owned a very cheap blowdryer that was very old until it broke. My daughter and I had long hair until we recently got it cut, but it would dry our hair unbelievably fast. I removed one star because yes it is heavy and the buttons are placed in a terrible spot. However, the quality of the drying power is amazing. By the way this is my first review ever written because I wanted recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Worked fine when I first receive it. Last night, after normal home usage, it burned out and is only fit for the garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple weeks but, so far, it&#x27;s living up to expectations.  Very strong on high - dries my long hair quickly and is quieter than my old one.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because I liked that it came with the attachments and that it was reasonably priced. What I found was in addition to the attachments, this hair dryer is very powerful! I recently had to use my old dryer and kept looking at it to make sure I had it on high, then was looking to see if there was dust blocking the way! What a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this dryer. My only complaint would be the buttons on the handle are not in a great place. I had to get used to holding the dryer and not turning it off by accident. I still give it five stars though!</li>
    <li> June 2015: still blows.  Getting ready to purchase 4th one for my daughter who is leaving for college. Previously purchased, similar dryers by JFrieda still function very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase Date: 2012.  What else is there to say.  It dries hair well and in a very short time.  Purchased two more for the teenagers in the home since I got tired of hunting for mine every morning.  I purchased my first one from Walmart 2 yrs ago, on sale, and it&#x27;s still blowing along.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my girlfriend because I read it wasn&#x27;t as loud as the other hairdryers. Quite true. She&#x27;s very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This dryer had to be designed by a man or someone who never uses a hair dryer! It is extremely heavy, and the switches are right in the middle of the handle. There is no way to hold the dryer without pressing the heat and air buttons. Consequently, I have to stop and turn the switches back on several times during my hair drying task. This is a serious flaw for a pricey dryer, one I will definitely return!</li>
    <li> I have long hair that takes forever to dry naturally. My old hairdryer finally died after maybe 10 years of heavy use! My sister had this one while I was visiting her &amp; I was amazed. The strength of the airflow is awesome and the temperature controls go from a good, healthy heat to a super cool (almost air conditioning for hair.) Great time saver - comes with nice add ons, as well, for different styling effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for probably a little longer than a year and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers (think hurricane vs gentle breeze). Of course, you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast, this dryer will not disappoint. It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord. The only downside is that I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are because the way I hold it to dry my hair, many times, I accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to. I would buy this a thousand times over.</li>
    <li> The dryer has a major design flaw.  The control switches are where your hand goes so while drying my hair, I kept on having to constantly adjust the speed or temp setting.  It&#x27;s very annoying.  I do like the fact they have a cool setting so I can use it to blow dry my puppies after they get a bath but I am thinking seriously about returning it because of the switch problem.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t bought a hair dryer in over 10 years.  Borrowed by daughter-in-law&#x27;s Frieda when we were visiting.  I knew I had to have this model so immediately went to Amazon to order before we returned home.  It will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> ...worth five stars just for that. Quiet, powerful with several settings and a comfortable ergonomic handle. Convenient hook keeps the blow dryer out of our way next to the vanity when not in use.</li>
    <li> I actually bought 3 of these because I have 5 girls and you can never have enough blow dryers, theses get used constantly and really hold up!</li>
    <li> John Frieda products are always good. I use the shampoo, what is good. Not more to say, just another hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but I thought I&#x27;d do it for this product. I have fine, curly hair but LOTS of it. It was taking me a good 25 minutes to blow dry my hair every other day and I was getting tired of it. I felt like I&#x27;d tried about every hair dryer (affordable) in the store. I decided I&#x27;d try an expensive salon one to see if that&#x27;d do the trick. So I splurged and bought the Buttercup Dry Bar hair dryer. It worked well but only cut my drying time down about 5 minutes and in all honesty, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the $200. I came across the John Frieda hair dryer and read some good reviews so decided I&#x27;d give it a shot, plus it was much more affordable than the Dry Bar. Well, I loved it! It only took me 11 minutes to blow dry this mane of mine plus it gave it extra shine and my ends don&#x27;t look so dry. It also straightened out my hair better than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve had which cut down my flat iron time, as well. The only cons are that the buttons are placed in an odd location and it has a weird hum but you get used to that real quick, so it didn&#x27;t really bother me all that much. But I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy, curly and long hair. Nothing can tame my hair, and I needed to purchase a new blow dryer and after reading the reviews about this one, I ordered it. And it works well, it didn&#x27;t seem to heat up at first, but it does get very hot.&lt;br /&gt;And it does it gets my hair straight in a shorter amount of time than my older hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and it takes forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;Now with this hair dryer, it takes me no time to have my hair looking great!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this is an excellent hair dryer. While I am not a huge fan of John Frieda&#x27;s line, I really love this tool. It has a very sleek, modern design, which isn&#x27;t necessarily as important as the performance, but it&#x27;s always nice when products like this have their own, personalized look and feel and its manufacturers are attentive to design. What&#x27;s even better than the design is the performance. WOW! This thing packs a punch for the price. It&#x27;s very powerful. With typical hair dryers, it takes anywhere from 15-20 minutes to achieve a complete dry. The John Frieda takes about 5 minutes to completely dry my medium-length, thick hair. It also leaves my hair shiny and virtually frizz-free.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer - buttons def take some time to get used to but overall I love it.</li>
    <li> Was in need of a new hairdryer for my thick long hair. This is a perfect product with quick drying results. It&#x27;s a big noisy.</li>
    <li> I love this device!  The power is amazing.  My hair is dry in minutes.  It feels really nice in your hands too.</li>
    <li> Great power! Shortened my drying time quite a bit.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever!  I have very fine, naturally wavy/curly hair, and this one gives it lots of volume. Doesn&#x27;t flatten it out like a lot do. I don&#x27;t even use a brush to style my hair, just my fingers and it&#x27;s perfect every time. This is my second one, the first one burned out after about a year and a half. Most burn out on me in 6 months, since I blow dry my hair almost every single day. It&#x27;s hard to get used to at first, since it blows way more air than any hair dryer I&#x27;ve previously owned. But once I got used to it, I knew this was the perfect one for me.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> AAMMAAZZIINNGG!!&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda---nothing else needs to be said. His products are all 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟, including this product!!</li>
    <li> This is the noisiest hairdryer I have ever used. Apart from waking anyone who might have been sleeping, it was headache inducing. It operates well and looks good but the noise factor was unbearable. I am not a whinger and am pretty easy to please but this was not worth keeping and was returned.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these each of my daughters wanted one.  My daughters and their mother say they get great results everytime.</li>
    <li> You plug it in and it blows warm, almost hot, air.  Both buttons are perfectly placed to maximize accidentally turning off the dryer in the middle of a blowout.  The cord becomes so twisted and tangled that you won&#x27;t be able to get a foot from the outlet (hey, you&#x27;ll never have to worry about dropping it in the tub!).</li>
    <li> I originally like this hair dryer very much. But after only 8 months it got a burnt odor -- still works but I&#x27;m afraid to use it now. Very disappointed for a &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; dryer.</li>
    <li> this dryer is ok, i have naturally curly hair and it doesnt get hot enough for me. the moter is strong and it blows very good. YET doesnt make my hair frizz, which is good. i dont find it louder than anyother dryer. not very heavy but the button placements on the handle make it a little akward to hold. overall, not bad.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this hair dryer.  One of the best investments I have made in my lifetime.  Could not beat the price either.  It was a win win all around.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I purchased this hair dryer. It is quieter than other hair dryers that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dryer.  Dries my hair faster than other dryers I have used. I have the matching flat iron too. Great products.</li>
    <li> Works great! So much more power and heat than my old blow dryer.  Not heavy at all, average weight probably.  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Sadly you can only test a few of the myriad hair dryers on the market.  You try to gain insight from reviews, but it&#x27;s only through use that you really get to know how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal was speed.  This implies high temperature and high velocity.  Think of those hand dryers you find in bathrooms.  Some are the older, lower-velocity type, but the modern versions are high velocity and dry your hands very quickly.  I found this John Frieda hair dryer to be analogous to the bathroom hair dryers, though I&#x27;m not saying the velocity is anything like the high-velocity hand dryers.  What I&#x27;m saying is once you use this hair dryer against the standard run-of-the-mill hair dryers, you might feel the same as I do that this hair dryer is a cut above.  I think the temperature is about on par with others, but it&#x27;s the velocity that makes the difference for me.  If I could find a hair dryer with even higher velocity, I would get in line for that one.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found for velocity so far, and it does save me time, which is the main benefit I sought.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing blow dryer. Seriously, I have spent money on models that cost tons more and this has to be the best blow dryer I have ever used. I have extremely thick, coarse hair. They could use it to reinforce the Eiffel Tower&#x27;s structure. Having hair like this usually means a lot of time and a lot of background music spent in front of the mirror. But with the JF1, I had great results and a true cut down in the time I spent on my hair. And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn&#x27;t feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the JF1. It is light weight, not as gigantic as it may seem , a great price point, and does a wonderful job. What more can you ask for?!</li>
    <li> My first impression of this hair dryer is its heft. It is not overwhelming, of course, but feels significantly more substantial than the usual plastic-laden blowers. It looks substantial too, with no cheap-looking material anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the normal functions are there. The top button controls hot/warm/cold, while the second button has the high/low/off settings. The electric plug is shock-proof. And a quick cold button is placed directly under the index finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once turned on, the motor immediately makes a statement of its superior quality with its calm low-frequency whirl and the strong yet steady airflow. In the long run, this should be what reminds the owner that he/she has gotten his/her money&#x27;s worth. The air filter in the back of the unit is sturdy and easy to clean. At 1875W, the heat should be able to satisfy anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the quality and design seem more than enough to justify the price. The only remaining question is longevity. But time will tell.</li>
    <li> This hair blow dryer is superior to the one I now own.  I particularly like the titanium ceramic coated grill and the two concentrators.  It has plenty of power, 1875 watts, and is lightweight.  I also find it advantageous to have 3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I was not familiar with this brand, but am impressed.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this Hair dryer 5 stars is because I love a retractable cord. Its a pain to have the cord always in the way - otherwise I love it especially  for this price. My hair dryes very fast and looks very healthy.</li>
    <li> Blows hot air around&lt;br /&gt;But now we really want it&lt;br /&gt;Hope it doesn&#x27;t melt</li>
    <li> Never had a blow dryer tangle my hair and make it limp. It does get your hair dry slowly.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for the price!  I have a lot of hair and it works well!</li>
    <li> pretty good, except for my hair tangles a lot more with this, not sure about this phenomenon... otherwise, pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> John Freida hair dryer looks and feels professional right out of the box as it looks amazing with the titanium finish.  Multiple speed and heat settings can handle all of your hair-drying needs.  Also includes a diffuser detachment for extra style.  The only negative is that it could be very noisy at times as if you are near an airport full of jets, but that can be totally tolerable from a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but kind a heavy when u need to blow dry you hair your hand will hurt</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. I was tired of using the crappy cheap one my mom bought for me and my sisters. This thing i hav seen all over youtube and can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> This was an impulse purchase for me due to both my everyday blow dryer and back-up blow dryer dying on me all at once. Initially I just bought the John Frieda JFHA5 Hot Air Brush, 1.5 inch, and while it definitely tamed my ends it left my my scalp a bit damp, not a good look nor is it  good in cold weather. So i decided to purchase an inexpensive small dryer to do my roots and after a 3 month long consideration  I choose this one. IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I have fine hair but lots of it and what would have taken me 25-30 minutes with my old dryer took me five minutes. Becuase this puppy is powerful and with a four year warranty it&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. I have coarse, thick hair that retains water really well. This dryer has enough umph to do the job.</li>
    <li> My wife just purchased this dryer, and loves it. Dries quickly, but doesn&#x27;t fry her hair. Dryer is not too loud. Only downside is the controls are right where you hold the dryer, but it&#x27;s easy to adapt to.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but the toggle switches for speed and heat are located where you grip the handle, as you can see from the picture, and I&#x27;m constantly turning the heat back up because I&#x27;ve hit the switch while drying my hair.  Lots of cool attachments I haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer itself is OK, not great (doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot), but OK.  However, my biggest issue is the location of the buttons. Every.Single.Time. I blowdry my hair, my hand either automatically switches the settings to cold or a low setting.. they are located exactly where I&#x27;m holding the dryer! I can&#x27;t stand it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It really does leave my hair shiny and softer than my old one.</li>
    <li> I love it. I bought one for my daughter also.</li>
    <li> Whenever a hairdryer bites the dust, it&#x27;s an arduous process to find a new one I can trust. I dry my hair every day and really need something good. I took a chance on this John Frieda hair dryer based on positive reviews and how professional it looked. And it lived up to all of the above! This is a great hair dryer. The heat settings and control are just what I need and it has a powerful air flow to dry hair fast. It&#x27;s as loud as any hair dryer and not bad, in my opinion. Per what some other reviewers have said, they are right and it is a bit heavy, but nothing out of control. And even though it doesn&#x27;t really matter for a hair dryer, I think it looks super cool and streamlined. Highly recommend for heavy hair dryer users!</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on a write up in Prevention Magazine.  Yes, a great dryer with lots of shine BUT the locations of the control button stink!  I spend more time reselecting the temperature/speed/on &amp; off, as no matter how you hold this dryer, you are pressing a switch.  I would recommend this to NO ONE!  It&#x27;s just poorly designed!</li>
    <li> The John Frieda JF1 hair dryer is a lightweight hair dryer with a sleek design and ceramic heat technology.  Unfortunately, the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer, then pull hair out.  While it does dry pretty quickly, there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look.  It&#x27;s also pretty loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons could use re-working as well, and would be better as switches, rather than buttons.  The temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally.  On the plus side, the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length (~8 feet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the John Frieda JF1 isn&#x27;t an overly impressive hair dryer and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> very pleased with this product,  my hair is less frizzy and easy to style</li>
    <li> Works great! A fantastic blow dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> Well all the reviews were right, great blower but a tad bit heavy but I&#x27;ve decided WORTH IT by far for the incredible price through Amazon.  Very pleased...</li>
    <li> A great value for the price.  I have been using this now for a few months and have no complaints.  I confess that I bought it mainly to color coordinate with a matching John Frieda Curling Iron to go into a new StyleAway Curling Iron/Blow Dryer Holder, all bought on amazon for my bathroom when I remodeled!  It looks as good as it works. The blow dryer is very stylish looking and the finish is holding up very well, it has a nice finish that doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  It has all the heat setting that I need, with a cool shot button that I do use with round brushing to set the curl. The blow dryer seems much more powerful than my previous dryer as my hair seems to dry much faster than with my old dryer.  I have read some reviews complaining about the weight, however I don&#x27;t find that to be a problem. Really, how much effort does it take to hold a blow dryer for a few minutes, even if it does weigh 1/2 # more?  The sleek design is well worth any extra effort.  Very happy with all my purchases!  My bathroom looks great - neat and tidy with all my products color coordinated and organized together in the StyleAway, it all hangs conveniently from a towel bar next to my vanity.  You will be happy with this blow dryer, especially if you get the matching curling iron.</li>
    <li> My $150 hair dryer bit the dust. I was not going to spend that kind of money again. I researched and found this item on Amazon. I have had my initial unit for over a year. I am still enjoying it and it works great; just like out of the box. So when I needed a 2nd hairdryer for another home, I purchased the same item. The product has to be of high quality and have a value pricing before I will purchase it for a 2nd time. This is a winner.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see the description &amp;#34;locking cool shot button&amp;#34;  but it does not lock.  You have to manually hold it down.  That gets tiring.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Heavy, big and burned out within 10 months of light use.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a great hair dryer because it was a bit more pricey than some of the others out there. It does dry my hair well, isn&#x27;t horribly heavy, and isn&#x27;t horribly loud, however there is one big issue with it for me. The controls are placed right on the handle and I am constantly hitting them accidentally. For me, there is no more comfortable way to hold the dryer, so they are in the way. It has a very poor design.  I would not buy this dryer again.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this dryer a few weeks ago and I am absolutely in LOVE with it. I have super thick, curly, blonde hair and I can never seem to dry my hair without getting tons of frizz and random curls that lay flat while others are super tight spirals. This dryer seems to fix all of these problems for me. I had a fairly nice dryer for about two years and it finally died so I started scouring Amazon, Target, Ulta, etc. looking for a decent hair dryer at a fair price. This hair dryer had so many great reviews that I knew that I had to try it and I&#x27;m really happy that I did. If you don&#x27;t know how to use any of the attachments like the included diffuser just Google &amp;#34;How to use a diffuser&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll get instructions and videos and all sorts of super helpful information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Solid/quality feel&lt;br /&gt;Less frizz&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels softer&lt;br /&gt;Long cord&lt;br /&gt;Multiple tools&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; blast button&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Volume is more even&lt;br /&gt;Cuts my drying time in half- It usually takes me about 30 minutes to dry my long (it&#x27;s a little more than halfway down my back) hair. I can turn this baby on and it maybe takes 10 minutes to dry with the diffuser on low with medium heat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Button Placement- Personally I&#x27;ve had no problems accidentally hitting any buttons like many reviews have stated, but I&#x27;m listing it as a con just so people can be more aware.&lt;br /&gt;Sound- I may just not be used to it but to be honest the sound reminds me of my Kitchen Aid hand-mixer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: You have to try this dryer. I honestly can find nothing truly negative about it. My hair loves it and I love it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (2015): I&#x27;ve had this dryer for over two years now! And it&#x27;s still going strong. I literally use it every day and take it with me when I travel. When/if this thing does die I will definitely be ordering another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (05/29/2016): Still works great! The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that the little plastic hinge/vent thing on the back where you remove the lint filter (or whatever it is lol) broke off. Not a huge deal but I have to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the dryer sometimes.uge deal but I have to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked into the dryer sometimes.</li>
    <li> Is there anywhere i can buy a comb attatchment for this blow dryer? I feel like it would be 10 times better with one.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is not too large or too long--the picture makes it look larger than it actually is. It is light-weight. The handle provides a perfect grip. The motor cools down very quickly and the casing does not retain heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons are all you could possibly ask for--and they are very conveniently located right on the handle where your fingers wrap around it. You don&#x27;t have to shift your grip or stop what you are doing to change a heat setting or \\&quot;blow\\&quot; setting. Don&#x27;t think that your fingers could accidently trip a botton: They are raised buttons and have a definite angle and curve and your fingers have to purposefully push them one way or the other to make changes. The \\&quot;cold\\&quot; buttom works very quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a loop for hanging, a safety plug and a long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; attachments, PLUS a pretty nifty one that is suited for nice, long, fine hair. It will be able to help lift a large section of hair and shoot many channels of air into the section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, it is a beautiful thing to look at. The box it comes in is classy, too! I got goose bumps when I first took it out of the box--no kidding!</li>
    <li> WOW!!!  My daughter has used this dryer several times on her long, slightly wavy, medium to thick, blonde, highlighted hair which can get slightly frizzy under certain conditions. Her hair has turned out shiny &amp; sparkly each time with no  static electricity or frizz.  She&#x27;s been using the low/warm setting. I have shiny, baby fine, straight  hair...it&#x27;s difficult for me to get volume using any  dryer.  This dryer is no  exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer has more settings than any we&#x27;ve used in the past. It isn&#x27;t overly heavy, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it lightweight.  It comes with two different styles of concentrators &amp; a diffuser.  Even when using the warm setting, her hair  dries quicker with this hair dryer and has more volume than it&#x27;s had lately. One dryer she was using was made so that her hair would get stuck in it which would pull the hair strands; this one doesn&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to list the attributes of this drier but noticed that they&#x27;re listed in the Manufacturer&#x27;s Product Description so take a look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my family, the claims for shinier hair with more volume are true.&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edited to add: I forgot to mention that the buttons are easy to use/find, but they do get in the way a little when you&#x27;re using the dryer.  Also be sure to keep the filter clean. Any dryer will overheat &amp; the motor could burn out if the filter isn&#x27;t kept clean. The filter is on the back. This drier actually has two screened filters which provide even more protection than any other dryer we&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so frustrated with this dryer!  I liked at first but within 3 months the attachments won&#x27;t stay in place, they swivel when I&#x27;m drying my hair and the back filter piece falls off daily. Not sure if I just got a defect but I&#x27;m super bummed based on all the good reviews this had.</li>
    <li> Needed a new blow dryer and thought this would be the one. Little did I know that I would turn it off and on and change the heat settings while simply holding it. Ended up returning it because I couldn&#x27;t get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blow dries your hair really fast, but that&#x27;s only when it&#x27;s on the correct setting, which I kept changing with a slight tough of my hand. If anything, they should make the buttons a little harder to switch... or just move them completely.</li>
    <li> Very heavy and bulky.  Hair Dryer is loud.</li>
    <li> I have been using drugstore brand (revlon, clairol, etc) hair dryers for years.  Recently, I found that no matter what brand I bought, the heat would go from hot to cold and the dryer took forever to dry my hair.  I decided to upgrade to a higher end dryer and am so thankful I did.  This dryer cuts the drying time in half and my hair is not frizzy.  I just went away for the weekend and every single one of my girlfriends asked to borrow my hair dryer and are now buying one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is a bit heavier than the drugstore brands but it&#x27;s also twice as powerful.  The buttons do take a minute to get used to, but after a day they shouldn&#x27;t be an issue anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (and my girlfriends) would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  I won&#x27;t ever go back to the &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34; again.</li>
    <li> Have you ever dried your hair with a cheap-o hair dryer and it caused your hair to be frizzy and weird? I could tell a difference in my hair the first time I used my John Frieda Full Volume Hair dryer. My hair is much smoother and shinier. I can&#x27;t explain the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; behind this. But my hair is as silky now as it was decades ago during my youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; reduction in the time needed to dry my hair. And the unit is a little heavier than a cheap-o dryer. But I think that&#x27;s due to a more powerful motor. The air flow is more powerful than any hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year and a half with no problems. The multiple levels of heat and fan are really great when drying. The only thing I dislike about it is that the buttons are in an odd spot on the side so when I&#x27;m drying my hair, my hand tends to switch the button to off. But I would still recommend getting it!</li>
    <li> I have normal to fine long hair, and while this dryer has dramatically shortened my drying time, my biggest issue is that it turns my dried hair into a tangly mess. A hairbrush literally rips my hair out after drying. I haven&#x27;t had this issue with a dryer before, and an at-home coconut oil treatment has helped the situation somewhat, so I&#x27;ve decided to keep the dryer until my next haircut to see if that alleviates the tangles. If not, I will probably buy a new dryer.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is pleased with this hairdryer, although there are some things that she would change. The drying time is quite good, and it gets hot without being too hot to handle, and it feels well built. On the other hand, it is a bit heavy and loud, and it is occasionally frustrating when buttons accidentally get pressed while handling it normally. Overall, we are happy with the hair dryer, but we might look at alternatives before buying again. It has held up well after about a year, though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blow dryer. I have long thick hair and with my old blow dryer it would take almost an hour. But no more b/c now that i have this high powered blow dryer it has cut my drying time by 75%... The cost is so resoneably and i will be buying one more so my daughter can experience this awesome time saving item. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! Love the attachments it came with.</li>
    <li> I am 58 years old and have mid-length, medium texture, slightly wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;For the past 15 years I have been using the same Conair hairdryer (it just will not die) an average of 2-3x a week and over that time have had my share of good hair days and bad.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has been getting very dry - even in the summer which is very unusual.&lt;br /&gt;So, after trying various shampoos with not much difference, I decided to Google &#x27;dry hair&#x27; and low and behold, hair dryers popped up! I don&#x27;t think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many &#x27;Top Ten Hair Dryer&#x27; lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what &#x27;technologies&#x27; exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho&#x27; people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn&#x27;t happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn&#x27;t &#x27;lock&#x27; but I don&#x27;t care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn&#x27;t even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can&#x27;t believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

    <li> Best hair dryer ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. It is quiet and has a powerful fan blower.  It has 3 settings each for heat and blower speed.&lt;br /&gt;There is also an instant cool button to cool down the air no matter what heat setting it is on.  It has a long cord which&lt;br /&gt;is nice.  It is a litlle larger in size than some and somewhat heavier. However, the heat and blower features and quietness&lt;br /&gt;more than offset this.</li>
    <li> Within nine months of purchase this hair dryer stopped working - overheats within minutes.  I don&#x27;t even dry my hair but a few times a month so this is not the best purchase.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair all that fast &amp; it is incredibly heavy. I work out 5-6 days a week &amp; when my muscles are sore this hair dryer really tires me out. I know I sound like a whiny baby but I really don&#x27;t like how heavy it is when I&#x27;m sore &amp; tired.</li>
    <li> Bought this the other day and was blown away by the power.  The attachments fit nice and snug and it dries in less time than my $20 one I had.  I definitely recommend this hair dryer.  My hair never got frizzy like it does with some other dryers.  The hair dryer that I just replaced with this one, the  attachments used to fall off all the time and it was frustrating.  I also used to hit the buttons during drying and shut it off accidentally.  Not with this one.  The buttons stay in their position easily, and the attachments stay on and fit really nice.  I think this dryer is going to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets in the house!&lt;br /&gt;Item RETURNED and refund awaiting! Do not trust it!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair dryer - In fact, the best one I&#x27;ve ever used to give my hair volume.  I&#x27;m middle aged with fine and thinning hair.  A couple friends commented that they thought my hair was getting thicker once I started using the dryer (I wish it were!).  However, those comments are directly related to how well this dryer works.  I&#x27;ve been using the 2&amp;#34; wide attachment so that it really dries the roots, which adds volume and lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would have had a 5 star rating, but as others have said, the buttons are in an awkward place.  I&#x27;m constantly accidently turning the dryer off or the temp to another setting.  And, yes, it isa bit heavier than the standard dryers, but not much.  It feels sturdy and like it will hold up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this dryer!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever.</li>
    <li> For someone with thick hair, I&#x27;m sure this mega air blasting machine would be wonderful, but it&#x27;s just waaaay too much power for my fine hair.  It leaves me with a rat&#x27;s nest of tangles, even on the low setting.</li>
    <li> It makes a lot of noise, but it dries my whole hair in less than 5 min.</li>
    <li> My Family has owned countless hair dryers over the years and the \\&quot;John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer\\&quot; is the best by far.  This dryer drys faster and leaves the hair manageable.  I bought one because of a \\&quot;Consumer Report\\&quot; rating and after trying it for a day , maybe two, I purchased another as a future replacement just in case this one wears out someday.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer really has made a difference in my hair.  I have been trying to grow my hair out for years, so I&#x27;m trying to change how I take care of my hair.  I use this dryer on High with a cool temperature.  ( My hair is dirty blond with a natural wave/light curl, and tends to frizz if I let it air try.)  I can honestly say that this dryer leaves my hair silkier and shinier than using my old dryer (which I thought I loved).  I no longer feel obligated to flat iron my hair in order for it to look presentable.  I would definitely recommend this product for women trying to improve the health of their hair, and who are trying to step away from the flat iron!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sleek, does a good job of styling &amp; drying hair, &amp; the controls are easy to use. I just wish it could be a little lighter, but that&#x27;s probably necessary to supply the power</li>
    <li> Gives great volume with exceptional heat control!  Would recommend to anyone looking to enhance body and volume with their hair.</li>
    <li> My hair used to take almost 20 minutes to dry. However, the first time I used this dryer it took 7 minutes. SEVEN!!! I couldn&#x27;t even believe that my hair was actually dry! It was soft and full, without being frizzy. Get this dryer, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer came much earlier than expected which was a great PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer looks and feels different (in a positive way).  There&#x27;s a strong amount of air flow, the temperature for cool and warm are perfect and don&#x27;t leave my hair all fried up unlike my old hair dryer.  And surprisingly, my hair actually felt smoother-not sure if it&#x27;s because of the hair dryer or because I rewet my hair after brushing-either way, it looked great with the first use compared to my 20+ yrs old hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con about the product is the location of the buttons-it is a bit of a nuisance, really, but if you can get over that-you should definitely get this hair dryer. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new hair dryer. It drys my hair faster and does not heat it up so that it looks frizzy. I recommend this dryer. It is heavy but that is not a problem and the buttons are fine right where they are.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the local CVS. It&#x27;s supposed to make your hair soft. It burned my hair and made the ends knotted and frizzy. Someone else on here said that it knotted their hair, too. I&#x27;m so surprised at all the positive reviews. The button placements are terribly designed. It&#x27;s heavy. The air on low is not low. And the low heat is too hot. Now I have to get a trim to get rid of the frizzy ends! Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Fast drying time and shine shine shine!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased! Gives my hair volume!</li>
    <li> Drives me crazy when I&#x27;m in a hurry-  the buttons  are right where you grip it (why would you put push buttons here instead of some sort of slider??) so I&#x27;m inadvertently either turning it off or changing it from hot to cool. Extremely frustrating.  Also, it is on the heavy side. I thought I&#x27;d get used to that, but I haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the power this dryer has, but when I have to replace it I&#x27;ll look for something different.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer! Enough to write this review, which I never do. I was cautious when buying this because of some of the complaints I read here on Amazon, but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to buy it anyway! I have rather thick hair, and with my old dryer it would take me at least 15-20 minutes to get it fully dried. With this dryer, the majority of my hair is dry within 1 minute, and that is no exaggeration! The dryer is pretty powerful! And it doesn&#x27;t make my hair crazy frizzy either, which is amazing! The weight of this dryer does not bother me, I do not think it is too heavy. The buttons are in a somewhat odd place, but they are small enough that I do not accidentally switch them while drying my hair. My only request would be to add a slightly slower setting, as the power of this dryer makes it harder to properly style my short bangs.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer works great!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this. It is really powerful which is handy for someone with frizzy hair like mine. Good value for such a good product.</li>
    <li> This  is a good high volume blow dryer.  I need a dryer that will add volume and this one does a nice job.  It comes with 3 attachments - a root dryer, a diffuser and a direction blowing attachment.  The only down side to this dryer is that it is heavy.  Not the worst I&#x27;ve had, but it is not light - so if you have to spend a long time drying your hair, this might not be the dryer for you.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer a lot - it dries my hair very fast.  The attachments are a bit hard to take on and off, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother on her birthday and she absolutely loves it!  I use it from time to time and I think that it&#x27;s a great product!  The one downfall is the button placement but it&#x27;s not that really a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably light, not as heavy as some people are saying it is.  It has a high heat capacity and it works wonderfully. This is a great price for the caliber of this blow dryer! I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Should&#x27;ve returned this. Not hot enough..at all, buttons are in weird place. As you&#x27;re drying your hair, you inevitably hit the off button, or another speed. Super annoying.</li>
    <li> this is a very good hair dryer. It doesn&#x27;t mess up my hair. Very good product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very little frizz and it dries quickly. The dryer is heavier and larger in size than I expected. The control buttons are positioned in a way that your fingers can&#x27;t avoid them while drying, so the settings are accidentally changed too easily.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thick hair, and this really did cut down on my drying time.  I use the cold button when I&#x27;m done and it seems to make my hair a little more manageable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer often, but with a new short cut I found I needed to- this blow dryer does wonders in a short time with my curls.... I use the diffuser attachment that came with it.  Super.</li>
    <li> Its perfect just what I was looking for.Its just a teeny bite heavier than I thought it would be. But with all the other great features  I can live with it. If you go in most stores to buy it is about 20-25 dollars more than on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> My hair dryer broke a while ago and I finally decided to replace it with this one. I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn&#x27;t the most expensive one that they had, but I&#x27;ve used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I compared it to my mother&#x27;s $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn&#x27;t shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn&#x27;t get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it&#x27;s pretty great at it&#x27;s job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;problem\\&quot; I&#x27;d say I have with it is that it&#x27;s a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say \\&quot;problem\\&quot; because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they&#x27;ve got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don&#x27;t notice when I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can&#x27;t say that I can relate. I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I&#x27;ve seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome dryer. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Two problems: first, the controls are in just the right spot for me to constantly switch it off by accident.  Took a bit to get the hang of how to hold it. Second, it broke after a few months of use.  It is a powerful hairdryer and I like it when it worked.  No point in buying it if it isn&#x27;t going to last!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is really quiet compared to what I&#x27;m used to, which is great.  It dries my hair quickly but hasn&#x27;t over dried it (I have really fine hair).  It&#x27;s also pretty light compared to my last hair dryer.  The only issue I have with it is I sometimes accidentally hit the off button or the temperature setting as I&#x27;m using it.  These buttons are located on the side of the handle and if you&#x27;re not careful you can easily switch your settings or shut off your dryer.  Since this is only a minor inconvenience I gave it four stars because other than what I just mentioned, this hair dryer works great!</li>
    <li> I chose this hair dryer simply because I saw in a news article that it was highly rated and I LOVE IT. Not sure why reviews are about the button placement and weight. I am like such a baby with heavy items and this is fine. As for the buttons, you get used to it after a couple of uses. Great product and it definitely dries faster and is pretty!</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I just love this hairdryer! I have super thick hair that takes forever to dry, and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try after reading the reviews, but didn&#x27;t have much hope, as I&#x27;ve not found a hairdryer to-date that dries my hair in less than 15 minutes. That is, until this John Frieda hair dryer! I can literally dry my hair in 5 minutes now, and the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is very warm, but not so warm it burns my scalp! Great strength and heat in this hairdryer! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer!! It has a very powerful flow of air which is excellent for straight hair like mine. Comes with all standard attachments and I think would be great for any type of hair. Excellent quality for the price. I have had mine for over a year now and it still works like it is brand new!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has this - I used it and got hooked.  So much better than my $20 Conair hair dryer - totally worth the money.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> I was excited to order this product after reading glowing reviews in a magazine article. So, it was a big disappointment to find that it was really large and unwieldy, extremely loud with a clicking sound that scared my pet, and the lowest setting still nearly blew me out of the bathroom and was not conducive for styling. I had to return it, even though the high ion content did leave my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Dries quick and going strong even after year+ of having it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer thinking it would be great for my hair and cut down on my drying time.  I am very disappointed! My hair is in horrible knots after/during using this dryer.  I have never had a problem with hair dryers, but while using this one, even with the attachment on, my hair is in bad tight knots. While blow drying, I&#x27;ve tried combing it, using a round brush everything, and it is wicked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second issue is the on/off and heat settings switches.  They are right where you wrap my hand, so as I am using the dryer I constantly flip them off.  It is poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not reccomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair well. My only quibble is that the on-off and temperature control switches are where you naturally want to grip the handle. That is a poor design flaw.</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t use a hairdryer often (I have long naturally curly hair that I usually air dry) but found that I needed a dryer if didn&#x27;t have time to air dry. This is a powerful dryer, nice design, the attachments STAY ON! Almost too well! It does NOT get overly hot, and the cool shot button really is cool (not Luke warm like other dyers). Reduced frizziness I normally get from my old hair dryer. The button location did not bother me as some have reported, never accidentally pressed while drying.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked very well for the first week I had it then it was downhill from there. It won&#x27;t consistently blow hot air on the hot setting; it would alternate between hot/lukewarm and even cold (and I haven&#x27;t even had it for 3 weeks yet!)  It is also quite heavy to hold over your head for any length of time. It is going back to Amazon ASAP!!!</li>
    <li> Better than your average store bought dryer because of the multiple settings and attachments.  I chose this one because I thought the cold &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; feature meant I didn&#x27;t have to actually hold the button down manually while using it. But you do have to hold it down the whole time to get cold air, and its awkward.  Wish I could find a dryer that was cold air only honestly.</li>
    <li> A must have! I recently purchased an expensive  blow dryer from a beauty supply store but did not like the way it left my hair... So I came across this one at target and decided to try it out.... This blow dryer left my hair super soft, shiny &amp; without any frizz... I mean absolutely flawless!!  As if I just walked out of a salon! I am not over exaggerating... I&#x27;m not a girly girl or into this stuff but I was beyond impressed with how fast &amp; fab my hair came out thanks to this blow dryer.... A Definite thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and coarse hair and this is the best hairdryer I have owned until now! It gets my hair dry so fast, and the end results are smooth and frizzless hair. With other hair dryers it takes anywhere from 25-35 minutes but this one literally takes 7-10 minutes plus adds more volume to my hair.The heat settings are perfect as well in case someone doesn&#x27;t want to add too much heat to your hair .. Every dryer I have ever owned did pretty much all the same things but at the end made my hair frizzy and dried my hair out. This dryer is THE ONLY ONE that makes my hair look so beautiful, sleek, soft and shiny! It makes my hair so smooth that I almost don&#x27;t have to flat iron it since it is naturally wavy. Freakinglyyy amazing!!</li>
    <li> Its a little heavy but works great, the heat settings work well and I believe this will last a long time as compared to the discount ones that don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer does not get hot enough to straighten curly/thick hair using the tension method. I tried using this on myself; my hair is mostly wavy and with an loose s curl at the ends, and it did nothing for me. My sister tried this too and she has thick hair-- did not work for her either. I was disappointed because I bought this as a Christmas present for her because she needed a new blow dryer. I thought the John Frieda brand would prove useful. I didn&#x27;t even bother returning it, I just sent it to my family to see if they would find some use for it. Perhaps this would work better for already straight hair or fine hair that you just want to dry faster than letting it air dry.</li>
    <li> First hair dryer I bought that was more than $15, so it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It makes my curly and frizzy hair look a whole lot better than before I bought it, that&#x27;s for sure. But, it&#x27;s pretty heavy and I wish there were more speed options. That&#x27;s the only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars. Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the gift she requested because her old one was on it&#x27;s last legs.  She was very pleased to open it for Christmas</li>
    <li> Mine never got hot. I sent it back.  I think it may have been defective.  But I also bought it to replace a nice $75 dryer, so maybe it was just what I was used to.</li>
    <li> Instantly, I knew I got my money&#x27;s worth with this blow dryer. I had settled for a mediocre dryer for quite a few years and thought I would splurge. I am extremely glad I did! Not only does it dry my hair quickly, it does so gently as well. My hair is much smoother and shinier after using this blow dryer than my previous one. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this hair dryer actually dries my hair any faster but, it sure makes it shinier.  I also love the shape &amp; placement of the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button which I use to set the volume.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an ionic blow dryer for a few years now and this one leaves my hair noticeably smoother than my current Babyliss. If you are using a regular blow dryer now, you will see a big difference with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing!  My hair is very wavy &amp; @ time very curly,&lt;br /&gt;This dryer let&#x27;s me style my hair easily.  It makes my dryer time so much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie, River Vale, NJ</li>
    <li> VERY Heavy. On/Off switch right on handle and gets turned off during use all the time.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Powerful. Does make my thin hair look more volumn.</li>
    <li> It is a good thing that my limited edition Revlon blow dryer broke after only 6 months. Because I replaced it with the John Frieda full volume blow dryer this morning and I was simply stunned at the difference in quality. I have had many brands of blow dryers over the years and it has always taken me at least 10 minutes to completely blow dry my very thick hair. However this John Frieda blow dryer took my very thick, shoulder length hair from soaking wet to bone dry and ready for hot rollers in three minutes! Yes, you read that right... three minutes! This blow dryer is going to save me so much time when I am in a hurry and trying to get out the door. It is worth every single penny and then some. I love, love, love this blow dryer and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this dryer did an awesome job w giving me lots of volumn. I&#x27;m happy to have given it a try. Keeper.</li>
    <li> I love it but... it&#x27;s a little heavy!</li>
    <li> Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working today. It just quit. Reset button won&#x27;t fix it. Very disappointed as I had a much cheaper hairdryer and it lasted years. This has only lasted 3 months!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this hair dryer.  I had been using an old Remington for years now, not even sure the model anymore.  I thought it did a pretty good job, but now I know I was way over for an upgrade.  I have the John Frieda straightener, so I though I&#x27;d give this a try.  I love the way they match in my bathroom (lol) and it works so good.  I appreciate the concentrators and diffuser it comes with as well as the cool blast option it has.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and my locks are too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this dryer - it is fast and efficient.  Not the quietest dryer on the block but it is very powerful, so not surprising that it&#x27;s a bit loud. Works super fast and definitely adds volume.  The buttons are indeed in an inconvenient place, but I you can get used to it. Good deal for this price.</li>
    <li> Lots of power, has cool warm and hott temp. Awesome!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this blowdryer!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t need a new hair dryer but saw this John Frieda dryer in the store and I had to purchase! I gave it a try and was not happy. In my opinion there was not enough air coming out, and it sounds funny. I will return tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I do not like this hair dryer at all. What a waste! I have fine hair and it&#x27;s pretty long - to the middle of my back - and when I use this dryer, it tangles my hair with the fine little knots that hurt to get out and break my hair. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me, even on the high/hot setting and it does nothing for my bangs. Like other people have said, the buttons are right on the handle and get in the way when you&#x27;re holding it, so that&#x27;s annoying. It is heavier than my old dryer and I can&#x27;t get used to that. So, basically, I have to go buy yet another hair dryer b/c I can&#x27;t imagine being stuck with this one for the next 5 or so years. Sorry I even got this.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair evenly. Love the cool setting. I&#x27;m AA w curly coily hair and this dryer allows my hair to set w nice n shiny curls.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. I thought the cool shot had a locking button, but it doesn&#x27;t. That was the main reason I bought it. It does work well and it doesn&#x27;t seem to over heat like me other one.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer after watching a review from &amp;#34;itsjudytime&amp;#34; on youtube. It really is a great dryer, good power, not too heavy, does a great job drying my very long hair. My only issue is that the power button an heat settings are on the handle so I have ended up accidentally turning the dryer off in the middle of drying my hair and also turning the heat setting to low. If the switches had been located somewhere else I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My friend suggested this dryer and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Only one drawback, little heavy.</li>
    <li> It was a nice hair dryer, came highly recommended by several sites. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 10 uses before the power began to surge and there was a distinct ozone odor coming from it. For safety I shut it off immediately. I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer that often, so I had already had it past the time I could return it. I don&#x27;t know if mine was a dud or not or if it perhaps was damaged some way in shipping, but I hesitate to buy the same model. It was to replace a dryer that had lasted me over 10 years, so I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is made by Conair. It is heavy, so beware!  It has a great selection of heat and power choices. It does the job at a good price.  However, I will be replacing it with one that is not so heavy!</li>
    <li> Not heavy, buttons not in the way.  Didn&#x27;t like the diffuser, so just attached a hot sock diffuser, works just fine. Like the sleek look to it.</li>
    <li> The best blow-dryer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This dryer BY FAR IS THE BEST EVER!!!! I have really long hair extensions and they take FOREVER to dry, and after reading the reviews for this dryer I decided to try it because they say drying in half the time.&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t kidding, this dryer is AMAZING to say the least, I have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive; so do yourself a favor, purchase this dryer, you wont be sorry, it is truly the best! Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I&#x27;ll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It&#x27;s totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn&#x27;t purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all. And side note, it really does dry in half the time, which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button ; )</li>
    <li> I have hair down to my bottom which usually takes an hour to dry with my conair. With this amazing beauty it takes less than 15 minutes!! I am so pleased with this purchase. The buttons are a bit weirdly placed and I wish it came with a diffuser that&#x27;s about the only downfalls! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has a lot of power and seems to dry my very long, fine hair quickly.  That&#x27;s what I love about it and the primary reason for the four star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that the on/off and temperature buttons are on the side of the handle - as pictured - and since they are rocker buttons I always accidentally turn it off or change temp at least once during my drying session.  I consider it a design flaw. The dryer is a bit heavy, but I chalk it up to quality and I got used to that right away.  Finally, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as past dryers - but with the increase in power it still dries great, so, that must be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once this one conks out I probably wouldn&#x27;t get another one unless the button situation changes.</li>
    <li> It works very well and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
