### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Okay, the quality is very good</li>
      <li>Gorgeous color,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a gloss not a lipstick!</li>
      <li>Color is nice though and feels very smooth on lips.</li>
      <li>I wanted more pigment, this is more of a tinted balm.</li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t make your lips shiny, you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to tell that it was on.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for something more matte and noticeable.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really cute color</li>
      <li>It acts more as a lipgloss then lipstick.</li>
      <li>Just wished it was more of a &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I think it would work better for lighter lips</li>
      <li>And yes, it&#x27;s more of a balm than lipstick.</li>
      <li>it would, goes on kinda looks like lipgloss,translucent and comes off too easily</li>
      <li>It also applies silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have a taste to me.</li>
      <li>Not bad but not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>I probably won;t buy lipstick online ever again as you can&#x27;t really trust the pictures.</li>
      <li>Cute but not what I expected.  </li>
      <li>Really light...not for darker lips...</li>
      <li>The lip balm feels and looks very luxurious, but color is off.</li>
      <li>not the color i was expecting it&#x27;s actually much lighter</li>
      <li>More of a gloss than a lipstick, but it&#x27;s a very pretty subtle color.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s on the picture is something really, really light and pale.</li>
      <li>Not a good lipstick the dollar store lipstick is better than this one</li>
      <li>What I received is hot pink</li>
      <li>It was too glossy and barely noticeable on the lips I was Looking for a dry bright pale pink color.</li>
      <li>but it kinda barely shows up.</li>

<li> However, it&#x27;s not the color that I expected.</li>
<li> Instead of nude, pale pink, it&#x27;s Barbie pink on my pigmented lips.</li>
<li> Not right texture or color</li>
<li> otherwise it&#x27;s hard to see.  </li>

    <li> Not a good lipstick the dollar store lipstick is better than this one</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color, but it is very sheer.</li>
    <li> It acts more as a lipgloss then lipstick. If it didn&#x27;t make your lips shiny, you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to tell that it was on. I was hoping for something more matte and noticeable.</li>
    <li> More of a gloss than a lipstick, but it&#x27;s a very pretty subtle color.</li>
    <li> doesnt go on asi thought it would, goes on kinda looks like lipgloss,translucent and comes off too easily</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a gloss not a lipstick! Color is nice though and feels very smooth on lips. Shipped fast! Just wished it was more of a &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> came in not sealed, the lipstick looked as if it had been melted or used. you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> The lip balm feels and looks very luxurious, but color is off. Instead of nude, pale pink, it&#x27;s Barbie pink on my pigmented lips. Other than that it is very light and moisturizing, a bit expensive for tinted lip balm though. And yes, it&#x27;s more of a balm than lipstick. overall I prefer these over revlons lip butter and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Not bad but not what I was looking for. I wanted more pigment, this is more of a tinted balm.</li>
    <li> Cute but not what I expected.  It was too glossy and barely noticeable on the lips I was Looking for a dry bright pale pink color.</li>
    <li> Not right texture or color</li>
    <li> was not the color pink represented at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really cute color but it kinda barely shows up. It also applies silky smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have a taste to me. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Really light...not for darker lips...I use it with another color otherwise it&#x27;s hard to see.  I think it would work better for lighter lips</li>
    <li> the color of this lipstick is off.. not the color i was expecting it&#x27;s actually much lighter then it shows!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, the quality is very good and so is the texture and the long-lasting effect. However, it&#x27;s not the color that I expected. What&#x27;s on the picture is something really, really light and pale. What I received is hot pink and I don&#x27;t get to use it a lot. I probably won;t buy lipstick online ever again as you can&#x27;t really trust the pictures.</li>
