      <li>I have tried many products and this works better the Pedi Egg.</li>
      <li>have only used this unit and am very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have nothing more to say.</li>
      <li>How many times do I have to do this</li>
      <li>&amp; you&#x27;ll go through more batteries at</li>
      <li>as I have arthritis I needed a product that worked a bit better.</li>
      <li>Much better than pumice stones or anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Even though this is advertised as a heel smoother, it can be use for so much more.</li>
      <li>I have had this product for many years however the one I had does not work anymore.  </li>
      <li>This place was very accurate and easy to do business.</li>
      <li>one huge problem is I have not been able to find replacement file cylinders.  </li>
      <li>An easy way to give yourself a pedicure without going to the spa.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
      <li>ongoing maintenance is easy...</li>

      <li>This product is fantastic for foot calluses.  </li>
      <li>too  light for the job, waisted money</li>
      <li>What a shame replacement heads are no longer available.  </li>
      <li>the sound of it turned on laying on the floor close to her.  </li>
      <li>Replacement tips are no longer available.  </li>
      <li>You still need to use good moisturizer and repeat exfoliating every few days to get a good effect.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove all dry skin after the first use but it gives very good effect and leaves heels smooth.</li>
      <li>but ultimately, this is excellent tool to travel with &amp; use consistently &amp; regularly.</li>
      <li>SO nice to have smooth feet again here in the dry climate of the desert.  </li>
      <li>Cheap, easy to use, and my feet are now baby soft.</li>
      <li>Battery operated which doesn&#x27;t provide enough power to effectively buff calluses.  </li>
      <li>I liked it well enough to buy another one solely to get the replacement tips, and paid to have it shipped to the UK.</li>
      <li>And when she&#x27;s not afraid of it anymore, I&#x27;m going to see if THIS thing meant for heels might work for her toenails.  </li>
      <li>the larger &amp; smaller filing heads work beautifully on hands and feet...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product to keep feet smooth.</li>
      <li>This product works really well on my very callused feet and makes them smooth again.  </li>
      <li>my left leg does more work as I favor my right leg.</li>
      <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>so I could have new clean ones</li>
      <li>but there are not yet any replacement heads for new clean files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My feet are baby smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I wore the first one into the ground...</li>
      <li>Excellent product and sorry to see it discontinued.  </li>
      <li>So sad as it is wonderful .  </li>
      <li>I HAVE BOUGHT TWO MORE OF THE ENTIRE KITS, JUST TO GET REPLACEMENTS TIPS WHICH IS RIDICULIOUS..  </li>
      <li>Okay I purchased this because I have dry heals on both feet.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I did not expect too much from this product</li>
      <li>works great-very reasonably priced</li>
      <li>the motor isn&#x27;t strong enough to really do what I had hoped for but I am sure for the average person it works well.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL ONE I HAD FOR OVER SEVERAL YEARS</li>
      <li>but she had one in the past and liked it</li>
      <li>AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHERS</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>DOES ANYONE KNOW OR HAVE NEW REPLACEMENT TIPS?  </li>
      <li>the sight of something new...</li>
      <li>but I was very  surprised  with the results.</li>
      <li>quality when I bought my first one was way above my expectation!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I googled \\&quot;Artetmis replacement tips\\&quot; and found a couple of different places to buy the tips, so you might be able to find them at other places besides Amazon.</li>
      <li>I use this tool to smooth my toenails down as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried to get my feet smooth with hundreds of dollars worth of products over the past several times.</li>
      <li>well i didn&#x27;t there is a reason why this product is discontinued .. if i had to compare it to anything it would be equivalent to one of those infermercials on the tv for some stupid product that promises you wonderful results and turns out to be a piece of junk ..</li>
      <li>and i can not buy any more stones, this is not a good thing</li>
      <li>only not so favorable thing I would say is that, I do need to change the batteries on a fairly regular basis or the pedicure smoother appliance does not have the power to do a proper job, but I feel it is well worth the cost of batteries.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This thing barely helps, it is super loud, and when you hold it on your problem dry areas it vibrates to other areas</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product but remember do not expect great effects after first use if your fet are in very bad shape.</li>
      <li>This, inexpensive little pedicure thing really works.  </li>

<li> These dry scaly patches are a major irritant and used to be handled by picking the dry skin off with the finger nails.</li>
<li> Twice as fast and half the pain!!</li>
<li> and so my feet are not soft.</li>
<li> The Artiemis Woman Heel Smoother does help remove the dry skin.</li>

<li> I would send it back, but it&#x27;s a waste of my freaking time and don&#x27;t care to pay to ship it back.</li>
<li> I was somewhat disappointed that it didn&#x27;t file down toenails and callouses very quickly or with much force, and</li>
<li> I had rough dry feet-</li>
<li> It really works well on keeping your feet baby soft without ever cutting or scrapping.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> they need to have bigger heads though. They seem so darn small need to be bigger in size for removing dry skin with.</li>
    <li> I did not expect too much from this product but I was very  surprised  with the results. It smoothes and removes dry skin on heels and toes. Very easy and safe to use. Battery operated. It also has built in safety future to prevent over-exfoliating, it stops when you press too hard. It doesn&#x27;t remove all dry skin after the first use but it gives very good effect and leaves heels smooth. You still need to use good moisturizer and repeat exfoliating every few days to get a good effect. I would recommend this product but remember do not expect great effects after first use if your fet are in very bad shape.</li>
    <li> This product is safe and effective.  Replacement tips are no longer available.  Too bad this product was not sold to a different company to continue the line.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001JYJLMY Artemis Woman HEEL SMOOTHER pedicure appliance]]Have used this product for years.  Works great, much better than using a pumis stone, etc.  Highly recommend this product to keep feet smooth.</li>
    <li> I tried every lotion in the world and none of them helped.  My feet are very rough.  I tried this and it started making a dent.  However, it didn&#x27;t have enough power for my feet.  My solution?  I went to the hardware store and got some 80 grit sandpaper.  Cheap, easy to use, and my feet are now baby soft.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these gadgets whilst visiting my son in Virginia. After returning to the UK, I found it was no longer possible to buy replacement tips as the company seemed to have gone out of business. What a shame as this is a great product. I liked it well enough to buy another one solely to get the replacement tips, and paid to have it shipped to the UK. It&#x27;s safe and used regularly keeps feet in great shape, smooth and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product before and was happy to find it was still available. I go barefoot a lot and so my feet are not soft. The Artiemis Woman Heel Smoother does help remove the dry skin. My only wish would be that the tips were made of metal so they would last longer.</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars...I would. These must be fake reviews, because this thing is TERRIBLE!!! It has no power at ALL. This is a POS. I would send it back, but it&#x27;s a waste of my freaking time and don&#x27;t care to pay to ship it back. Shame on you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years and it didn&#x27;t work for me as soon as I got it.  The heads are WAY too small to work on the bottoms of my heels. I&#x27;d need a much larger and flatter surface for this to work.  So I just put it away as another bad purchase and it&#x27;s been in my dresser drawer for a LONG time and forgot about.  Then today I was looking for a grinder to do my puppy&#x27;s toenails and saw all the bad reviews for ones I could afford.....then I remembered I had THIS in my dresser.  HEY...could there be a different use for this I thought?? So, I got it out and am now acclimating my puppy to it gradually...the sight of something new...the sound of it turned on laying on the floor close to her.  And when she&#x27;s not afraid of it anymore, I&#x27;m going to see if THIS thing meant for heels might work for her toenails.  HAS ANYONE OUT THERE THOUGHT OF THIS??  I&#x27;d be happy to hear of anyone has tried it for this purpose instead of for heels.  I don&#x27;t know if we can put email addresses on here, but I&#x27;m going to try.  If you&#x27;ve tried this for you dog&#x27;s nails, would you please let me know or leave a comment?  I&#x27;d appreciate it.  My email address is shirleyv143@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;If this is removed by amazon, it is shirleyv143 at yahoo dot com.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Artemis Woman heel smoother pedicure appliance was the best thing I have used for calluses on my feet. The calluses are quite hard and very uncomfortable. This smoother is the best..</li>
    <li> Have had this tool before.  I have found that it works well on finger calluses as well as feet.  Great tool. n</li>
    <li> its amazing . I have tried to get my feet smooth with hundreds of dollars worth of products over the past several times. I had rough dry feet- and NOTHING worked. So finally I bought the feel smoother- and it was a miracle! My feet are baby smooth and soft. Honestly, I would have paid $8 for it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and sorry to see it discontinued.  This place was very accurate and easy to do business.</li>
    <li> I use this product several times a week....  It is wonderful!!!!  one huge problem is I have not been able to find replacement file cylinders.  I would purchase those so I could have new clean ones weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this unit and am very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great, easy to use but there are not yet any replacement heads for new clean files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything and would like it better if I could get replacement file heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality when I bought my first one was way above my expectation!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product for keeping my feet healthy!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the company does not make this product any more.  I have used this product and a its replacement for over ten years.</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and have loved it ever since.  On my trip to Texas I had it in my suitcase-not my carry-on-and when I got to Texas it was gone.  So went online and ordered another plus two - one for my daughter and one for my daughter-in-law.  Summer is coming and we all want nice looking feet - so do the guys.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful; I just hope they start making it again.  It really works well on keeping your feet baby soft without ever cutting or scrapping.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This, inexpensive little pedicure thing really works.  It takes care of rough heels and calluses. You can buy replacement files.</li>
    <li> now i read the reviews for this product and they were soooo wonderful i thought for sure this would work great .. well i didn&#x27;t there is a reason why this product is discontinued .. if i had to compare it to anything it would be equivalent to one of those infermercials on the tv for some stupid product that promises you wonderful results and turns out to be a piece of junk .. like the ab roller or the weight shaker that supposed to tone your arms . yes this is just like that .. it has zero power .. it stops as soon as you press on the skin if you have anything beyond a skin lift forget about it .. this is NOT for hard to remove of tough skin ... quite frankly it removes nothing what so ever not even the smallest amount of skin .. i would discourage anyone from wasting their money .. better invest in a good puma stone .. period ..</li>
    <li> I have had this product for many years however the one I had does not work anymore.  I am happy that I could still purchase it through Amazon.  This product works really well on my very callused feet and makes them smooth again.  I have tried many products and this works better the Pedi Egg.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much! My only issue is trying to find refills. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a must have. An easy way to give yourself a pedicure without going to the spa.</li>
    <li> THIS IS TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL ONE I HAD FOR OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND WORKS JUST AS GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHERS &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> too  light for the job, waisted money</li>
    <li> Even though this is advertised as a heel smoother, it can be use for so much more. I have a problem with patches of rough skin that continually pops up on my elbows and forearms. These dry scaly patches are a major irritant and used to be handled by picking the dry skin off with the finger nails. Now I use the Artemis Lady to grind the dry skin off, no more bleeding sore spots from pulling off too much skin!! Twice as fast and half the pain!!</li>
    <li> So sad as it is wonderful .  I have nothing more to say. How many times do I have to do this</li>
    <li> This is my second Artemis Woman Heel Smoother pedicure appliance... I wore the first one into the ground...&lt;br /&gt;but the larger &amp; smaller filing heads work beautifully on hands and feet... safest way to address calluses...&lt;br /&gt;and to keep feet smooth &amp; looking good. Once you get the situation under control... ongoing maintenance is easy...but some people start with built up heel calluses and get discouraged. It&#x27;s going to take longer &amp; you&#x27;ll go through more batteries at the beginning(try rechargeables)...but ultimately, this is excellent tool to travel with &amp; use consistently &amp; regularly. In South Florida it is sandal time year round! A must ...</li>
    <li> To start with I am a real customer who is not someone making a \\&quot;fake review\\&quot; (I noticed someone who was not happy with this product accused a reviewer of faking a favorable review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a terrible problem with calluses building up on my right foot due to an injured left leg, so my left leg does more work as I favor my right leg. This is the only tool that has helped me keep up with the constant maintenance I have to do to keep my calluses under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition I have some damaged nail beds on a couple of my toes that tend to grow out as ridged, thick, unsightly toenails. I use this tool to smooth my toenails down as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only not so favorable thing I would say is that, I do need to change the batteries on a fairly regular basis or the pedicure smoother appliance does not have the power to do a proper job, but I feel it is well worth the cost of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that some reviewers were disappointed that Amazon no longer carries the replacement tips for this appliance. I googled \\&quot;Artetmis replacement tips\\&quot; and found a couple of different places to buy the tips, so you might be able to find them at other places besides Amazon. One store was a national chain store, one was an online beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed that it didn&#x27;t file down toenails and callouses very quickly or with much force, and as I have arthritis I needed a product that worked a bit better.</li>
    <li> BEST EVER TO DO MY FEET.  FOR THOSE THAT WROTE NOT ENOUGH POWER, TRY USING THE HIGHEST MH BATTERIES.  I USE RECHARABLE DIGITAL CAMERA BATTERIES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE, IS I CAN&#x27;T ORDER/FIND THE DURACRYSTAL REPLACEMENT TIPS.  I&#x27;M TOLD THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS THEIR PRODUCT IS STILL SELLING HERE?  IT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE SENSE TO ME.  I HAVE BOUGHT TWO MORE OF THE ENTIRE KITS, JUST TO GET REPLACEMENTS TIPS WHICH IS RIDICULIOUS..  DOES ANYONE KNOW OR HAVE NEW REPLACEMENT TIPS?  IF SO, CONTACE ME @ LOVETIGERS0412@AOL.COM AND ON SUBJECT LINE PLEASE TYPE REPLACEMENT TIPS.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
    <li> Okay I purchased this because I have dry heals on both feet. I hate it and it&#x27;s not ladylike, so I thought I&#x27;d buy this thing and try it because a pedi stone doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing the job anymore. This thing barely helps, it is super loud, and when you hold it on your problem dry areas it vibrates to other areas and it&#x27;s hard to manuever. I dislike it and I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten this one.</li>
    <li> So, after reading the reviews I decided to take a shot at one for the money- the one complaint I would have is that the motor is somewhat adequate for maintaining a smooth heel and foot but if you are a male like me with a pretty bad set of dry callused heels the motor isn&#x27;t strong enough to really do what I had hoped for but I am sure for the average person it works well.  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> I have two of these just in case something happens to one!  It words great, easily and quickly.  Much better than pumice stones or anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  SO nice to have smooth feet again here in the dry climate of the desert.  One even goes camping with me.</li>
    <li> works great-very reasonably priced</li>
    <li> Battery operated which doesn&#x27;t provide enough power to effectively buff calluses.  Ends up coming to a screeching halt when even the slightest pressure is applied. Tossed it.</li>
    <li> product works as expected, however company is out of business and i can not buy any more stones, this is not a good thing</li>
    <li> What a shame replacement heads are no longer available.  This product is fantastic for foot calluses.  What is the possibility that it will return?</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend but she had one in the past and liked it and I have one that I like. It smoothes my feet.</li>
