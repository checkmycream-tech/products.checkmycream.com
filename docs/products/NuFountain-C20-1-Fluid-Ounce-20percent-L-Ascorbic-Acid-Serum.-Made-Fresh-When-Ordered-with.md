<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nufountain C20 Vitamin C Serum is made fresh and does not take long to turn bad. I kept it in dark place as directed. I could not see a change except my skin got very dry.  I would not waste my money again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks(&amp;#60;4 weeks) now nd I see the result already. It makes my skin super soft nd plump. I use it in combination with NiaSerum Topical Niacinamide serum daily. Sometimes I use Clinique Repairwear uplifting cream but I&#x27;m not very regular on that. Though in the daytime I always wear sunscreen. It has never caused me to breakout. It might have a little drying effect for those with very dry skin so they should wear a moisturizer over it. It&#x27;s the perfect serum.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  A bit thin and not really so much a serum as a watery liquid but it seems to do the trick.  I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles around the eyes after using it for a few weeks.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I am trying to recreate my esthetician&#x27;s regimen she had for me without spending the $65/month for a once a month chemical peel and in-between treatments.  She had me on glycolic peels but she gave me a vitamin c cream to use between peels.  I started with using DDF&#x27;s 5% glycolic wash and following up with 10% glycolic toner.  This seemed to be working but I needed that extra umph so I added the 20% L-ascorbic acid serum.  Adding this product, along with Bee Yummy Skin Food for face has added that extra something I was looking for.  I&#x27;ve never used it just by itself, but it will be a permanent part of my regimen from now on.  Now, if my glycolic peels will hurry up and get here I can try alternating peel with this product.  I hope I started all of this soon enough to have flawless skin before my wedding.  Regardless this product is helping me get there and I will continue to use it after my big day!</li>
    <li> My facialist suggested I start using a vitamin C serum to help balance my skin (my skin is dry), and of course her recommended product is really expensive. After doing some research online, I found this product.  I decided to try it and see how it goes.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is watery, but I&#x27;ve found now that I&#x27;m used to it, anything thicker feels too heavy on my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin become much softer and hydrated with this product.  Just told my mom to go buy it.  Thrilled with a quality product at a decent price.</li>
    <li> Another in a long line of vitamin C serums I have tried. Seems ok but like with the rest didn&#x27;t notice anything great or different happening with my skin after using the bottle so have moved on to something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading numerous reviews to prep my skin for my upcoming wedding. I have been using the product for about 2 months now... only applying it at night before bed, after washing my face. I actually stopped this morning and looked in the mirror... i am impressed! My pores have significantly shrunk, and overall my skin looks refreshed. I will say it took a good couple of months before having this feeling but overall i am happy with the results! I am prone to beakouts from stress, that time of the month, etc... using this product consistently has helped with all of those! Will definitley purchase again.</li>
    <li> This serum has improved my skin to the degree that I no longer wear all-over foundation, just concealer under my eyes. I use it every morning, and a bottle lasts me approximately 1.5 months. The serum has almost no smell - maybe the faintest acidic odor - and is a clear liquid that absorbs into my skin right away. I never experienced stinging. By the end of the first bottle I used, I saw my sunspots fade and my complexion even out. I am now on my fourth bottle and will continue purchasing, although I think it isn&#x27;t providing any more improvements, just maintenance (which is fine by me since my skin looks better than it ever has).</li>
    <li> The product was able to reduce oil on my skin  At the end I went to a dermatologist, gave me a prescription and I was able to get rid off my dark spots after all  But the vendor service is great: fast!</li>
    <li> I like this serum because it contains C20 which is an extra ingredient that is good for the skin. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and is not sticky. I have used other brands of vitamin c serum, but like this one best. Great for enlarged pores and fading sun spots. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a really well made product that delivers results... I felt and noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture pretty quickly. It seemed to give me a slightly \\&quot;rosy\\&quot; effect which I don&#x27;t mind because I can get quite pale during the winter months. That \\&quot;glow\\&quot; does dissipate later on. I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on this type of product and have read that you could probably make something like this yourself for just a fraction of the cost. Maybe at some point I will try that. But, for now this product is reasonably priced (at least compared to most brands) and I believe it&#x27;s just as good if not better than more expensive brands. Things that i really like about this product-- 1. It is made fresh to order with the date written on the bottle. 2. It&#x27;s odorless, all-naturall, and colorless. 3. The customer service is excellent. I ordered the wrong bottle (this product) wanted to to order the Ferulic C+. I  e-mailed NuFountain and they sent me the Ferulic C+ and told me to just keep the C20. The Ferulic is supposed to be better for acne or oily prone skin. Although NuFountain claims all their products are made for acne or oily prone skin. The Ferulic C+ has more of a \\&quot;gel-like\\&quot; consistency and seems to be a little on the sticky side after it dries on your skin. The C20 is a liquid and isn&#x27;t as sticky. I think I like the C20 a little bit better at this point, but I&#x27;ve only used the Ferulic three times. We&#x27;ll see. Btw I&#x27;m a 41 year old male that has had acne prone skin most of my life that has to go that \\&quot;extra mile\\&quot; to keep it under control. Overall my skin has responded well to this product and I would recommend it (especially at this price) out of my respect for this company and it&#x27;s customer service thus far.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a serum, this is water. Nothing smoothe or creamy. I think they forgot the glycerine. It literally has no substance at all. I feel like I purchased water. I have been trying to pat it with my fingers, I will report back if I see or feel any difference.  I would like to know if I can add something to it to make it smooth onto my face.</li>
    <li> Simply the best Vitamin C serum. Unbelievable great value.  I tell all of my friends to buy this product</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old with very fair/sensitive skin and was hesitant to try the 20% serum. So glad that I did because the results are awesome! My skin just glows and I get allot of compliments. I had absolutely no reaction/sensitivity to the product and I could not be happier. I have always looked younger than my years but recently was guessed to be 35...really?! Will definitely be buying this product again :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a serious Internet shopper and have used several Vitamin C serum products before. This is definitely the one I&#x27;m sticking with (I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle). I use it every 2-3 days. I routinely exfoliate and tone BEFORE I use the Vit.C serum, and it absorbs immediately and nicely into the skin - no problems at all later with the skin flakiness mentioned by another user. I did have to get used to the \\&quot;water-like\\&quot; consistency, because other products I&#x27;d used before were thicker. But the eyedrop applicator really helps. And I follow it with a collagen cream, and don&#x27;t try to make the Vit.C be my moisturizer too. The combination has made my 50-something-year-old skin much smoother and healthy feeling/looking -- I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on it!! Compared to other products it&#x27;s also a great value for the price. I can&#x27;t take advantage of the \\&quot;buy 2 get 1 free\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t use it fast enough to keep extra bottles fresh, but it&#x27;s still much less expensive than any other 20% serum I&#x27;ve found. And makes it makes a noticeable difference to my skin. Can&#x27;t beat that combination!</li>
    <li> I was born with sensitive skin, but my complection was always flawles until after my mid 20&#x27;s. My skin changed dramatically then; breakouts, not only from acne but also roceacia.  It&#x27;s been a long road of dermatologists, trying new products, and lots of money to keep it healthy. This product is perfect for me, it has kept my complection clear and I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products. Financially, times have been very hard and being able to afford a good product it&#x27;s a plus!  Thank you! We need honest producers!</li>
    <li> Update: They replied back yesterday(wow that was fast):) and will be sending me the C20+Ferulic as a replacement. Wonderful customer service!!!! After I receive it and give it a try I will be back with a review. Thanks again NuFountain!!!</li>
    <li> Compared to other Vit C I have used on my face this seems like using nothing at all.  Maybe it sat in warehouse for too long.  Some Vit C lotions/serums cause redness and burning, which to me, proves its working. This product felt like putting water on my face.  No reaction.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum, I notice that my skin is clearer and brighter.  I keep mine in the refrigerator so that it last longer and it&#x27;s cooling to the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty adventerous when it comes to skincare products.  Or I used to be... until this product burned my skin.  Maybe I used too much, I don&#x27;t know, but I put a few drops on and a couple of days later (maybe it was the next day) it looked like I had an acid burn.  Thank goodness the burned look faded away.  But I learned not to buy stuff that I don&#x27;t really know the source of, especially if I&#x27;m putting it on my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had good results with Vitamin C serum in the past but it was so expensive that I didn&#x27;t continue. This price made it worth a try again. The serum came quickly, was nicely packed, and had the creation date on the sealed bottle. It is more watery than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used ascorbic acid serum before be cautious or you may want to try the lower concentration first. Some people&#x27;s skin can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other similar products, but they were not effective.  This serum has a good consistency and you can see good results right away; my skin was glowing.  I keep it in the refrigerator to extend the lifetime of the product to make it feel more refreshing.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I bought bottle after bottle of Obagi serum because I actually use it for the stretch marks and loose skin on my arms, along with tretinoin (yes it has given me amazing results) but the Obagi is soooo expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I needed to find a cheaper alternative due to a change in my finances, which I was not very happy about because when it comes to my skin I always want the cream of the crop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this serum in particular because it was actually one of the best sellers as far as vitamin C products go and had a lot of good reviews so I&#x27;d thought that I would give it a try. At first I thought all of these reviews were fake, because for this serum to be so cheap, there is just no way it worked as well as Obagi, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well let me tell you, ever since I swapped my Obagi out for this, I&#x27;ve noticed a MORE noticeable improvement in the condition of my arm skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I didnt say \\&quot;miraculous\\&quot; or \\&quot;amazing\\&quot;...but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Obagi serum is soo expensive because it simply carries the name. But do I think it is as effective as this Nufountain stuff?? No, I dont. Because the Obagi serum is very oily, and I am under the assumption that the oil prohibits the skin from truly absorbing the vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;The Nufountain forumal has NO oil and when you put it on your skin, it feels like drops of water and it does not spread nearly as well as the Obagi stuff. It spreads on your skin just as water would. BUT I think that is why this serum works so well. Your skin immediately aborbs it. You may have to put more drops just to get it to cover enough of your skin, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied it, I was VERY dissapointed because it was soo thin and watery and I was use to my thick oily Obagi serum. So I had only used Nufountain a few times because I didn&#x27;t FEEL like it was working. But I was looking in the mirror this morning, and my skin out of nowhere just looked soo nice, smooth and bright. And the only thing that changed in my regimen was this Nufountain serum, so I&#x27;m under the impression that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, I like this stuff. I was not even willing to give it a chance after a few applications, and it proved me wrong!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I bought the C20 and it does not irritate my skin. I notice that on the days that I use the C20 serum on my face, I have zero breakouts. When I stop using it for a day or two that&#x27;s when my skin starts acting up. So, not only do I get a surge of antioxidants for my face while using this product, it has helped clear up my breakouts too! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this and I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing when my bottle runs out. It is also such a reasonable price compared to other brands, and the ingredient list is minimal. I feel good about putting this on my face. Thanks NuFountain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week now and have found that I don&#x27;t like the texture it has under my makeup during the day and I don&#x27;t like layering up too much. However, I have been using it at night and it works great! I find that my skin is much softer, smoother, and more even toned. Also, acne seems to heal up faster and previous scars are getting lighter. I love the fact that it just soaks right in and still provides great results, no need to be all creamed or greased up, especially for acne prone skin. If your looking for some extra protection and repair for your skin you just cant go wrong with this serum! :)</li>
    <li> I just tried a new vitamin C serum and it does not work as well as this one. It did take a bit of time to show results but it was worth it. It helped with hyper pigmentation and faded away scarring. I need to go back to this product.</li>
    <li> It may be made fresh, but not sure I feel or have gotten the same results as the Obagi product. You should try it for yourselves.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product.  It&#x27;s require to leave it in the refrigerate but mine far a way from bathroom so I barely use it.    Beside... It&#x27;s burn my eyes when I&#x27;d apply it which indicate there are some string chemicals inside.  I didn&#x27;t see any change on my skin. I actually start to brake out but I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of this product.</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast and was packaged nice. I love how that make the serums per order and they had a date on the bottle that said which date it was made! I just started to use this product and it does not flake and it dries quickly. I hope I see good results within a few weeks.  Keep up the great service!</li>
    <li> This impressed me because it&#x27;s made fresh when ordered and cost less than the brand I usually order. I was taken aback by the watery consistancy because I was used to more viscosity. I soon adjusted to it and it works just as good as the more expensive one I was using. The instructions say to be sure to let it dry before using moisturizer so I had to adjust my routine a bit but that was easy to do. Overall I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> so far so good with this c serum I am using it with retin a (applying the c waiting 30 min then applying the retin a as a carrier)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been wanting to replace the Retin-A that I&#x27;ve been using for adult acne, but was concerned I&#x27;d never find a solid product; NuFountain Vit C serum works better than expected. I&#x27;ve officially been off of Retin-A for 3 weeks now while using this serum in the am &amp; pm, and my skin has never looked better. Definitely follow the directions about applying the serum before any other product (I was initially mixing it with Hyaluronic Acid) to get it&#x27;s full potency. Highly recommend this product to any woman, no matter your skintone (I am 38yo with olive complexion &amp; sensitive skin).</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and used the entire bottle  but I didnt  really notice a difference in my spots. I ended up trying another brand by magestic pure. I guess I will have to wait and see how this works.</li>
    <li> Ok so to be fair.  I received this product as promised and shipping was quick. No problems there.  It had a piece of paper in the package that explained that they make this fresh prior to shipment and it tells you to stop using it if it changes colors.  When I received it, it was a thin milky to slight yellow color.  After about two weeks, it was orange.  Applying the liquid to my face was like slapping some egg yoke on my face.  As it dried, it made my face feel tight and dry.  Make up went over it well thought.  I can&#x27;t say that I hated it but it was just not my thing.  I would not order it again.  It did not stay fresh long enough and it felt funny when applying it to my face.  I noticed no difference in my skin other than what I have already said.  It was not worth the money to me.</li>
    <li> Been using the vit. C serum for a few weeks and so far happy with it.  A slight sting when I put it on which makes me think it&#x27;s working and absorbs fast. Skin looks fresh!</li>
    <li> I apply this in the morning to face and neck after sonic cleanse for my 53 years old normal-to-dry skin. Follow up in 15-20 minutes with light moisturizer and sunscreen.  Have been using for about 2 weeks. Very pleased with this product,as it makes my skin feel like silk, and seems to be taming my fine lines.  It&#x27;s a good idea to mix the serum by gently rolling the bottle between your palms prior to use. After using the dropper, insert it back into the bottle while squeezing the bulb to keep air expelled from the dropper.  This will minimize introduction of air and oxidation of the serum.  Ordered 3 bottles because I can&#x27;t resist a bargain.  I&#x27;m keeping all three bottles in the 60 degree wine cooler to extend shelf life. Very pleased.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this nearly every month.  People are noticing a difference in my face.  I think it is shrinking the pours on my face too.  and I&#x27;m going to be 60 this year.  2014</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money on this product, water would have been a much better investment for me. BOOOOO</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because its made fresh right after your order and its oil-free. The vitamin c content is high which is a plus when using to build collagen and to protect the face from uv light from the sun. I always purchase Vitamin C serums in dark colored bottles to protect the vitamin from breaking down. I also keep my vitamin c products in the refrigerator to preserve its longevity. So far, since my purchase several months ago, the serum is still clear, which means its still active. When vitamin c serums turn yellow its time to toss the bottle! Don&#x27;t use it if the serum turns yellow, it can damage the cells. This is a great price for this product and it shipped fast! I recommend this product to Amazon customers...</li>
    <li> Has been helping my blotchy redness on my face. Dries quickly, does dry you out so I use the rosé hip oil as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I never really know about these items but this is at least as good as anything I ever got from my dermatologist.  Does it work?  I&#x27;m not sure, do any of them?  Update 3/13/11-Amazon ran a special and I ordered two bottles for the price of one.  Before I had a chance to open the second bottle it \\&quot;turned\\&quot; leaving it colored and with a distinct smell.  NuFountain replaced the bottle without question, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering more than one bottle at a time.</li>
    <li> So far so good, although it stings I think it&#x27;s evened out my tone and brightens.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I ordered this product. I like that it&#x27;s a clear liquid form. It has no scent so there&#x27;s no additives added. I wish it came  a larger bottle quanity botle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 11 weeks now and I really don&#x27;t see a difference in the fine lines on my face.  I going to continue using until the bottle is gone and then make a decision.  Not pleased with it right now. There has to be a better product out there. :(</li>
    <li> I have been searching for healthy serums for my skin so I came upon this.&lt;br /&gt;It is for sure made fresh, however it is pretty much water. There is no serum like texture to this, which makes it very hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;It does say it will burn a little which is does when you put it on your face. I broke out more using this then not using it. It lasts quite a long time however I think I will continue my search for a perfect serum.</li>
    <li> I bought the C20 because a client highly recommended it. AND I thought almost all the reviews were fantastic. I am 39, have freckles with a few being bigger than i&#x27;d like (borderline sun mark). Wrinkles aren&#x27;t crazy yet, but I also take collagen hydrolysate, which I think helps in that department too! I have a few, but I was going more for the lightening effect of the C20. So I get the product and start using it, keeping it in the fridge, applying as directed. I normally only use coconut oil and have for years. It burned as I expected and I thought it was a good sign. Not so much. After a few days of use I had tender zits and rough patches on my nose, jaw line and cheek line. And I thought, &amp;#34;this can&#x27;t be from the C20! Everyone loves it!&amp;#34; So I kept using it for three weeks. I actually started to sabotage my new routine so I&#x27;d &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; because I hated it. I&#x27;ve finally been back on my regular coconut oil protocol for at least a week now and I&#x27;m almost back to normal. Phew! Glad I let it go and I sincerely hope my extreme sensitivity to this product is very uncommon. But just in case...thought I&#x27;d mention it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and I appreciate that the serum is made to order.  I use the serum daily in the morning and I&#x27;ve noticed over time that my skin has an even tone and smoothness.  Store your serum bottle in the fridge to maintain the longevity of the product.</li>
    <li> this product works just as well as the high price brands...  it&#x27;s made fresh too...  i&#x27;ve used it for a while now and think it works great....</li>
    <li> WOW!  This serum works.......need to be patient. It took daily use over 2 weeks before I felt a difference.  My skin gradually felt softer, smoother, and became more even....my sunspots are also much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like water.....and stings just a little for me. Leave on overnight......on weekends I just leave on my face all day.  The only inconvenience is the serum must be refrigerated......so I need to run to the kitchen every night to apply the serum in the downstairs bathroom!</li>
    <li> Good product to use along with other vitamin c skin products and with the added bonus of being made fresh is nice.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased just one bottle (which the company recommends) to see how my skin would react.  The product tingles at first, then itches a little, and then gives way to a SLIGHTLY funny smell.  But I would expect that for any sort of changes to take place.  My skin instantly looked brighter, lighter, a little pinkish, and more vibrant.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my face, and even though I&#x27;ve had some expensive IPL laser treatments, I contribute more improvement to the NuFountain Vitamin C serum.  I bought three more and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Keep it in the fridge!</li>
    <li> the service of the company is good. I use everyday with the hyaluronic acid  and my skin looks fresh and glowing. keep always&lt;br /&gt;in the refrigerate.</li>
    <li> the vitamin C serum is working great for my face. it&#x27;s getting smooth everyday. its not a miracle but it works</li>
    <li> I think this is still to new to rate.  What little I have seen as a first time user in just a couple of weeks I like.  Again too new for me to really rate.</li>
    <li> I have used high priced products for several years and never found a product that gave me that \\&quot;glow\\&quot; that every woman wants.  I decided to try this product and, WOW, I finally have clear, glowing skin!!  I recommend this product to anyone who wishes to achieve that look.</li>
    <li> I do like this except I wish it were just a little thicker.  I wasted too much in applying it.</li>
    <li> Did not show any improvement of my skin texture in the month I used it.  Didn&#x27;t mind the water texture, if it worked.</li>
    <li> NuFountain C20 made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions, as this serum has such good reviews, and for the first couple of weeks, it made my previously dull skin positively glow. I loved the effects. But then, the clogs began. And then the clogs multiplied. My skin was a wreck. I used half the bottle before I accepted that the much-loved C20 might be the problem. By the time my skin healed and I tried it one more time (which also made me break out), two months had passed. Amazon&#x27;s return window is 30 days. This I understand. What I don&#x27;t understand is a company that doesn&#x27;t stand behind its products. When I contacted NuFountain directly to explain that the serum had caused me to break out, but I could no longer return it to Amazon, their response was that because I had purchased it from Amazon, there was nothing they could do. Seriously? You&#x27;re going to hide behind a third party seller to avoid taking responsibility for your product?</li>
    <li> What a deal with a price to match. Who needs to spend a lot of money buying face cream when you can buy the vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days, I will come back with another review once I&#x27;ve used up the bottle in about a month. (I apply it to face, neck, chest, shoulders, back if someone will help me, everywhere where I had acne.)&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face, wait about 20 mins so my skins ph can go back to 5.5~, and apply this using my fingers. I even apply it on my under eye area, both pm and am.&lt;br /&gt;In just 5 days, I see improvement in fine lines under my eyes, and my skin tone evening out from all the acne scars and such. I&#x27;m so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;I have a deep emotion line on my forehead I want to fix, and some ice-pick scars on my cheeks I want to become more shallow, so I will come back and report on how it has helped with that once the bottle is used up.&lt;br /&gt;Never seen a product work so fast. I&#x27;m wondering next time if I should buy the ones with added ingredients in like hyaluronic acid etc</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum really brighten my skin. Whenever I get a new batch and start using it, the results are instant. I usually get compliments on how clear and bright my skin looks. I am working on perfecting a good face routine for hyperpigmentation and will continue to order this serum as part of the regime. I keep it in a small black jewelry sack to decrease exposure to light so it can last longer.</li>
    <li> I said he could sting a little , I do not think , looks like water , I have not seen changes in my skin in a week , I hope that perhaps within a month</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years from this company and love it. I don&#x27;t let it run out. I usually get the 3 pack I messed up last time and ordered just one . Keep refrigerated until time to use it then i keep in my makeup bag in my cabinet keep out of the light and in a cool place. I immediately used 4 drops with no problem all over my face and neck just dropped in my hand . I use in the mornings only before I put on my moisturizer,</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  It did absolutely nothing for my face.  I could barely see a difference at all.</li>
    <li> I tried one bottle to see if I liked it.  I can say that I did see improvement, So I bougth the buy 2 get one free.  I was worried that by the time I got to the third bottle, that it might not be good.  To my surprise,  the third bottle was a good as the first.  I do keep mine in the Fridg.  I&#x27;m using this with Vitamin E and A.  I have a lot of compiment on my skin,  I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> The totally liquid texture is a bit surprising at first; just like clear water, it doesent spread easily all over face, but it actually turned ton be a huge advantage for me and my skin which does not like grease at all. Ones we get used to spread this texture, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;I do see results on my skin aparence, it is brighter, and mor even, also seems to be firm.My skins hates hyaluronic acid, oils, fruit acids... Vitamin C seems to be the only anti aging actif that my skin likes, I am glad I found one !&lt;br /&gt;Dark spots also seems to lighten a little.&lt;br /&gt;I will definetly buy it again.... and again !&lt;br /&gt;I recomed to anyone that want&#x27;s to try vitemin c, espectially for sensitive or reactive skins, cause the ingridient list is so pure. Also, perfect for those who run aways from silicones and oils or any other obstruing products..; This is just vitemin c in water !The product was sent very, very fast with a usefull notice.... Hapy !</li>
    <li> I will definitely be buying again! My skin feels and looks fantastic. Order arrived promptly and securely and I am very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this serum but it is still hard for me to tell if it is making any changes to my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and have seen a difference in my pore size, tightness, and even tone of my skin.  I have also used it on my son&#x27;s acne (which WAS really bad) and it is almost gone!  I am amazed. On my second bottle now.  Oh yeah, I use it on my keratosis pilaris (on back of arms) and it is not completely gone, yet, but it has gotten alot better :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year or so now.  It&#x27;s a great product.  It&#x27;s always fresh.  It always arrives promptly.</li>
    <li> My acne has cleared up considerably and I have had fewer break-outs since using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! The best I&#x27;ve tried!! You&#x27;ll see results within few days!!! Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product....not only is it all natural but it really works!  It makes skin brighter and firmer with continued use.  It also helps diminish wrinkles and age spots.  It goes on so easily and dries fast. I just put my moisturizer over it and i use it morning and night. This is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> The product itself was very watery. I don&#x27;t think it did much for my skin. I stopped using after several weeks. I continued to get acne and there was no change in skin brightness.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time using this, but after reading other reviews decided to give it a try.  It was shipped fast and I received it in about 5 days.  It feels so good going on and I have had several people ask me if i&#x27;ve change make up.  I will continue  to buy this .</li>
    <li> It absorb as soon as you apply it and I read differently on the package product so idk if its working yet or not.. I haven&#x27;t broke out yet so I guess that&#x27;s a good thing with my sensitive skin.. However I will continue using it.. So check back later :-)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!....Backround I have been getting fine lines,  looking tired, laugh lines stay longer then supposed to my forehead is just bad and I still have acne and nothing helps. And ive tried everything from este lauder, clarins, clinique, drugstore buys and after i read and read and finally found this stuff C20. It is by far the best anti wrinkle serum around and its fading my old acne scars healing my current acne and reducing my lines dramaticly. I look rested an younger, tight. I put this on then with some Glycerin and grade A Shea butter i moisterize. My skin has been thanking me every day. It has been so amazing. I read the high vitamin c and high vitaminA (from the Shea) should help each other out as a duo team skin cleaning of free radicals and helps boost collagen and balance out your skin....this stuff is that awesome and I am this excited after one week I can&#x27;t wait till next week! I&#x27;ll try to keep this review updated.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and fine lines under my eyes (luckily nothing major yet).  I tend to break out with a lot of products so when I find something that works I stick with it.  Having great luck with my Olay 7 effects face lotion, which I use during the day. Was looking for something more vitamin based and wrinkle fighting for the night time.  I decided to give this a try and used it each night for several weeks. However, it made me break out a little around my eyes (strange because I never break out there) and I still don&#x27;t see any improvement in my fine lines.  Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work the same on Asian or Combo skin? Not sure, but I&#x27;m going to pass on this and continue my search.</li>
    <li> I have spent soooo much $$ on products to improve my 54 yr. old skin, and this one, is THE BEST!  Just 6 drops in the palm of my left hand, and I apply it with a finger from my right hand to face and neck every morning.  After it has a couple of minutes to dry, I apply moisturizer.  Usually a vit C cream.  Sometimes my skin will need exfoliating after this proceedure, before I apply my makeup.  My skin showed dramatic improvement within weeks!  My age spots have almost disappeared, and I&#x27;ve had no more pimples since I&#x27;ve been using this great product!  I&#x27;m half-way through the bottle, and do not want to run out, so am back to purchase more.  No more wasting $$ on products that promise what they can&#x27;t deliver!  :D!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.. Within a week I started to see a difference in my skin. I did a lot of shopping around before I purchased this product (C serum is expensive) NuFountain&#x27;s price could not be beat...I will be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product&#x3D;my skin is clear and mainly blemish free. People can&#x27;t tell I had acne from the scarring I had before using this product. I recommend this to anyone wanting a more even skin tone...and then to wait a month...</li>
    <li> I purchased just one bottle using it sparingly. In combination with phytoceramides, I must admit that my wrinkles have lessened to a point that I noticed! I accidently spilled some, so I will be buying the 2 bottles, get 1 free. I don&#x27;t suffer any yellowness, stinging or bad smell that I&#x27;ve heard other&#x27;s complain about. This product is enjoyable to use because it works.</li>
    <li> I am turning into healthier approach and among healthy eating and exercising articles I read about using a Vit Serum. I use this product foe a couple of months and I see a difference already my skin is soft and smooth and no more crazy breakouts. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> If I could give it no star, I would. This product irritated my skin awfully, I can not tolerate it at all, and healing took time. I have been trying to return this but this awfull seller IS NOT RESPONDING ! I do not understand why some products if not good, can not be returned regular Amazon way? This is irresponsible</li>
    <li> I am still using it, but after 30 days I&#x27;ve seen no differents in my skin. Hope next 30 days it will work.</li>
    <li> Product works great I use it twice a day. If you have sensitive skin use 10% solution since it can cause a slight irritation. I have been using vitamin c serum for years and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I had never tried L-ascorbic acid before, but I was thinking about doing the Obaji C regime so help with sun damage.  Boy am I glad I only spent $20 on this instead!  You get more than your money&#x27;s worth from this product.  First off, like other reviewers said, it came promptly and packaged beautifully.  It also is made fresh when you order and there is a written date on the bottle of when it was made just for you!  From the moment I started using it, something happened to my skin (almost instantly).  It became smooth, clear and healthy.  I have no idea how it really works, all I know is that it does.  I can almost go make-up free now, which is something I have wished for for years!!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I received the product promptly and it was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it has done nothing for me. It didn&#x27;t diminish a few brown spots I had on my face. By the way, I am Chinese with a light complexion and I think this information is very important in deciding if a product is right for you or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I instead use baking soda as a facial microabrasion once a week, and it has diminished those few brown spots.</li>
    <li> Took forever to receive. Company did send me a letter to Amazon telling them they ran out of the chemical compound to make the product so I had to wait longer  This is Not a serum!!!  DO NOT waste your money !! Feels like water,you can literally pour it out of bottle like water. Smells like chemical. Broke my face out badly.  I will go back to using my Mad Hippie because it is truly the best product to use.  This stuff is 100% crapola</li>
    <li> Been using it for ~month and hard to tell  yet if it is making any sort of difference.  However I know the ingredients of the serum make it effective with prolonged use.  I don&#x27;t see any negative effects so I will keep using it with my sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell it is fresh since the serum is transparent..  I had an older serum that was over an year old &amp; it had turned a brownish colour &amp; that&#x27;s when you know you shouldn&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> I gave this 2 stars then on 2nd thought went and added another star. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, I just felt it was a little to &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34;. It didn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin and when it is hot outside, that just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I tried using less of it but that still did not seem to correct the issue, so I went back to my old brand.</li>
    <li> I use these products and have been pleased.  For the money, they do a good job.  I&#x27;ve also tried the real expensive product with only slightly better results.  My skin absorbs it and gives me a glow.  I strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> First of all I have never written a review on Amazon, but this serum is just too good to keep quiet about! I am a 34 year old olive toned, acne prone, former sun worshiper with a few sun spot and acne marks. I have been using retin-A for a few years for its acne and anti aging benefits but this vitamin c serum has really brightened up and cleared up my skin dramatically! Within two weeks my dark spots were fading and my acne marks were healing. I apply it twice a day, once in morning and again before bed. I am so happy that I found this product! Such a good value and the results are almost immediate. I hope you like it as much as I do! :)</li>
    <li> Not sure what I expected, but Vitamin C serum really does work and this product was by far the best price I found.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for me. I will try one more time while on a steady beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference at first but then it irritated my skin.  So I stopped using it.  Color of product kept getting darker so I didn&#x27;t know if it was going bad..</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C-20 serum from Nufountain is the best that I have found anywhere..and extremely fast delivery. all in all , they have a very happy customer and I am ordering more ..</li>
    <li> My skin looks brighter and fresher</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the company and their products.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped my serum the next day after I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I am living in France, it took only EIGHT days for my order to get there. It is incredibly fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I tried this vitamin C serum, and my face is still tingling and stinging, so I know it works, because potent vitamin C serums always sting.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, it is cheap, the company is reliable, and this is a good quality product (no bad preservatives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write more when I can notice some change in my face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is saving my skin! Pores look smaller and I have a more even and smooth complexion. Ordering my third bottle now!</li>
    <li> I am beginning to see a difference.  My eight weeks end Dec 31 so have a while to go and I am 63 so I know it will take the full eight.  I can tell by touch and looking in the mirror and really getting excited!!</li>
    <li> I had read that Vit C serum helps to reduce wrinkles and fine lines. But after using it religiously every night, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. So I stopped using it. Instead I bought and started using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair moisturizer spf30 and also the nighttime version, both of which has retinol and after using them two days, I could see it was already working.</li>
    <li> Very very good, you will be able to tell this is real vitamin C when you apply it, it may tingle at first or a little burning, it goes away shortly. After about three times using it, that will stop, your skin will adjust to it. I like the fact they even hand write on it the day it was made so you know it is fresh. Keep In a dark place, like your dresser drawer or refrigerate. L ascorbic acid should always come in a dark colored bottle to protect it from light. Do not mix directly with other product , like a moisturizer. Wait til it dries on your face and then apply your moisturizer. I got this information from a dermatologist.  Just saying!!!</li>
    <li> Researched vitamin C serum and Dr. Oz recommends it during the day for your skin.  It has only been about three weeks and time to see improvement is 6-8 weeks.  My skin feels better and I think looks fresher.  I will continue.  Wish I would have taken before and after pics. Product came in good condition, no problems.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I consider using Vitamin C Serum to help even pigment and improve skin tone. I opted to try NuFountain after reading the many superlative reviews at Amazon and elsewhere.    I&#x27;m so glad I did. Though the serum itself has helped improve my skin quality and pigment, the real reason I&#x27;m writing it to recognize the exceptional customer service I received.  My first shipment arrived earlier than I was expecting- and I unfortunately didn&#x27;t check my mailbox quickly.  My shipment had arrived in the morning mail delivery- and sat in my mailbox an entire afternoon in 106 degree weather.  When I opened it- it smelled just like \\&quot;hot dog water\\&quot; (though it was not yet yellow).  I didn&#x27;t feel any sensation when applying it- and wrote Nufountain to inquire about the possibility mine might have gone bad from the heat.    They immediately expedited a replacement shipment- which I picked up the morning it was delivered.  It had a fresh smell- and burned just a tiny bit after application (a sign it was actually doing something).  I doubt whether I would have received similar treatment from some of the other operations out there who are selling their preparations for 3x+ the cost.      Thank you, NuFountain, for going the extra mile here- you reputation is well-earned!</li>
    <li> First of all, shipping took forever! I emailed the seller and they quickly responded that they were out of l-ascorbic acid and that they didn&#x27;t notify me because I should get the product well within shipping timeframe. I placed my order on 10/25 and received it on 11/8. That&#x27;s too long for my taste. Anyway, I applied the serum Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. I woke up Monday morning and my entire face was swollen! Plus, I had a red itchy rash all over my face. My doctor had to prescribe a steroid cream and I iced my face and eyes for 3 days. The swelling is gone but the rash is still there. I think it was too strong for me. I&#x27;ve used Peter Thomas Roth Camu Camu serum with no problem. I guess this is just so pure that my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised by the consistency of this product. It feels like water not at all like a serum. It has done nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> My face is actually glowing since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I give it 5 stars for sure! I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> I am one of those who has read many books, visited many websites, heard the low-down from skin professionals, etc., in that quest for amazing skin as I age (I&#x27;m 39 as of the date of this review). And I&#x27;ve found that Vitamin C serum has been consistently recommended by beauty and skin gurus everywhere (cleanser, an anti-oxidant serum, and moisturizer with 30+ SPF being the top 3 important ones). With that in mind, I began a disciplined facial routine which now includes the use of [[ASIN:B001TAIFZM NuFountain Fresh Cosmetics C20, Oil-Free 20% Vitamin C Serum, 1.0 oz., Made Fresh When Ordered]]. I am on my 3rd bottle of this product now (I&#x27;ve managed to extend the life of my serum to almost double by always keeping it in a wine fridge and only applying it in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a routine of daily cleansing, the use of a moisturizer with (at least) a 30+ SPF factor, AND the use of my C20 Vitamin C serum (I do nothing more for my face other than to apply Rosehip oil on at night, after cleansing), my skin is brighter, my skin tone is more even, and my bouts of adult acne are virtually non-existent (except for that one pesky pimple during that time of the month). But the biggest difference? The enlarged pores, mostly on my nose and the area right next to it, have been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced. I used to load on the face primer in order to mask the big pores (because without it, foundation would only accentuate them). But NO MORE. In fact - and I only realized this today - I have completely changed my make-up routine from primer, foundation, and powder to only BB Cream (which is much more like a tinted moisturizer) BECAUSE my skin looks so good now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s safe to say that I&#x27;m quite happy with the results of using vitamin C serum. And this product in particular is great because it arrives in a dark amber bottle, the liquid itself is a pale yellow color (which tells you it&#x27;s fresh - in addition to having the date it was made written on the bottle itself), and is priced reasonably in comparison to other brands. All of which makes it a winner in MY book.made written on the bottle itself), and is priced reasonably in comparison to other brands. All of which makes it a winner in MY book.</li>
    <li> I only bought one bottle instead of the three they had for a deal, because I had never tried this company nor Vitamin C serum before. I&#x27;m wishing now I had gone with the 3 bottles! Great product and instructions! Super fast shipping. I learned after I ordered it that sometimes some people have issues with the 20% strength if they haven&#x27;t used Votamin C before, my skin has had no negative reactions to this strength at all. Very pleased and will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C stimulates collagen production and I like this product. It&#x27;s simple, unadulterated, made to order, fresh. I put it in the refrigerator as soon as it arrives and keep it there. I use it once a day with the goal of firming my aging skin. My last order, I ordered the 3-bottle deal, and have had no problem with discoloration or odors (which are a sign that bacteria has invaded and you need to toss it). Nearly every vehicle (skin care product) I have looked at to try to get some Vitamin C on my skin has contained all kinds of undesirable chemicals. I&#x27;ll stick with this one as long as NuFountain keeps making it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin nor was I able to finish the bottle, even after using it daily, I had to end up throwing it away due to the aging of it (turned yellow).</li>
    <li> I first received a bottle that the expiration date seemed wrong. (the date was written by hand)&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the customer service. The customer service was great. They responded quickly and answered my question. (yes, they put the wrong date)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the bottle in my room where there is no direct sunlight and cool temperature as they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;After a week, the liquid started smelling funny. The color of the serum was still clear but I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t really say if this works or not.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Nufountain C20 Vitamin C Serum on Nov. 21st. They made it fresh on Nov. 23rd. I received it at my delivery address on Nov. 25th. Today is Feb. 27th and I am ordering my 2nd bottle and the very small amount that I have left in my 1st bottle has NOT oxygenated and is still clear because I followed NuFountain&#x27;s advice and stored it in my fridge as I do not have a wine cooler. The product arrived well wrapped and secured with the dropper pinched with some serum already in the dropper because YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT AIR BUBBLES GETTING INTO THE PRODUCT. I went to NuFountain&#x27;s YouTube video and found the best method for me to put the serum on my face. They recommended using the dropper, cupping your hand, add 6 to 7 drops of serum in the middle of your cupped hand, use your finger tips to dab some serum on certain spots on your face (or was that my own method? I forget but the next suggestion that I followed is definitely their suggestion for sure) and using the rest of the serum by pressing your hands together and patting the remaining serum on your face, neck and chest for even distribution of the product (See the video demonstration on YouTube).  I applied this serum DAY AND NIGHT 95% of the time. THE SERUM WAS NEVER OUTSIDE OF MY FRIDGE FOR MORE THAN 2 OR 3 MINUTES AT A TIME. I MOVED SWIFTLY BECAUSE I FEARED OXYGENATION OF THE PRODUCT. I KEPT IT IN A DARK SPOT IN THE FRIDGE. I MEAN IN THE DOOR OF THE FRIDGE BEHIND A TALLER BOTTLE OF SOMETHING.  From my receiving date till now, I probably didn&#x27;t apply the serum at all in an entire day a total of 8-12 times. From delivery date till now it was applied only once a day maybe 10 times. My skin is brighter. Dark marks have lightened tremendously. My facial care routine is cleansing with Black soap with shea butter, toning with Dickerson&#x27;s pore perfecting toner then applying the serum. I use Nature&#x27;s Way coconut oil or Mogador argan oil as a moisturizer after waiting 10 minutes for the serum to fully absorb. My concealer goes on well afterward. Speaking of concealer- since I started using the serum, I use way less concealer because a lot of what I considered to be problem spots on my face have faded tremendously or disappeared. NuFountain&#x27;s vitamin C serum has a lot of blemish lightening power (I can&#x27;t think of better words at this moment to describe it, but you know what I mean).  NO- you cannot put makeup on over the serum without first applying a moisturizer. NO- you cannot go outside with just the serum on your face or you WILL have dry, white, flaky spots on your face.  This serum is a fountain of youth in a bottle. It&#x27;s my special secret that I recommend to anyone to add to their facial routine. I am complimented almost every day about my skin! This is one of my keepers. I want a bottle in my fridge at all times and in a cooler when I&#x27;m travelling. I am about to order another bottle. This product is better than I expected it to be and I was already optimistic about it from reading the reviews here. NuFountain, you had me at \\&quot;Made fresh when ordered.\\&quot;  *I am LC from NC*</li>
    <li> This is an affordable product that works!  I use it daily, in the AM, before applying moisturizer.  I do keep the product refrigerated since it lasts several weeks for me.  I have used NuFountain&#x27;s C20 and the C with Ferulic and I definitely see an improvement in skin tone and texture.  No irritation, no offensive odor, and visible results!  Well done, NuFountain!</li>
    <li> Seems very pure.  My complexion has improved since I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now.I still haven&#x27;t used close to half of the bottle.  Arrived VERY quickly.</li>
    <li> Item was sent on time.  For now, my review is just OK because I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the month I used it.  I would still give it another shot.  I like how it&#x27;s quick drying and not at all oily.  Leaves my skin refreshed.</li>
    <li> Bought this after Dr. Oz had a show on using this on your face at night before night cream.  Very nice product!!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes with out being greesy. I use this in conjunction with aloe vera when I have a sun or wind burn. I mix it with my daily spf lotion it brightens the complexion. ♡</li>
    <li> My second bottle. I like the serum, I like that it is made fresh but the bad part is that it oxidizes too quick. I dont have a wine cooler in my room to keep this in so I have to keep it in my fridge otherwise it will turn yellow and go bad within 2 weeks and there goes in the trash. For me this is quite inconvenient. I dont want to walk back and forth to use it. Will have to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I found this product to sting my skin when using it after exfoliating (especially on my neck), which I think is the best time to put on skin-nourishing products. The water-like consistency makes it very difficult to apply. The dropper bottle will be more useful to me than the product (for essential oils or adding bleach drops when cleaning my reverse-osmosis plastic water lines each year). The packaging was excellent and you can tell from the nice accompanying note with the product, excellent labeling, and care of packaging that the people behind this product are wonderful and care about their customers. I have found that puncturing a vitamin E capsule and putting it directly on my skin gave me better results than topical vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the great reviews, but I must say I&#x27;m not too impressed. I&#x27;ve been using this product daily expecting to see some positive results, but unfortunately I have not. I do not experience any tightness, glowing, anti-acne results. However... It does offer subtle softness after washing my face. I just don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about... May try another serum to see if there is a dramatic difference. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 bottles from this shipper.  The first bottle came in a couple of days.  The remaining two I had to call and ask where are they.  They took about a week to get them.  I ve only used the first bottle.  The other two I gave away.  I used this product every day for about sixs weeks until the vitamin C turned yellow.  I did not see a difference by using this.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! I saw results in 7 days. The most amazing thing is the vertical lines around my mouth are almost completely gone in 8 weeks. Makeup goes on smoothly after dry down of just a couple of minutes. A must have for us Baby boomers!</li>
    <li> I was uncertain about this product as it was the first time ordering.  I read the reviews, I saw they sold many units as a top seller on Amazon which gave me confidence.  I have had success with other (expensive) Vitamin C Serum brands and this one did not disappoint.  I saved a small fortune by not just buying on &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name.  A small amount goes a long way.  Will certainly be ordering again.  I do not want to stock up on this as it is made fresh and needs to be stored properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; products in the past and they&#x27;ve all had an oily base, but this one has a more watery consistency, and I like that, plus the date of manufacturing this Vitamin C serum was written on the bottle, so I know that it is fresh. The product does tighten my skin I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> good product i like this !!!! i recomended all would a good skin tone !!!!!!!!!!!!i&#x27;m brown skin and my skin glow more with this product</li>
    <li> Best ever... I love how my skin looks, very radiant.. I never leave reviews to anything I buy... But to this serum, i have to...  yess is the best... I love it and I highly recommen it</li>
    <li> Love this product! It works wonders on my skin! My skin tends to be dry but this product is amazing ! My skin became flawless.. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get every week!!!! You do need to follow up with a cream moisturizer, for me it works great with a mychelle dry skin cream. This vitamin c product is like a miracle!</li>
    <li> I love vitamin c products.  I loved that this was freshly made but it seemed to make my skin break out.  I was hoping it would be a new staple for me beauty wise but I guess I have to keep searching.  I cannot use it on my face.</li>
    <li> For being 20% Vitamin C, not sure it really makes any difference in my skin. I have used other vitamin C products and have noticed a difference in my skin, but this one didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Looks like water, no smell; wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work, but started to notice the tingling after a few days, seems to be delivering the desired effect.  Skin looks healthier, spots fading - will continue to use (have only been using for about a week).</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;believer&amp;#34; in this Vitamin C serum and recommend often to others.  I use this product daily.</li>
    <li> By the first week of using morning and nite, my skin is beautiful!  I am 61 years old and this works!!  Will order again soon...</li>
    <li> I was a little perplexed when I opened my first bottle of this serum after it arrived last week. I wondered how a skin remedy with the color and consistency of tap water was going to be of any benefit to my skin. Well, now, after using it for 5 days, I must say, I am even more bewildered. After the first application, I was amazed at how it immediately tightened my skin and reduced the look of expression lines. When I woke up the next morning my face was as soft and smooth as my prepubescent skin. It reduces the look of your pores straight away, and evens out the texture in a matter of days. It also seems to cut down on extreme oiliness in the t- zone ( I really didn&#x60;t expect that benefit) I haven&#x60;t seen any significant improvement to hyperpigmented areas yet, but I haven&#x60;t been using it that long. After doing a bit more research, it now makes sense how the water solubility of this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is  the best delivery system for getting the Vit C into the cells. Seems to work better than taking massive doses of Vitamin C internally because most of it never even gets to the cellular level anyway. I just hope it&#x60;s not one of those things where my skin gets used to to it, and then it stops working. For anyone looking to improve their skin tone and help with any of the aforementioned skin issues, give this stuff a try. It&#x60;s relatively inexpensive for what it does in such short amount of time.</li>
    <li> This prodcut seems just like water to me. I will give it some time. Since I work in a laboratory maybe I will have them run some testing to see exactly what it is.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to write this review so that I could see how the product worked and I&#x27;m happy to report that it&#x27;s awesome.  I am 45 years old and notice a huge difference.  My skin is smoother with fewer fine lines and seems to be clearer with an evenness I haven&#x27;t seen since my 30&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today.</li>
    <li> This stinged somewhat. I make my own now.</li>
    <li> This does seem to eas wrinkles and makes skin feel better. I noticed the fine lines around my lips looking smaller. I have to wonder if lemon juice wouldn&#x27;t do the same thing though.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I saw great results the first week of using this product that I went back and order 3 more bottles. The first bottle I had purchased I had a few questions so I contacted the company and they literally responded back within the hour and were very helpful and even offered to send me another bottle if I had thought I had received a bad batch. I indeed had not received a bad batch but followed her instructions on making sure my face was still damp (not completely dry) when applying the product and that did alleviate my problem of a sticky feel to my face. Since using this product my face is much softer and a 30-35% decrease in laugh lines. Even my husband has noticed a difference and I have only been using this for a few weeks, so I can&#x27;t wait to see more results after the 6-8 week period. NuFountain has a customer for life now. I highly recommend this product. I am in my 40&#x27;s.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the positive changes in my skin since using this serum! I&#x27;m a repeat customer now!</li>
    <li> really did not notice any difference. used it for 3 month. I am late forties, pretty ok skin tone etc. so maybe thats why? not sure.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most important beauty purchases I made. The product does what it claims. Overnight, I felt the oiliness of my face was significantly reduced.  I noticed some discoloration was gone in a few days. I am reordering..</li>
    <li> My dermatologist introduced me to a similar Vitamin C serum from a different company. I was extremely pleased with the results, but had a hard time justifying the 80 dollar price tag. After searching online for a less expensive alternative, I stumbled across this product.  The price was right, the reviews were glowing, and I figured I had nothing to loose by ordering it-and I am so glad I did! This product has significantly improved the tone and texture of my skin. My skin looks so much clearer and firmer and it also seems to minimize any hormonal breakouts. Like other reviewers mentioned, the consistency of this product is akin to..well, water, but don&#x27;t be alarmed, it&#x27;s still potent. I just put a few drops in the palm of my hand and pat it in my face and neck using my other hand. I wish I had found this product sooner!</li>
    <li> I always wait before sharing a review for skincare products because realistically it takes time to see results. Well, I got my order fast - no problem there. The bottle&#x27;s dated 4/28 so I think I got it around the 1st of May. A full month later and I see no difference at all. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I wonder if I&#x27;m using enough or not. Some seemed to mention a bottle lasts about a month. Well I&#x27;ve got about 2/3 a bottle left. But I&#x27;ve followed the instructions exactly. It says start with about 5 or 6 drops in the morning. I use a little more than that sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll finish the bottle just because I have it, but I don&#x27;t know if the next step for me is to try the other formula they have, I forget what it&#x27;s called but it&#x27;s the one with Ferulic acid. I&#x27;m African-American and that should have nothing to do with its effectiveness, but perhaps it will take longer to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to see the results so many rave about. Oh well, nothing hurts a try. I&#x27;ll be back at the end of June. And TODAY June 2nd, I&#x27;ve taken a photo of my clean face to compare and see if I see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will report back.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I scrub my face and then apply this for a fresh look every day.</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome!! Im getting more for my friends and family. Its very watery but doesnt leave a film on your face</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone!!!!!! It really is an amazing serum and I really love it!  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I receive this item on Thursday and use it three times already and I do notice my face is soft. I have no issue of applying on my face.  I&#x27;m hoping this product will help clear my daughter&#x27;s face.  She has a very severe acne...I will write another review in few weeks and see how mine and my daughter&#x27;s skin goes...</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s description discusses keeping it in the dark and under a temperature controlled variance.  I followed the instructions and the product did absolutely nothing for me.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year .. I can honestly say that it was worked for me,my skin is brighter my brownish spots are fading away .. Lately I have been receiving compliments about how my skin looks brighter and youthful looking .. Now keep in mind that this product is not for a quick result, you have to be patient and keep using it to see results .. Some of us will see results immediately , but some won&#x27;t , in my case my skin has a lot of brownish spots little by little they have been fading away .. My skin is acne prone,have had acne my whole life , thank God with this product I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts .. I will recommend to anyone .. Try it you&#x27;ll like it .. Good luck !!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because it was promoted as a  very good skin care serum on Dr. Oz&#x27;s TV show.  I have used it as prescribed, but after 2 weeks could see no difference in my skin.  Don&#x27; think it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Certainly seen positive results within a few days.  Stored product as recommended by NU fountain and found no oxidation as they mentioned which may occur if not stored properly.  Gave a nice sheen to skin.</li>
    <li> I have to say I tried a topical vitamin C product with E and hyaluronic acid for two months and came right back to this one. No results with the other product, big ones with this product. I&#x27;ve read that all you need is the vitamin C and I am now a believer. Excellent service here as well.</li>
    <li> I had very high expectations for this product based on the reviews. Am happy to say it has not disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;Its not a miracle product but I do see the effects on my 37 years old skin(I hate how that sounds but...sigh)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Plumping: The most noticeable effect after 2 weeks of use is the plumping. I have a skinny face, so always fear that I will look older than I am. But this serum has made my skin, esp, cheeks plumper. The difference is subtle but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Clarity: I have not had acne breakouts since I started using this. I dabbed it on a pimple that appeared overnight and it was gone the next day. Brown spots are not significantly lighter. I don&#x27;t have much sun damage but do have hereditary brown spots. I guess there is no fix for that.. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Softness: I believe this is again related to the plumping effect, I feel my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Pores: I have not noticed any difference in pore size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with the product. I store it in the fridge. I use 6-7 drops every night(dab it on my face) and top it off with argan oil after it dries. Helps for now, we&#x27;ll see as I get older... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up review(Nov 24):&lt;br /&gt;Its been 2 months since I started using the serum. The bottle is still not finished, there&#x27;s about a week&#x27;s supply left.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this for about 4 days in between as I was traveling to a tropical place. The fines lines actually came back!&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, still happy with this product. I intend to continue using it till my skin stops responding (hope never).</li>
    <li> Very nice product once you get used to the consistency. It really makes your skin feel like velvet to the touch. Only on my second container &amp; am waiting for the 8 weeks as the company suggested for the full scale benefits to become apparent. I do have high expectations judging from the results thus far :D</li>
    <li> The product is very fresh when delivered. I noticed spots and blemishes fading.. However there is no way to use this entire bottle to guaranteed freshness time/date. I started using the product daily until skin improved. I am now only using after facial peels. Product is good but freshness doesn&#x27;t matter unless used frequently or on a large surface area and complete the entire bottle in recommended time.</li>
    <li> stays fresh and notice results immediately. I like this product better than the one I recently bought from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This is what I use on my skin before my moisturizer and it makes my skin smooth and glowing.  It helps minimize wrinkles and just overall helps.  I would recommend this as a daily morning and nightly ritual.</li>
    <li> I like this serum it&#x27;s fresh just as descrided will proubly order from them again this was a hassle free order</li>
    <li> I purchased this again because I saw how truly effective a product it is- and, it&#x27;s priced we&#x27;ll below the luxury labelled competition.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in Dec 2012 and I waited to write this review until I had finished one full bottle. I am very pleased to say that the terrible age spots on my face have noticibly faded. I apply this product night and morning, with a q-tip because trying to dispense it into my hands with the dropper is very difficult. So, forget the dropper and use a q-tip if you want to use the product both efficiently and sparingly. I highly recommend it for those of us who have dark age spots on the face and neck.</li>
    <li> The water like consistency was different, but it really wasn&#x27;t a problem.  The serum goes on well and I love the results! This is my second bottle and my skin looks great!  Lines have nearly disappeared and dark spots are fading...very pleased with this product!  And I found the slight citus smell refreshing, very pleasant!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately my skin is too sensitive for this product but it was of great quality. I&#x27;m also using Trerin-X so that may have been too much for my skin. A good buy.</li>
    <li> i have numerous vitamin c serums and lotions but this product packs the best punch for the money!  fine lines are diminishing by the week! excellent</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and I am a professional gardener.  I noticed in the last 3 years I have starting getting age spots.&lt;br /&gt;I received my first bottle as a gift and started to use it 2 times a day.  On the third day&lt;br /&gt;I started getting complements from friends on my skin, and they wanted to know what I was&lt;br /&gt;doing that was making me look younger.  I was pleasantly surprised because others were seeing&lt;br /&gt;something I didn&#x27;t see.  Now I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks on my face, backs of hands and&lt;br /&gt;upper chest area-- and as an experiment, I purposely left one small spot untreated.  The treated brown&lt;br /&gt; spots have faded at least 80 percent lighter than the one untreated. I&#x27;m hopeful that C-20+ will continue to lighten the spots until they disappear altogether. It is amazing stuff, and I&#x27;m going to&lt;br /&gt;purchase another bottle after I write this.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum for about a month and can totally see results already. My skin is firmer and brighter and I love that each batch of the serum is made fresh. I also want to comment that the customer service is excellent and the company really cares about their customers. I had a question on the usage of the product and I got an immediate response with the answer to my question. I researched Vitamin C serums extensively before purchasing this product and I believe this is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> Great product. It has helped with my complexion and fine lines. On my third bottle and I highly recommend. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> The NuFountain® Fresh Cosmetics 20% L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C Serum arrived in good packaging (maybe just a smidge too much but all recyclable). The product is a good ratio (effective but not harsh) of active serum to inactive ingredients (inactive ingredients we selected). Storage and use instructions were easy and beneficial--and said why to do what. Excellent delivery, excellent product. Keep the bottling, labeling and poop-stick (documentation) simple. I&#x27;m reordering, tonight!</li>
    <li> Have seen some results in a two week period.  Not as great as I read on line though. But worth the try.</li>
    <li> Ordered this with some hesitation but for the price, thought what the heck.  Within a weak had completely cleared some adult acne that the dermotolgist said would need some cutting. Definitly smoothes the complexation and reduces pore size.  The reproted stinging is not really noticable and goes away in seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to order some additional products from this company and emailed with  questions. There is no phone number for customer service on their website.  I&#x27;ve emailed twice and have not recieved a response. One of the reasons I ordered this product on Amazon were the positive comments about their customer service.  So far, I haven&#x27;t experienced that.</li>
    <li> Two things that I love about this product&lt;br /&gt;1- it smells amazing - I know this is a personal preference and it might not appeal to everyone&lt;br /&gt;2- after a couple of applications (every morning as mentioned on the bottle ) my skin is extremely smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> just felt like it was only water and unlike other products, didn&#x27;t see any results but there were agreeable to return the product.</li>
    <li> Really like this product , does not dry out like some vitamin C and like the fact it is made fresh before shipping, will buy again</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like it. My acne didn&#x27;t go away, but overall my face looks so much better. Really helped even out complexion issues. At first my face went quite red, but I added in coconut oil to moisturize after applying this product, and within a day my skin looked the best I&#x27;ve seen it in years.&lt;br /&gt;Only comment is that they make it fresh for you because it does go bad! There is a note on the product that it should not be used once it turns amber. It starts out totally clear, and slowly turns yellow. My first bottle lasted me about 3 months, and was medium yellow by the time I finished it. My second bottle started out lightly yellow already, and so far so good about 6 weeks later. I haven&#x27;t opened the 3rd bottle (I bought them buy 2, get 3rd free) but I&#x27;m a bit worried it might not last long enough (mind you that&#x27;s still going to be about 6 mos from the time I bought it).&lt;br /&gt;SO, if you aren&#x27;t going to be using a ton of the stuff, buy it one bottle at a time, so it stays fresh.</li>
    <li> I heard that only vitamin c ester would work through the skin. Although this is not an ester, it is working somehow. It is clearing up my acne that I think has been caused by products with dimethicone...it is in everything! It has also made my skin radiant and smooth. I have used it morning and night for a week and already see results! Love that its made fresh to order!</li>
    <li> Ive bought this product twice now and absolutely love it! It had helped diminish little red veins in my cheeks and brightened my skin&#x27;s overall appearance. I use it in conjunction with am ultra rich moisturizer and could not be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> This is the only C serum I&#x27;ve found on Amazon with a low ph and pure ascorbic acid; both of which are needed to produce the collagen producing effects seen in clinical studies of C serums.  If you buy a C Serum and don&#x27;t feel a slight stinging/burning sensation upon application, it is most likely not going to give you the results seen in published, placebo controlled trials.</li>
    <li> It appears to help my skin appear fresher</li>
    <li> Great product! Use carefully!</li>
    <li> Love it this product, I use it in all of my hair product is good for your hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This C20 is like water versus an oily base.  Exactly as described.  Love the purity of it. I use per the directions on my face, neck and chest.</li>
    <li> I initally bought this with skeptisism.  I used to use skincuticils at 120$ a bottle.  It smelled so bad I threw it out.  Because of the basic properties of vit c I thought  I would give this a try.  It is as effective as the high end brand without the smell.  However the consistancy is watery so you have to be quick in applying.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month and love the fact that it is fresh and that it is priced well.  I have used other Vit. C products, but love the purity of this product.  I will continue to order this.  Thank you NuFountain.</li>
    <li> and here are the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Vitamin C is soluble in aqueous solution (ie. water)&lt;br /&gt;(2) Vitamin C is known to be most effectively absorbed to skin at a slightly acidic condition - it makes it uncharged so that it can cross the skin barrier.&lt;br /&gt;(3) The highest absorption efficacy was observed at 20%.  30% do not improve the absorption level.&lt;br /&gt;(4) This is absolutely clear when you first receive it, but turns yellowish as you use them - which indicates the freshness of the product.  The color indicates vitamin C is being oxidized, and oxidized ascorbate is not the one you wanna apply to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. so given all these, why would anyone want other unnecessary chemicals like glycerol in the vitamin C serum?  Of course it&#x27;s like water because because that is the ideal solvent.  Of course it stinks a bit if you have a micro-size open wound because it has to be slightly acidic (It&#x27;s ascorbic acid).  You&#x27;re waisting money if you&#x27;re using yellow/brownish gooey serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh another plus: super fast shipping :)</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is an essential ingredient in your daily regimen. It is simply the best antioxidant, keeping your face younger when you it religiously. Unfortunately, many (expensive) serums sold in markets are deficient; they only put few vitamin C in an ingredient list, which is practically ineffective. Ascorbic acid in this serum, which is the most effective form of vitamin C, beautifully delivers what it claimed. NuFountain knows its downside well; it is very sensitive to light and oxygen, so that they made it fresh to keep its capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3-for-2 and kept unused bottles in the fridge away from light and temperature. They lasted 3 months; one bottle per month. I strictly applied it everyday, day and night. This is the golden rule for using any skin care; you can&#x27;t expect a result right after few uses. Personally, I do not evaluate skin care products until eighth week of continuous usage. No miracle overnight product in the world! For this serum I can see the result when starting using the second bottle. Skin texture was more smooth and refined. Skin tone was more even and brighter. Acne spots, which are the most difficult problem to tackle for my skin, keep fading and almost gone after finish the third bottle. I use vitamin C with BHA exfoliant and they perfectly worked together to reduce enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is effective, did what it claimed, and, most importantly, affordable.</li>
    <li> This is nothing against the product&#x27;s quality, actually the way my skin reacted it must mean that it&#x27;s a good, concentrated high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to a lot of personal dealings, I was not able to take care of myself very well for 2 years. When it came time to start taking care of myself again I found that I forgot or had no idea where to start with skin care. I am older than I was when I was a teenager so I couldn&#x27;t revert back to that routine. So I got this to help with making my skin brighter. It worked too well. I used it twice and I could feel it stinging (not too bad) and from reading some of the other reviewers, I took as it was working. I had to stop using it because my skin reacted adversely to it which means I just have sensitive skin, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that this may not be a good review and it sucks that I never got to see if it really worked. But I am envious of some of those tougher skinned ladies out there that are able to to use this product and see results. If you got the skin, I would try it out and see. But be cautious sensitive skin people.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of vitamin c serums and this is just water! No color no smell and the product was not sticky at all its vitamin c it should be kinda sticky and have a slight yellow color it clear and just water.... Don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
    <li> bought this because I saw on Dr. Oz, don&#x27;t see the visible results</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY works on hyperpigmentation but it makes me break out, so I really don&#x27;t know how much longer I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a double edged sword. :\</li>
    <li> Я  очень вам благодарна за ваш продукт , это такое хорошее средство для моего лица , после его нанесения , моё лицо  просто великолепно выглядит !!!</li>
    <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found a Vit C  Serum thats not greasy!  I&#x27;ve used Obagi for ages and every night I have to wait around for it to dry enough so it won&#x27;t stick to the pillow.  I had to use it a night because it was so thick and heavy that it felt slimy under my make up.  This on the other hand goes on with no greasy feeling, it sinks right in.  The tingle tells me it&#x27;s the real deal.  I&#x27;m super happy after just one application.  So happy with the price too.  I&#x27;ll be taking advantage of the special deal for sure!</li>
    <li> been using this product for about 3 weeks age spots have faded a little will try one more bottle no difference in wrinkles</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a big surprise for me. after more than 5 weeks that i use this serum twice a day, first 2 weeks, it looked better, the dark spots faded away a little bit, and then stopped, nothing happened after that. i&#x27;m still using it everyday even i have not seen any progress on my face anymore. i would like to see until i finish this bottle what will happen, so i can post the last result. so far i&#x27;m still wishing that this serum might have the little miracle on my face.</li>
    <li> Could not tell it did anything for me.</li>
    <li> I have been trying many many things over the years to erase sun damage and the beginings of fine wrinkles. ONLY a few fine wrinkles I might add. I have read dozens and dozens of books on vitamins and beauty regimes. Vitamin C is the key factor in health inside and out. After 6 weeks of using this my face is smooth and creamy and the pigmintation is perfect. Also it tightens everything up and has smoothed out any fine lines I have. Its alo a key number ONE factor to use after a chemical peel to help with healing and discoloration. Yes it stings for the first few uses and it might even make you peel a tiny bit, but thats a good thing. We have 20 layers of dead skin on our faces and products cant get through unless you exfoliate, plus this helps with collagen production and a semi bleaching of freckles etc. I use it on my arms, chest, neck and face. I encouraged my mother to start using it and she has never looked back. This company packages the product the way vitamin C should be packaged, in a glass BOTTLE! Do not buy vitamin C products in a jar or mixed with other junk. The C breaks down fast. I also love this company mixing fresh when ordered and shipping is very fast. A little goes a long way and there is plenty in each bottle to cover everything for about 3-4 weeks, however in my opinion with everything I have read and my expeirence vitamin C must be used within 3 weeks and kept in a dark room tempature place. This Serum is better than any over the counter product, department store and even better than Retin-A. I have erased 15 years off my face with peels and this Vitamin C. People guess me to be 25 and I have been 37 for many birthdays now. So people do research about Vitamin C and products and you will come straight back to this company, and yes I have tried other brands, and none have compared. I do not work for this company, I am just a house wife trying to look younger so I can get a divorce and find another man with a bigger bank account. I like to be fully honest with all my reviews :)</li>
    <li> Been using for a few weeks and have noticed nothing except dryness.  It may be too soon to rate this product.</li>
    <li> I can tell a huge difference in my skin. This is my first time ordering and won&#x27;t be my last. I hope it&#x27;s working just as well on my fine lines as it is on my pimples! My face is so clear now. FYI I also use bare minerals intensive glow pads at night and take an acai pill/supplement everyday.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this product a few weeks ago and I can already see results.  My olive complexion tends to scar and hyperpigment very easily.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face, my discolorations have definitely faded rapidly.  And bonus, I ordered 2 bottles and got one free...yeah!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about two weeks, and am already receiving compliments on my skin! It looks brighter and overall much healthier, and my dark spots and scars are fading significantly! I also love that the date it was made is actually hand-written on the bottle. Thank you, NuFountain!</li>
    <li> not as expected - would not recommend this product to anyone.  Sorry I spent the money - won&#x27;t do it again</li>
    <li> I ordered this from another seller on ebay and itt was 30% and it seems much better than this item. The consistency of this serum was nothing like the consistency of the 30% serum and the 30% seems like it works much better and has more vitamin c.</li>
    <li> I love that this has no fragrance, it&#x27;s great under makeup and makes my skin feel good.  I will buy again.  I store it in the fridge to keep it longer.</li>
    <li> The best thing about the serum is that it is made to order, so you get a fresh product and if you follow the directions for application you will get the most benefit and the bottle will last you for about a month.  The price is great for &amp;#34;made to order&amp;#34; product and the best part for me was that the serum was OIL FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fair and sensitive skin, however the 20% concentration is just right - the serum has a tingling sensation once applied, but does not irritate my skin.  However, I cannot wear it all day - I apply it in the morning after I wash my face and wear it for about 45 minutes and wash off before I apply the makeup.  I tried wearing it all day under the makeup and my skin got irritated.  So the best thing is to use your own judgement and experiment.  But once you find the best way to get the benefits, you will be very happy with it, as it is a powerful anti oxidant and makes skin look very radiant.</li>
    <li> Use this along with Life Extension Skin Restoring Phytoceramides with Lipowheat and my skin is better.  Takes a couple of months to see the change but I like the changes I see in my skin.</li>
    <li> I used a different product in a blue bottle that I liked better, it was thicker than this one and I used it for 3 months and notices I showed to sign of acne.  This product is very watery and I had a few break outs in the past two months of using.  I purchased this product to lighten my past acne spots on my jaw line and they have reduced somewhat but not completely.  however I have been putting it on the tops of my hands and the marks on my hands are almost completely gone so I would say it works great on Age spots but so so on Acne spots.</li>
