<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works really well! Only some irritation from the fiber lashes, but that is closer to bed time and is easily fixed by washing my face. I definitely love it and can&#x27;t wait to use it for going downtown with a fierce look!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic mascara! I really love how long and delicate it makes my lashes. A really great product with very pretty packaging too. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Packaging and easy step by step directions. I used my usual facial cleanser and had no problem with removing.  I&#x27;m amazed at the results and will be a repeat buyer!!</li>
    <li> The quality of this mascara is outstanding! It really makes my lashes look bigger and more full. I also love that it comes in such pretty and elegant packaging so it would make a great gift for any occasion!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS....JUST WISH IT WAS WATERPROOF...BUT ID BUY IT AGAIN !</li>
    <li> Delivery as promised. The product is okay, the fiber seems to be very little and it&#x27;s not as full as stated. Since I&#x27;ve purchase I just will continue to use until all gone.</li>
    <li> This works great and gives me the best eyelashes ever!  A tip is to apply the fiber coating only on the top half of the lashes and not all the way at the base.  It is a little harder to remove, but worth the results.  You can also end with a coat of your regular mascara if you want.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have inherited my mother&#x27;s eyelashes, I hardly have any. My mother used to have hers put on 1 lash at a time. This was in the 70&#x27;s. For years I didn&#x27;t wear mascara because I didn&#x27;t want to lose even more lashes washing off the mascara, lashes always came off too. I saw this product and was amazed. I went and watched several u tube videos of this 3D mascara. Found several to choose f tom on Amazon, &amp; chose Ultra beauty essentials. I&#x27;m in love, I finally have long thick beautiful lashes. I&#x27;m buying my daughter some for her to try, but she already has long lashes. She tried mine, wow, gorgeous.  Several people complemented me on my makeup last nite. I&#x27;ll definitely be a long time customer. Love it, I finally have beautiful long thick lashes</li>
    <li> I found the product very very dry and difficult to apply. Fibers are very irritating to the eye.  Would NOT recommend product.  Could be that I have very short lashes????</li>
    <li> Amazing. I never write reviews. Ordering another for myself and my sister as a gift. This is one of those things, that once you try, you can&#x27;t live without! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I never thought about trying a 3D fiber lash mascara before, but I am so happy I had the opportunity to try this product. Before I used the mascara, I watched a few tutorials to make sure I knew how to put it on. It was my first time ever trying fiber mascara and I didn&#x27;t want to mess it up. When I put it on, I immediately fell in love and I&#x27;m already addicted. I only used one coat and it made a dramatic difference, so be careful with how much you put on. It&#x27;s definitely more for an evening look. Also, many people said to put a coat of plain mascara on first before using this mascara, but I found that it works better when I started with my natural eyelashes. I made sure to follow the directions exactly. I did not let the magnifying gel dry before putting on the fibers, and I immediately put on another coat of the gel after applying the fibers to secure them in place. I also used a lash comb to separate my lashes after applying the mascara to avoid a clumpy look. I didn&#x27;t have any fibers fall loose onto my face all day or night. It&#x27;s also easy to take off. I just used baby oil and the fibers washed off with no hassle. After trying it for the first time, I received multiple compliments on how amazing my eyes looked. Someone even purchased a set for them self right away. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to those looking for a fiber lash mascara. I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the picture, the top photo is with no mascara at all, the middle photo is with one coat of my regular mascara, and the bottom photo is with only one coat of the 3D fiber lash mascara (only used on top lashes, not bottom). &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
    <li> Love it! I do not have to mess with fake eyelashes anymore!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It works great and I have really short lashes.  I have tried other brands and find this one to be the best!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. All I hoped for and more</li>
    <li> Makes even the most pathetic eye lashes look fantastic (like mine). You do have to watch a few hours after applying some of the fibers will be all over your cheeks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!! I don&#x27;t know why I have never gotten this before now!! My lashes look amazing and they are mine, not falsie.  I have gotten many compliments on it!  It is so easy to apply and it last all day long!! It doesn&#x27;t clump and it doesn&#x27;t irritate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy to use, you first apply the transfer gel onto your eyelash and right after you will apply your fibers.  After you have done that, you apply another coat of your transfer gel.  You can repeat those steps as many times as you like.  This does make your lashes longer and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about purchasing this item, let me assure you that you want to and you will love it as much as I have!!!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> Very good look, once you practice a bit.  It helps to have a mascara brush to further define the look.  Lasts a few days.  I will buy again</li>
    <li> It works great,for me my lashes are small and when i used the 3d fiber lashes it made a big difference and i would recommend to anyone who wants to have long beautiful eye lashes</li>
    <li> flakes more than other brands but if you can handle a few flakes it works just as well as other expensive brands</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. My lashes didn&#x27;t look any fuller or longer than when I use a good mascara.&lt;br /&gt;also, found it to be a little messy. sometimes flakes drop onto your face while applying.</li>
    <li> The product is like went  false eyelashes, I like it because it is easy to use, and easy to remove with eye make up remover.&lt;br /&gt;the box is like a treasure box, fancy and elegant.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff works pretty good! My complaints are that I don&#x27;t prefer the brush, and I use my younique fiber lash brush instead. The mascara itself is good, a little runny but after the third day I like it. The fiberlashes are not near the same quality as Younique&#x27;s, and they don&#x27;t seem to really come off the wand! This stuff is good enough to use though if I ever can&#x27;t get my hands on Younique 3d fiberlashes. The packaging was adorable! &amp; I love the price of this compared to other brands! Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Exquisite eye mascara is a good product. I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes look thicker, darker and somewhat longer.&lt;br /&gt;I do however wish it didn&#x27;t clump my lashes together so much, maybe it should come with a lash brush.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara set! I have always wanted to try 3D lashes, but found other brands to be really expensive. I found Esquisite Eye 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara at a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;The presentation of this mascara set is absolutely gorgeous and luxurious. The little blue box has a compartment for the magnifying gel and the fiber lashes. The magnifying gel container is bigger than a regular mascara bottle and the fiber lash bottle is a little smaller. I used the instructions for my first application. It suggests to use your regular mascara and then immediately apply the magnifying gel and the fiber lashes. Repeat the application of magnifying gel and fiber lashes until you get the intended results. Do the same process with the other eye.&lt;br /&gt;My results were amazing! My lashes look longer and full. The mascara stayed on the whole day with no other applications needed. I suggest wiping under the yes after applying the gel and fiber lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. And at a fraction of the price, it does exactly as intended.</li>
    <li> YAY! Here&#x27;s a mascara that I don&#x27;t have to order when a friend has a &amp;#34;party&amp;#34; or buy at the mall when there&#x27;s a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; with purchase &amp; one that has the reliability of applying it once in the morning &amp; knowing that all day I&#x27;m covered! Being able to have fuller, thicker without the time consuming efforts of using false lashes - trying to put the adhesive on then apply them to the lash line before the adhesive dries then worrying about getting through the night without losing one!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been offered the opportunity to use this product and share my experience &amp; personal opinion and couldn&#x27;t be happier to have been selected because with the reduced investment to obtain the first set I&#x27;ll be able to quickly order another!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this amazingness in a tube to ladies looking for a look that can go from the office to dinner, for ladies that want to make a statement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent years trying out so many different mascaras looking for something that would dramatically add length and volume. I never used anything like this, with fiber lashes, and I think I found what I&#x27;ve been looking for. This is somewhat easy to apply at first but gets easier with time and practice. You have to apply the fiber lashes very quickly after the gel to get the best results. The fiber lashes can get a little annoying  when applying because they fall off the brush onto your face but it&#x27;s nothing a quick swipe cant get rid of. I love the length this adds, it&#x27;s very noticeable and makes a huge difference, It actually kind of looks and feels like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, but they feel more natural. This darkens and lengthens my lashes and adds a little bit of volume. Little fibers kept falling into my eyes about 10 minutes after applying it, but it wasn&#x27;t irritating or blurring my eyes, I could just feel the little fuzz. They last and look great all day, even after driving in the car with all the windows down. This was much easier to wash off than I expected, which was great. I didn&#x27;t have to keep rubbing my eyes with water to get it off like I have to do with other mascaras. Overall, I really loved this and I would recommend it to anyone (unless you wear contacts), it does a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness do I love this product. Has the most amazing package in the world. Very well made tube and mascara. It really does make your eye lashes look like you are wearing false eye lashes but more natural. I have always wanted my eye lashes to look like I was wearing false eye lashes but I was so worried to put that glue near my eyes and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about it because now I have found this amazing product and my eye lashes will always look amazing all year long. I want to thank you Ultra Beauty for this amazing product and for giving me a discount on this product for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a 3D mascara before and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. My girlfriends have been telling me about it for a while so I was really excited when I got presented with a chance to get this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes. This mascara is just fabulous! It makes my lashes so much longer and fuller! I have blonde short lashes, so this mascara works wonders for me. The fibers are very easy to remove once you are done. It comes packaged in an exquisite looking box so it would be a perfect gift for a special lady in your life. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I will buy this product again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Okay.......I&#x27;ve had Younique Moonstruck lashes since January and love them.  I was overconfident and decided to venture out and try these fiber lashes.  No comparison.  I&#x27;m going back to Younique.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the price difference for me.  As for this brand, the lashes are barely visible, they shed, and they cause irritation to my eyes.  The box is cute.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This gave me long beautiful lashes. I hate wearing false eyelashes and thanks to this fiber mascara i never have to now. I think it works better than Yonique mascara. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I did not like this mascara. It worked awesome the first 5-7 applications and then it just didn&#x27;t anymore. I contacted the company and tried their suggestions but nothing helped. Very disappointed, I wish this product lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I didnt feel like this was any better than a thick mascara.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, definitely lengthens and thickens the appearance of the lashes!</li>
    <li> I love this mascaraI I was completely shocked at how well it worked. I have never had much for lashes and a medical condition made them even thinner. I followed the instructions and put a coat of my regular mascara on first. Then I put 2 coats of the 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara. The removal was also very easy. I have sensitive eyes and this mascara did not irritate them at all. I am so pleased. The 2 photos are my before and after pictures. I will be recommending this to all my friends. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this product until I read the reviews… The reviews seemed to similar and I noticed they reviewed a lot of the same products. Could be legit but I feel its not true reviews.</li>
    <li> The mascara itself helps your lash get volumize, while the the other just don&#x27;t help at all, and oh the fibers fall out ...</li>
    <li> Smelled very like chemicals, came off easily.</li>
    <li> I bought these and I was skeptical. I absolutely love this mascara. It&#x27;s super easy to use and it lasts all day. I never get any flaking in my eyes or anything. I will defiantly purchase against.</li>
    <li> great product, creates nice looking lashes that look natural not fake.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light feeling. It&#x27;s takes a few coats for the way I like my mascara but worth the time n effort</li>
    <li> I really liked this Product.Loved it, very high quality for the price.I got for a really good price  .It was so pretty .The box was so elegant.It reminded me of something that came from Tiffany&#x27;s it looked very high end the box was gorgeous I love the little white satin ribbon that was on it and then when I opened up the box I was even more pleased because of  the inside of it ,and the mascara came  in like a metal container it wasn&#x27;t plastic it didn&#x27;t look cheap or anything like that so I was very pleased I would definitely buy this again and I would highly recommend it to someone because it is quality and I got this for a good price I definitely know for sure. It was worth way more than what I paid for the seller over this should be very pleased because this is really a good product thank you</li>
    <li> I have never used fibers before and to be honest I was not sure if I was doing it right but after I got done with my first eye I was very happy with the results. I must start off by saying you get everything as pictured and the packaging is so pretty and elegant. I like that the back of package has instructions as well as a insert inside the package.  Both products are a nice size and I think I will get a lot of uses out of it. I did follow the directions when using the product as I&#x27;m not familiar with fiber lashes so I wanted to ensure I had a good result the first time I used it and I did. I would recommend not putting the fibers to close to your lash line so you don&#x27;t cause any possible irritation but other than that the product is great.  In the picture I attached I used one coat of regular mascara and then I used the fiber lash mascara.  No other products are on my eyes other than what&#x27;s listed and I believe I got great results. I received a discount to try and review this product,  the opinions listed are my own honest feedback.</li>
    <li> Really liked the added body to my own lashes.  Three step process to apply, but very easy.  Washed well with regular face soap.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe how great this works! My eyelashes have never been sexier! Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara since I have seen different brands.I was finally offered an opportunity to try these 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara for my honest feedback about it.So far I am absolutely loving the results.I can make my eyelashes look more fuller or I can make them look more natural if I wanted to.I really love the packaging when I seen it for the first time.It looks beautiful and of high quality.The tubes are beautiful as well it is silver and sleek.This can definitely be gifted to one of your girlfriends if you wanted to.I love the look it gives my eyelashes a  more fuller and lengthier look.I love that this set is build able, so if I was looking for a more full lengthy look I can coat it up to 3 times with the 3D Lash after I apply a regular coat of mascara.It says in the manual you can use a regular coat of mascara prior to using this set which I did try and they gave my lashes a more full defined bolder look.I also tried this with nothing but the 3D Fiber Lash only using one coat and nothing else and I love the results.It gave me a natural lengthier  defined look.You can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing any Mascara.Great product!The one con I would say is you have to work on one eye at a time because the gel can dry pretty quickly and if you do not, when you go apply the fibers it will not stick.They suggest keeping both open and easy to access for quick application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you end up buying this I would definitely keep a small mirror in hand and unscrew both tubes from the 3D Lash kit and keep them all in the same hand.You can have both ready to apply quickly.I just hold the small compact mirror and both tubes in the same hand held by my pinky and ring finger.It sounds awkward but very easy to do &amp; every things at the tips of your fingers ready to go.All you do is pull out the applicator tip to apply and switch in between the gel &amp; fiber applicator.Easy peasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I noticed is fall out when applying more than one coat.When I was using 3 coats on top of my 1 coat of regular mascara I had some fall out.So make sure you brush that off before heading out.Overall I am very happy with this set it definitely helps lengthen and add definition to my lashes, beautiful packaging, &amp; great product.I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you are in the market for a 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.than one coat.When I was using 3 coats on top of my 1 coat of regular mascara I had some fall out.So make sure you brush that off before heading out.Overall I am very happy with this set it definitely helps lengthen and add definition to my lashes, beautiful packaging, &amp; great product.I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you are in the market for a 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.</li>
    <li> I have some experience with fiber lashes so I wasn&#x27;t a completely noob. The concept is easy after you use it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand doesn&#x27;t mention using it on top of your regular mascara so make sure you read the instructions. You should start with one eye at a time so that the gel doesn&#x27;t dry before you get the fibers on. I do a quick a liberal coating of gel applying it just like my regular mascara and making sure that I get every lash from bottom to top. I quickly swipe the 3-d fiber over the gel focusing mainly on the tips for extra length. I do this for both eyes and then wait about 45 seconds before applying my second coat so my lashes have time to dry and won&#x27;t clump together. For my second layer, I focus on the tips of my lashes and do the same process as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried any brand of 3-d fiber lashes that didn&#x27;t have a little fallout. These are no different and no more than the usual fall onto my cheeks. It is a minor problem that is easy fixed by dabbing a cotton pad under my eyes to pick them up. The end look is fantastic and well worth the extra time and patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is after one coat! You can definitely tell a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> This is not my first 3D Fiber Mascara experience...I&#x27;ve tried one other.  When I was younger I had long lashes and was always complimented on them.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my lashes have either gotten shorter or lost their pigmentation because I don&#x27;t get compliments anymore.  (Poor me! ha!)  I use a lot of mascara and I curl my lashes, but still my lashes do not stand out by any means.  I have found with the other fiber lash mascara and with this one, I just don&#x27;t get the results that some people get so...MAYBE IT&#x27;S JUST ME!  This product is good.  The color is good, I did not experience fall out during the day (of the fibers onto my face), it did lengthen my lashes (just not as much as I had hoped), but I still felt the need to either reapply or get out my lash curler a couple of hours after using it.  My main complaint with this type of mascara is that it takes longer to put it on.  However, you do get results with it and for some people it looks great!  For others, like me...it looks good.

    <li> When I first bought this item it was dry. The seller contacted me immediately and sent me a new one!  The product is awesome and it makes my eye lashes look like I have falsies!! Easy to put on and looks awesome. The seller was very helpful and she thinks about her customers. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Back when, when I was 30 years younger I was blessed with Hispanic thick dark sultry long eyelashes. Not sure how eyelashes suddenly become less long and lush...I&#x27;ve tried every promised mascara on the market, and was happy with Benefits They&#x27;re Real, but taking it off I think took most of my eyelashes off. Then I came upon Exquisite Eyes 3D. OMG, I no longer wake up looking like the alien from E.T.  So I am no longer E.T, but E.E 3D! My husband even mentioned I look happier..whatever that means, but just him telling me that made me happier! So now I&#x27;m a  better and happier wife! Now when I&#x27;m out and about and see women with tired eyes, I want to pull out my E.E. 3D and give them an eye makeover!</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply and use. It takes a little longer because of the two products you need to apply and the extra steps to achieve the look you want, though. The first step is some sort of mascara gel. You have to use that step before you can use the second step. You have to apply the second tube, which are the fibers immediately after using the first tube. You then can do all the steps over again to get more fibers to stick to your eyelashes. The fiber tube is dry so you must apply it quickly after applying the mascara gel. Do one eye completely before doing the second eye. I wish this came with a dry eyelash brush for when I am completely done with all the steps. My eyelashes started to clump but if you have, an eyelash brush than you can fix that problem and your eyelashes will look beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried any sort of fiber mascara before so I was thrilled to buy this at a discount. It comes with good instructions, which I really appreciated. The instructions say you can apply your regular mascara first, if you want too, so I tried that. I liked the results better this way. I also could then see the added length from the fibers. The fibers do seem to fall down onto your face as the day goes on though. You will get little flexes but they are so tiny it really wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. I wish the fibers were not so dry though but I guess that is why it comes with a gel that you&#x27;re supposed to apply first.  I love the packaging and the box this comes in. It&#x27;s so cute and it feels like the box has a magnet closure, which is really nice. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Exquisite Eyes 3D Fiber Lashes!!!!! I tried so hard to take a picture of my lashes &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; but I could not capture the true effects of how awesome my lashes were after using Exquisite eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I thought for sure I was going to screw up during the 3 step application but I didn&#x27;t! You must do one eye at a time and I applied two applications. Cleaning my eyelashes afterwards were just as easy. There was no drying or clumping. I didn&#x27;t even pull any lashes out while wiping the mascara away. I am hooked for life!!!&lt;br /&gt;Magnifying gel mascara and fibers came in a tube, respectfully. They were neatly placed in a beautiful Tiffany blue box with a pretty bow on it.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
    <li> It was really fun to use Exquisite Eyes 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara.  My lashes looked longer and definitely fuller.  My eyes really popped using this mascara.  It wasn&#x27;t hard to apply and it was easy to take off.  It didn&#x27;t run like my other regular mascara tends to do.  I really like the look of my lashes now.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
    <li> I found my new event mascara!  This stuff works awesome and doesn&#x27;t look like fake, because it&#x27;s only adding onto your actual eyelashes.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I can tell when women are wearing fake eyelashes, and it&#x27;s not always flattering.  This mascara is awesome.  Use as directed.  I apply a coat of my favorite mascara first and let it dry.  Then, I apply each step a couple of times until I think I have enough length.  Make sure to apply step 2 immediately after step 1 for best results.  I just open them both and keep them ready in my hand for a fast switch.  It is easy to remove (just like any water resistant mascara).  If I had any complaint, it&#x27;s that I manage to get the fibers in my eye, but they don&#x27;t burn, and they are easy to blow off.  I am so glad I stumbled on this product! :)</li>
