### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great enhancer for eyes!</li>
      <li>This kohl eyeliner is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>Great eye contact!  </li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner I have ever had.  </li>
      <li>perfect kohl,perfect color and love the defining powder idea</li>
      <li>This applicator tip is awesome, retains its shape and would be easy for beginners I think.</li>
      <li>The pigmentation is good, also would suggest trying the eyeshadows from L&#x27;Oreal</li>
      <li>LOREAL sellls good stuff,</li>
      <li>I really love powdered Kohl eyeliner!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>It comes off easily with eye make- up remover or in my case coconut oil, and it creates a great exotic look.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>color is more like a graffiti</li>
      <li>I love the teal color and the ease of putting it on with the pointed wand.</li>
      <li>Okay so the reason i gave this 5 stars is because of the finished work i do with it.</li>
      <li>I got this thinking it would be more like a liquid liner.  </li>
      <li>I have gotten so many compliments when I use it.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure</li>
      <li>Just make sure your lashes aren&#x27;t in the way.  </li>
      <li>I apply it under my eyelashes on the top and then slide it across the inside of my lower lashes.</li>
      <li>Rich colour with easy to apply and smudge, a bit powdery in consistency though.</li>
      <li>Perfect for everyday, no matter</li>
      <li>Have discovered that once I apply, I need to clean the applicator off before storing it away or reapplying.  </li>
      <li>Just like the real stuff, over the day the kohl collects in the corner of the eye; it&#x27;s easily removed with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This eye liner is different but pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is easy and fast to apply and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>But there is a very, very high percentage of lead in real kohl, and most of us want to hang on to</li>
      <li>so worth it&lt;</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a buy.</li>
      <li>everyone safe your money and buy this product at its original price, where it is not hoopfully locked away in some cupboard waiting to be discarded and then suddenly put up for sale.</li>
      <li>so I just push it back against the inside of the top before I take it out.</li>
      <li>The powder of this product makes it so very much more natural and professional looking than waxy pens.</li>
      <li>It worked fine the first two times i used it, after that the tip got bent putting it back into the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I have blue eyes, this is a great accent for daytime wear without being too dark.</li>
      <li>Not a big deal, I can brush it off easily</li>
      <li>If you are thinking a bout saving plenty dollars, watchout, it could be that the product may not be of very high quality, or expired even though not</li>
      <li>Glides on smooth, last all day!</li>
      <li>That being said i have used real kohl, its called surma in somecountries, and my mom always said to put vasaline on the tip and it will be easier to handle.</li>
      <li>make sure you use this before applying you consealor or blush because you will get dark purple powder all over your cheeks.  </li>
      <li>Then if you have a little patch that needs more color just use the tip like you would a pencil.</li>
      <li>It takes some practice to use powder, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s worth dealing with blue powder on your face.  </li>
      <li>I also have the burgundy color which I like but would probably be more flattering on brown or green eyes.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not really blue as it looks more black really.</li>
      <li>It was a dry eyeline, nice color but inadequate and messy.</li>
      <li>and clear..</li>
      <li>/&gt;L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s HiP Kohl Liner is much safer and is applied the same way!</li>
      <li>this is a POWDER eyeliner and not a dried out tube of liquid liner.</li>
      <li>It is just messy and cheap and would not buy again.</li>
      <li>Open your eye and rimming is complete!</li>
      <li>Even though the color is nice the quality of the product is very poor.</li>
      <li>That being said, a loose powder does sprinkle a little bit down my face if applying using a drawing motion but easily wipes away.</li>

<li> That being said, a loose powder does sprinkle a little bit down my face if applying using a drawing motion but easily wipes away.</li>
<li> Real kohl is applied to the wet rim of your eyelids, laying the stick along the rim of your lower lid at one corner, closing your eye, and drawing the stick along to the other corner.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find at a reasonable price, but thankfully Loreal makes it.</li>
<li> I am a middle aged woman.  </li>
<li> Bacteria will grow inside the powder &amp; cause discomfort OR potentially give you an eye fungus, if you are not careful (learned the hard way).  </li>
<li> I do not use this is in my waterline because I just feel a little iffy about putting loose type powder in this area, so I use this on my upper and lower lash line.</li>
<li> wish the bottle was a little bigger</li>
<li> I do not like the applicator to rough for an eyelid.</li>
<li> Careful not to get it into your eyes when applying.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; of if is hard to get off, and a thick line, leaves you cleaning your upper eyelid constantly.</li>
<li> Unscrew the applicator, withdraw it slowly and tap the excess powder back into the vial.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelmingly black and not colorfully glittery.</li>
<li> Every time i pull the stick out now it pulls messy dark purple powder out and it gets everywhere.  </li>
<li> It is a powder and a messy one at that.  </li>
<li> : I blink a few times to settle the powder, and then put on my under eye makeup as usual.</li>
<li> And its hard to apply.</li>
<li> I am not sure if they sent me the wrong color if it is just a bad description of what the color is.</li>
<li> horrible stuff!</li>
<li> Terrible !</li>
<li> the worst make up I have ever used in my life!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelmingly black and not colorfully glittery. Perfect for everyday, no matter what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never go without it.</li>
    <li> They should market this as an eyeshadow, not liner.</li>
    <li> It applies with ease, but I made the assumption that it would \\&quot;dry\\&quot; no it doesn&#x27;t, and therefore smears all over.  The \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; of if is hard to get off, and a thick line, leaves you cleaning your upper eyelid constantly.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever had.  I love the teal color and the ease of putting it on with the pointed wand. The powder of this product makes it so very much more natural and professional looking than waxy pens.</li>
    <li> I do not like the applicator to rough for an eyelid. Will not order again or suggest to anyone to order.</li>
    <li> Real kohl is applied to the wet rim of your eyelids, laying the stick along the rim of your lower lid at one corner, closing your eye, and drawing the stick along to the other corner. Open your eye and rimming is complete! But there is a very, very high percentage of lead in real kohl, and most of us want to hang on to what intelligence we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s HiP Kohl Liner is much safer and is applied the same way! Unscrew the applicator, withdraw it slowly and tap the excess powder back into the vial. Apply as above. It looks -so- good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I blink a few times to settle the powder, and then put on my under eye makeup as usual. Just like the real stuff, over the day the kohl collects in the corner of the eye; it&#x27;s easily removed with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My faves are navy and teal; the gold and burgundy have glitter but not enough intensity for my look.</li>
    <li> Have discovered that once I apply, I need to clean the applicator off before storing it away or reapplying.  Bacteria will grow inside the powder &amp; cause discomfort OR potentially give you an eye fungus, if you are not careful (learned the hard way).  One bottle lasts me about 4 months of daily use.  Never want to be without it.  Great eye contact!  People always look me in the eye when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Okay so the reason i gave this 5 stars is because of the finished work i do with it. That being said i have used real kohl, its called surma in somecountries, and my mom always said to put vasaline on the tip and it will be easier to handle. I have done the same thing with the loreal one and there is no lose powder, and it works almost like liquid liner,try it it works.</li>
    <li> The navy color wasnt that obvious. And its hard to apply. It sometimes gets in my eyes and the color also falls on my cheeks while I am trying to apply it. It doesnt seem to last either.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is different but pretty good. It&#x27;s like liquid eye liner but in powder form. It is easy and fast to apply and stays on all day. I can&#x27;t argue about that.  The only problem I see is that since it is powder, when I apply it, powder falls on my cheeks.  Not a big deal, I can brush it off easily but I thought I would mention it.</li>
    <li> This kohl eyeliner is wonderful. I am a middle aged woman.  I apply it under my eyelashes on the top and then slide it across the inside of my lower lashes. I have gotten so many compliments when I use it.  It looks like I had plastic surgery on my eyes.  Very happy with this purchase.  The end of the tip did curl so I just push it back against the inside of the top before I take it out.</li>
    <li> Love it but it&#x27;s not really blue as it looks more black really. kinda dissappointed</li>
    <li> perfect kohl,perfect color and love the defining powder idea&lt;br /&gt;sharp and clear..so worth it&lt;br /&gt;yet wish the bottle was a little bigger</li>
    <li> The tip was bent and it leaves shavings on the fce.  It was a dry eyeline, nice color but inadequate and messy.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it would be more like a liquid liner.  It is a powder and a messy one at that.  The color was not correct. I am not sure if they sent me the wrong color if it is just a bad description of what the color is. It worked fine the first two times i used it, after that the tip got bent putting it back into the bottle.  Every time i pull the stick out now it pulls messy dark purple powder out and it gets everywhere.  The same goes for putting it on. make sure you use this before applying you consealor or blush because you will get dark purple powder all over your cheeks.  It is just messy and cheap and would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I really love powdered Kohl eyeliner! It&#x27;s hard to find at a reasonable price, but thankfully Loreal makes it. Glides on smooth, last all day!</li>
    <li> When I received this I thought it was going to be liquid liner but it is powder so I did not like the application of it.</li>
    <li> Even though the color is nice the quality of the product is very poor. It is like a powder. Terrible !</li>
    <li> great enhancer for eyes! but the tip of applicator bends so u have to cut a bit of it off!</li>
    <li> the worst make up I have ever used in my life!!! who the hell makes eye liner in a powder??? when you try to apply it, it dusts all over your face and by the time you are done with your eyes, you have to wash your face and re-apply foundation... it looks like make up from Cleopatra times when women had to use coal to give their eyes some color... horrible stuff! would not buy it even if somebody paid me to do so!</li>
    <li> Rich colour with easy to apply and smudge, a bit powdery in consistency though. Careful not to get it into your eyes when applying.</li>
    <li> I have blue eyes, this is a great accent for daytime wear without being too dark. I also have the burgundy color which I like but would probably be more flattering on brown or green eyes. The pigmentation is good, also would suggest trying the eyeshadows from L&#x27;Oreal HiP. I do not use this is in my waterline because I just feel a little iffy about putting loose type powder in this area, so I use this on my upper and lower lash line. That being said, a loose powder does sprinkle a little bit down my face if applying using a drawing motion but easily wipes away. I would recommend using a dabbing sort of motion to avoid this. This applicator tip is awesome, retains its shape and would be easy for beginners I think. Definitely worth a buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning something from my purchases at Amazon. If you are thinking a bout saving plenty dollars, watchout, it could be that the product may not be of very high quality, or expired even though not stated.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and I know LOREAL sellls good stuff, but when I got it, the so call powdered liner would not line.&lt;br /&gt;So everyone safe your money and buy this product at its original price, where it is not hoopfully locked away in some cupboard waiting to be discarded and then suddenly put up for sale. Never me again.</li>
    <li> This liner is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;You can wear like a eyeshadow also.&lt;br /&gt;This color is more like a graffiti and I love it!</li>
    <li> It takes some practice to use powder, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s worth dealing with blue powder on your face.  It comes off easily with eye make- up remover or in my case coconut oil, and it creates a great exotic look.  Just stick the tip in the corner of your eye, close our eye and draw the stick across the inside of the eye.  Just make sure your lashes aren&#x27;t in the way.  I also like to draw the stick across my eye 2or 3 times without re-dipping the stick.  Then if you have a little patch that needs more color just use the tip like you would a pencil. Just make sure you know this is a POWDER eyeliner and not a dried out tube of liquid liner.</li>
