### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very impressed!</li>
      <li>Great for my oily skin.  </li>
      <li>It is because of my oily skin that I have to use about four of these a day, so the quantity of the product is great.</li>
      <li>and they worked great.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see where these were go great for the price.  </li>
      <li>These are great blotting papers.</li>
      <li>face oil great.</li>
      <li>They smell great too.  </li>
      <li>Good  but no amaizing</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>I also like that these sheets tend to lift more oil than make-up - always a plus.</li>
      <li>I like them -- but as someone with fairly oily skin, I would relegate these for event purse duty, when my make-up is fresh and a temperate indoor climate temperate</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these blotting linens.</li>
      <li>I did not find that I needed to use more than one at a time.  </li>
      <li>but no worries, just use another sheet! :)</li>
      <li>Like 60% more than what I&#x27;ve been paying.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite blotting papers.</li>
      <li>The product is pretty good.</li>
      <li>As for the product itself, so far they are great.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, these are handy for removing oil without smudging my concealer, and they smell good, too!</li>
      <li>If you wip not blot the paper will easily tear.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they work just fine.  </li>
      <li>these serve a purpose -- but important</li>
      <li>The soak up oil well, and smell awesome (like green tea).</li>
      <li>This product is so great not only because of the price but also because of how well it works.</li>
      <li>Usually Amazon has the best deals, but</li>
      <li>I would only repurchase because they&#x27;re cute, smell nice</li>
      <li>I love these for their large size and quantity.</li>
      <li>As much as I love Amazon, you can get them much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I am lucky to have this problem, I know.</li>
      <li>However, I do like using this product, it leaves my face feeling fresh</li>
      <li>When wearing makeup this product definitely comes in handy.</li>
      <li>Very nicely designed little package.</li>
      <li>The oil on my face just soaks right through.</li>
      <li>They are bigger and more importantly, come out easily and individually just like Kleenex tissues.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not as powdery as the old fashioned ones, and not as strong as the rubbery feeling sheets.  </li>
      <li>I like these, but I could have sworn they used to be much cheaper!</li>
      <li>I purchased the Palladio at Sephora several years ago, and they work so much better.  </li>
      <li>I kept them in my emergency kit and sure enough we needed them</li>
      <li>I used one sheet today and five hours later my forehead is still oil free!  </li>
      <li>Great value, especially when compared to most other blotting sheets that are typically much smaller in size and count.  </li>
      <li>These are good, but no better than the cheaper brands.</li>
      <li>I was very eager to try these out after all the great review, but I was dissappointed that they are SO THIN.  </li>
      <li>Initially, I was thrilled when I found that these were also twice the size of my normal blue sheets however...  </li>
      <li>I normally buy the super cheap blue plastic blotting sheets but saw this at my local Sephora and couldn&#x27;t help myself; I had to have them.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m curious about the special edition scents they come out with around the holidays ;)  </li>
      <li>They smell good, but they are just too thin to be helpful.  </li>
      <li>Product was just as described new packaging and blots</li>
      <li>That said, those varieties can be too much when only a little absorption is needed, so even for more oily skin like mine</li>
      <li>The best thing about these blotting linens is that it absorbs oil without disturbing my makeup, unlike one-ply generic tissue paper where you can obviously see the makeup residue being pulled off and onto the paper.</li>
      <li>One of these sheets would be completely transparent from picking up oil off my forehead and yet; I would still have enough oily shine left over to require 2 more sheets before I looked relatively matte.  </li>
      <li>the extra sheets and larger size don&#x27;t really translate into much of a savings.  </li>
      <li>Or maybe my complexion is so much more oilier than other people&#x27;s, which is odd because I&#x27;m 61 years old.  </li>
      <li>These blotting papers cost double what other brands do but they are worth the price, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t pick up oil nearly as well as the blue sheets do</li>
      <li>Also love the slight green tea scent.</li>
      <li>I justified the expense because these have 100 sheets whereas the blue ones I usually buy only come with 50.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would try Amazon this time, but I am surprised at how much more expensive they are here.</li>
      <li>I was pretty surprised at how small the sheets were.</li>
      <li>I like the pretty little \\&quot;case\\&quot; that these come in, but unfortunately I always put them in the back pocket of my jeans before I go to school, so eventually the front part ripped off and most of the papers slide out and fell onto the floor.</li>
      <li>I do however &#x27;like&#x27; these; they&#x27;re pretty and have a faint but lovely green tea scent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I usually buy these at a store at a local mall. I thought I would try Amazon this time, but I am surprised at how much more expensive they are here. Like 60% more than what I&#x27;ve been paying. What gives? Usually Amazon has the best deals, but not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product five stars, but I am giving only three because of the price here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works well, blot don&#x27;t wipe.  Keeps make up on and removes oil.  If you wip not blot the paper will easily tear.</li>
    <li> This product is so great not only because of the price but also because of how well it works. I usually use in this on my t-zone area and it leaves my skin matte. When wearing makeup this product definitely comes in handy. It is small and fits inside a purse of pocket.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blotting papers. The soak up oil well, and smell awesome (like green tea). Additionally, there are no counterproductive ingredients (like the mineral oil in the blue papers).  However, they are $10 at Sephora. Buy them there.</li>
    <li> These sheets do their job. They absorb the excess oil without any mineral oil. Also love the slight green tea scent.</li>
    <li> Great for my oily skin.  These linens smell like green tea.  I just wish they were cheaper.  They are my #1 must-have item to carry around at all times.</li>
    <li> I love these for their large size and quantity. Great value, especially when compared to most other blotting sheets that are typically much smaller in size and count.  These are a necessity for us gals with uber oily skin (I have to blot virtually every hour and a half).  I also like that these sheets tend to lift more oil than make-up - always a plus.</li>
    <li> Bought these at Sephora today for $10.  As much as I love Amazon, you can get them much cheaper.  As for the product itself, so far they are great.  My forehead is super oily, at its worst midafternoon.  I used one sheet today and five hours later my forehead is still oil free!  They smell great too.  I did not find that I needed to use more than one at a time.  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> The product is pretty good. but Sephora only sells for $10</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wedding in case my girls and I got shiny in between pictures. I kept them in my emergency kit and sure enough we needed them and they worked great. Would definitely get these again.</li>
    <li> I like these, but I could have sworn they used to be much cheaper! Why would I pay $20 for 100 teensy scraps of tissue? These are good, but no better than the cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> Good  but no amaizing</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these blotting linens. My skin is unearthly oily, especially on my t-zone area. It is because of my oily skin that I have to use about four of these a day, so the quantity of the product is great. The best thing about these blotting linens is that it absorbs oil without disturbing my makeup, unlike one-ply generic tissue paper where you can obviously see the makeup residue being pulled off and onto the paper.</li>
    <li> These blotting papers cost double what other brands do but they are worth the price, in my opinion.  They are bigger and more importantly, come out easily and individually just like Kleenex tissues.  Very nicely designed little package.</li>
    <li> I like the pretty little \\&quot;case\\&quot; that these come in, but unfortunately I always put them in the back pocket of my jeans before I go to school, so eventually the front part ripped off and most of the papers slide out and fell onto the floor. Other than that, these are handy for removing oil without smudging my concealer, and they smell good, too!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a must get. Takes the shine off your face, only problem is oil returns promptly! but no worries, just use another sheet! :)</li>
    <li> I like them -- but as someone with fairly oily skin, I would relegate these for event purse duty, when my make-up is fresh and a temperate indoor climate temperate is all my skin has had to endure.  They&#x27;re not as powdery as the old fashioned ones, and not as strong as the rubbery feeling sheets.  That said, those varieties can be too much when only a little absorption is needed, so even for more oily skin like mine these serve a purpose -- but important to know what purpose they&#x27;ll serve.</li>
    <li> I use about 2-3 sheets a day to get rid of excess oil on my face. It works well and I like that is has green tea. I&#x27;ve used cheaper blotting sheets in the past and they always smudged my foundation, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the Boscia blotting sheets.</li>
    <li> These are great blotting papers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see where these were go great for the price.  I saw some at Sally&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Supply after that for $1.00 that worked just as well.</li>
    <li> I normally buy the super cheap blue plastic blotting sheets but saw this at my local Sephora and couldn&#x27;t help myself; I had to have them.  I justified the expense because these have 100 sheets whereas the blue ones I usually buy only come with 50.  Initially, I was thrilled when I found that these were also twice the size of my normal blue sheets however...  they don&#x27;t pick up oil nearly as well as the blue sheets do and I tend to get quite oily in the T-Zone by mid-afternoon.  One of these sheets would be completely transparent from picking up oil off my forehead and yet; I would still have enough oily shine left over to require 2 more sheets before I looked relatively matte.  In contrast; one of my old blue sheets was enough to blot my entire face even though they&#x27;re half the size of these sheets.  So...  the extra sheets and larger size don&#x27;t really translate into much of a savings.  I do however &#x27;like&#x27; these; they&#x27;re pretty and have a faint but lovely green tea scent.  I would only repurchase because they&#x27;re cute, smell nice and I&#x27;m curious about the special edition scents they come out with around the holidays ;)  Basically; I&#x27;d buy them as a novelty if I had the extra money to spend/was feeling frivolous but besides that, I&#x27;m going to stick with my trusty blue sheets as my mainstay.</li>
    <li> They really smell like green tea it&#x27;s amazing. Product was just as described new packaging and blots face oil great.</li>
    <li> I was very eager to try these out after all the great review, but I was dissappointed that they are SO THIN.  Otherwise, they work just fine.  But I am not used to using about 3 of them at a time.  I purchased the Palladio at Sephora several years ago, and they work so much better.  They smell good, but they are just too thin to be helpful.  Or maybe my complexion is so much more oilier than other people&#x27;s, which is odd because I&#x27;m 61 years old.  I am lucky to have this problem, I know.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Sephora. I&#x27;m a blotting addict. I get greasy by noon. I usually use two sheets at a time twice a day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how oily I was until I started using these. Yes, they take off the oil without taking off my makeup...but I have to use at least 3 or 4 sheets at a time. The oil on my face just soaks right through. I was pretty surprised at how small the sheets were. However, I do like using this product, it leaves my face feeling fresh</li>
    <li> chose because of write up in real simple magazine - ridiculous price and worthless - no better than a pc. of typing paper.</li>
    <li> I like that after using these sheets I don&#x27;t feel like my skin gets oilier after using them. Some sheets seem to make the problem worse. These do not bother my skin at all.</li>
