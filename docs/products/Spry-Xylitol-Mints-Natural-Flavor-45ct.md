      <li>#34;too much of a good thing&amp;#34; with these mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Also, good for your teeth.</li>
      <li>Xylitol is good for restoring your mouth&#x27;s ph after eating.  </li>
      <li>It is great when you have a breath that needs refreshing.</li>
      <li>This is a good handy item.</li>
      <li>and it is fine - but not these mints!</li>

      <li>These are great to have on hand, and way cheaper than our local health food store!  </li>
      <li>But enjoy a couple of them, maybe even 10 of them -</li>

    <li> So, maybe I am an idiot... But I had these in the car, I was really hungry, and sitting in bad traffic. So somehow I managed to eat a bunch of them - and boy did my tummy rebel - I was in pain for a couple of hours. So, enjoy them! But enjoy a couple of them, maybe even 10 of them - but a bunch is just not a good idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other types of mints you can eat a ton in one sitting and it is fine - but not these mints! So please let my over-indulgence in these mints be a warning... There is such a thing as &amp;#34;too much of a good thing&amp;#34; with these mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful to you! :)</li>
    <li> I keep a supply of these in my purse and in the car.</li>
    <li> Very minty and sugarless!  Also, good for your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this gum,i suggest it to all my friends</li>
    <li> Prescribed for my son by his dentist.  He enjoys this flavor. Great Price!</li>
    <li> I love Spry peppermints - work to keep fresh breath, fight cavities and a nontoxic sugar substitute. What&#x27;s not to love? :)</li>
    <li> I didnt like the taste but they came in great time and as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> tastes great and LOVE this little holder for my Spry gum to take in my purse.  I had Aspertame/Asuflame toxicity so I cannot chew other gums....these are great!</li>
    <li> It is great when you have a breath that needs refreshing. I had dry mouth really bad and my dental hygienist recommended any xylitol products. It helped 100%! I also like the tube that it comes in. It is as user-friendly as it can be for me. I have a physical disability with not very good control or coordination.</li>
    <li> Love this. Compact to carry in a purse. Arrived on time and is alot cheaper than the Health Store</li>
    <li> Love the taste and the packaging. My one complailnt is the cost of shipping, more than twice as much as the cost of the product! Fortunately I found a nearby store that carries it.</li>
