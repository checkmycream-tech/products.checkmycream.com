### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The splendor was so great that my monocle shattered into a million pieces!</li>
      <li>I felt like a crown prince or a duke at best.  </li>
      <li>You will look so much better!!!!  </li>
      <li>and I decided that I best leave.</li>
      <li>You will feel better!!!  </li>
      <li>I swear it smells almost as good as Brut!</li>
      <li>Smells great and cheap!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d be happy to allow them to the dumpster scraps.  </li>
      <li>Still want to smell great?  </li>
      <li>I think its quite remarkable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Felix, good fellow that he is, gave me some of the juice</li>
      <li>So for two years, this is how I based my purchase of bottles of smell good.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful and unique fragrance.</li>
      <li>the love of all that is beautiful in this world</li>
      <li>I know he&#x27;s somewhere enjoying this great perfume and would have loved to rate it five stars</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not even my best pick-up lines, ruggedly handsome looks and suave demeanor stood a chance against his magically scented aura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Otherwise a great product at a great price with an elegant diamond to top it off.</li>
      <li>I know some might want to thank me, but please, we have to better mankind!</li>
      <li>This product is simply amazing.</li>
      <li>The man that had just swept me off my feet did not have his own perfumer and resorted to wearing potions that could be purchased by just anyone?    </li>
      <li>The majesty that I am does not want to be bothered by my own majesty&#x27;s smell.  </li>
      <li>I decided to use my dad&#x27;s credit card and get him a nice perfume for the weekend.</li>
      <li>Be warned that by buying this you are taking your life into your own hands</li>
      <li>(Canadian) is a nice touch, eh.</li>
      <li>Eat well and feel healthy and sexy!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll tell you&#x27;re an amazing person (as many times as you want).</li>
      <li>My dad loved it,  he was so excited that he divorced my mum,  sold the house and disappeared for 3 years.  </li>
      <li>Have a trainer help you get fit and sexy!  </li>
      <li>a positive side, the box is very nice and I am going to use it to save yogurt lids.</li>
      <li>He was in heaven and couldn&#x27;t believe that at last he&#x27;d found the perfect aroma for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>( Yes, he had received it as a gift from his latest conquest. )</li>
      <li>Customers reading an Amazon Verified Purchase review can use this information to help them decide which reviews are most helpful in their purchasing decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And surely he did.</li>
      <li>It is actually more like 99.99%</li>
      <li>Better yet - instead of purchasing this to make yourself feel better about life, send me a check</li>
      <li>It works like magic</li>
      <li>Ask your hubby if it&#x27;s OK to use his credit card before making any purchases online.</li>
      <li>This perfume is hand crafted from an extensive list of exquisite ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it does sound like a nice fantasy.</li>
      <li>Some more may have been sold since.</li>
      <li>You will be Happier and more Attractive to others - FAR MORE SO than ANY benefit obtained from a squirt of cologne.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m rich now!</li>
      <li>Unique and rare ingredients make up a beautiful and rare perfume.</li>
      <li>No men&#x27;s cologne could smell so amazing that it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>Many people trust the reviews of Amazon ratings, and some of yours seem to be like the Android Free App of the Day reviews (though, admittedly, well-written).</li>
      <li>no wait there was a light, a light coming ever closer!</li>
      <li>And I am pretty sure not too many were sold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick and the presentation of the handcrafted box and bottle were outstanding</li>
      <li>To paraphrase the great patriot, Nathan Hale, I only regret I have but one pimp-stick to give the ho&#x27;s of this world.  </li>
      <li>but hey it is sure worth it.</li>
      <li>Hire yourself a private Chef to prepare joyous, delicious and healthy complete meals for you and your friends.  </li>
      <li>What i cheap deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, as Felix said, this is \\&quot;ALMOST\\&quot; as good as Old Spice, hence my 2 star</li>
      <li>&quot; Almost as good as Old Spice.</li>
      <li>The longer wait was worth it!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited when it came to my house</li>
      <li>This product is quite unique.</li>
      <li>my mind, in my dreams I could see colours, shapes, symbols and then a bright white light then nothing, darkness,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the perfume and strongly recommend any virgin out there who wants to get laid so badly, it worth the money, yo.</li>
      <li>We discussed the important issues of the day, such as which furrier in London offered the best lynx pelts and the proper color diamond to wear on the maiden voyage of one&#x27;s newest luxury yacht.    </li>
      <li>Oh well, even if the listing price is a mistake, I feel the words above are good advice that is applicable to the purchase of any overpriced \\&quot;thing\\&quot;:  </li>
      <li>This super cool super bowl event is about 1/10 the sensation of the perfume&#x27;s power to stimulate the senses...</li>
      <li>With all the houses, cars, and fly threads, I still felt very incomplete and soon fell into a deep depression no money could buy out.  </li>
      <li>The snout of a Dobhar-chu; Tears of a pregnant Mermaid; And the bile from a Hibagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I hobbled up as quickly as I could and ripped the stiletto from my now bleeding leg.</li>
      <li>Imagine sitting in a luxury box at the Super Bowl with a supermodel on each side and another performing a lap dance and Chuck Norris jumps out of an exploding TBS Blimp 1000 feet in the air landing on the 50 yard line and kicking 100 ninja butts for the halftime show.</li>
      <li>I was glowing with a gentle warm yellow light!</li>
      <li>a great smelling perfume with a ridiculous and almost humorous price</li>
      <li>; how can I ensure that my legacy will live on and that I can do better for mankind?  </li>
      <li>I am now no longer a being of flesh and bone, I have surpassed humanity I am now a being of light and pure energy, I am omnipresent</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure there will be many who are interested and would be more than happy to take it off your hands... including some of the other negative reviewers.</li>
      <li>The Amazon Verified Review label offers one more way to help gauge the quality and relevance of a product</li>

      <li>I do not even splash this perfume on me but carry it around and just open the top and take a sniff; that is all I need to get me through the day.</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>Just one sniff of this stuff pulled me out of my depression and made me whole!  </li>
      <li>course you have a right to spend as much as you want on whatever you want.  </li>
      <li>Though still worrying that the valet would scratch my newly purchased Bugati Veyron, I went to the bar to grab myself a glass of Henri IV Dudognon Heritage Cognac Grande Champagne to calm my nerves.</li>
      <li>The odor is so strong that it went through my condom too, the girls kept screaming about it, some of them told me the perfume actually went inside their body like you putting oil in car engine.</li>
      <li>I entered a large soiree at the house of Baron Flonderboot Ducard.</li>
      <li>If we could somehow validate their experience with the product, we certainly would.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Immediately I gave them each a squirt of my Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men but quickly ran out of the 16.9 oz!</li>
      <li>Well, as much as  I am pro peace, I am not a peace duke.  </li>
      <li>Is this price for real?  </li>
      <li>Given what notes are in this bottle, there is no way anyone should pay this much for a bottle of cologne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The riot which ensued when I entered the nightclub again and a tidal wave of women descended upon me was too much to bear.</li>
      <li>Then all of a sudden a searing pain in my head, like a knife slicing me in two, a taste of blood in my mouth and a warm sensation as ruby red blood poured from my nose then darkness!</li>
      <li>After searching high and low, I have finally found the reason God (the Pimps&#x27; Pimp) gave humans any kind of olfactory sense.  </li>

      <li>This is NEW JERSEY after all!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Felix is a 75 year old Tango dance instructor who regularly gets Maseratis and Lamberghinis as presents from adoring rich widows.</li>
      <li>Why use half a million dollars to help feed starving children when you can smell better\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Words of wisdom :)</li>
      <li>I trust his judgment implicitly and he reassured me that this particular juice was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I won a very lucrative \\&quot;slip-n-fall\\&quot; lawsuit against Walmart and soon found myself on an epic spending spree for about two years.  I thought I got everything I, or anyone else for that matter, wanted.  With all the houses, cars, and fly threads, I still felt very incomplete and soon fell into a deep depression no money could buy out.  Prior to my hefty award, I usually purchased my \\&quot;smell good\\&quot; from the local pharmacy in one gallon jugs for about $10.  After my award and accelerated trip up the class level, I learned that the paradox of perfumes was that the smaller the bottle, the more expensive it is.  So for two years, this is how I based my purchase of bottles of smell good.  I totally ignored the Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men because I thought that at 16.9 oz, the perfume would be in the cheap smell good category - but alas, I never looked at the price.  Then years of low class living made me balk at purchasing because at $400K+, 16.9 oz is not nearly enough to warrant a purchase. I mean come on; I&#x27;ve purchased oil tankers for cheaper - even with a full load of oil included.  But, as I mentioned, I was in a depression and could not snap out of it and pulled the trigger anyway desperate for any resolve to my crises. Note: I did save some money by choosing a slower shipping speed.   The longer wait was worth it!  Just one sniff of this stuff pulled me out of my depression and made me whole!  Imagine sitting in a luxury box at the Super Bowl with a supermodel on each side and another performing a lap dance and Chuck Norris jumps out of an exploding TBS Blimp 1000 feet in the air landing on the 50 yard line and kicking 100 ninja butts for the halftime show. This super cool super bowl event is about 1/10 the sensation of the perfume&#x27;s power to stimulate the senses...seriously.  I do not even splash this perfume on me but carry it around and just open the top and take a sniff; that is all I need to get me through the day.</li>
    <li> I swear it smells almost as good as Brut! Let me tell you $435k and the shipping is only $12...i wouldn&#x27;t want to be the delivery service that has to cough up that replacement if it breaks in shipping.</li>
    <li> So let me tell you a little about myself. I am the founder of whatever.com. This is a website that basically sits on the internet and collects views, and does nothing else. A few months back some rich old geezer chanced upon my website. He saw the front page had a view count of over 700 million. So it dawned on his old feeble mind that he should invest all his money in my website. He called me up (he didn&#x27;t know how to use email) and asked about my website, whatever.com. He asked me what its purpose was, I told him I&#x27;ll be damn if I know. He told me he would call me back about an offer to invest in the website. And surely he did. Then some other rich old geezer called about investing in my website. Then another. Then another. Then....well you get the idea. Old people must have some secret language they all communicate in that we can&#x27;t understand, may be it has to do with that shaking they all do. Anyway, I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m rich now! The only problem is that these old geezers keep coming to my office to talk to me about their investments. Even after they leave, my office still has that old people smell...young people know what I mean. This is where Clive Christian comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I could cover up that smell with cologne. I figure the more expensive, the better it would work. And what cologne is more expensive then Clive Christian&#x27;s Imperial Majesty? So I bought 300 bottles, just because I can. And guess what? IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! $435,000 per bottle and it can&#x27;t even get that old people smell out! As a matter of fact, Clive Christian Imperial Majesty smells like urine. So now my office smells like old people and urine. The life of an dot.com billionaire.</li>
    <li> This cologne has done nothing less than CHANGE MY LIFE!!!  With the first spritz, my lifelong depression evaporated in a puff of divinely scented smoke.  Just one suggestion...I would prefer if the bottle were made of a hollowed out diamond.  Also, does this come in a gift set?  **update ** the second spritz was almost too much for my feeble mind to handle! The splendor was so great that my monocle shattered into a million pieces!</li>
    <li> It would appear this is a bargain at $435,000:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there I was at home, clipping coupons and sorting out food stamps when my friend Felix called me and told me about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His high praise tempted me to get it at once (Perhaps my credit card would clear?) Until I remembered I took a solemn vow NEVER to buy blind again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, my former buys of Chanel Allure and Tommy Boy earned me tons of compliments, especially from teenage girls--and a close brush with the law (but that&#x27;s another story) In any case, one must exercise restraint in buying fragrances without smelling them first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, we went clubbing that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felix is a 75 year old Tango dance instructor who regularly gets Maseratis and Lamberghinis as presents from adoring rich widows. I trust his judgment implicitly and he reassured me that this particular juice was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; Almost as good as Old Spice. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, a bevy of beauties congregated around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even my best pick-up lines, ruggedly handsome looks and suave demeanor stood a chance against his magically scented aura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felix, good fellow that he is, gave me some of the juice ( Yes, he had received it as a gift from his latest conquest. ) He suggested that I step outside and inconspicuously apply a couple of drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m ashamed to admit that I committed a beginner&#x27;s mistake: I over applied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The riot which ensued when I entered the nightclub again and a tidal wave of women descended upon me was too much to bear. I had to flee for my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have no doubt I would have ended as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille did at the end of the film \\&quot;Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\\&quot; (2006) ---And I want to make it perfectly clear that I do NOT approve of cannibalism!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will only apply two drops, maximum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, I remain conflicted. First of all, I&#x27;m still short of the $11.95 for shipping. Secondly, there is ONLY ONE bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( Amazingly there&#x27;s plenty more left of the women&#x27;s version--why the ladies are not sensible enough to purchase this, is beyond my comprehension.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as Felix said, this is \\&quot;ALMOST\\&quot; as good as Old Spice, hence my 2 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*&lt;br /&gt;I need a hug.</li>
    <li> This perfume is hand crafted from an extensive list of exquisite ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warn you if you are allergic to any of these following ingredients DO NOT BUY: The blubber of a Trunko; Oils secreted from both a Loveland Frog, and a Mongolian Deathworm; The snout of a Dobhar-chu; Tears of a pregnant Mermaid; And the bile from a Hibagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Otherwise a great product at a great price with an elegant diamond to top it off.</li>
    <li> This is one of those colognes that you can smell on yourself all day long.  The majesty that I am does not want to be bothered by my own majesty&#x27;s smell.  I felt like a crown prince or a duke at best.  Well, as much as  I am pro peace, I am not a peace duke.  Well, maybe I am in the scope of this review, but that&#x27;s irrelevant..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive side, the box is very nice and I am going to use it to save yogurt lids.</li>
    <li> Wow...so he bought bottles for 20 of his closest friends. Don&#x27;t we all wish we had 7 or 8 million dollars to spend on perfume. Bed his dad the sheik was pissed about that. Maybe he should spill some in the back of his 18kt gold rolls Royce as well. As far as I know there was a very limited supply of these baccarat and diamond encrusted bottles produced. And I am pretty sure not too many were sold. I think Madonna and Elton John were the only two purchased  them. This was a few years&lt;br /&gt;Ago. Some more may have been sold since. At any rate I received a bottle as a gift. The 1000.00 bottle. It is a wonderful and unique fragrance. Unique and rare ingredients make up a beautiful and rare perfume. I love mixing the male and female versions. I seriously doubt anyone no matter how wealthy would use this in bath water. Give me a break. But it does sound like a nice fantasy.</li>
    <li> If you are so disappointed in your purchase, would you please put yours up for sale? I check this page daily for used bottles and no one seems to want to sell their \\&quot;disappointment\\&quot;. I imagine the resell value should be reasonable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I can only surmise that your low ratings and complaints are merely your collective ploy to discourage other potential buyers from enjoying the LAST bottle of this sweet, sweet fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the love of all that is beautiful in this world, then, I implore you: either increase the ratings of your misleading reviews or put your bottles up for sale. Many people trust the reviews of Amazon ratings, and some of yours seem to be like the Android Free App of the Day reviews (though, admittedly, well-written). Don&#x27;t stoop to that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there will be many who are interested and would be more than happy to take it off your hands... including some of the other negative reviewers.</li>
    <li> At last year&#x27;s Christmas Gala Ball Fundraiser for the Organization to Raise Awareness of Falling Millinery Standards, I was introduced to a dashing young gentleman.  I was entranced by the alluring scent he wore.  It spoke to me of fog-shrouded hills overlooking majestic castles with secret rooms filled with heirloom treasures.  Surely this man was a duke, a baron at the very least.  We discussed the important issues of the day, such as which furrier in London offered the best lynx pelts and the proper color diamond to wear on the maiden voyage of one&#x27;s newest luxury yacht.    As the evening wore on, the scent of his perfume overwhelmed my senses and before I knew it, I was awakening in the Presidential Suite in the Plaza Hotel.  Without disturbing my new friend, I made my way to the powder room.  There, to my utter horror, I discovered the source of my temptation.  A bottle of Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men!  I could not believe my eyes.  The man that had just swept me off my feet did not have his own perfumer and resorted to wearing potions that could be purchased by just anyone?    Horrified at being caught in such a position, I hurriedly called the chambermaid to draw my bath and dress me so that I could leave before the charlatan awoke.  I avoided disaster this time, but with this sort of product on the market, everyone is at risk.</li>
    <li> After purchasing my 7th private jet (1 for everyday of the week) i decided to spend some pocket change on some perfume. After countless hours of looking at overpriced 10 dollar bottles of perfume i came across this baby! What i cheap deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never forget what my father always told me \\&quot; Why use half a million dollars to help feed starving children when you can smell better\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Words of wisdom :)</li>
    <li> You can review Any product on Amazon without actually purchasing the product. Many people buy products from other sites or from local stores so Amazon allows anyone to write a review for any product. If you read all the reviews for the Clive Christian Imperial Perfume priced at $435,000.00 you will notice not one review has the Amazon Verified Purchase under the name. It wasn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What&#x27;s an \\&quot;Amazon Verified Purchase\\&quot; review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a product review is marked \\&quot;Amazon Verified Purchase,\\&quot; it means that the customer who wrote the review purchased the item at Amazon.com. Customers can add this label to their review only if we can verify the item being reviewed was purchased at Amazon.com. Customers reading an Amazon Verified Purchase review can use this information to help them decide which reviews are most helpful in their purchasing decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a review is not marked Amazon Verified Purchase, it doesn&#x27;t mean that the reviewer has no experience with the product - it just means we couldn&#x27;t verify that it had been purchased at Amazon. They may have purchased the item elsewhere or had some other interaction with it. If we could somehow validate their experience with the product, we certainly would. The Amazon Verified Review label offers one more way to help gauge the quality and relevance of a product review.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. I was so excited when it came to my house I felt like a little boy on Christmas. All of my friends tell me i smell like a million bucks. and the funny thing is is that it cost me a half a mil! but hey it is sure worth it. so if you can actually afford it (like me) BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> I hate to sound crass but the business of maintaining a robust stable and \\&quot;keeping the pimp hand strong\\&quot; requires I play the part.  My custom-made twelve-button silk suit in mauve with matching &#x27;gator shoes, felt hat, iced-out grill, 12-carat Canary diamond ring, and cane form an incomplete ensemble without my pimp-scent.  After searching high and low, I have finally found the reason God (the Pimps&#x27; Pimp) gave humans any kind of olfactory sense.  To say this concoction is a panty-dropper does not do it justice.  To paraphrase the great patriot, Nathan Hale, I only regret I have but one pimp-stick to give the ho&#x27;s of this world.  Even nuns get a little weak in the knees as I pass and give them a glimpse at an earthly paradise few mortal men can offer.  If you are an aspiring man-madame or just want to smell like one, this is the last stop on the Sex-funk Express.</li>
    <li> This is the only perfume I use... It works like magic so one doesn&#x27;t have to smell that other 47%!.... It is actually more like 99.99% but what the heck, I have a bunch of money so I can be flexible with facts.</li>
    <li> I was wondering one day what to do with my fortune when I pass; how can I ensure that my legacy will live on and that I can do better for mankind?  I have, after all, matured and grew out of the need for frivolous possessions after my wife dying (see my review  http://www.amazon.com/Chopard-Womens-277480-1001-Happy-Diamond/dp/B001K3IXKK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;watches&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1347667810&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1 ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So one day while slumming, er, um.., pondering as I strolled through Camden NJ I saw others asking for food for themselves and, even worse, for their children.  I suggested they go work at my KFC where we sell food and I&#x27;d be happy to allow them to the dumpster scraps.  I know, such kindness is not often seen, but again, after my wife&#x27;s passing... I was however appalled at several gentlemen whom approached me, smelling like they had not had their chambermaids draw their afternoon bath.  The rancid smell, the horror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I gave them each a squirt of my Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men but quickly ran out of the 16.9 oz! This is NEW JERSEY after all!  So I immediately called my attorney and set forth in motion my resolve to fully fragrance all of Camden NJ upon my death.  I know some might want to thank me, but please, we have to better mankind!</li>
    <li> Word on the street is that Monty Burns teabags this stuff to freshen his nether regions after a long day at the Springfield Nucular Panner Plant.  Also, I hear that 60% OF THE TIME, IT WORKS EVERY TIME.</li>
    <li> I bought this one with the hope that after 60 years of saving money, a virgin like me could finally get laid (I avoided having a girlfriend to save money, I didn&#x27;t even think about getting a prostitute because... you know... costly). So now whenever I put half a drop on my \\&quot;little boy\\&quot;, it attracted every female nearby (within 1km diameter). The odor is so strong that it went through my condom too, the girls kept screaming about it, some of them told me the perfume actually went inside their body like you putting oil in car engine. I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the perfume and strongly recommend any virgin out there who wants to get laid so badly, it worth the money, yo.</li>
    <li> Is this price for real?  No men&#x27;s cologne could smell so amazing that it&#x27;s worth the insane price of over $400,000.  PLEASE tell me this is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you have a right to spend as much as you want on whatever you want.  But on THIS?  If the ultimate goal of an enhancement is to attract others to you, then please consider these much better alternatives:  Hire a discrete and private Personal Trainer to improve your appearance and your health.  OR!!!! Hire yourself a private Chef to prepare joyous, delicious and healthy complete meals for you and your friends.  You will look so much better!!!!  You will feel better!!!  You will be Happier and more Attractive to others - FAR MORE SO than ANY benefit obtained from a squirt of cologne.  Still want to smell great?  Then pick out a $500 scent you like, or have a scent made for you.  Don&#x27;t let anybody take advantage of you.  Have a trainer help you get fit and sexy!  Eat well and feel healthy and sexy!  Don&#x27;t buy a $400K bottle of men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I will be so embarrassed if the \\&quot;$400K\\&quot; price tag is just a typo.  Oh well, even if the listing price is a mistake, I feel the words above are good advice that is applicable to the purchase of any overpriced \\&quot;thing\\&quot;:  Cars, watches, etc.  Thanks!  I hope this helps somebody, even just one time.)</li>
    <li> This product is quite unique. One squirt and you are buried with rich middle aged women. Even tho it costed me half of my inheritance, it did not set me back financially. Such a luxurious fragrance. Exquisite in every known way, it is immaculate amongst any other edu toilet alcohol based scent. I spray my pet giraffe with it and he runs in circles. I think its quite remarkable.</li>
    <li> Having come into a vast amount of wealth I decided to indulge in a few luxury items, multiple cars and houses, fast woman, gambling, the datastroyer and few zenith watches. You know the standard items a rich man needs but I was lacking a scent that defined me as a person. After much research, comparisons and deliberation I settled on Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men 16.9 oz Perfume. A little pricey for such a small bottle but I trusted my decision and remembered the old saying &#x60;quality not  quantity&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick and the presentation of the handcrafted box and bottle were outstanding all I needed now was an occasion to try out the scent. Then out of the blue an opportunity presented itself, I was invited to a banquet for the 100 richest people in Retford, I could hardly wait to try out the scent, for its delicate smell to tease my nostrils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came to the big night and my fingers trembled as I uncorked the bottle and gently dabbed the perfume onto my skin, I inhaled deeply..... but nothing, I could smell nothing. Then all of a sudden a searing pain in my head, like a knife slicing me in two, a taste of blood in my mouth and a warm sensation as ruby red blood poured from my nose then darkness! I had passed out!&lt;br /&gt;In my mind, in my dreams I could see colours, shapes, symbols and then a bright white light then nothing, darkness, no wait there was a light, a light coming ever closer! What was it? It was vast never ending I was looking at the universe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was awake, I could feel the cold floor against my face. I arose and got to my feet scanning the room I saw that the Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men 16.9 oz Perfume was back in its box on the side, I caught sight of the clock, this can&#x27;t be I had been unconscious for a week! Then strange things began to happen, I could see round corners, I was levitating and I could move objects with my mind! I knew what had happened, the Majesty Perfume had unlocked my brain, I was enlightened and like the Buddha himself I was glowing with a gentle warm yellow light! I was the one! I closed my eyes and I could see all of time and space, everything that ever was and everything that ever could be! I had all the answers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have evolved I am now no longer a being of flesh and bone, I have surpassed humanity I am now a being of light and pure energy, I am omnipresent I see all I hear all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you ask me \\&quot;Is Clive Christian Imperial Majesty Perfume for Men 16.9 oz Perfume worth buying?\\&quot; and in return I ask you a question, \\&quot;Do you want to transcend the comprehension of all living beings? Do you want to be the alpha and the omega? Do you want to have combined knowledge of the universe? Do you want to travel through time and space and live forever?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you do!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because I was tired of him reeking of cheap cologne on our nights out around town. The first, and only night, he wore the Majesty Perfume he was overjoyed at the compliments he was getting from all who brushed past him. He was in heaven and couldn&#x27;t believe that at last he&#x27;d found the perfect aroma for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only when I told him how much it was that things changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my spell in hospital, I managed to stop him from having me &#x27;put away&#x27; and things have remained a little strained in our relationship since the purchase. I&#x27;ve now been banned from turning on the computer and was only able to write this review while he was away at anger management classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice? Ask your hubby if it&#x27;s OK to use his credit card before making any purchases online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve placed this on my Wish List and notified family, friends, and co-workers. I&#x27;m hoping for a scentsible birthday. The extra .9 oz. (Canadian) is a nice touch, eh.</li>
    <li> Smells great and cheap!&lt;br /&gt;This perfume beats any other change perfume. I like the thing one i do the thing in the bed</li>
    <li> One of my Business partners who is obsessed with luxury had recently purchased this perfume and was extremely excited to show it to me. I will say that it does have a very unique scent which I enjoyed but the insane price really brings my ratings down.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great smelling perfume with a ridiculous and almost humorous price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Its like they wanted to see how far people are willing to go to buy their perfume.&lt;br /&gt;If you have lots of money to throw away go for it!</li>
    <li> Just so there isn&#x27;t someone stupid enough out there to spend over $400,000 on a single cologne - the actual manufacturing cost to product 1 bottle could not be over $100. Given what notes are in this bottle, there is no way anyone should pay this much for a bottle of cologne. Better yet - instead of purchasing this to make yourself feel better about life, send me a check and I&#x27;ll tell you&#x27;re an amazing person (as many times as you want). acarterczyz@me.com</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my first bottle of Clive Christian Imperial Majesty for Men and it was the most terrifying experience of my entire life! I entered a large soiree at the house of Baron Flonderboot Ducard. Though still worrying that the valet would scratch my newly purchased Bugati Veyron, I went to the bar to grab myself a glass of Henri IV Dudognon Heritage Cognac Grande Champagne to calm my nerves. I had noticed the women in the ball room had all began to move towards the bar but I took no notice of it and continued to speak to the bartender regarding my newest private jet. I heard the noise of the female crowd growing ever closer and I decided that I best leave. As I stood up the crows exploded in cheers and screams. Like The Beatles running from fan girls, I booked it towards the door, at least 1000 women on my tail. I made it through the door and whistled for the valet. He sped around the corner and screeched to a halt in front of the massive mansion. I legged it towards my 2 and a half million dollar sports car but fell onto my face. A sharp pain rushed through my leg and I realized that a high heal protruded from my leg. I hobbled up as quickly as I could and ripped the stiletto from my now bleeding leg. I reached the Bugati and jumped through the open window into the drivers seat. The valet threw me the keys and in only 2.5 seconds I was racing down the road as a horde of sexually charged babes chased after me. I could&#x27;ve been killed because of this perfume! I advise revising its effect on women because it creates the equivalent of poking a menstrual bear to all women. Be warned that by buying this you are taking your life into your own hands</li>
    <li> I bathe my Chihuahua in it. Makes him smell like a french poodle. And you just can&#x27;t buy that kinda thing. Unless you have half a mill.</li>
    <li> I like getting gifts for people so as I was celebrating the weekend,  I decided to use my dad&#x27;s credit card and get him a nice perfume for the weekend. My dad loved it,  he was so excited that he divorced my mum,  sold the house and disappeared for 3 years.  I know he&#x27;s somewhere enjoying this great perfume and would have loved to rate it five stars so I&#x27;m doing it for him.</li>
