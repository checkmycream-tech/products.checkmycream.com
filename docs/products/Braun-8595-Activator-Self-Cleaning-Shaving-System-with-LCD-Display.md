      <li>was so impressed with the Braun 370 that I thought I&#x27;d try out the pricy Braun 8595.</li>
      <li>, this is the best electric shaving system on the market for someone switching from a blade, IMHO.  </li>
      <li>This is the best shave I have had with an electric.  </li>
      <li>here&#x27;s the part that really impressed me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best purchases I made this year!</li>
      <li>and it is great!</li>
      <li>Now comes the best part:</li>
      <li>Happy shaving!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 4 months, and it&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>This was a gift to my husband,I shopped around and found the best deal here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Excellent razor.  </li>
      <li>-)k, this is the best foil shaver you can get.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So, in my book, this is the best foil shaver you can get.  </li>
      <li>great shave AND a razor that cleans itself!</li>
      <li>The self cleaning system works flawless.</li>
      <li>I found an awesome deal at Sams Club.</li>
      <li>The razor kit plus a pack of 2 refills for the cleaner for $140.00 which is the best deal even on here and doing a froogle search.</li>
      <li>than that, this is the best shaver to date!</li>
      <li>And it does give the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>The closeness of the shave wasn&#x27;t all too impressive, but they served me well through my high-school and college years.  </li>
      <li>Also, the shipping wasn&#x27;t the best - the outer plastic casing around the shaver&#x27;s box was cracked upon arrival.</li>
      <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried provides a closer shave, not even the best disposable razors.</li>
      <li>This is the best razor out there.</li>
      <li>But when I do spend 5-10 minutes with the Braun, I always wind up with the best cleanest shave.  </li>
      <li>-Excellent</li>
      <li>After using this shaver for over a year, I&#x27;m still impressed.  </li>

      <li>cannot tell you how wonderful this is.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The best part about this shaver is the cleaning mechanism.</li>
      <li>Then I saw the ad for the 8595 and the technology looked impressive.  </li>
      <li>I went for the gold and bought the best.  </li>

      <li>I should say I am not 100% impressed by the shave in the neck region.</li>

      <li>a day and this machine is perfect.</li>
      <li>but I could not shave perfectly</li>

      <li>It gives an incredibly close shave with no irritation to the skin.  </li>
      <li>Good luck!    </li>
      <li>So, I picked one up at Best Buy (on Good Friday, incidentally).</li>
      <li>The 8595 is beautiful.</li>
      <li>This has proven a good shaver, and I am impressed with its functionality...self-cleaning and tells you everything.  </li>
      <li>very nice perk to this razor as well is that when it cleans it smells incredible.  </li>
      <li>The charger is great too-it juices up the shaver while optimizing the battery capacity and life-span.\\</li>
      <li>This thing is great.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Braun has taken the 7000 series shavers and gone a step further, to say the least. I loved my 7526 but was persuaded to try this unit. The new foil design is truly an advance. It makes shaving so much easier, especially for those wayward neck hairs that grow every which way. And I get virtually no irritation despite having sensitive skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the down side the cleaning cycle is still noisy but not distressingly so, and the cleaning solution needs to be changed regularly, adding to the cost. Gillette/Braun has figured out how to keep us shavers buying consumables even for dry shaves. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer claims that the foil and cutterblock should last 18 months but I found with the 7526 that 6-9 months was more realistic for maintaining shave quality. I suspect that this unit will be similar in that respect. This also adds to the cost but replacing them does give you a virtually new shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning unit analyzes the amount of hair in the shaver after a shave and sets the cleaning cycle accordingly. It also analyzes battery usage and charges after each use. Periodically it discharges the battery completely to avoid battery \\&quot;memory\\&quot;. It does this automatically. There is also a cord that can be used on extended trips and a brush for manual cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the whole I am very happy with this unit and would recommend the Braun 8000 series to anyone comtemplating a replacement or a first electric shave system.</li>
    <li> I will make this short and too the point. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I shave my head and have sensative skin. I purchased this shaver on the suggestions from other Amazon users. This is What I found: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;-Shaves the closest next to a straight blade! &lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t give you skin irritation. I go over spots multiple times and my old shaver would give me bumps and red spots on my head and neck. This one leaves my skin feeling smooth and not irritated at all. &lt;br /&gt;-Cleans up very well. After putting it through the cleaning cycle, it looks new, shaves new, and even smells good from the solution it cleans itself in. &lt;br /&gt;-Best shaver out there. Worth every dollar! &lt;br /&gt;-Makes shaving easy. Becuase the base and shaver work together, this shaver will charge itself as much as it needs, keep track of how long you shaved before to determine the proper cleaning. This shaver does all the thinking for you. &lt;br /&gt;-Newer design is a plus. The new shaver head does capture more hairs than other ones. This is a vast improvement from previous versions and normal foil razors. &lt;br /&gt;-Looks cool. This is like the Cadillac of razors. You can hold it at any angle and it isnt too heavy or bulky, just right! &lt;br /&gt;-Put together well. Even the carrying case is a hard molded plastic with a head cleaning brush that forms to the inside. &lt;br /&gt;-Is able to get all shaving areas, especially when you lock the  pivoting head to get into hard to reach areas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Hair does come out of the shaver. As noted by a few other reviews, if you have a decent amount of hair to shave, the hair starts to fall out of the shaver like some one is sprinkling pepper by your head. Because i shave my head, it creates a decent amount. But you can cut this down by opening the head and shaking out the excess. But it can create a mess if you don&#x27;t pay attention. &lt;br /&gt;-Is pricey. Most people would have a hard time putting out over 100 bucks for a razor. But please listen to others and myself, you will see that you get what you pay for and in this circumstance, it is very true! I found an awesome deal at Sams Club. The razor kit plus a pack of 2 refills for the cleaner for $140.00 which is the best deal even on here and doing a froogle search. Chek that out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is the best shaver to date! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve never typed up a review here on Amazon, but since I based my decision to buy this shaver from all the other reviews on here, I thought I should at least contribute back to the community. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t repeat what has already been said.  Bottomline, this shaver does what it claims.  And it does give the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  And yes, my whiskers lie flat around my throat like a lot of other guys and my 3-rotor Norelco would never get all of them which forced me to use a twin-edge Gillette after 10 mins on the Norelco to get the stubborn wiskers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have used electric shavers all my life. My experience has been either I don&#x27;t get a good shave, or if I press hard enough against my skin, all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past would leave my skin with a burning sensation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not this Braun.  I thought the screeen looked gimicky, but it really does the job.  Note that I have NOT been able to save any time shaving with the Braun.  It still takes me 5-10 minutes to shave (depending how many days over the weekend I opted to skip shaving).  But when I do spend 5-10 minutes with the Braun, I always wind up with the best cleanest shave.  I can&#x27;t say that with the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used even after 10 minutes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Regarding the cleaner - I&#x27;m following the clean once a week and then reseal it trick.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy cleaner every month.  So far I&#x27;ve had this 8595 about 3 weeks and I only clean it once a week AND only charge it once a week.  The battery still shows 50% charge remaining by the end of the week so I suppose I could push it to every 2 weeks if I wanted. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Basically if you want to, just use the auto clean and when it&#x27;s done, pull out the cleaning solution \\&quot;tub\\&quot; and reseal it with the originally provided shipping plugs that came with it.  It won&#x27;t evaporate during the week while sealed up.  At the end of week, get out the charging station (I leave mine under the sink cabinet), slap in the solution \\&quot;tub\\&quot;, drop in the shaver and enable the auto clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I doesn&#x27;t bug me to not have it cleaned every day.  I&#x27;m just glad I now have a product that can auto clean for me on a weekly basis.  A real time saver in my opinion and no mess in the sink or trash with old wiskers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I will confirm other things you&#x27;ll read from other reviews: &lt;br /&gt;- yes the auto clean is noisy.  I don&#x27;t do auto clean in the mornings with the wife sleeping.  I do my once a week auto clean in the evening after I get home from work &lt;br /&gt;- yes the blue light is bright... doesn&#x27;t matter to me, I only have the charging station out on the sink once a week for the cleaning &lt;br /&gt;- yes the plug-in charger is big and sticks out of the socket pretty far... again no biggie to me because I only plug it in once a week &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it.  Hope this review helps you decide if the 8595 meets your needs and expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He likes the razor.  The shave is much closer when compared to other electric razors that he has used.  He highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver, but my biggest gripe is the trimmer.. It does not come as close as other razors I have had.. It is HORRIBLE on my side burns.. The razor it self is great and I love the cleaning is great also.. I can really tell the difference between a shave with the razor after a few shaves without cleaning it.. I really like the LCD, it tells me how long it needs to charge for and how long cleaning is going to take.. If only the trimmer were better I would have given this a higher rating for the trimmer plays a large role in the razor score..</li>
    <li> I got this shaver in November of &#x27;05 and have loved it ever since.  Several people have commented on the cleaning solution needing to be repurchased several times a year.  So far I&#x27;m on my third cartridge and they have lasted at least three months each.  Cleaning the razor every 2-3 days has worked well for me.  Plus, it&#x27;s great having a clean razor whenever I want, and it actually smells clean, too!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco for close to 15 years.  For the last 10 years I have been using a wet shaver.  This was a bit of a change for me, but it&#x27;s turned out to be better.  I have never had an electric shave this close.  I love having a clean razor every time I shave as well.  I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> The razor gives a great shave for electric. However, the cleaning process is very noisy if the base is used. The cleaning solution is expensive.The razor can be cleaned manually but this is also more difficult than older razors I have used.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my husband,I shopped around and found the best deal here on Amazon. Wonderful shaver, he uses it everyday and will not use his old shavers or razor blades any longer. Great product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I have owned it for a month now and I can safely say that it is one of the nicer products that I own.  The best part for me is that it is virtually maintenance free.  It cleans itself, charges itself, tells you when the foil and cutting block needs replacing, and it even conditions the battery so it is at peak performance all the time.  The shave is a dream, far less irritation the my old Mach 3 razor.  Also if you give it the three weeks of shaving everyday for your hair to adjust to the electric it is a stunningly close shave.  This is a wonderful product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have now had this product for over a year and am quite impressed by it.  It gives the closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric shaver and love the cleaning function that keeps the razor functioning well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for over a year now and I can honestly say it shaves better than a blade! It actually provides a closer shave than those 3 and 4 blade razors. It also seems to be better for your skin, generating less in-grown hairs than a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I still use a blade when I let my beard grow too long between shaves (my beard grows very fast, if I don&#x27;t shave for a few days it is half an inch long). A blade is quicker for hacking off a long beard, but this razor will give you a closer shave with less irritation and the self cleaning feature keeps the unit clean and ready to use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;No regrets - the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned (and I&#x27;ve tried them all!) &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> After seeing all the great reviews I bought this shaver and liked it at first.  However after a year or so I was beginning to wonder if paying $5 a month just to maintain this thing in cleaner was worth it.  Then I pulled it out of the cleaner once to see the head was burned.  The solution was new and full but I remembered hearing it run an awful lot when it cleaned the previous day.  I bought a new head and guess what, the exact same thing happened again about two months later.  After years of using Braun&#x27;s shavers this shaver found its rightful place in the trash and I bought a Norelco 8140XL.   It cleans under free running water,  shaves better, quieter although more powerful in cutting tough areas, and costs way less to buy and no \\&quot;cleaner tax\\&quot; to pay every month.   I think the new Braun&#x27;s are grossly overrated.</li>
    <li> The pressure facing health and beauty grooming appliances is tough... they have to constantly think of new and better ways to improve their products, EVEN THOUGH they may have already reached a technological ceiling.  It&#x27;s because of the competitive nature of business.  They could make subtle improvements in an existing shaver and price it less, but people won&#x27;t buy it because there isn&#x27;t some compelling difference.  So, companies keep trying to invent catch phrases and ambiguous functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much better can a foil shaver get?  Braun reached a major pinnacle with the 7000 series.  The Syncro line was the first introducing a head cleaning system, as well as a faster motor with side-to-side vibration.  You take a shave with a 7000 series and the new 7 series, and guess what?  You won&#x27;t feel a noticeable difference. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the 7000 series isn&#x27;t as well built as the 8000 series.  The 7000 series had some issues, most notably with the cleaner (the securing clasp weakens and won&#x27;t hold the shaver in place) and the shaver casing.  My 7000 still works, but the side grips have warped.  And it&#x27;s noisier than the 8000 series.  My 8595 is solidly built.  It works quickly, doesn&#x27;t become hot to the touch, and charges fully within 60 minutes--enough to last almost two weeks.  The cleaning station is a notable improvement over the 7000 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers have pointed out, you don&#x27;t need to use the cleaning station after each shave.  I use mine once every couple of weeks, then recap it and put it away.  In between, I just dump the whiskers into the sink after each shave.  This makes the fluid last about 20 times as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the newer 790cc series (borrowed from a friend).  I did a shaving comparison with the 8595 on one side and the 790cc on the other.  Guess what?  No difference.  Plus, the 8595 has the LCD technology that gives you more information (Braun removed this to save $$ on production costs in the later models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in my book, this is the best foil shaver you can get.  Well, the 8995 model is basically the same, with just some minor cosmetic changes to the casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re cost conscious and looking for the optimal Braun shaver, look no further than the 8595 or 8995.  :-)k, this is the best foil shaver you can get.

    <li> Overall the unit shaves good but that&#x27;s about it. The foil &amp; heads don&#x27;t last as long as indicated so need to be changeed often. The cleaning solution is also a constant purchase. Also after a while the cleaning portion stopped functioning !! I initially bought it to save money on constantly chaning razor heads but in the end quality razors are cheaper to replace than maintaining this unit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with this shaver for a year, am now giving up and going to Norelco.    The shaver screens would break every other month.  A little piece would come out that was almost invisible, producing a razor sharp edge in the screen.  Not knowing this, I would then shave and cause cuts on my face.  I&#x27;ve been through 6 of these screens despite trying to barely skim my face, resulting in a poor shave.    At $45/screen + cutting block, I&#x27;ve spent way more than the shaver itself is worth.    Braun &#x3D; Fail</li>
    <li> I tested the Noreclo Spectra and Cool Skin as well as the Panasonic.  The Panasonic shaved me the closest but led to some modest skin irritation.  The Cool Skin also shaved me close but has no on board trimmer.  The on board Nivea is a pain to use.  The Spectra did not shave nearly as close and like all Norelco shavers is difficult to clean as the heads must be taken apart periodically and soaked in alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the Activator is the answer.  I get a close and gentle shave with no irritation.  The shave is not as close as with the Panasonic but it&#x27;s a lot gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning feature really works as advertised and is a joy.  The shaver comes out as clean as new and smelling of lemons.  I no longer have a mess in my bathroom sink.  It&#x27;s wonderful having a clean shaver every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy Braun Activator shaver.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is my first electrec shaver,I have been a Gillette user all my life,I now use the Braun to replace Mach III.I was a little sceptic at first that a machine could get as good a shave as the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is a very good device, I got an excellent shave within one week of using it and my shaving time gets shorter every time (it has a little display that informs about last shave duration,total number of shaves ...). The cleaning device is very efficient(and a little noisy).All in all this is a Smart product that delivers.</li>
    <li> So I jumped on this because people were saying it doesn&#x27;t irriatate your skin. Been using it for about a month now and I can say it causes no irritation at all! At first the shaves weren&#x27;t as close as I expected them to be. But Braun said that your beard needs a good 2-3 weeks to get used to the shaver I believe. Welp, they weren&#x27;t lying... omg this shaver cuts close! I barely tried (no pulling at skin to make hairs stand up) and my chin is smooth like a babies butt! I love this shaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Norelco for years but being a gadget guy I bought the little Braun 370 Pocket Twist Plus, battery operated shaver ($10) for my car. I love that little shaver so much I bought a second for my other car. Whether I&#x27;m running late or just touching up before a meeting it gives one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with the Braun 370 that I thought I&#x27;d try out the pricy Braun 8595. What a disappointment! Forget it if you have a fast growing beard. Anything longer than a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is too long for the foil&#x27;s design. I also takes about twice as long as my Norelco to give me half as good a shave. Add in the cost of the cleaner and the bright light it&#x27;s really awful. Now it&#x27;s just taking up space in a drawer until my next garage sale.</li>
    <li> This razor works very well, but like it says in other reviews the light on it is very bright so as long as you have it in your bathroom it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> I have used many different types of shavers and manufactures in the past 45 years and with each I have returned to the trusty old blade razor.  However this time I can say that I have found one that will continue to provide a close shave without burning your face with constantly running the shaver back and forth trying to get those stubble that just won&#x27;t make their way into the cutting head.  I have now used this razor for almost a year waiting to provide an accurate review for all to refer to.  I say this as the reviews here were, in most cases less than good.  I find that the cost of the cleaning fluid to be negligible as well as being probably the reason the performance has been so good.  I say this because if you wait for Amazon to have a sale on it the cost is only $4.00 each and when you clean daily you feel like you are shaving with a new shaver each and every day.  I did try to do as some have suggested in these reviews, the method of cleaning the shaver every other day or even longer between, and can tell you that you use no more cleaning fluid doing it every day and the oils left in the razor without cleaning makes it provide a less than normal performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps some of you in your decision of purchasing this item especially at such a high end cost but it is really worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this item primarily for the self-cleaning features and the &#x27;activator&#x27; foil pattern in hopes of getting the close as a blade shave from an electric.  I also though it might be good for my bathroom sink drain as no more hairs would be getting washed away in it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  The shaver gives a pretty good shave for an electric but after a few weeks use there are still areas you need to go over several times, especially on neck to get a good shave.  And it never quite gets them all.  Kind of looks like a blade shave after a few hours, not quite a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  However, the cleaning features are fantastic.  The razor still looks like new, and I have yet to have to change the cartridge and have never seen a hair on the razor after cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  If what you are looking for is an easy to use, decent shave this is a good choice.  If you NEED the BEST shave possible, you may be disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and he loves it.  It does a great job, very close shave.  There is a sideburn trimmer.  The self cleaning apparatus is very easy to use &amp; works great.  My only complaint is that the cleaning process is a little noisy.  Also, the shipping wasn&#x27;t the best - the outer plastic casing around the shaver&#x27;s box was cracked upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Shave is very close.  I love the self cleaning feature. Amazingly quiet compared to an old Remington I had. Definitely better than the Norelco rotary in my opinion.  My hairs tend to hide from most electric razors.  The Braun does the best at getting them cut as close as possible.  The only wierdness is if I leave the shaver in the charger/cleaning unit, after time the unit wants to go to the next stage of cleaning even if I havent used it at all, example: it will go from Eco Mode to Normal Mode.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my Remington TCT3 which I rate highly and have reviewed on here too.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun previously to the Remington but that was beaten hands down by the TCT3 for overall performance. This Braun, however, is a very different story. Its precision head and comb basically make it the best electric razor that I have ever used for removing virtually all kinds of hairs. It deals swiftly and effectively with hair that lies flat against the skin which is usually becomes that scourge of dry shaving - the ingrowing hair.&lt;br /&gt;It will deal with conventional bristles over large areas like the cheek just as effectively as the TCT3 but it takes a little longer because it has two foils instead of the TCT3&#x27;s three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is superb, and gives a really refreshing shave after having been carried out. I would recommend using it maybe only weekly though, as daily is wasteful, and not called for when you can use the effective brush provided. Recharging can be carried out via the cleaner or the lead supplied. The charges last for about ten days before there is a need for recharging again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great shaver and to be recommended.</li>
    <li> I am a tough case - tough beard, soft skin.  Fifteen years ago Braun persuaded me to go electric from shaving brush, mug and safety razor. Braun 3000 series, 5000 series - last shaver was the 6550, quiet, effective, precise. I read the 8595 reviews and liked the idea of a cleaning solution because I have bought shaver cleaner/lubricant spray in the past and am careful to clean stubble out of the cutter block after every shave.  So how does the 8594 perform after 3 months?  Excellent.  I will be giving them as gifts. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS: It is quiet and effective.  The new screen moves smoothly over skin and does not bite or nick.  The cleaning process is a nice touch as it removes all the stubble and leaves the shaver like new with a lemony smell.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The new shaving screen somehow does occasionally miss a longer hair but they are easily seen and I clip them with a scissors.  The cleaning process is rather loud with the shaver cycling on and off several times.  And, the thought of paying $5 a month for cleaning solution is annoying, but I don&#x27;t.  I shave for a week, opening the screen and tapping out stubble after each shave.  Then, on the weekend I use the brush to clean out the cutter block and put the shaver in the cleaning base.  If I shake out the stubble it clicks up to an intensive clean.  If I use the small brush to clean the shaver first, it cleans at the normal level.  After three months I am still on the first cartridge -- I am guessing it will last four months or more making the annual cost of cleaning less than $15.  That&#x27;s tolerable.  Using this approach when I travel I don&#x27;t worry about the cleaning system, I take care of it when I return.  No big deal.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: Excellent shaver with useful new features as Braun continues to innovate.  Well worth a premium price.  It should last for years  --  or at least until Braun improves the line so much that you want the latest.  Give you face a break.</li>
    <li> This system really does work very well. I had been using another Braun shaver, so there was no \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period needed - a close, comfortable, fast shave right from the beginning. The cleaning system seems to work very well - I clean every other shave, and so this should extend the life of the cleaning cartridge. For me, not having to do the manual cleaning is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> This razor really does shave as close as a blade. &lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve got to try it to believe it!!</li>
    <li> The reviews here might have given me false expectations, becuase everyone said it was so good.  It&#x27;s decent.  The shave itself does seem a little closer than when I used my Gillette Fusion, but it also takes a whole lot longer to do the shave.  I think my face may be a bit worse than others because I have hair grain that goes in many directions, and also because I have a bit of fat face (double chin).  The neck definitely seems a whole lot harder to shave than my face.  I found that using Lectric Shave helps a lot, more than the oil recommended in another post, and more than not doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem is that I keep cutting myself, especially my ears when shaving my sideburns area.  I never cut myself with the Fusion, and definitely never my ears!  I have no idea why that happens, I&#x27;m very careful, but it still happens and HURTS!</li>
    <li> This is, by far the worst shaver you can buy. It is NOISY, heavy, It bites, and tonight I&#x27;m probably scarred for life. The thing took a big chunk of my lip! I normally use a norelco three head electric razor, but decided to try a Brawn, because of all the hype. My wife boughtit for Xmass and I have tried it for six months, not just the 21 days they tell you you should try it for. After the fiasco today, I&#x27;m bleeding for goodness sake, I am just throwing it in the garbage and buying another, light, quiet, smooth norelco three head razor. And a straight razor for when I need a close, close shave. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a longtime electric shaver user, so no long wait for my face to &#x27;adapt.&#x27; Past tries of variouus Norelcos burned my face badly. I last used a Panasonic Linear but not with shaving cream, which shaved better than dry but was more irritating. Both the Panasonic and Braun drag on my skin without pre-shave which I recommend. Neither shaver mentions preshaves at all. I always liked ability to clean the Panasonic with antibacterial liquid soap. However, once a new foil/cutter is used for a while, the shave quality went downhill. Finally replaced the Panasonic because battery charge time was dropping and I travel a lot. Went back to this Braun mainly because of the new foil design - hadn&#x27;t used a Braun in over 5 years. This shaves only a little better than the Panasonic, probably because the foil/cutter is new. However, there is much less irritation than any other shaver I&#x27;ve used. No one mentioned the vibration from the oscillating head - I found it annoying on the chin line when the jaw bone vibrates with it. I thought the cleaner function was a gimmick, but was used to daily cleaning the Panasonic with liquid soap and water, so worth giving the Braun cleaner a try.  However, since you can&#x27;t travel with the cleaner and I spend 20 weeks a year on the road, there is no advantage and it cannot be cleaned with water. Replacement foil/cutter is cheaper than Panasonic&#x27;s but I don&#x27;t expect the Braun foil to last 18 months, more like 8-10 months like every other shaver I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> My blade launched a relentless and savage attack on me, the blood loss was almost fatal !!!!! I turned 50 last week. I do believe my skin has changed and I could no longer continue to use a blade.  The 8595 took some getting use to and I have.  The booklet stated that a two week period was needed for my skin to become acustome to the 8595, this was the case for me.  I am now very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun before and jumped ship to Panasonic after reading some good reviews. I thought both were fine with different strong points and weak points but when Braun created the Activator shaving screen they jumped way ahead. This shaver cuts my shave time down by at least a third mostly because of its ability to take the hair off my neck under my chin....a very difficult area to cut. I&#x27;d strongly reco this series of Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> I have wet shaved for many years after failed attempts to use electric shavers. I noticed this shaver on the shelves of a local store and decided to investigate further. Based on reviews like this I decided to buy one and I have not been disappointed at all. The shaver takes a little getting used to but with a small amount of effort does shave extremely closely. The cleaning mechanism is awesome leaving a faint clean citrus smell. I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a close shave from an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a really well designed shaver.  I had one of the older Braun shavers and I thought you could not get much better.  But, this one shaves even closer.  The foil has an improved design.  The display indicating the amount of charge left on the battery is also very useful.  I end up only needing to charge it about once a week.</li>
    <li> 1. Intro:&lt;br /&gt;--I bought this to replace my Braun Syncro 7570 (which still works fine, but the cleaning base was broken so I decided to just buy the new shaver). It&#x27;s a little different.&lt;br /&gt;--A little background: Brauns are the only shavers that work for me. I&#x27;ve tried everything else (except panasonic) and I would always have to use a manual razor to finish the shave except the Brauns. This is my third Braun (after the 7570 and the 6550).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Other people&#x27;s complaints:&lt;br /&gt;--Yes the saver has to turn on for it to clean so there is noise associated with the cleaning. For eco cleaning, the intermittent noise is about 3 minutes. It&#x27;s really not that long or that loud.&lt;br /&gt;--The blue leds are bright. okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Pros:&lt;br /&gt;--Good shave (not that different form the syncro). Catches more neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;--It seems to really care about not wasting your cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;--Battery is always fully charged so if you go on a trip you just take the shaver in its nice small case and you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it for at least a week. (and the base will do a deep cleaning when you come back).&lt;br /&gt;--It just works! You don&#x27;t have to worry about maintaining it.&lt;br /&gt;--Over a long period it&#x27;s still cheaper than disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;--The drying part of of the cleaning cycle is better than the syncro. Instead of blowing air through, it heats instead. this is better than before if you have a humid bathroom, and it makes less cleaning fluid smell. (it&#x27;s probably more efficient too but I&#x27;m guessing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Cons:&lt;br /&gt;--The cleaning base makes a high pitch electronic noise when idle. It&#x27;s in the bathroom so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It definitely would in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;--There is a shaving odometer on it. It counts the number of shaves during the lifetime of the product. It can&#x27;t be reset. I list it as con because I don&#x27;t need something else keeping track of what I do. (I guess it could be a pro since you know you&#x27;re getting a brand new shaver when it&#x27;s at 0!).&lt;br /&gt;--The \\&quot;smiley face\\&quot; form the syncro is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Both pro and con:&lt;br /&gt;--The automatic cleaning. I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry/think about it but if I wanted it to go through a cycle I can&#x27;t force it. I&#x27;d have to shave for a minute and then put it back to make it clean. (I accidentally interrupted the cleaning cycle one day (it was new and I was playing with it) and it didn&#x27;t dry it. So I ended up with a wet shaver and there was nothing I could do to dry it except wait). It&#x27;s also a pro because it doesn&#x27;t just start cleaning every time you put it the the base like the old syncro.&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s like driving and automatic after you&#x27;ve been used to a stick shift, both good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;--Word of advice, don&#x27;t mess with it while it&#x27;s cleaning. Even though it&#x27;s \\&quot;locked\\&quot; you can still pull it forward and interrupt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;--I&#x27;d recommend it. In the long run it&#x27;s cheaper than disposables. Let say you have change the foil and cutter every year, and you have to put a new cleaning solution cartridge one a month.&lt;br /&gt;--Cartridge is about ~$4 for each. ~$50 a year.&lt;br /&gt;--Foil is $30 (rounded up). ~$30 a year.&lt;br /&gt;--How much would you spend on disposables in a year?5. Both pro and con:  --The automatic cleaning. I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry/think about it but if I wanted it to go through a cycle I can&#x27;t force it.

    <li> First off (gotta get this out of the way first), to the reviewer who claimed she and her husband couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open the cleaning solution by any means... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Um, flip the container over. You&#x27;re trying to open it from the large, flat back side...you&#x27;ve got it upside down. If you&#x27;d bothered to look at the other side, you&#x27;d see a cap with a ring pull on it, which opens so easily, a child could do it with his little finger. There&#x27;s an illustration in the booklet, by the way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As to the shaver itself, yes, it is indeed a \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; product. Do you need LED lights, cleaning solution, and an LCD display for a shaver? No, you don&#x27;t. But for those willing to invest, this shaver does what it claims. I just began using it today, and it gives the closest, most non-irritating shave on my stubborn beard that I&#x27;ve EVER had in an electric shaver. I shaved faster, and closer, than I ever have before using conventional Remington electric shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;m done, I invert the shaver into the stand, it tells me if it needs to be cleaned...I press the \\&quot;clean/lock\\&quot; button...and presto! No more getting hairs all over the counter cleaning my shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the money, the 8595 gives me a close, comfortable shave, and an extremely lazy man&#x27;s method of cleaning the shaver when I&#x27;m done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What more could a person ask for? This is the ultimate \\&quot;creature comfort\\&quot; for a man.</li>
    <li> I never liked using electric shavers, but this one is made,designed and drives like a german auto.  One can&#x27;t expect more from a shaver. Gives as close as you can get without a razor blade.  The self cleaning system works flawless. I bought mine on ebay.. what a mistake. Amazon &amp; braun is giving you 50 bucks now. Great gift.</li>
    <li> After using a blade all my life, I finally bit the bullet and bought this top-of-the-line electric.  There are a few things that you need to know about this shaver if you decide to switch: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1-It will get you &#x27;almost&#x27; as close as a blade.  I have some very tough, angular stubble and after several passes with this shaver, I get nearly as close as I did with a double edged razor.  It did take my face and neck a few weeks to get accustomed to electric and I need to use the fixed #2 setting on my neck but it really is amazing how close you can get. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2-The cleaning modes do work!  It is loud and it seems to take a long time but the cleaning really does seem to give you a brand new foil every time you use it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3-I get no irritation from using this shaver.  I tried a Remington years ago and it almost ate my face.  It turned me off to electric for another 15 years.  This shaver and the foil design almost completely eliminate the possibility of irritation or &#x27;nicking&#x27;.  I am pretty rough with how I use it and have even used it in, ahem, other sensitive areas and it is great! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;4-Watch out for the sideburn/moustache/beard trimmer.  I tried to clip an errant eyebrow hair and it left me with 1/4 less eyebrow with one touch.  It really works well... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;5-The LCD sytem is an expensive add-on that is useless other than telling you when the unit is done cleaning.  Then it just flashes a constant testing phase that it&#x27;s supposedly going through.  Yeah, right.  Testing what?  If the next model down is different only in this design, get that one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is the best electric shaving system on the market for someone switching from a blade, IMHO.  I used to hate shaving and would skip days at a time due to this.  Now I shave every day and don&#x27;t mind it at all!  Take the jump.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver to replace my electric Remington triple-blade.  This has proven a good shaver, and I am impressed with its functionality...self-cleaning and tells you everything.  After a few months, the shaver has lost the unrivaled closeness I got the first few weeks with the new blade, but it still does an effective job.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Battery life on this, and any other similar, Braun model is really excellent compared to my previous Remington shavers.  Although you can plug it I&#x27;ve gone two weeks with it out of the charger without degraded performance.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning cycle, however, is pretty loud; but a tradeoff, as it does result in a good cleaning job.</li>
    <li> I waited several months to write this review to make sure I had given the shaver a good deal of time to either impress or diasappoint. As the rating shows, it has impressed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First off, the shaver comes with instructions telling you to give your skin some time to adjust to the shaver. This is crucial, particularly if you&#x27;re switching from razors. The first couple of shaves were downright terrible and missed a lot of hairs. This however quickly improves, and after a few weeks, the shave will be very smooth and even. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Performance &lt;br /&gt;The shaver has exceeded all my expectations. It is true, no electric shaver can match the closeness of a razor, however, you must consider what you want this shaver for. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I personally wanted to streamline the morning routine, save myself some time and avoid the mess. With a fairly quick and careless pass, the shaver removes almost all visible stubble. Sure if you press up against the skin and rub against the grain you will feel some prickles, but I&#x27;m going to work, not a date. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the part that really impressed me. If you actually take the time to do careful passes, the resulting shave feels no different than a razor shave. The only difference I notice is the speed with which the stubble grows back. With a razor, I&#x27;m good till the next morning, maybe longer. With the shaver the stubble&#x27;s starting to come back by night time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Additionaly, there are areas around the jaw line and neck that I could never shave propperly before without much cutting and irritation, that are now easily accessible, cut free and irritation free. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only part I noticed the shaver having issues with, was along the sides of the neck where the hair grows at an odd angle, but I quickly discovered that sideways strokes would catch those hairs.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The foil is actually very good. If you find there&#x27;s an area that you can&#x27;t quite shave right, try moving the foil over the area in different directions, there&#x27;s bound to be one where the foil will catch the hairs. This versatility of strokes is an obvious advantage of the foil over a razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend a sidways stroke with a razor ;-) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So in short, as far as performace goes, if you give yourself time to shave carefully, the shave will feel as smooth as a razor. If you&#x27;re in a rush, the shave will pass anything but the \\&quot;touch test\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning &lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how wonderful this is. No mess, no hassle, just plop the shaver in, push a button and forget about it. I&#x27;ve noticed other reviews complain about the noise. I didn&#x27;t find the noise to be much louder than shaving itself. Your TV is probably louder than the cleaning cycle. Besides, for the most part, the cleaning is actually fairly silent with ocassional momments of noise.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning packs will probably end up being cheaper than buying new razors, and while I haven&#x27;t had to replace the foil and cutting block yet, I did order the parts and it was about as expensive as a cartridge of Mach3 blades. Also if you order the cleaning packs from Amazon, last I checked, buying a 3 2-packs is more cost effective than the 2 3-packs. And buying several 2-packs and the foil/cutting block replacememnt separately is cheaper than buying the package \\&quot;deal\\&quot; set. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;8595 VS 8585 &lt;br /&gt;I do not own and have not used the 8585 model so I cannot comment on it. I have seen other reviews that say the only difference is the LCD display. If this is the case, my only comments is that the LCD shows you charge remaining, minutes remaining in cleaning, and warns you when it&#x27;s time to replace the foil and cutting block along with some other info that I forget now. If you think that you want this feature like I do, get 8595, if not, save yourself $20. (Assuming that the LCD is in fact the only difference between the shavers)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s about all there is to cover on the shaver. I am very well pleased with this shaver. Not having owned any other shavers, I really cannot compare to others, but I definitely prefer the shaver to using razors. I hope the review has been helpful.</li>
    <li> I thought this is very sharp and useful. It looks cool but I could not shave perfectly and I got bleeding sometime...well, may be I don&#x27;t have good technique. I would recommend Gillette Fusion Power, it does work and it much cheaper than Braun. It&#x27;s too expensive than its quality. I gave 3 points, because I still like this engineering concept (self cleaning and cool display). A shaving solution would help it.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8595 gives a very close shave for an electric. I have problems with ingrown hair, and this razor doesn&#x27;t tear up my face like a blade does. However, I have to use it every day, where I could go 2 days between shaves with a blade. But overall, I&#x27;m no longer a blood donor every second day. The Braun is gentle on the face and sends you off to work clean-shaven with no blood and seems to help the ingrown hair problem too, once your face gets used to it (2-3 weeks).</li>
    <li> Shaving is close. We have a clean razor every time we pick it up for shaving. The only down side is the noise. Makes noise both while shaving as well as cleaning.    Good value for money if you buy it with coupons/rebates for less than [...] bucks.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever used. I especially like the self-cleaning feature. This is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a fine electric.</li>
    <li> If you buy this shaver and you don&#x27;t like it, I don&#x27;t think you really know what you were looking for. I have tried about 6 different electric shavers over the last 10 years and none of them would last more than 2 months in my house.  My skin is so sensitive that all the shavers would leave burn marks and it would be impossible to continue shaving after a while. With this new shaver, the experience is nothing but great. Only after a week of shaving I get no burn marks, the shave is very close and comfortable, and the cleaning feature is just amazing. Fresh and ready to go every time you want to shave.  I can say that this is by far the best shaver on the market right now. Don&#x27;t think about this one, just buy it.</li>
    <li> I like the shave, but am getting increasingly annoyed after two shaving heads have broken down in less than a year. The mesh seems to bend and tear and starts cutting one&#x27;s face. My replacement head broke after three months. The razor and heads are both expensive and this is not what I bargained for ...</li>
    <li> This product is top on our list of purchases.  My husband says it has been the best shaver he has ever had.  Very easy to work, clean shave.   No complaints at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad, but he decided that he didn&#x27;t need it. so i got it back i was going to return it, but I told myself what the hell I&#x27;ll try it. After that first shave, I love it ever since then. It&#x27;s been 2 years and I still haven&#x27;t change the blade I just empty it out and use the self cleaning system, it works really great. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this products in 05 and my husband still uses it it today; ten years later. Cleaning solution still available, but a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Can someone who has both the new Activator and an older 7000 series shaver try putting the new foil on the older shaver?  I need a new foil for my 7680 and I&#x27;d like to try the Activator foil if it will fit.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. The shaver is ok at best because it does not give me a very close shave. It really fails in these specific areas - on my chin and around my neck. There is always some small stubble left in these areas and I have to use my blade to give me a closer shave. In addition, I noticed that there is always some stubble that this shaver fails to cut at all. If I don&#x27;t look closely before I am done, then I will leave the house with a little more stubble than I want on my face.  &lt;br /&gt;The best part about this shaver is the cleaning mechanism. Once I am finished, I just stick it in the dome cleaning appartus and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore.  &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I need a more powerful shaver and I am considering purchasing the panasonic 8095nc for a test drive.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This may be suited for other types of people but I am not sure if it is the best shaver for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Activator recently when I switched from the Panasonic 8092 wet/dry shaver -- great shave but a poorly constructed and poorly supported product from a very customer-UNFRIENDLY company. Even though this is a traditional dry shaver, my first impressions are that it is anything but traditional in the level of technology built into it. The shave I get is amazingly close -- not as close as the Panasonic wet/dry nor a regular razor -- but with NO razor burn. That&#x27;s what amazed me the most: the level of closeness, the lack of any razor burn or irritation, the quickness of the shave and the quality of construction and design. If you&#x27;re searching for an electric razor, don&#x27;t let the price of the Braun Activator scare you off -- so far, for me, it&#x27;s more than worth it. I expect to be using this razor for many years to come -- Braun&#x27;s also known the high-quality of the customer support, unlike Panasonic. Good luck!    UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for more than two months now, and my initial impressions have been surpassed! It&#x27;s a terrific product -- shave is EXTREMELY close, no razor burn and no need for any pre-shave product. The best thing is that the cleaning solution is only half used, despite an intensive cleaning at least once a week. So, in reality, you will NOT be spending $10 bucks each month to replenish the solution. Get the Braun Activator ... you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Activator shaving system for Christmas. Now I know that all electric razors take a while to cut good but after a month it was still cutting horribly. I would spend 3 times as longs as I did with a regular razor just trying to shave my neck. For the hefty price tag it should cut like a dream but buyer beware. My Activator also broke after having it one month. I took great care of it always putting it back in the charger after I was done with it and cleaning it regularly. But now the LCD display will not work. At first it started flickering and now it won&#x27;t display anything. It may be the right razor for some people but for more than $150 you&#x27;d better make sure you&#x27;re one of those people or else you&#x27;re going to end up with a broken razor that doesn&#x27;t even cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun was however very helpful when I called them and I was able to return it no sweat.</li>
    <li> I fell so bad when I think of all the money I have spent on blades. Compared to that this is more than worth its price. I have been using it since Feb,2005 and after the first two months I can honestly say that this is a very good product. Though I must admit the LCD display is nonsense since it does not display anything but battery level. They could have done it with three tinyleds and save us some more money. But anyway I am really happy with this product. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used a cheap Remington for a number of years and was getting tired of the irritation and occasional nicks, so I figured it was time to give a new shaver a try.  I saw a rave review of this shaver in a Men&#x27;s magazine, thought the self-cleaning thing was a bit gimmicky, but decided to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is \\&quot;Wow\\&quot;!  Of course, going from a $39 razor to a ~$200 razor is probably not a good comparison, but here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It really doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my Remington did.  Of course, that means that my neck is no longer nicked and beet-red after a shave.  I consider this a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The self-cleaning thing is not a gimmick.  It rocks!  I discovered how good it is when I went out of town for a week.  The base isn&#x27;t sealed, so you can&#x27;t travel with it--no worries though, the shaver comes with a brush, and the cord plugs directly into the shaver as well as into the base.  Well, after a couple of days of just using the brush to clean it, I found that the shave just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable.  I don&#x27;t know if it was oil from my skin building up, or just my imagination; however, once I got home and cycled it through the cleaner, it was as good (and comfortable) as new.  Note that the cleaning fluid is a lubricant (supposedly) mixed with denatured alcohol and it works.  Popping open the top reveals an immaculate interior, even after having not cleaned it for five shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Blue LED&#x27;s suck.  The LED on the base of the shaver could light your entire house.  Can you say \\&quot;Black Sharpie\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The self-cleaning cycle is not something you want to do at night (note that you initiate it manually, so you can control this).  It runs the shaver to assist in the cleaning process and is a bit on the noisy side.  Especially because it&#x27;s intermittent.  It will be quiet for 5 minutes, then suddenly run the razor for 15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Battery life isn&#x27;t really what I expected.  At six to seven minutes per shave, it consumes (at least based on the graphic on the LCD panel) about 20% of the battery.  Not a show-stopper, more of an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. NO MORE SHAVING WITH A RAZOR!!  One of the annoying \\&quot;features\\&quot; of my Remington was if I skipped shaving for a couple of days, my beard would be too long for the Remington to pick up.  Because of this, I would have to shave with a razor.  Braun addresses this by having a \\&quot;long hair cutter\\&quot; (if you will) in the center of the shaving head.  It really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The swivel head thing is pretty cool.  It really does work and isn&#x27;t annoying like I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Lifespan of the cleaning cartridge is a bit short.  I get between a month and a month-and-a-half out of a cartridge before I have to replace it.  Note that the shaver doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;use\\&quot; the fluid up through the cleaning process per se.  It is recycled back into the cartridge, along with your whiskers.  When it sucks the fluid back up, it is through a filter.  This means that the loss of fluid is due to evaporation exclusively, so the whole \\&quot;Eco\\&quot; clean thing is a bit hoaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the shaver and have recommended it to a couple of my friends.  At $200, it&#x27;s a bit pricy, but with some of the deals Amazon has been running, it comes down quite a bit.  I would consider it a steal at $100 and reasonable at $150.minutes per shave, it consumes (at least based on the graphic on the LCD panel) about 20% of the battery.  Not a show-stopper, more of an observation. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;6. NO MORE SHAVING WITH A RAZOR!!

    <li> Update - I got Braun&#x27;s newest model (9595) for Christmas 2007. It is improved, and the improvements are worth it. Fortunately it still uses the same cleaning cartridges as prior models.Below is my original review of the 8595:&lt;br /&gt;You often get what you pay for. In this case, it&#x27;s true. I had been using a Braun 7500 series for the past 4 years and was quite pleased with it since I have sensitive skin. My son now needs his first razor so I gave him that one and treated myself to the new, top-of-the-line Braun. I was a bit apprehensive because I read some less than stellar reviews but I should have considered the source - obviously inexperienced men who did NOT wait at least three weeks to give their face time to adapt to the new razor as per the instructions. Also, one person panned the razor because of the loud cleaning system. Get a life! The Brauns are the ONLY electric razors with a cleaning system, and it could not function unless the razor is running during the cleaning process.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is much better than the previous model in every way, and the prior model was the best out there at the time. Excellent, smooth, close shave. Electronics are better, too , as far as the display. Better cleaning function, and there is now a display of how much cleaning fluid is left.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this razor without any reservations, if you can afford it.</li>
    <li> !!~3.5 Stars~!! &lt;br /&gt;minus 1 star for messy shave &lt;br /&gt;minus .5 star for buzzing sound from charger &lt;br /&gt;3 stars for coolness! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying this shaver is a MONSTER. I just had my first shave with the 8585 this morning. There are 3 settings for shaving: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1 - Normal shave &lt;br /&gt;2 - tilted head for hard to reach parts (under the nose) &lt;br /&gt;3 - the TRIMMER aka THE PLOWER!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I decided not to shave until I got my 8585, which was about 2 weeks without shaving. Here&#x27;s how it went: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- I started off using setting 1 on my cheeks. AMAZING job. Honestly the closest shave with an electric shaver. Baby butt clean, seriously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Time to move on to the chin... oh man... Setting 1, basically started to pull the hairs from my chin. I actually had to turn off the razor and use my hands to pull the hair caught in the razor. Same thing happened with setting 2. I think this is where most people have problems with the shaver. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then it is time to move to SETTING 3... THE PLOWER!! The hairs on my chin were about a good 3/4 of an inch long. The trimmer just plowed through it. And it left it looking evenly shaved, not too thick and not too short. But I wanted a full clean shave so I went back to setting 1 and shaved it like how I shaved my cheeks.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, the two problems I have with the shaver is that its though getting hairs on the neck. It takes some skill and a certain shaving motion to get those hairs. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Second, using the trimmer on a full beard is just messy... I advise doing over a sink. Plus the shaver isn&#x27;t that great at catching all the smaller hairs.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly, the shaver leaves a few hairs after cleaning. My syncro 7526 was super clean after cleaning. Found that to be weird.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a last note, the activator screen is amazing on small short hairs, like the cheeks. USE the trimmer for the chin at first, then settings 1 or 2. Its a great shaver and it offers amazingly close shaves, you just have to know how to get it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun and this one surpasses all of the previous models - wish I had gotten it sooner.  Before I got it I thought that the cleaning system was superfluous; after using the cleaning cycle on a daily basis for several weeks now I would not want to be without it! The new design of the cutterhead is a significant improvement over older models.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for Norelco&#x27;s supposedly high-end Smarttouch XL 9190XL, which did not shave closely enough for my tastes.  The Braun is much heavier and as loud as an electric lawnmower.  While the self-cleaning unit gets the job done it is large and bulky, too big to store on a bathroom countertop of limited size.  The unit is not well-suited for travel.  With the lower weight limits for checked baggage on all the airlines these days, ounces count when packing for a long trip and this model just weighs too much.  Packing the cleaning unit for travel would be out of the question.  The shaving closeness is only marginally better than the Norelco.  I&#x27;m still searching for the holy Grail of electric razors.</li>
    <li> Pros: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Close shave, for an electric &lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use, clean, and keep charged with the cleaning base &lt;br /&gt;-Major gadget points with the cleaning base &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;-Expensive &lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning base requires refill cartridges (estimated to last 1-2 months each) &lt;br /&gt;-Difficult to clean by hand (if traveling) &lt;br /&gt;-Loud &lt;br /&gt;-Not as portable as some units &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can think of only two reasons why we (men) use electric shavers: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. They are quicker, cleaner, and easier to use than a blade. &lt;br /&gt;2. They are gadgets, and everything is better with power. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Based on that bit of information, the Braun Activator is a resounding success, but only on the second point. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like most men, I learned to shave the old fashioned way. No, not with a straight-razor and leather strap, I&#x27;m not that old. I learned using a safety razor and a bottle of shaving cream. As I got older, and the time between getting up and getting to school/work/etc. narrowed, and breakfast went the way of the dodo, so I sought out a way to cut down the daily 5 minutes it took to shave and clean up. About 8 years ago I started using a Norelco rotary shaver and figured I had found it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Basics &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For those who are not familiar with electric shavers, there&#x27;s basically two types: foil and rotary. Rotaries are the ones with two or three circular screens on the top. Foil shavers, like this Braun, have a rectangular screen, or \\&quot;foil,\\&quot; at the top. On average, foil cuts closer, but rotary cuts long and/or tough hair better. Oh, and in case you&#x27;re REALLY new, NO electric shaver comes as close as a blade (gimme my money back, Remington). Braun make the highest rated foils. Norelco make the highest rated rotaries. There is a \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; shaver style out there, too, but I haven&#x27;t tried them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Incumbent &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for years, most recently the Norelco Quadra. It was the answer to my original need for speed. It was fast, easy, and didn&#x27;t need constant cleaning. On an average day, it cut close enough for my purposes. On the best day it was acceptable for more formal occasions, but I usually brought out the blade for such events. I always wondered, though, if the foils were really that much better at getting a close shave without the need for shaving cream and a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Challenger &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is a foil shaver better? To find out, I went whole hog and bought the Braun Activator. Well, after 3 weeks of use, I have decided it probably isn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Again, for those who don&#x27;t know much about electric shavers, the manufacturers say you need to give them at least a few weeks before making a firm decision, probably to make it harder to return to the store. . .oh, did I say that? Anyway, they say that it takes time for your skin to adjust to a new type of shaving. I wouldn&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve never had razor burn, skin irritation, or felt the need to use aftershave. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Oh, and I don&#x27;t read the manuals,  watch drama, or put the toilet seat down, either. Are we clear? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shave Closeness &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I&#x27;ve been living with the Braun for 3 weeks now, and my face should have done any adjusting it needed to do. After the first few days with the Braun, I could clearly tell that the foil shaver consistently cut closer than the rotary shaver. It was also more thorough and seemed to miss fewer hairs. Being an electric, it didn&#x27;t require any shaving cream or major cleanup, either. The shaver is nice and heafty, with a solid metal case. It would make a heck of a projectile. It also makes it easy to direct around the face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Appearance &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver and base look pretty cool together, too. It&#x27;s almost like a little sculpture sitting there on your countertop. The LEDs and the LCD make you think it&#x27;s about to connect to the Internet, take pictures of you naked, and send them to all yourfriends. For all I know, it did. I told you, I didn&#x27;t read the manual. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving Effort &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sure, it cuts closer, but it&#x27;s also much more sensitive to the angle at which you hold the head, how fast you move it, and the direction you move it. In order to get the best shave, you have to move the head \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot; and move it slowly. It also tends to take more passes over the same area to get the best results. It&#x27;s like mowing a lawn with a dull lawnmower blade. A rotary shaver, being circular, doesn&#x27;t care which direction you move it or how fast you go. Shaving with the Braun is much more like shaving with a blade. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shaving Comfort &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, it now takes me twice as long, or more, to shave when compared to the Norelco, and I can shave just as fast with a regular razor and get a much closer shave. Also, the closeness of the shave with the Braun comes at the cost of an apparently higher rate of nicks. I&#x27;ve had the thing for 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve had 3 nicks already (all around the jawline/chin, and no, I didn&#x27;t cry). This is more than I had in 8 years of using a Norelco. In fact, that&#x27;s more than I get with a razor. That&#x27;s OK, though. Scars are cool, right? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is also incredibly loud. This is due mostly to the fact that the shaving head behind the foil vibrates at high RPM while shaving. Though not uncomfortably loud or jarring, it is an annoyance and is likely to wake up someone in the next room or county. Yes, the Norelco also makes some noise, but it is MUCH quieter and you don&#x27;t have to run it as long to get a decent shave, which makes it better for husbands who don&#x27;t want to wake up grumpy (just let her sleep) before slipping off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When it comes to cleaning, the Braun is a mixed bag. The base unit that it comes with is nice. Just drop the shaver in, hit the button, and in about 30-40 minutes (depending on level of cleaning required), you get a fresh, clean shaver. It&#x27;s also kind of entertaining the first few times in a \\&quot;let&#x27;s get some beer and watch the bug zapper\\&quot; sort of way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re home, but what if you&#x27;re traveling? The base doesn&#x27;t travel. It gets homesick. It has a small reservoir of cleaning fluid inside it that can, and will, spill out even if you&#x27;re just moving it across the countertop. Let&#x27;s just say this wouldn&#x27;t make it through airport security. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Travel &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thus when you&#x27;re on the road, you&#x27;ll have to clean it by hand. The procedure is long, complicated, and reminds me of field stripping and cleaning an M1911 Colt (minus the cool factor). In short, it&#x27;s easier to rebuild a Chevy small block than put this thing back together after manual cleaning. If you&#x27;re going to be traveling for more than a few days, pack your regular razor and shaving cream. Strike one against traveling. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For comparison, cleaning the Norelco involves pressing a button to flip open the top, dumping out the hair, and, if you&#x27;re really gung-ho, rinsing in water. Ten seconds, max. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun comes with a nice plastic carrying case, but it doesn&#x27;t have anywhere for the wall plug to go. This is probably fine for shorter trips, but it would have been nice to have space for the charger. It does have a little custom-fit space for the included cleaning brush, though, so at least you can clean it by hand, provided you don&#x27;t have to do anything else on your trip such as work (see above). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Expense &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that the Braun base requires cleaning solution? Yeah. In addition to buying one of the most expensive shavers on the market, you&#x27;ve got to buy cleaning solution cartridges. Each cartridge costs about $4-6 and supposedly lasts 1-2 months. Oh, and you have to buy new razor heads every year, too. The manufacturer says that manual cleaning is essentially only for emergencies and should be followed by cleaning in the base the normal way ASAP. I think the shavergets addicted to the cleaning fluid and goes into withdrawal after a few days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Final Impression &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks of use, here&#x27;s my impression of the Braun. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor but closer than a rotary; it&#x27;s harder to use than a Norelco; it&#x27;s expensive; it&#x27;s noisy; it cuts your hair, and your face; it&#x27;s more expensive to maintain; and it&#x27;s harder to travel with than a car sick dog. But hey, it&#x27;s cool looking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you want a close shave, get a real razor. If you want fast and easy, get a rotary. If you want your neighbors to think aliens landed their craft on your bathroom counter (complete with flashing lights and sound effects), get the Braun.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 8595 for my husband last Christmas.  He was a Norelco user and he is very picky.  He loves it.  He said he gets a super close shave. It doesn&#x27;t pull his wiskers.  He likes the fact that he doesn&#x27;t have to clean his razor.  I bought another 8595 for my brother&#x27;s birthday. He also was a Norelco user.  He thinks it&#x27;s great too.  I recommend paying a little extra for the 8595, as I think it tells you when to change the solution.  When you put the razor in it&#x27;s cradle, you do hear it being cleaned. It makes a hum that last for less than a minute.</li>
    <li> Comfortable to shave with.  Cleaning mechanism is very good.  Shaves well but not a replacement for a blade razor.  Held a charge on a trip for 10 days which was good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for two years now.  It was my first electric razor.  I have replaced the blade once, I am due for a replacement this fall.  It works great, shaves close with out bothering my skin.  I shave every other day but I could go every day if needed.  The cleaning function works well and keeps it fresh and operating smoothly.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my Dad for Christmas.  He loves it!  Says it works great.</li>
    <li> Was this Braun&#x27;s attempt to fix the inherent design flaw with the Syncro&#x27;s cleaning system? I have had my Syncro cleaning unit in 4 times in the last year for replacement of the upper housing parts, which the repair center says is a known (and admitted) problem. I can see that this has a different design - no more \\&quot;arm\\&quot; that must lock into the shaver for cleaning like with the Syncro?    I am seriously thinking about buying an Activator based on the good reviews, and since the next time my Syncro cleaner unit goes bad, I am out another $50-$60, which I would rather put towards the new Activator</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  I have a cowlick on my ghotee that is a nightmare to shave, but a couple passes from this and I&#x27;m good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I am in a unique situation when it comes to shaving.  I had some reconstructive jaw surgery some years ago that left me with a damaged nerve in my lower face.  As a result I can&#x27;t shave with regular blade razors because the feeling of pain in my jaw area is amplified from the nerve damage.  As a result I have to use an electric razor which doesn&#x27;t pull at the hair as much.  This razor was the perfect solution because it gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve had so far with an electric razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A very nice perk to this razor as well is that when it cleans it smells incredible.  I feel like I&#x27;m shaving with aftershave already on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About the only downside I can think of is that the cleaning cycle is loud.  I think the clean cycle is based on the amount of battery left as well.  So it assumes a certain degree of use based on it&#x27;s battery.  Regardless, it is loud when it cleans.  But that&#x27;s not a big deal for me &#x27;cause I just clean it after I shave in the morning so I&#x27;m at work while it&#x27;s going. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I deffinitely recommend this razor to anyone needing a good clean shave.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far in the world of electric razors.</li>
    <li> I have tired other electric razors - 3 different Norelco shavers but mainly used a Mach 3 or a Quattro, over the past 30 years.    I cannot say enough positive things about my new 8595 Activator by Braun. This is my only razor from now on.  This razor is truly as excellent as all the positive reviews you read here, say it is.  My face was used to the switch from my Mach 3 to the 8595 Activator within 3 days - some thing that never happened with any of the Norelco products (dry or wet shavers). Shaving is a joy like it was when I first started shaving.  The self-cleaning system is easy to use and keeps the razor shaving like new each time you use it.    PLUS - there&#x27;s a 30 day trial period when you can return the product to Braun, if you don&#x27;t like what the 8595 does.    UPDATE - July 28, 2007  I still love this razor and will never go back to a wet safety razor shave.  It is still a joy to shave each morning.  Excellent razor.  I did purchase a 360 replacement head and used it in this razor - same size, etc.  It seems to shave closer with the new type of replacement head.  No need to buy a new razor to get that reward!  I replace the head after 12 months.  Always use a pre-shave!</li>
    <li> I have previously owned 5 Braun shavers, my last one being a 7000 series which lasted for about 5 years. I was very happy with my 7000 series shaver, but I recently dropped it and the popup trimmer mechanism broke about a week later. Except for my 7000 series shaver, the recharable batteries in all of my previous shavers died within 2-3 years. Continuing to use them on AC only eventually caused the battery charging circuitry to blow-out, as the batteries would no longer take a charge. The move to NiMH batteries in the newer shavers seems to have corrected that problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Activator is well-made, well-balanced, and provides an exceptional shave. The automatic cleaning function has been improved since the 7000 series in two respects. It now has the intelligence to determine how dirty the shaver is, and enters one of three different cleaning programs to conserve the cleaning solution. It also has a more sophisticated battery charging program that will vary the charging mode to provide the longest battery life possible. As far as shaving is concerned, the main improvement seems to be the foil and cutter design. Without exaggeration, this shaver provides a noticably closer shave than my 7000 series ever did with a new foil/cutter -- and that was a pretty good shave. The motor is strong, and the vibration is comparable to my 7000 series. The cleaning/charging base is the same size as the old except that the arm that extended upwards to lock the shaver in place is gone. This is a nice redesign, as it blends in better with the bathroom decor. The advanced cleaning programs will also clean the shaver in less time if a full cleaning cycle is not required. Also, the cleaning cartridges are  the same as those for the 7000 series, which is nice if you have a few unopened ones on hand as I do! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although it kills me to spend so much on a new shaver when my 7000 worked so well, this is a very good shaver and I am happy with my purchase. The shave is betterthan before, and the unit itself seems to be well-made and well-designed. The new foil desing seems to be the major advancement, and the improved cleaning/charging system is well thought-out. Although all of this may seem like unnecessary gimmicry, you will get an awesome shave and a well-made unit that will probably last for many years to come. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost. My 8 year old Remington actually gave me a closer shave but it was tired and worn out. Save your money and buy a more economic shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a low cost Remington, thinking that since it was so much more expensive that it would work better. &lt;br /&gt;The shave was okay, but not any better than the Remington. &lt;br /&gt;Certainly not worth the money. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also upset that Amazon will not take it back. It has to be returned to Braun, and I have to wait 6-8 weeks for a refund (per Braun). &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to save him on time in the bathroom and give me more time.  He loves it and will even do it walking around as it catches the hair.  It cleans great and shaves close. Great product for him and I.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had a 5610 Flex XP cordless electric razor for last two years and bought this one few weeks back. What I wanted was to get a better shave on my neck area which they have advertised as great. I should say I am not 100% impressed by the shave in the neck region. Still I have to move around in different directions to get all the hair out. I am talking about a growth of 2/3 days. My older 5610 Flex XP does a similar job and I would say the improvement in 8595 is 15% more. Over all the system is very good and the cleaning is excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of the other norelco models from costco, but this is the only one that works for me.  With the other brands, I never felt like it was actually close enough and the big head on the other brands made me miss spots.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So what I don&#x27;t like is: &lt;br /&gt;Cartriges are expensive (you can get them cheaper at taget) &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get certain spots in the grooves of my neck &lt;br /&gt;Takes longer than blade shaving &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning system is loud, have to make sure I&#x27;m leaving &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I do like: &lt;br /&gt;SELF CLEANING &lt;br /&gt;Does a pretty decent job when you don&#x27;t feel like being careful  &lt;br /&gt;Can buy it at Costco and return if you don&#x27;t like &lt;br /&gt;Refills are easy to find &lt;br /&gt;The clean smell is very nice &lt;br /&gt;Asthetically pleasing shape  &lt;br /&gt;Carrying case is pretty good  &lt;br /&gt;Tells you when you need to replace the blade</li>
    <li> When this one wears out, I&#x27;ll be going back to a Norelco.  It&#x27;s like a vacuum cleaner that requires you to go over the same piece of lint 15 times before picking it up.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun 6520 for 4.5 years. My Dad gave me his Braun 8595 because he bought the new model. He said the cutter and foil were relatively new (6 months or a year old). He said I just needed to buy the cleaning catridge. I spent about $11. My first shave and it felt as if it was pulling the hairs out, not cutting. I gave it a few days, but didn&#x27;t feel it was doing any better a job than my 6520, which worked fine. I decided to return the unit to my father as I no longer had any interest in painful shaves. I told him if he bought me a new cutter and foil I&#x27;d try again. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $40 on it without knowing it would solve my problem. Well, after I got the new cutter and foil, I tried again. It did not pull, but did not shave any better than the 6520. To put it in persepctive, the 6520 has the original cutter and foil (4.5 years old now) and has not been cleaned in about 6 months or more and did an equal job. Therefore, unless the cleaning mechanism intrigues you, the cost is unjustified. I tried the new model also and didn&#x27;t think it was any better. Therefore, if you find a less expensive model, you may want to buy that instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 4 months, and it&#x27;s great!  I get a much closer shave than I expected.  I used to use blade, but I keep cutting myself.  Got this unit as a gift from my wife, and totally love it!  The cleaning system is ok, I mean, it does a very good job of cleaning.  The shaver has 3 levels of cleaning (eco, normal, and intensive).  I&#x27;ve only seen the shaver telling me it needs intensive clean, but never the other two.  From 1 shave, it goes from not needing any cleaning yet to &#x27;intensive cleaning needed&#x27;...what happened to eco and normal?  Makes me think is my shaver faulty, or is Braun trying to rip me off, making me having to buy more cleaning solutions!  Anyone else having this issue?</li>
    <li> Best shaver on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved with a dry electric for over 10 years, and believe that this is by far the best shaver I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth your consideration.</li>
    <li> This is only my second review, I feel I had to do it since this is such a good product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used to own a top of the line Philishave rotary, the new Braun 8595 is by far a superior shave. &lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and after shaving with my Philips, the skin on my neck was irritated and red for hours, even after purchasing and installing new heads. &lt;br /&gt;With the Braun 8595, no more irritation and a much closer shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks, I already bought 2 years worth of cleaning solution, so I know I am keeping this puppy for a long time. You feel like you are using a brand new shaver every time you shave. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So if you have sensitive skin, this one is a no-brainer, run to the store and get the Braun 8595, you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have over the years used several Braun shavers, panasonic, norelco, and remington.  I think the accolades for this shaver must depend on what you expect.  This produces an average shave, nothing more.  If you look at the reviews for the model without the LCD, there are additional complaints in this area.    I had to replace the cutter and foil after only 8 months.  Do not expect to get 18 months as indicated by the manufacturer, it will not happen.    The previous Synchro shaver I bought had the cleaner base break in a month.    This model is definately far superior in that regard.  I have had no problems.    However, the shave itself is average.  The new design is no improvement at all, and neck hairs are near impossible to shave.    I think the Panasonic high speed shaver is superior to this, at about half the price.    This product is way too expensive for its ability, and you keep paying and paying to use it.</li>
    <li> I have discovered a universal truth that no one has ever taken the time to tell me about shaving: settle for mediocrity.  Your face does not have to feel like a baby&#x27;s butt. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, if you want it to, this razor can do just that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have always had trouble with shaving; entailing constant razor burn and acne.  I was a blade guy because when I took the trouble to shave I wanted it to be close.  Well this razor gets close and the foil prevents the common mistake of shaving too close.  My razor burn healed in a few days.  It only took about a week for me to adjust completely to the razor and become a true convert. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used to dread shaving and thus tried to avoid it.  I would knick and cut myself literally hundreds of times, but I look forward to shaving with this thing.  It leaves my face feeling tingly, but definitely not cut to shreds.  I use it every single day and everybody who knows me notices that I look better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor is also very hygenic.  The automatic cleaning it gets every day can only be good for my skin.  The razor head smells like lemons after a cleaning and it is very refreshing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Moms, buy this for your sons.  Girlfriends, buy this for your boyfriends.  Sisters, buy this for your brothers.  Grandma, buy it for grandpa.  You get the idea.  It is great!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is the BEST.  I have used Norelco products for 10yrs.  Last one was the Quadra.  I have always had a horrible problem with ingrown hairs on my neck.  I was actually contemplating laser treatment it was so bad.  After a week of using the Activator I no longer have a problem with the ingrown hairs!  This product saved my neck!  The Activator doesnt miss hairs like the Quadra, especially on the neck where the Quadra always missed lots of hairs.  As for closeness I would rate them equal.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the other reviews before buying this shaver. A lot of people say it&#x27;s the best dry shaver ever. I have to say that I&#x27;m disappointed. My old Norelco three head electric gave me a closer shave than this Braun. I&#x27;ve given this one a month for my face to &#x27;get used to&#x27; the new shaver, but I&#x27;ve only noticed a marginal difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the gimicks. The LCD is useful. Self cleaning is cool, although I&#x27;ve only put it in there four times so far, and it&#x27;s already telling me that I&#x27;m going to have to change the liquid soon - great.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The thing is, though, that when I buy a $150+ shaver, I expect a really really good shave. And this is merely average. Like I said, my Norelco was closer. I feel like the hairs grow back quicker with the Braun too, and frankly the shave doesn&#x27;t look as clean in the mirror either. Maybe it&#x27;s just my face, but I don&#x27;t think my face is that much different than the next person&#x27;s.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using it - I&#x27;m just disappointed that my money hasn&#x27;t gone further.</li>
    <li> I received the 8595 Braun Activator Model for my birthday and secretly thought that all its printed features were pure hype. &lt;br /&gt;How surprized I was when I actually started shaving with this model. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Informatively, since I am retired it is not necessary for me to shave every day, and since I do not really find it pleasureable to shave, especially with the maintenance, etc., that comes in different forms, I skip many days and shave when only when necessary. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My last shaver was the Panasonic wet/dry rechargeable Shaver, for which I paid close to 250 dollars and found lacking all the hype that went on in advertisisng this shaver.  It took forever to complete a shave, but since I had some old Norelco models, I would at times use 2 razors to complete the job. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now for the 8595 Braun Activator:  Following closely the instructions which recommeded that the face be dry and to shave prior to washing,  it did away with the Pre-Electric lotions that have increased in price. So, with Shaver in hand I commence shaving and notice that it is the closest shave I have ever had with an electric razor. Now comes the best part: No use running hot water over the shaver head, as in the case of the Panasonic Shaver, I had to use liquid soap in the cleaning when Shaver indicated cleaning, and there was an indicator for recharging.  With my 8595 model Braun, when I finish shaving I place the shaver in the station and it automatically does all the rest.  When setting up the shaver for first use, there is a cleaning cartridge that is inserted into the station. One just follows the instructions.  The cleaning cartridge should last about a month and sells for about 5 dollars each. No other stuff is needed. It is recommeded to shave daily. So when the cartridge is inserted and the station is connected to an ac outlet, you just shave and return the razor into the station and as advertised it automatically does the rest. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver automatically adusts when one uses the sideburn trimmer, etc. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Regarding the cleaning cartridge as mentioned above, if it is used daily it lasts 30 days, if not used daily it should last &lt;br /&gt;approximately 8 weeks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So here it is:  Cleaning and lubrication plus re-charging the battery is all done automatically as advertised. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this Razor and now shaving is just as simple as I have always wished it would be. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver. This from an individual that has gone through many a shaver, hoping for the best, but disappointed in actual performance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I would have added a few more stars in addition to the five stars in the rating. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Robert Lyons &lt;br /&gt;Reno, Nevada &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I owned a previous model and was very happy with it but was intriqued by the new head design on this model.  As good as the previous version was this one is even better.  Closer shave in less time.  Highly recommended.    Update April 2007: I wrote the orignial review about 18 months ago.  By way of update, the blades need to be changed more frequently than the recommended 18 months.  Other than that I still love this shaver.</li>
    <li> I read all the amazon reviews before purchasing this razor, but there are a few things I didn&#x27;t really consider that I wish had known before I bought it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think many people have already discussed the positives, so I will focus on other topics. I agree that the razor provides a closer shave than my old norelco, but it also takes me longer to shave and I do miss more hairs. In particular I have trouble with hairs on my neck and hairs next to my ears (where my sideburns would be). The shape of the razor makes it difficult to get to the hairs closest to my ears. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The razor is a lot louder than my old razor, so I am frequently worried about waking people up. Even louder than shaving though is the cleaning function. The problem with this is that it takes between 30 and 50 minutes for the razor to clean itself using the base unit. It only actually makes noise intermittently during that time, but when it does it is very loud (and frequently startling for other people if they walk into the bathroom and all the sudden it starts going off). Again, having something making noise that loud off and on for 50 minutes makes it difficult to find a time where I can clean it without worrying about waking someone up (I of course wake up earlier than anyone else in my house, so this may not be a problem for some people). As an aside, you can&#x27;t effectively stop the cleaning once you&#x27;ve started it, so it is not pleasant when you start the cleaning and then realize you missed hairs...probably on your neck or next to your ears. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In spite of its noise, I do like the cleaning function, and I think it cleans well. I also think it may help keep acne at bay. The other drawback of the cleaning though is that the extent of the cleaning is out of your control. That is to say, you can&#x27;t shave three times and do a quick clean (or atleast I haven&#x27;t figured out how to). The razor keeps track of how long you&#x27;ve shaved since your last cleaning and chooses a length ofcleaning time based on that. So, it forces you to use more cleaning solution than is probably necessary. As someone who works for a company that employs similar strategies, I can assure you this is not an accident. Braun makes its highest margins on the solution sales. They consist of about 10 cents of alcohol/water and 25 cents of plastic, but cost $5, so it is a way to drive after market revenue. They&#x27;ve also been designed so that you can&#x27;t refill/reuse them. It&#x27;s a smart strategy for Braun because otherwise electric razors are not a particularly profitable business compared to disposable blades--but it&#x27;s not so great if you&#x27;re the consumer.</li>
    <li> This is a very good dry shaver. I have been using it daily. The cleaner solution leaves a very clean feeling for the shaver. It is a nice product. By the way, this is my first electric shaver. &lt;br /&gt;after first few days, u get used to it.</li>
    <li> My son liked mine so much, I ordered him one for his birthday! I wrote a review on this shaver when I got mine last year and am glad to say, I still love it. So does my son.</li>
    <li> So I used to be a Razor man (2/3 blade models), but got tired of the irritation it caused my sensitive skin.    So I got this one and have used it for about 2 months, and what a difference. If you have sensitive skin you should consider this item.     For good results though your skin needs to be dry and DO NOT use just before your morning shower as your skin will swell around your hairs and ... ouch. A daily wash cloth against the grain of your hair growth helps a lot too.    One last item is that some people don&#x27;t like to alcohol used in the cleaning cartridges, but I dissagree. The alcohol regularly disinfects your shaver so you do not support a bateria colony in the thing you most often rub against your face...</li>
    <li> I have had several razors over the years and this is by far the best. The fact that is cleans itself is just a bonus. The main benifit is in how well it shaves. It&#x27;s no match for a blade when it comes to closeness, but who cares. It cuts all of my hairs in the first pass, no other electric has ever done that for me and it cuts closer than any electric I&#x27;ve ever used. With my last shaver, an expensive Norelco, I would have to go over my neck several times in every direction to get most of the hairs. I find myself shaving twice with this one just out of habit, but it&#x27;s not really necessary. The cleaning cycle is about as noisy as the shaver is when it&#x27;s being used, so if your wife is sleeping right next to the bathroom, that may not be to great. The Cleaning cycle, cycles on and off so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s making constant noise. My wife gets up before I do, so for us it&#x27;s not a problem at all.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I really like my new razor.</li>
    <li> but this will do until it comes along.  By far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric.  It still won&#x27;t get some of those annoying wirey hairs, but it gets enough of them for everyday use.  Gets most of the rest of my face in one or two passes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: big bulky recharge unit.</li>
    <li> The first time that I shaved with this razor I could immediately notice a difference. It is definitely worth the price and I would highly recommend it. This is the best razor out there.</li>
    <li> First electric shaver that has given me a blade close shave! Would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the morning hassle of the blade and shave cream routine.</li>
    <li> Number of shaves with the Activator: 431    Shave frequency: Once every 3 days    Battery life: Up to 3 or 4 weeks on one charge.    Shave quality: I have semi-sensitive skin and the razor irritated my face slightly at first. However, after my face adjusted to the razor I had no further problems and no longer feel any irritation. It only takes 2 or 3 minutes for a thorough shave (every once in a while you have to use the extension cutter for long hairs). The shave is nearly as close as a wet razor (no electric shave is, despite what they may advertise), and involves no mess because the shaver catches all stubble and you can neatly empty it after shaving. Feel free to shave in the car!    Cleaning: I found that simply brushing the razor kept it plenty clean and the cleaning solution is not essential. If you do choose to clean using the solution more than just on occasion, the solution will last 4-5 weeks and a box of 2 refills will cost around $11.    Foil and cutter replacement: After 431 shaves it is JUST now time to replace the foil and cutters. They lasted well over 18 months for me and still gave a close shave. I am upgrading to the 360 Complete foil and cutter, so the shave should be even better than before (however, I&#x27;ll be forced to clean with the solution, as you cannot use the brush on the 360 cutters).    Aesthetics: The 8595 is beautiful. It feels solid and looks sleek whether it&#x27;s in its case, in the cleaner station, in your hand, on the counter, wherever. The cleaner station is a bit bulky, but it looks very nice with the razor.    I highly recommend the Braun Activator, and at $140, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for Xmas as a gift for my husband. So far he only used manual razors but he wanted to give it a try. So I thought that I would spend more money to get a good one. Well, maybe it is as good as an electric razor gets, but the shaving is not near as close as if you use a manual! Can&#x27;t return it but, won&#x27;t be used...</li>
    <li> It doesnt seem like it shaves  much closer than any  other 100 shavers, yet this one is an extra 50 beyond 100.It frequently says it needs cleaning- and the cleaning cycle is more than a half hour.Its a great shaver, but dont expect it to provide the same level of closeness as a razor. My husband likes it ok. And as a female using it occasionally on my legs, I would say -I like my razor better.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin that get horrible razor bumps after shaving.  I have tried everything including other dry shavers.  While the other dry shavers did not irritate my skin like a blade does they never worked good for my hair.  I saw this model and read some reviews so decided to give it a try.  It worked great.  A nice clean shave and NO irritation!</li>
    <li> I am a Braun believer now!  Better than a razor by far and comfortable to use.  Battery charge last a long time (about 10 5-minute shaves).  Buy it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> WORTHLESS   I bought this razor for my husband, but the container of cleaning fluid could not be opened by any means that we could find, and the razor itself died within two weeks</li>
    <li> I shaved before with a norelco rotary, and was pretty disappointed with the results, especially compared to a razor.  Norelco&#x27;s lift and cut system would sometimes lift and cut my skin, and I would never expect an electric to cut up my skin like that.  After years with that norelco sitting in the closet, I tired of buying new razor refills for my safety razor, and purchased the Braun 8595.  It&#x27;s built like a tank, strong and has a great feel to it.  This thing is really smart, it knows everything you would want to about it, when to charge, change the cleaning solution, change the cutting parts, and even if the surrounding environment is too hot to perform a cleaning. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pro: &lt;br /&gt;Cut is as close as a blade razor for my skin &lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is automatic &lt;br /&gt;Base station charges and cleans &lt;br /&gt;Build quality is amazing &lt;br /&gt;Can be cleaned on the road without water (you&#x27;re not even supposed to use water to clean it) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Can be expensive, but definitely worth it &lt;br /&gt;Can take a couple weeks for your skin to get used to it, but has taken me only a few days &lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t buy it sooner</li>
    <li> I must confess that starting back in my early years of shaving, I have been using the Norelco Rotary dry-shavers exclusively.  The closeness of the shave wasn&#x27;t all too impressive, but they served me well through my high-school and college years.  When the battery of my second Norelco shaver went dead: I gave the manual disposal shavers a try -- let me just say that the shave was a bit *too* close for comfort.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In summer of last year, I saw the first easy-to-clean electric razor I have ever seen - A Phillips-Norelco \\&quot;Spectra\\&quot; that is designed to be cleaned with conventional tap water.  Granted it was a bit pricey at $100, but I needed a shaver that was going to be less of a hassle to clean.  Not only was I dissapointed with its lack of closeness (which turned out to be a huge step down from the previous Norelcos I have owned), I was disguisted by its poor construction.  Not only did the plastic cap barely fit on top of the shaver head - the actually head assembely had a habit of popping open unexpectedly (which would result in hair fragments dispersing all over the place).  Once it reached the point where I literally had to hold the shaver head down with one of my fingers so I could keep it from opening during the actual shave process - I knew it was time to give this contraption an early retirement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sadly, It became quite apparent that Norelco is no longer interested in building quality products (as all of their shavers appear to have the same half-witted/cheap head-assembly latch mechanism).  After reading all the glowing reviews for the Braun 8595 I decided that It was time for something that was going to actually do the job and do it well - So, I picked one up at Best Buy (on Good Friday, incidentally). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Build Quality of the shaver itself is incredible.  It has a classy aluminum body, with a silky-smooth pivoting head assembly. The protective cap, and the foil assembly are all easily removable and snap in-place with a solid and re-assuring *click*.  In fact, when my girl-friend placed the cap on - it went on so smoothly I originally thought it was magnetic.  This attention to detail speaks volumes about the quality of a product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plastic carrying case is nice - perhaps a little on the flimsy side but much better than the cloth pouches that most razors come with.  This, coupled with the handy brush, makes for a razor that travels incredibly well.  cleaning the razor thoroughly, by hand, takes about 1/20 the time it takes to clean a Norelco (which, if you haven&#x27;t expericed this before - is so painful - I would often let it go for weeks and just dump out the majority of the hair every once in awhile). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now if Braun left out the cleaning station and the review stopped here - I would still be giving this product 5 stars: after all when travelling, manual cleaning is just something that I&#x27;ll have to do, and the 8595 is incredibly easy to clean (despite the fact that it is not hydrogenic).  Enter the cleaning station. In principle, how can you beat something that hygenically washes your shaver, after each use, with a alcohol solution that leaves it with a nice \\&quot;clean smell\\&quot; of citrus?  Honestly, you just can&#x27;t.  And the time saved, when a full cleaning excercize is reduced to plunking it down and pressing the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; button greatly outweights the nominal expense of buying a new cartridge every 4-6 weeks.  Granted, the cleaning base doesn&#x27;t appear to have the same sense of level of craftmenship as the shaver, but it does its job of holding the razor in-place (as it appears that the shaver itself, is the one that is driving the cleaning process). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The difference in price between the 8595 and the 8585 is probably a bit excessive, given that the only difference I know of is that this model has an LCD display.  On the other hand: I like the know the percentage of battery power I have left, when traveling, so I decided that if I am going to buy the Activator, I might as well get the one with the display.  Regarding the noise during cleaning: it&#x27;s not much different than the actual shaving process itself and since the cleaning cycle runs in different phases - it&#x27;s hardly annoying enough to drive anyone to insanity.  And while the trimmer may not be in the most ergonomically optimal location: if you do end up wacking your face with it while shaving, I find you have to be shaving at an incorrect angle anyway.  Finally, I actually like the feel of it as I shave, both in my hand and on my face.  Norelco shavers were always awkward to me in the sense that they are contoured in such a way that you have to hold it in a very specific way in order for it to feel natural.  This doesn&#x27;t work for me - as I like to change how I hold it depending on the orientation of the hairs that I am trimming at a givin instant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you are a diehard-dispable-blade-shaver, odds are this shaver probably won&#x27;t be for you (as with any electric shaver, for that matter).  Futhermore, people who travel all the time are likely to find the charge/clean base of little use (which could pose a problem as the cartridges contain alcohol that will evaporate over time).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, those who have a busy life-style, and don&#x27;t want to be bothered with cleaning the razor every day - and are tired of their first waking experience of each work-day being a complete annoyance: the Braun 8595 (or the 8585) is the razor for you.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8595 Activator is one razor that&#x27;s worth the price! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Great shave. I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Braun electric razors for the past 15+ years. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried provides a closer shave, not even the best disposable razors. And nothing I&#x27;ve tried is as gentle on my skin. No bumps, burns or irritation. The best Norelco and Remmington shavers I received as gifts didn&#x27;t come close. Even after several tries, they each chewed up my face, leaving my skin raw. When I upgraded to the Braun 8595 I was pleasantly surprised that it provided an even closer and smoother shave than my Bruan 6000 series shaver. I was upgrading because of the self-cleaning feature. The improved quality of the shave was an added and unexpected bonus.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Braun made the best even better. The self-cleaning feature is a big time saver. And, it&#x27;s a great feeling to use a really clean razor each morning. Trust me, you&#x27;ll love it! I loved my Braun 6000 series razor. The only drawback was the time I spent cleaning it each morning and the mess it created. Cleaning it meant taking the foil off to remove whiskers from the cutter block area, which left a mess in and around the sink. The Braun 8595 even tells you when it&#x27;s time to change the cleaning cartridges. And, they&#x27;re easy to replace. Simply push one button, the unit rises to reveal the cleaning-solution cartridge. Simply pull it out and replace it with a new one. Easy! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another feature I love about my Braun 8595 is the \\&quot;Smart Logic\\&quot; system that keeps the razor fully charged for each use. Although I loved my Braun 6000 series razor, it did lose a little in the quality of the shave as the battery ran down and was ready to be recharged.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A great shave AND a razor that cleans itself! It&#x27;s one of the best purchases I made this year! This razor is well worth the price! And, with the discount, rebate and Amazon coupon... My advice is don&#x27;t wait! This is one instance that the product description lives up to its promises. As Bruan states, put simply, \\&quot;The Braun Activator... takes care of itself. Aside from giving you a super-close shave, the nifty unit automatically detects when it needs to be cleaned, alerts you on the LCD panel which of the 3 cleaning programs is required and proceeds to wash and dry itself. It also lubricates the cutting parts and tells you when the shaving foil and cutting block need to be replaced. The charger is great too-it juices up the shaver while optimizing the battery capacity and life-span.\\&quot; This is one case of truth in advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric shavers. I have a hard time shaving with a regular razor because my skin is so sensitive. I&#x27;ve had to sacrifice a good shave to keep my skin from getting irritated constantly. That all changed when I purchased the Braun 8595 Activator. I get a clean shave that doesn&#x27;t take a long time either. This was definitely one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> I gave up on electric shavers about 25 years ago, but a friend of mine just got a Braun Activator and was so enthusiastic about it that I decided to give it a try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, it appears that electric shaving technology hasn&#x27;t improved much in the last 25 years - it has just become more expensive. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Admittedly I have very sensitive skin and a very tough beard but I thought that surely this miracle of 21st century technology could cope with that but, sadly, it couldn&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I found that the shave was very uneven and I had to go over a particular area up 8 or 10 times just to get most (but not all) of the hairs. Trying to use it on anything more than a single day&#x27;s growth was just hopeless and the best that I ever achieved was the feeling of fine sandpaper. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you like gadgets this shaver certainly has them - cool blue lights, LCD displays, and an ugly and awkwardly shaped charger and cleaning station.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Probably if you are used to electric shavers this one is OK (but overpriced) but it wasn&#x27;t nearly good enough for me to want to switch back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks I am packing it up and sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> My old Braun 7000 series shaved just as close.  The new design foil did not do any better.  However it does run quieter and is satisfactory.  I purchased it because my old one was about to give out and I did not want to take it to a service center.</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned at providing a close shave in a minimal amount of time.  Nothing is as good as a top quality blade, of course; but for convenience and comfort, this Braun is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the self-cleaning process that comes with the shaver.  It always leaves the device in brand-new condition.  The shaver travels well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for a fair price.</li>
    <li> It was good while it lasted. Started going through foils to quickly. Upgraded to the 7 series.</li>
    <li> My 4th Braun; my 2nd Activator - wanted a separate one for traveling. The 8000 series has a far superior cleaning system than the 7000 series. Close shave, but not razor close, and that&#x27;s fine with me. Need to replace the blade head, as recommended, after a year. Performance starts to deteriorate at about 18 months when holder of the blade head starts of loosen up; can be fixed under the 2-yr. warranty. It was reported Proctor &amp; Gamble bought Braun in mid 2006, and soon after, the Activator was renamed 360 Complete with new Gillette blade head. Also reported, basic razor is essentially the same.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift and he really likes it.  He&#x27;s usually too lazy to shave with a regular razor and shaving cream because it seems like a hassle, but the Braun 8595 makes it a lot easier get rid of the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow each day. &lt;br /&gt;The cartridges seem expensive, but they seem to last a while.  We&#x27;re still waiting for the Amazon gift certificate that was promised with the purchase though.   &lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good buy and he&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Braun 8595 Shaving system is a great bargain.  It has the important features of thier top line shaver, at a great cost savings over their top end system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very comfortable, and I get the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To get a really close shave I&#x27;ve always had to shave the same area repeatedly for several minutes with my older Norelco. The Braun gives me a close shave every time, with just a single pass.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the fast charge time, and I like being able to use the razor on AC power with the single AC cord, when I travel.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning feature is handy, but it is a bit too much like a &#x27;gimmick&#x27;. I bought the Braun to get a close comfortable shave, and it certainly accomplished this goalfor me.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It out performs my previous electric shaver hands down.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would rcommend it to anyone who wants a good clean comfortable shave without a lot of bells and whistles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It is hard to reach an agreement on shavers because every face skin is unique, making shavers to perform differently for different customers.    This is my third Braun; I bought my first one in 1996, the second one in 2001, and this one in 2005. The second one, a 6510, still works, and I alternate it with the 8595. It&#x27;s really hard to tell the difference between the shaving of these two models, I mean, both of them work very fine, with a litle advantage for the 8595. I must also say that the 6510 performs exactly as well as the oldest one, of which I don&#x27;t remember the model (it had an all-aluminium case with an array of rubber dots and two color LEDs). Before my first Braun, I used a very old rotative Philishave I inherited from my father, after he changed to Braun.    I&#x27;m beginning to think that Braun&#x27;s is the best shaving system available, and that it has been so for decades. However, it is not perfect, at least not for me, since my skin is kind of sensitive, and if I shave thoroughly with the electric shaver it gets irritated. I must shave half the way with the shaver and the other with a Gillette Mach 3. That&#x27;s the best combination I&#x27;ve found over the years. I can&#x27;t shave thoroughly with the Gillette either.    My conclusion is: if your skin is not that sensitive, this shaver, or maybe any Braun, will work pretty fine for you.</li>
    <li> My husbands had this a couple of years. It is now starting to fall apart, still shaves good though.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I was against the braun shaving products for some stupid reason. Must be the 007 movie that inspired me to get the Norelco 8894XL. I thought the norelco was the closest and the smoothest shaves without any irritation. Two days ago I picked up the Braun 8895 shaver and my first day of shaving was simply phenomenal! I have sensitive skin and this shaver did not make me itchy and uncomfortable.. the shave is unbelievably smooth. You dont even feel like you&#x27;re shaving with an electrical shaver! The cleaning system is very very hygenic. Unlike the water cleaning of the norelco. The battery charging station is very cool and the hard travel case is awesome!! Every penny was well worth it!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A+++++</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you will love this.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Money saving tip: (1)If there&#x27;s a Costco near you, get the 8595 Series from there for about $160. It comes with extra foil and cutter (retail approx. $40) and travel case.  (2)Do not discard the plastic plug that comes with the cartridge. It will make your cartridge last longer. If you keep the plug on the cartridge between shaving/cleaning, you will replace it about once every TWO to THREE months instead of replacing it once a month (Braun recommends you replace the cartridge after 30 uses, based on daily use. Even if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, this alcohol-based solution evaporates).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t believe Amazon&#x27;s sales pitch for the cartridge: Nobody sells the pair of cartridges for $20. Everywhere, the pair sells for $9.99. The plus side of buying the cartridge here is that you can qualify for free shipping (\\&quot;super saver shipping\\&quot;), and no sales tax depending on which state you live in.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So invest a little--say goodbye to the stubble and shaving cream mess, to nicks and cuts, and say hello to this wonderful new system! Happy shaving!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shave is trully innovative. After using Panasonic shavers for several years I have to admit the difference is clear. Yes! The self cleaning mechanism is very convenient though noisy but accomodating. &lt;br /&gt;Obviously it doesn&#x27;t chave as close as a blade but you can&#x27;t expect that with an electric shaver. However it is preety smooth and best of all it leaves little or no irritation to my skin. For many years I&#x27;d been living with the humiliation of strangers walking upto me and asking why my neck was so red. &lt;br /&gt;Well! No more. The Braun Activator 8505 has ended my irritation problems. &lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products that you really just have to take it on a test run to appreciate how weel it works. I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating because it couldn&#x27;t clear some hair on my neck and chin. Apart from that it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun 8595 for about a month now.  This is the best shave I have had with an electric.  My previous shaver was a Norelco, a close shave, but lots of irritation.  The Braun has virtually no irritation.  Just a little on my neck.  I was quite supprised by the Braun&#x27;s ability to do a very close shave, even on my neck.  Though I do have very fine facial hair.  The self cleaning is worth the counter space it takes up.  As for the price of the solution, shop around.  I have seen the twin packs for under $6.  My only complaint is with the cord.  My bathroom, as are most bathrooms, is tight on space.  The transformer sticks out about 21/2 inches.  This prevents me from opening my medicine cabinet door fully.  If Braun made the plugs move, it could then hug the wall and be out of the way.  A weird oversight considering the thought and inovation that went in to the rest of the shaver.  Still, I would recomend this shaver in a heartbeat.       UPDATE:  After using this shaver for over a year, I&#x27;m still impressed.  Much better shave than my old Norelco.  So far it has been trouble free, though I&#x27;m getting close to replacing the cutter head.  I would recomend this over a Norelco anyday.</li>
    <li> I had been using a cheap Norelco Electric shaver prior to this.  So far, in the first few days, the Braun has given me a close enough shave, but design has made it difficult to get under the jaw and neck.  Some problems I&#x27;ve been having so far are as follows: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. When shaving, a lot of hair tends to leak out or not get caught in the shaver.  This leaves a mess of hair powder on the sink and on my shirt.  I don&#x27;t know if this is common, or if it&#x27;s just  because I have been using it to cut hair after a couple days, but it never happened with my norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2. The self-cleaner seems like a scam.  Sure it cleans the razor, and then dries it out...but how exactly does it know how clean your razor is?  I used it once, and it read \\&quot;eco clean\\&quot; so I was satisfied...it sat in the charger for 3 days, unused, and now it says \\&quot;normal clean\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know how it got more dirty in that time.  So I used it again, for longer hair, and it still reads \\&quot;normal.\\&quot;  So, when the cleaner runs out, go buy more. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that I&#x27;ve been pretty satisfied.  But can&#x27;t help wonder when the hair piles up while shaving, and I&#x27;m having to buy more cleaning fluid every couple months...was this razor really worth $150+ dollars?  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I switched back to electric after growing tired of showing up to work with a bloody, irritated face.  While not as close as a blade, the 8595 provides a clean, comfortable and quick shave.  The shaver is easy to hold and the cleaning system easy to understand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are only two disadvantages of this shaver.  First, the total cost of ownership is high, from the pricey shaver to the recurring cost of the non-refillable cleaning cartridges thought up by some MBA from hell.  Second, the cleaning cycle seems needlessly loud and long.  They need to take a clue from their cousins at Bosch on making quick and quiet equipment.</li>
    <li> Its an awsome shaver.. no more burns.. and you can decide on if you wanna keep a stub as well.. i have tried several of these but this one stands out from all of them. Just be sure to use it before taking a bathc as suggested by one of the users earlier. Cleaning part of the device works gr8 as well. You get a fresh feel to your shave everytime to use it. Also there is no mess on the basin in the morning.. :-) Excellent choice...</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers since I had peach fuzz. So after 15 years of using shavers that cost less than 100 bucks I finaly decided to splurge a few extra bones and get a \\&quot;superior\\&quot; shaver. Well all that I can say is that the reviews on Amazon are right on the money. This shaver kicks some serious butt. I have always had sensitive skin on my neck. This razor glided over the tough areas and cut every little tough hair with no irritation or leftover razor bumps. I am waiting for as long as I can before I use the cleaning station because I am cheap, and I realize that when I open the alcohol based soulution I know that it will evaporate quickly. I will keep you posted on my cleaning experience!! If you use electric razors and you want the cream of the crop.... Look no further. This is a grand product. Buy it today.</li>
    <li> I bought the 8595 Activator to replace my 5-year old 7570 Syncro.  The engineers at Braun have been busy and improved both the cutting quality and the bells and whistles.  First to the most important feature - how well it cuts hair.  The new foil design has improved on the Syncro and the Activator gives a consistent close shave when you follow the simple instructions.  Needless to say, this Braun product is far superior to any other electric razors I have tried.  Braun has also improved on the cleaning/charging system.  This is welcome because as a traveler, I often have different degree of cleaning needs.  The cleaning module detects the level of cleaning needed (Eco, Normal or Intensive).  In addition, the Clean&amp;Charge unit has an indicator for how full or empty the cleaning charge is.  Finally, Braun has implemented a smart charge system that will do a much better job of maintaining battery charge and strength.  Overall, I highly recommend this system, yet still look forward to what changes will be in store in the next 5 years.</li>
    <li> i never thought i&#x27;d be so hyped on something like an electric razor but this one deserves some attention.i&#x27;d used braun for years so i was confident of the quality.i started seeing good revues about the activator style and started hinting around before the holidays.i was quite pleased with the unit in all respects from the closeness and handling to the read outs.all in all,i&#x27;d get another without hesitation but if i keep this one  in good shape that won&#x27;t be needed for a long time. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. I will never go back to the blade again. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Gives me a noticeably closer shave than my old triple head units, but does not shave effectively next to my moustache.  The triple head shaver was able to get closer in without cutting the moustache hairs I was hoping to keep.  The sideburn trimmer is not as easy to use as it should be, but cuts well if you get the angle right.  The cleaning system make a racket but the fluid has lasted well, perhaps because I only use it once a week.  I&#x27;ve never come close to running down the battery even with the weekly chargings.</li>
    <li> This product is everything that I expected it to be.  It gives an incredibly close shave with no irritation to the skin.  I didn&#x27;t even have to give my face a few days to get used to it.  In addition the package is complete, it comes with everything you need to get started and shave right away as well as everything you need to clean and mantain it.</li>
    <li> After reading 4-star reviews on Amazon.com website, I bought a Braun 8595 shaving system.  As a razor, I like it over the Norelco rotary system I used earlier but I think this one has a design flaw. The trimmer is placed in a way that it touches the face from time to time when shaving it faced towards you.  This is annoying.  They should have placed it completely hidden without letting it touch the face when shaving. In addition to that problem, when extended, it is not long enough to trim too.  Now I am thinking of getting a Noreclo or a Panasonic wet/dry shaving system.  I wrote to Braun about this but they never responded to me.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy this shaver.  I typically shave with a razor every-other day, and shave with an electric on my off days as not to irritate my skin.  I enjoyed my old Braun, and replaced it with the \\&quot;Braun 8595 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System with LCD Display\\&quot; instead of paying $35 for a new foil and cutter-block. &lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get my girlfriend to stop using it.  She says she has never had an electric cut so much hair, so cleanly before.  I agree.  It&#x27;s pretty pricy, but I am even considering buying the upgrade foil/cutter block for the 360 version of this razor.  One word of warning, its pricy and a serious piece of hardware.  If you have kids running around I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy one.  It&#x27;s likely to get misused/damaged, and the cleaning solution is highly flamable.  1 month and counting, no complaints. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have used many different electric shavers and this is the best I have tried. The cleaning system works well and the solution has a citrus smell. I also have sensitive skin and this shaver has not irritated me once in a months worth of use.</li>
    <li> In reading the instructions I realized that I had been reduced to a raw material supplier and servant for a bloody machine. It will tell me when the cartridge needs replacement, When the foil gets worn it will tell me, if the clipper needs replacement it will tell me, if it needs cleaning, it crys, it discharges the battery so memory won&#x27;t take a hold.  All it wants me for is to pay the electric bill and grow beard.  That is disgusting!</li>
    <li> While the Braun Activator may work very well for some (or even most) people, it should be noted that it doesn&#x27;t work well for everyone.  For years I have shaved with a blade (Gilette Mach 3).  I have sensitive skin and typically shave every other day.  I decided to purchase an electric razor with the hopes that I could shave daily.  I decided to purchase the best razor that money could buy and found myself owning the Braun Activator.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used the Activator for the required 30 days and was very disappointed.  The Activator did a nice job on most of my face, cutting just as close as a blade on my cheeks.  However, it has difficulty in problem areas.  The worst problem area is the neck.  Even after going over my neck multiple times, the Activator could not cut all the hairs.  I found myself cleaning up with a blade after irritating my skin with the Activator.  Realizing that the Activator took twice as long to shave, couldn&#x27;t shave my neck, and I still had to use a blade, I sent my Activator back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope anyone that purchases an Activator has better luck than I did.  As I said, I&#x27;m sure it works very well for most people.  However, if you have sensitive skin - beware.</li>
    <li> I have tried about 5 different electric razors all but this one have given me razor burn it must have something to do with the self cleaning and sharpening aspect of this razor which keeps it like new but its not perfect I would say it misses about 15 - 20 hairs overall I would give it a 8.5</li>
    <li> I have owned probably 15 electric shavers in my life. This is by FAR the best yet. I actually look forward to shaving again. My wife loves it too.  This shaver belongs in the next James Bond movie. &lt;br /&gt;Doc &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> What can I say about this product? Well, I switiched to Electric Shavers about five weeks ago and began my journey with the Norelco 8894XL and then the Norelco 9190XL. In fact, I reviewed the Norelco 9190XL on Amazon and felt it performed quite well and gave a closer and more comfortable shave than the 8894XL because of the advance made with the HQ9 heads. Anyway, I had read some reviews about the Braun 8595, also known as the Activator and decided to give it a try and compare its foil to the Norelco rotaries. All I can say after using the Braun is WOW!. This is the best shave I have ever gotten and that includes blades as well as the other electrics I have used. My skin is really smooth and I have never used a shaver of this quality. It is fast as well as close in terms of the shave and the irration is minimal. I think that the cleaning machine is terrific and eliminates the need to remove the heads and cutters in a rotary to perform cleaning. I just put the shaver in the machine and it cleans the shaver as well as recharges the battery. You end up with a really nice lemon smell the next time you use the shaver. This shaver, along with the high end Norelcos is not cheap, but it is worth the price. Again, it is by far the best shaver I have owned and I would highly recommend it. I have read that Braun is improving the head and has already come out in Europe with an updated version called the 360. I almost cant imagine something better than the 8595. It is one terrific shaver and congratulate Braun in creating such a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> When you use this razor it feels like it is brand new each time.  It is simple to use and it cleans itself every day! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> the new screen cuts more hairs because it has a large window opening.  It is also therefore more irratating for sensitive skin.  I have both and did a 1/2 1/2 face study on the 2.</li>
    <li> i just received my 8595 today and got to experiance the great shave before i had to go to work.. it&#x27;s great!! i had been using a Remington TCT3 for the past 3 years and it was just killing my face. i have sensitive skin and everyday i dreaded the time when it came to shave. burning face, razor bumps and ingrown hairs... NOT ANYMORE!! i was a little bit skeptical about some of the bad reviews that it got, especially for the steep pricetag, but maybe the people are just not using it right or something.. thats the only thing i can think of cause mine works flawlessly.. glides over my skin so smooth and cuts so clean that its actually hard to believe that i had been using the shaver that i had for so long!! a couple bad reviews it got were that the cleaning system is too loud.... the razor itself has to turn on in order for it to get clean...DUMBA$$...and it&#x27;s not THAT loud...turn your hearing aid down a bit....and another one that got a bad review... the little blue LED light is too bright!!! ARE U KIDDING ME????? c&#x27;mon people....simple easy fixes for both... dont start the cleaning process before you go to bed... and shut your bathroom door if the light is too bright....i couldnt believe it.. i think the LED looks kinda cool.... anyways, it&#x27;s a great product and i would recommend it to anyone..</li>
    <li> I currently own a braun 7570(7680) which is exactly identical to this 8595 except this screen heads differ. This new 8595 does not shave as well as my older unit. My 7570 (which is now the 7680) I am able to choose if I want to clean and charge together or seperately. I was excited to have this new model which is suppose to shave even closer and better than other models. I found this un-true. It took me much longer to shave with this new model than the older one. Also some longer hairs on my neck were totally missed after going over the area 3-4 times. Very Disappointing that this newer model does not perform as well as my 8 year old 7570(7680). I love the 7570(7680) and I will stick with braun, just not this model 8595. Go for the 7680 you will not be disappointed.The 2 stars are for this 8595 performance. Just a note, my  face stuble was only 2 days old. If you have longer face hair you use option #3 to trim hair down to a manageable length and I always get a smooth shave. Any electric razor will have a hard time with longer hair. Good shavings to all.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for Christmas expecting it to live up to all the hype about the foil head and self-cleaning, etc.  I was sorely disappointed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First, I was a bit perturbed that you need to purchase new cleaning solutions (at $10 each!!) every MONTH!  If I&#x27;m buying a $180 shaver, the last thing I want to do is spend more money on it.  The $180 should pay for years of shaving, and having to constantly buy new cleaning solutions was an investment I wasn&#x27;t willing to make... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But I WAS willing to put up with it if the shave was great.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  The first shave was disappointing overall--long hairs were completely missed, both on my neck and my chin.  But I put this, too, aside, blaming it on my face.  Surely after a couple shaves my face would adjust and I would be getting better results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Four shaves later, the Activator was not performing as it said it would.  Hairs were continually missed, even after going over them several times and using both the pivoting and stable head options.  Braun&#x27;s claims that just a simple, fast shave would get the job done were not true.  A couple times, after finishing with the Activator, I was even forced to SHAVE AGAIN with my OLD SHAVER to rid of the stray hairs!!! This was not looking good... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then came the base.  First of all, the thing is huge.  How am I supposed to take this on vacations, or to my other home?  How do I even MOVE IT from one end of the room to the other without fear of spilling some of the precious cleaning solution!?!?! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the charging/cleaning base makes this high-pitched ringing noise, even when not cleaning or charging.  My sink is in my bedroom so I keep my shaver there, and the noise was keeping me up at night.  I figured I could get used to it but I was forced to unplug the base unit every time before I went to sleep--a very, very unnecessary annoyance, and one that could&#x27;ve easily been prevented with some modified design or internal readjustments. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaning process itself is LOUD.  It sounds like a drill.  On top of that, it takes a half hour to clean (nearly an hour on \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; mode).  And you have no choice in how you would like your shaver to be cleaned--it is selected automatically.  After two quick shaves, my shaver registered that it needed an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; cleaning--something that takes nearly 50 minutes and uses a ton of solution.  I can&#x27;t imagine that there was that much hair in my shaver after only two quick shaves! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was keeping an eye on the cleaning solution level to see how often I would REALLY have to replace these things.  The book says every four weeks, but after two cleans my solution reservoir was only 2/3 full.  Do the math. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At last, I gave up.  I&#x27;m taking the shaver back, and I will never ever buy a Braun product ever again. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!! THIS SHAVER IS TERRIBLE!!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! BUY A CHEAPER SHAVER THAT WILL PROBABLY GIVE YOU A BETTER SHAVE ANYWAY!!!</li>
    <li> Well I had mine for about 3 months when it started to get very loud. It started to vibrate &amp; make a lot of noise. I called Braun &amp; they told me I would have to bring it or ship it to one of their service centers. The closest one for me is an hour away. It is there now. The guy said it needs a part &amp; its a common problem. Not too good for a shaver that was 160.00. I expected Braun to ship me another one but that did not happen...</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Battery will last for days of shaving.  I have had this for one year and have only gone through two cleaing soluntion refills.  Gotta love that fresh citrus smell right after a cleaning.  My biggest complaints are that is is very noisy and if yu turn it sideways while shaving, it dumps the \\&quot;hair dust\\&quot; all over the place.</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago, I was impressed and disappointed at the same time. Whenever I use this machine, I can get some areas to be razor shaved smooth and some areas to have a few too many stubbles. My recommendation is to buy this machine if you have your facial hair in one direction and stick to the razor if your facial hair isn&#x27;t. But definetly this was better than the norelco.</li>
    <li> Well    Pros:  -It is a nice shaver. My first electric shaver was a braun - I bought in 1992 and I still have it. In comparison to my old shaver- this one does magic.  -very close shave (as someone had said in a review- you shouldn&#x27;t expect it to be as close as a razor- but close enough)  -Excellent first pass effect and fast  -Excellent charge  -Like new after cleaning    Cons:  -Expensive  -After having this for over a year now, I&#x27;m beginning to feel the need for a new blade- I only shave once every 4-5 days.  -The trimmer is difficult to clean- isn&#x27;t cleaned by the solution.  -Solution needed but in one year of use, I have only replaced it once with  every 4-5 days of use.  Recommend this Braun shaver- it is true it is expensive but I love it and I would always buy top of the line Braun shavers if I need in the future.  I just do not like razors- they give me an itch after the shave and I don&#x27;t know how they do that, but they make my hair grow thicker and faster.    Good luck with your purchase</li>
    <li> Expensive but 1st class shave.  For the man on the go.  Beat out all the shavers in the past..&lt;br /&gt;Cartigages last 10 shave and I have a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Let me just say this.  I have those razor bumps on my neck, at least I use to.  I went to the doctors got all of these prescriptions and nothing worked.  I finally got this Braun shaver and BOOM, GONE!  Amazing shaver and I will not get anything else.  Cleans very very well and works wonders.  Get this shaver.</li>
    <li> I always trusted braun shavers, but this one really excellent in all aspects,  interactive, hygiene and performance.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy owning it.</li>
    <li> My son has enjoyed this since we gave it to him as a Christmas present. The only repairs that have been necessary are replacement of the heads.</li>
    <li> I have been using razors for the past 7 years. I bought my 1st electric shaver in 1997 a Philishave 2 blade rotary system, and discontinued using it as I spent more time shaving with it than my regular Gillette razor and wouldn&#x27;t get as good a shave. I am originally from South-asia and have a very thick beard, such that I need to shave on a daily basis for work. I have been shaving every alternate days, to prevent cutting myself shaving with mach3, still having ingrown hair the day after. But due to a few comments from my collegues about my afternoon shadow, I decided to invest in an electric shaver and see its results. Having already experienced the Philishave (now called Norelco), I decided to get the Top of the line Braun which is the 8595 Activator. This is the best shaving system I&#x27;ve used to date, its unbelievable the results I get. I get better shaves than the mach3 and that too on a daily basis without bleeding. There have been times I&#x27;ve pushed this shaver harder to my skin than normal and have resulted in a minor cut, but still a perfectly close shave !!! I now go to work clean shaved. This unit feels like new every morning thanks to its self-cleaning system. I would definately recommend this to any person out there ... Note: it does take a couple days to get used to this shaver, and also make sure that you shave before you shower to get the best results. The after shower shave only works with razors, as they soften the hair, but as the pores swell, it won&#x27;t work well with this electric shaver. cheers !</li>
    <li> I love this razor....I got it for Christmas.  I was spending $20 a month on my schick quatro blades and they were killing my skin.  NO skin irritation with this razor.  My only compliant is that it does take two or three weeks to get that great shave...because of the damage razor blades do to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had to call my wife and tell her I left it at the hotel I stayed...have to by another one.</li>
    <li> Its not as good as advertised, save your money for something better...</li>
    <li> I received the Braun 8595 for Christmas (thanks mom!) and love it.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I had a Norelco before which irritated my neck badly.  The Braun does not irritate my neck, though it doesn&#x27;t always cut all the neck hairs on the first run over them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is sleek, solid, feels good to hold, and looks very European.  The motor on this razor feels very strong, but not too strong where you should fear for your skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;None of the other reviews mention that this razor has a third setting where you can put up a little blade. This is useful for evening out your sideburns and making them nice and straight.  It&#x27;s also good for trimming the fine hairs that may grow on your earlobes.  I guess you could conceivably shave your head using the little clipper but it would take forever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My main problem is buying the replacement cleaning cartridges.  And as stated before, some of the hairs do not always get collected in the razor and will fall out on the basin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall though, the Braun 8595 gives a very comfortable shave.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After years of shaving with my Braun Syncro 7570, an amazing razor by all accounts, I was looking forward to trying out the new top of the line Activator.  Improvements over the Syncro I was hoping for included the same great shave with even less irritation (the Syncro head gets hot after about 2 min.&#x27;s causing some irritation), a cleaning base that didn&#x27;t give off as much of a smell while cleaning, a more sturdy foil (everyone I know that has a Syncro regularly has a foil chip every couple of months which causes instant shaving irritation which requires going out and buying a new foil/cutter for $25-$30), and fewer irritating blinking lights on the razor while cleaning/charing.      After using the Activator for two straight months I can say that for me, without question, the razor does not shave as close as the Syncro.  The Activator is marginally more comfortable, however I think the greater comfort comes from a shave that isn&#x27;t as close.  While I know every beard is different, honestly, I can&#x27;t believe that only a few other reviewers have had this problem, the difference between the Syncro and Activator is quit noticeable.  While the cleaning base station does have less of a smell, there are more blinking lights on the razor that stay on even after cleaning - like a Disney light show - at least with my Syncro I can make the lights go off by removing the charging arm when done cleaning/charging.    Braun is out with a new, sturdier foil/cutter block for the Syncro 7000 series so I&#x27;m sticking with it.  I haven&#x27;t tried the new foil yet since my old one is still kicking, but my advice is this:  if you think the Activator is the best razor you&#x27;ve ever used, get yourself a Braun Syncro (the last update was the 7680) with one of the new foil/cutter block assemblies and you&#x27;ll find yourself with an even better shave.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have been trying all kinds of shavers over the years looking for a good shave without irritation.  I ended up going through a few rotary-based solutions, but found they did not do a good job, took a long time to shave, and ended up irritating my skin.  It was depressing.  Then I saw the ad for the 8595 and the technology looked impressive.  I went for the gold and bought the best.  IT WAS WORTH IT!  A great shave, quickly and thoroughly with no irritation!  I will never go back, from now on its Braun for me.</li>
    <li> sorry, I do not review but ask a question. &lt;br /&gt;Can I use this shaver in other countries? &lt;br /&gt;the problem might be the electricity pressure &lt;br /&gt;can I use it under 220v? &lt;br /&gt;I will appreciate any answer~~</li>
    <li> I WAS USING A 2 YR OLD NORELCO WITH JUST PASSABLE RESULTS. MY NEW BRAUN IS LIKE SHAVING WITH A BLADE, ONLY MUCH FASTER. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT TO RECEIVE IT. THANKS!  PCK</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I have always been hesitant to purchase an electric razor due to the closeness factor.  However, my face is smooth as a \\&quot;you know what\\&quot;, and shaving time is about a fourth of the time it takes with a straight razor (Mach 3).   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I shopped around for this product and there is a large varience in pricing.  I was able to locate for around $100.  Well worth the price!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver as a Christmas gift after I did a lot of hunting around and looking at other brands.  (I even tried one or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Brauns in the past, and about three years ago, I tried a Panasonic Wet/Dry Linear.  I liked the results of the Panasonic when I used it as a wet shaver and with the correct shaving creams.  However, I missed the shave&#x27;n&#x27;go I used to get with the Bruns.  Besides, I could never stop getting shaving bumps on my neck with the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are different beard types out there.  Mine grows so fast and so coarse that NASA is studying using it in braids as a new bullet-proof material.  Lack of attention to my beard can be certain death to a disposable razor (yes, my beard can dull a disposable blade in one try).  On top of this beard type, I have very sensitive skin around my neck and am heavily prone to shaving bumps there, which can look like a mild jungle-rot or some other nasty thing, so I try my best to shave with care and avoid them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think other guys who can go days without shaving have a different set of expectations.  Likewise, the guys who can scrape a week old diaposable on their face and get a smooth finish will have other expectations.  Me, and my beard, demand performance or suffer the ill side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun answers all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who complain about the need to buy a $5 refill every couple months have not taken up the math on disposables lately.  I can easily spend $30 a month on blades and cream and wind up with worse results and a stubbly face.  For $2.50 per month, and $25 every 18 months for the replacement blades and foil, this shaver will make you happy to shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave is delightful because the micro-oscillations of the shaving head feel like a little massage.  Unlike the Norelco which pulled my face with the shaving head, this shaver glides on the skin and does not catch on my jaw line or tricky places of my neck.  Not this shaver-- it glides easily and mows down the stubble well without tearing my skin like a Remington.  In fact, it feels to me when using this shaver dry is most like using the Panasonic Linear with the Neutragena Bump Guard shaving cream.  The bonus is that my face is dry and there&#x27;s no clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found over the years that Braun shavers perform best when used on a face that was washed (or at least rinsed) about 10 minutes before the shave.  The result is silky smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placing the shaver back into the base station causes a light display as the shaver and base communicate and determine what kind of clean it needs.  Press the blue button and you hear solution pumped into the head and then the shaver turns on for a moment to expel the clippings.  About a half hour later, it&#x27;s ready for business again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the shaver out of the cleaning base and placing it to one&#x27;s face results in a fresh citrusy smell which is quite pleasing compared to how some of my shavers have smelled in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD display reveals intriguing information.  Pressing a button tells you for how long you last shaved.  I&#x27;m averaging 6 minutes (which is 4 minutes shorter than I used to with other shavers).  It will also tell you how many shaves it has made.  Pressing again mentions something about something else, and pressing it again tells you what part for the foil when you do need to reorder.  It shows the battery charge left which is nice for me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bone I can pick with it is that I tend to turn the shaver on and off when I shave.  If you wait too long before turning it back on, it counts it as a new shave, which can throw off the time in the LCD.  It only matters if you like to remember averages and have ever been an OCD engineer.  For everyone else, it&#x27;s probably fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, and my most sensitive neck, and most coarse beard, this shaver is perfect.  No holds barred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You folks who don&#x27;t like it can go back to something else, but leave this product alone, because it works wonders for me and is far cheaper than my other alternatives.  (like $10 a month to wet shave with the Panasonic or $30 per month to shave with disposables).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your beard is anything like mine as I described above, do not fear the Braun Activator -- it is your friend!No holds barred. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You folks who don&#x27;t like it can go back to something else, but leave this product alone, because it works wonders for me and is far cheaper than my other alternatives.

    <li> I had this shaver for a year. It does not shave as well as my old Braun shaver. The concept is excellent and the fact that you do not have to clean it is good. However, when it comes to providing you with a nice shave, it just does not work well. In addition, it is not cheap to buy new cleaning solution... I am going back to a shaver that I can use in the shower - it is much faster &amp; easier to use and seems to provide a much closer shave.</li>
    <li> This razor is hopeless if you have been using a wet shave razor, it does not shave closely, leaves a nasty rash and requires even more frequent shaves than before!! The cleaning system is great though. Beware if you buy from Amazon they will not accept the return.</li>
    <li> This thing is great.  It&#x27;s the next generation from the one I had previously which was eaten by my dog.  The self cleaning function is great and I think keeps the blades sharper longer.  That part is loud, so either do it when you are leaving the house or have it in a different room.  The smell of the cleaning fluid is pretty mild, so it doesn&#x27;t gross you out or anything.  Best shaver I have ever had, far and away and I researched it to death before I bought it and so I give it thumbs WAY up.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, and he was a razor shaver before I gave this to him.  He used to have problems with ingrown hairs on his neck, and using this shaver every day has made them almost all disappear!!  He absolutely loves the shave it gives him and my father-in-law (also a razor shaver) will sneak and borrow it sometimes, too!!  I got a great price on it and I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver - much nicer than the norelco triple-style shavers I&#x27;ve been using.  What&#x27;s really nice is the cleaning system.  BUT, it will definitely tell you it needs to clean every time - I usually clean it twoce a week and it works great.  After having it for a few months and cleaning it 2-3 times a week the cleaner fluid meter still shows it as &#x27;full&#x27;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new electric shaver this is a great one to get.</li>
    <li> I had a beard last week, but when Amazon had this as a daily special for $104, I decided to give up my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is most surprising is that after not having shaved for almost a decade, that I got a close, clean shave, with absolutely no irritation. I used Norelco rotaries way back, and with much tugging of facial hairs and effort, I got a mediocre shave from the Norelco&#x27;s. With the Braun, I get blade closeness, comfortable shaves, with no (yes that was NO) irritation. Very pleased with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to do a cursory cleaning (if you don&#x27;t have the base handy). Or stick in the base, close the bathroom door (so you don&#x27;t hear the buzzing of it running) and in 35 minutes it&#x27;s as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plug could have a better design, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect...</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying the 360 Complete, but I think this is essentially the same product.  It is a good bit less expensive and performs fine.  I have been a \\&quot;thin foil\\&quot; shaver for 30 years, and I judge this one as close and comfortable as any of the many I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shavers I have had, it is easy to handle and performs well. My Amazon purchase was easy and by far the cheapest on the market. Thanks</li>
    <li> This razor is horrible. I have no idea what they are talking about in those other reviews.  This thing doesn&#x27;t even come close to a good shave. Watch out, becasue if you get and don&#x27;t like it then you can&#x27;t even return on amazon...it&#x27;s becaus of the alchol that it come with (it&#x27;s a non-returnable item).  Wast of 200.00 earned dollars.</li>
    <li> i shave my head everyday- sometime more than once a day and this machine is perfect. It lasts about a week when I am on holiday which is good battery life. it shaves closer than a mach 3 going with the grain. so the only way i can shave closer is to go against the grain w/ mach3 which is not pleasant to do every time.</li>
    <li> When the new BrAun 8000 series quietly debuted, I was curious as to what advancements could be made to a fine shaver like the BrAun Synchro 7000 series. &lt;br /&gt;The answers are a whole new design, although predicated on the earlier 7000 series self-cleaning BrAuns, and most importantly, a new screen design that really does help capture all kinds of hair types as opposed to the standard Braun screen as well as the screen on most other shavers, this one features a screen of various openeing sizes that are a geometric pattern. &lt;br /&gt;BrAun seems to have concentrated on keeping their expertise in the dry shaver market, as opposed to Panasonic who leads the pack in the wet/dry shavers, and it really shows with this shaver. &lt;br /&gt;The unit is just as well thought out in design as the 7000 series although I personally find the 7000 series a better looking overall shell, with the 8595 featuring a shiney silver appearnace as opposed to the Titanium/Champagne and black of the 7000 series. &lt;br /&gt;The Shaver runs just as smoothly as the 7000 series but the real leap in performance seems to be due to the screen design. After having used this new model for over a week I can attest to the fact that BrAun&#x27;s claim of cutting and capturing more hair per pass on your face is valid. The shave seems a bit closer than the synchro 7000 series and certainly takes less time to get a better quality shave than the earlier 7000 series models and rivals that of the Panasonic wet dry models I have earlier reviewed. The clean and charge base is smaller than the 7000 series but does use the same refill cartridges as the earlier models and seems to be more efficient at the cleaning/charging duties as it automatically reads from the shaver what type of charge and clean is required, either economy, normal or intensive, as well as reading the cartridge fill level. Battery maintennace and health is  a premium and is included on the 8000 series and will deep discharge the batteries once it \\&quot;sees\\&quot; the regularuse requires it for battery health. &lt;br /&gt;All in all BrAun is introducing a decided improvement over its venerable 7000 series and keeps it&#x27;s claim as the premeier dry shaver in the world. On a personal note I never obtained world class results until I went from the Electric Shave type products, to a quality shaving oil such as The Total Shaving Solution, not sold by Amazon (but should be!). I use 1 drop and rub it in on my face, wait 30 seconds and shave and I have never had such a smooth, comfortable shave, even with my Panasonic wet/dry shaveer I have always been crazy about. If anything, clean up with the BrAun is even better than the Panasonic as I just splap it in the holder and push down the lock for a clean, charged and dry razor the next time my beard is ready! &lt;br /&gt;If you are ready for an investmnent or upgrade from either the earlier BrAun models, or even the Panasonic wet/dry shavers, you will not be disappointed with the Braun 8595, a world class shaver giving world class results!</li>
    <li> I just finished reading the other reviews, and wanted to add my $.02.  I like the shave, I like the self cleaning, I like the LCD display to give me geeky info on my razor.  Some things I don&#x27;t like are that the \\&quot;Battery Self Test\\&quot; seems to be continuous when the razor is charging in the base, and the BRIGHT blue LED on the razor that is on when it&#x27;s in the charger as well.  The Self Test thing makes me feel like I&#x27;m wasting a ton of power having this thing plugged in.  The Blue LED literally acts as a night light in my bathroom, which drives me nuts.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken to unplugging the razor once the cleaning cycle is done, which makes me feel better about the power consumed and keeps me from being bothered by the night light.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the razor at all...  the next morning the battery is still fully charged and the razor is nice and clean and dry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tim</li>
    <li> Throughout the years i have tried electric shavers with ugly results. They caused ingrown hairs, rashes all over my face and especially my neck. Going through the best disposable razors with better results and shelling out for expensive Gillette Mach 3 turbo blades all the time (had to keep them sharp) just got old and messy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews on amazon for various models, this one had some success stories with problems similar to mine. I ordered the 8595 and after using it for a week solid....I LOVE IT. I have thick hair and it shaves closer than any blade i have ever used! The only area that is hard to shave is on the bottom of my neck area. Have to go over it a few times but am getting used to it. It is all about going against the grain in specific areas. The better this is done, the less passes are needed. Most parts of my face only require one pass or two...that is it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The LED version only tells you useless info aside from knowing how much battery time you have left. If you care about that then spend the extra bucks but i dont think there is a need to unless you go on extended travel and dont plan on taking the charging cord. Battery has lasted me all week without charging so far. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning cylce is awesome, no mess and disinfects and cleans. I am totally giving up my my regular blades...no use for them. This is truly a superior shaver that gives a superior shave.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best shaver I have ever used. Close as a blade but no chance of the occasional slice and dice.The pivoting head adjustment allows the shaver to travel the contours of your face assuring a close shave everywhere and the pop-up sideburn trimmer is a real plus. The cleaning system is great..no more brushing out the heads, just pop it in the slot and bingo! All done.I would recommend this shaver to anyone whose face has more contours than a notebook pad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few different models in the past, and this one is a keeper.  Does an amazing job, the auto-cleaner is great, holds a charge forever, quick-charge, travel case, etc. etc. etc.  Expensive, yes, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband, and he loves it from day 1! No complaints, smooth shaving! Guys, go ahead and buy this shaver and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> i have been using electric razors for many years starting with a Sunbeam.  This razor provides the quickest and closest shave of any that I have used.  I was somewhat concerned about the self cleaning system but I know find that is always pleasant to pick up the razor with a slightly lemon smell and always clean.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I never had a closer shave with an electric razor. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;James, Naperville, IL &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The Braun 8595 Activator vs. the Panasonic ES8077S Vortex: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Braun is a good razor, but the Panasonic is better by a two-star margin. I bought the Braun first and was somewhat disappointed -- more friction and more effort to get a good result than I expected from a top-price razor. I then bought the Panasonic and returned the Braun without hesitation.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a wet/dry shaver; the Braun is dry only. The Panasonic takes about half the time for a complete shave, wet or dry, as it does not require innumerable passes to get a smooth result; two is fine -- three if you&#x27;re meticulous. The Panasonic shaver costs less. The Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning cartridges cost less. The Panasonic is lighter and therefore less fatiguing to grip. As soon as I tried the Panasonic, I knew the Braun was going back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution does make the shaver smell like Froot Loops if you&#x27;re into aroma therapy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Both manufacturers offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, by the way, which I don&#x27;t think is mentioned in Amazon&#x27;s descriptions. (Not knowing this, I had almost been ready to pay more at Costco.com just for the returnability but decided to take a chance.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other shavers but this is by far a much better shave than I have gotten with other brands. When you finish shaving put the shaver in it&#x27;s cradel and at the push of a button this shaver selects how long to clean itself.  At the same time it makes a decision to charge the battery or drain and recharge to extend the life of the battery.  This is almost a completely self maintaining shaver.    Wish I had a car like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the activator for 8 months now, and I&#x27;m switching back to a straight razor.  This electric razor is probably fantastic for most people, but not for me.  I have really sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s always irritated around my neck after I&#x27;m finished shaving.  My skin is also very thin, meaning it wrinkles easy and can stretch a little bit.  I find getting the hair under my cheek bones almost impossible, and usually have to resort to a straight razor to remove it.  I&#x27;m not sure if all electric razors are like this, as this is my first, but it&#x27;s very annoying.  Also, though my skin feels smooth to the touch when I&#x27;m finished, I still notice what looks like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  I also have to shave daily with this, when I was only shaving twice a week a mach 3. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the people who say they have sensitive skin and this helps, I&#x27;d really like to know your technique...my skin itches and burns for about 20 minutes after I&#x27;m finished, regardless of when I shave.  A straight razor with good sensitive skin shaving cream never bothered me this much, and always got rid of all the hair on my face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The automatic cleaner is nice, and the refill packs usually last about 3-4 months, so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  It can be a little loud, but with my bathroom door shut, you can barely hear it.  I usually shave right before I leave anyway, so it&#x27;s not really a bother to me, anyway.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver and is easily the best.  I gives a good, smooth shave and does so very comfortably.</li>
    <li> I had used a few before but thi sone is the best</li>
    <li> I used this shaver for about a year and few months, and it&#x27;s great, when it worked! I get a much closer shave than I expected. I used to use blade, before using this one. Much comfortable than shaving with blade (on a daily basis). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But after few months, silver paint just below the shaving heads started peeling off. I didn&#x27;t care as it is just cosmetic. Then the trimmer stopped trimming and instead it pulls hair from the side burns and mustache. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cleaner works as advertised, but the blades don&#x27;t keep the original performance after few months. So this message is for Braun (if they care to read) to keep up with the good shaver, but to make it work for few years at least. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would have given 4 1/2 stars, if it survived its anniversary without much trouble.</li>
    <li> Use it daily and it provides the best, consistent close electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had -- highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After five years it is alive and well.  I have had to by a new block and screen for it, but what do you expect.</li>
