<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not an every-day, around the office-type cologne.  Save this for a night out with the lady friend.  Great addition for anyone who likes to wear cologne and have a selection.</li>
    <li> Good product and a lot cheaper than the store</li>
    <li> Great smell, but still really pricey for an older cologne. Note, the women&#x27;s perfume of this is a good substitute believe it or not, and I think I enjoy that smell better. Still, this is a great, clean smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> 2 sprays last all day.</li>
    <li> I wear this cologne daily. Much better price here than in retail stores. Shrink-wrapped original box and spray bottle. Totally pleased with the shipper. The scent itself is one I like, obviously. However, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on you as well as some others. By the end of the day it seems long gone.</li>
    <li> smells really good, a tiny bit different than the regular Guilty, but still just as good.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite cologne the smell speaks for itself also it lingers for after your passed making one think wow</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple colognes in the past year and have really liked most of them. But, Gucci Guilty is now my scent. So don&#x27;t you buy it!  It&#x27;s mine!  Lol</li>
    <li> Love the smell, quantity should be larger. Lid is very difficult to open but otherwise good.. Merry Christmas to All</li>
    <li> i receive the perfume today and they are fake because i also bought the gucci guilty intense both of them were fake!!! its dissapontining for me because this is the second time that happens to me.....</li>
    <li> The fragrance is wonderful, but it does not last very long. I know this is an eau de toilette, but the scent seems to fade after an hour. I just wish it came in an eau de parfum strength. That is the only downside to this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Valentines Day and he loves it, so do I.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, it really stands out. Not over bearing either, just right enough to put you in the mood.</li>
    <li> Got it for a much better price, arrived just as expected. Very happy with my purchase, very convenient. I recomend it.</li>
    <li> I smelled this fragrance at a department store and had to have it! At Amazon prices I couldn&#x27;t say no and I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased. The scent is distinct, seductive, and smooth. It&#x27;s definitely more for evening wear and will make an impression every time.</li>
    <li> great fragrance!! This is a great smelling fragrance it last a long time and my wife loves it. its my new favorite ,</li>
    <li> I was unable to purchase this item in the stores due to it being on out of stock so I looked here. I found it at a reasonable price and worth it. Arrived fast and was perfect. The smell is intoxicating in a good way to me when my boyfriend wears it. I love love love this scent.</li>
    <li> I give this a 5 star because of the balanced cologne that it is.  It isn&#x27;t overly strong and has a very balanced presence.  It isn&#x27;t over powering in any one type of smell.  I am a big fan of sandalwood based colognes because sandalwood is a very woodsy and earthy smell that isn&#x27;t as overpowering as a lot of colognes can be.  This is the only cologne that I like as much as Calvin Klein Intense Euphoria, and that is saying a lot for Gucci to manufacture a cologne that I can say that about.  I recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the harsh colognes on the market and are searching for a more mellow but distinct fragrance.  My wife is very sensitive to strong colognes and as long as you don&#x27;t bathe yourself in this, it is very mellow but present without being harsh.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT LAST A FEW HOURS!! NOT TO STRONG JUST RIGHT, THE WOMEN LOVE IT! I WEAR IT TO WORK EVERY OTHER DAY! FUNNY I FIRST SMELLED THIS AT MACYS RUNNING FROM THE PERFUME PREDATORS! THEN AS I THOUGHT I GOT AWAY, HE GOT ME SAYING \\&quot;GUILTY BY GUCCI\\&quot; WHILE DRESSED IN A SUIT IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING FROM A COMMERCIAL SO I SMELLED IT AND WAS HOOKED!!</li>
    <li> This cologne is made for romance! Great unique scent. Ladies..start your engines! I&#x27;m glad I ordered this one. It&#x27;s one of my favorite.</li>
    <li> This was a XMAS gift for my husband. Shipment was fast and I compared prices from other stores. This was a bargain. It smells sophisticated and sexy.</li>
    <li> The cologne was old. The fragrance didn&#x27;t last very long at all. Great price but my husband was not satisfied</li>
    <li> its the type of smell you put on your self that you and who&#x27;s around you will love it. can&#x27;t describe it but love it.&lt;br /&gt;i would also recommend legend by mont blank</li>
    <li> Pretty solid smell but not amazing, however for the price that amazon offered it was an amazing deal. I would reccomend to others but not my go to smell.</li>
    <li> I am actually very impressed with this cologne. Of course it is very hard to describe the smell in words, but I would say it is masculine and smells great, without being overbearing. I use only one spray on my neck/chest area and it really lasts for hours and hours! Even by mid to the end of the day my wife says she can still smell it on me in a very subtle inticing way. She says it has a sweet and masculine smell and she really enjoys it. I rate it 5 starts both for the smell and how long it lasts with only a small amount. I have received only compliments and I am very happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> This cologne is one of thee best ever made! The scent last all day long and ladies love it!! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I just loved the smell and when I have it to my husband he fell on love with it also!</li>
    <li> I bought this because this girl I like would always tell me how much she loves this scent... I obviously have a crush on her.  I bought it, she smelled, she liked it, and now she&#x27;s with someone else.</li>
    <li> Was not like as I expected...feel like they sent me duplicate one....the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.  It goes away so quick...remains hardly for one hour...then gone....waste of money...will not buy from the sane place I bought... will try different vendor...&lt;br /&gt;E</li>
    <li> As usual Amazon is flawless when it comes to shipping/packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cologne smells fantastic and is unquestionably intense. However, as many other reviewers have noted, the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. I don&#x27;t expect the scent to last an entire day but this cologne doesn&#x27;t stay more than a few hours with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue of cologne authenticity, but  rather the way it was designed. Call is a trick to sell more cologne. This will be my first and last bottle.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne so he was excited to get it in time for Christmas. I love the masculine smell which is not very overwhelming</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing and a great price compared to retailer stores. I have been looking for THE cologne for a long time now and I have finally found it.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling fragrance, didn&#x27;t last as long on me for some reason.  I still like it and will use it.  Looking forward to trying the regular Guilty.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a strong long lasting cologne then guilty is your choice. Awesome smell that lasts long for a very good price; I&#x27;ve got several compliments on it. It gives away this young yet masculine man&#x27;s scent! Def buying it again.</li>
    <li> I do like the smell of this cologne but I think its a little over priced... that&#x27;s just me. Its a Christmas present for my Husband and I know he will love it so all in all Im happy.</li>
    <li> This spray smells wonderful and is not overpowering like some other sprays.  It has a very clean, masculine smell.  It is a little expensive but makes a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for men I love this stuff and it came in a speedy manner too you should get it!</li>
    <li> Very strong perfume i like it</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne. I get compliments regularly from new people I meet and even from people that already know I wear it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one</li>
    <li> the title says its all, you can never go wrong with Gucci. The smell is long lasting, And it is always complimented on, but then again all colognes are complimented on for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Cheaper than Macy&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Not much to say about htis other than it smells great.  Perfect for business environment or a night out. Scent last for a few hours, just depends on where you spray it and how much.  A little bit goes a long way.  Price is better on here versus getting it from a department store, and it is authentic on here.</li>
    <li> I really loved the smell of this!&lt;br /&gt;it was a Wonderful birthday gift I got for a friend&lt;br /&gt;buy It!</li>
    <li> Best aroma for a man on the market!!!!!!!!  Very subtle-yet romantic-but not over-whelming!!!!!!  Every man should own @ least one bottle.  Also, much more affordable than @ Macy&#x27;s.  $70 a bottle @ mall or $90 for the gift package.  The gift package is not worth $90.  The creams &amp; shower gels do not stay with you for the day &amp; they&#x27;re not any better than regular gels/lotions--therefore, I would not recommend the gift package.  I purchased my man this &amp; love it.  I received this item in less than a week &amp; did not pay for the rush postage.</li>
    <li> Smells great... only lasts a few hrs</li>
    <li> the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this cologne 5 stars is because it is a little musky for me. But it still smells very nice and lasts for hours. one little spray and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend for christmas. I knew he would like it because it&#x27;s his signature scent. I love the way it smells and it reminds me of him. The seller provided prompt and efficient service, making sure I received the package well before christmas time. I would definitely recommend this cologne to men as well as women who are looking for gift ideas.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, make-a all da ladies want it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. One of my favorite colognes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lasts for long the smell max 1-2 hrs. Other than that it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> Smells great I get a lot of compliments on the soft but attractive fragrance. This is a must have in the collection.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase a lot of perfumes from Amazon but this one was a great disappointment for me.&lt;br /&gt;I received it in time i&#x27;ve been promised to but the smell does not last even half day even though it&#x27;s the intense.</li>
    <li> i belikeve this was not an AUTHENTIC product !!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nowhere near what I researched and the scent doesn&#x27;t last 5 MINUTES!! It&#x27;s TERRIBLE&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back !!</li>
    <li> I never get tired of this no matter how often he wears it. I bought this last year and still can&#x27;t get enough of it. He can wear this as often as he wants!</li>
    <li> I first smelled this cologne in my moms macy&#x27;s magazine and ihad to buy it decided to get it on amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier even went in to macy&#x27;s and got some test strips to compare &amp; it was about the same macys last a little longer but not bye much 3oz bottle for 59$ great price !!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband who is particular about what colognes he&#x27;ll wear. He loves the scent and so do I. My 20 yr. old son commented that it smelled &amp;#34;fresh/clean&amp;#34;. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this perfume smells good smell is unique is a gift for my boyfriend and I really love how she is, this luxury perfume, I recommend boys!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to gift it to my husband on our 365th day of being married. I followed other reviews to make this purchase as I was looking for a date-night perfume that was manly and not sweet and girly like other moden man are wearing,  This perfume is perfect.  It smell is very enticing and stays on strong without being overpowering.  We headed out for the night and it withsttod the smell of bars (cigarettes, etc) throughout the night. His scent did stand out :) When we cuddled at home after evening out was over,  I could still smell the perfume.  I only gave it four stars because there is an earthy maybe herb-like mix in the scent that I could do without. Maybe its just me.  I will mention it however so those perfume lovers may catch it here before buying it if its one of those things they dislike.  Against my will, he wants to wear it during the day,  I will update my review with how the perfume deals with sweat at a later date.</li>
    <li> Not that great as you expect from Gucci. Will not recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I think I ask for the plain one not the intense</li>
    <li> Awesome perfect amazing</li>
    <li> I received exactly what was described and what I expected and it arrived really fast, awesome scent I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> This badboy smells awesome. Great price and it seems to be an original. Many say that there is a lot of fakes out there but this seems to be ok. It lasts almost 4-5 hours. I wear it at work and get a lot of compliments from the ladies.</li>
    <li> so deep smell but is confortable spray over the neck please used this spray lotion when meet your girlfriend  at the park</li>
    <li> My wife really like the smell of this cologne, and it seems to be her favorite one even as of today, still have half a bottle left.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it! As well do I, it smells great! Other guys asked where I bought it from.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this only after reading the reviews.. Well, there&#x27;s noting Gucci about it; nothing unque that sets it apart from other scents. It&#x27;s just a very dark musky cologne smell, that gracefully does not last long on my skin. I use this to deodorize my car instead.. Guys who love a bit sweeter or a citrus smelly fragnance, stay away from this despite what reviews indicate. (e.g what I consider sweet is YSL La Nuit Parfum - but this doesnt stay long) I love Versache Man Eau Fraiche for a Citrusy flavor, and longevity. Even Chanel Bleu is excellent - has this orange/grapefruit citrus scent</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT ARTICLE RECOMMEND IT TO ALL THE COMMUNITY CAN GIVE WITNESS IS HIGH QUALITY AND SATISFY MY NEEDS, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE AS RECEIVED WAS HOPING THAT IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED</li>
    <li> BOUGH THIS FOR MY HUSBAND , HE LOVED IT , BUT BEST OF ALL I LOVE IT. BEST COLOGNE OUT THERE .</li>
    <li> I bought this after the sample I wore from Nordstrom got me multiple compliments from strangers. The scent is a nice combination of musk for the fall and fresh/sweet scent that you can wear for the spring/summer nights out.</li>
    <li> So i bought this Cologne about a year ago from.Amazon and i couldn&#x27;t be happier with this scent strong but smooth crisp and fresh . I&#x27;m not a Cologne buff or anything near it but ido own this  Cologne and Calvin kleins summer cologne , both.from.Amazon winning !</li>
    <li> I never really liked this brand. However, I smelled a sample of this cologne.. Fantastic, smells amazing. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I like this very much.it was as advertised. It was for a gift and they loved it.</li>
    <li> Nice cologne, gotten many compliments on this cologne. It has an all day lasting scent, would recommend it to friends!</li>
    <li> I want to preface this review that there are many factors that affect the scent of a cologne on a individual.  The scent is okay on me, but nothing that really gets the ladies going.  I will use this for around the house and other places where I am not looking to make a statement.  It smells okay, but will not purchase the scent again.</li>
    <li> smells great he love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I bought this for my husband and it smells awesome! It lasts all day and smells just as good as when he first put it on.</li>
    <li> I order alot online, but took a chance on this fragrance based solely on Reviews.  Too lazy to take a ride to Mall and smell test.  I Like it.  Fiance and coworkers agree it is a very pleasent fragrance.  I am happy.</li>
    <li> Huum i dont lik that much</li>
    <li> I like original better... This one has the original smell plus a hint of chocolate to it. That sounds strange, but it does. It still smells good, but the original is better.</li>
    <li> I tend to buy my husband his colognes and he&#x27;s always happy with what I purchase.  I hesitated to buy this one last Christmas because when I went to the counter the salesperson said something like, &amp;#34;Oh, you&#x27;re like the hundreth person coming to buy this!&amp;#34;  Personally, I like to wear things no other&#x27;s wear but because I wasn&#x27;t going to wear it and it smells sooooo great I put that philosophy aside.  My husband says it&#x27;s his favorite one so far.  Buying thru Amazon saves a bunch and I&#x27;m all for that!</li>
    <li> For $70 I got a 1.6once bottle in JCPenny but returned it when I saw I could get 3onces for less on here.</li>
    <li> Having been a fan of Gucci for a while now I have found this is now my favorite.Great smell(everyone likes it)last for a while and just what you would expect from Gucci.</li>
    <li> If you like orgasmic smells in your nose, this will do it. I love gucci guilty, instant turn on when he walks in the room</li>
    <li> It seems like Chanel Allure, Polo Red &amp; Lecoste White all have that lingering clean smell similar to Guilty. It&#x27;s not real strong so get this intense one; I can smell it on my collar the next day!  I do have a spray tester the girl filled at the department  store and this is 100% identical!  Smells are very personal and believe it or not one fragrance can smell different one day to the next by variance in diet, stress or/and meds!</li>
    <li> I like the regular better,this has more of a metal smell than the powder smell of regular Guilty.This still smells good,its just different.I personally was wanting the smell of the regular Guilty but wanted it to last longer.I keep it,it will just be on the dresser a little longer than the regular.</li>
    <li> I paid about $60.00 for this on amazon and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. It has a pretty strong smell that I have gotten multiple compliments on already. This is definitely a younger man&#x27;s cologne. My scent preferences are along the lines of Polo Black, Ferrari Black, John Varvatos and F by Ferragamo and I&#x27;d rank this up there with any of them. It&#x27;s a great, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> This has basically become my favorite cologne.  I use this everyday, I did not use cologne before everyday and only on the weekends.  But now I use Intense every day.</li>
    <li> seller was great, but Gucci needs to go back to the drawing board ,way back. i cant believe they put the Gucci name on this putrid mess. i can honestly say this is one of the worst, weird smelling  colognes Ive  came across.</li>
    <li> was purchased as a gift for my husband it smells great he absolutely loves it and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> This was shipped really fast and has a nice smell. Would definetely recommend for others. Great buy and met expectations.</li>
    <li> Bought mine in London, I wanted something that was different, sufficiently masculine yet sweet. These days perfumes smell more and more alike and its hard to tell them apart, but this one is nice and different, love it!</li>
    <li> smells like heaven. this is my signature smell</li>
    <li> This is for real men. The ladies love this for some reason from young to old.  Its really nice and cool.</li>
    <li> Nice scent! Its a little on the intense side, but that means I won&#x27;t have to use as much as with my old cologne. Overall pretty nice. I have yet to wear it, so I&#x27;ll have to edit this review after my girlfriend gets a chance to smell it haha.</li>
    <li> Not great. Not really what I was looking for. Should have gone to the store to buy and test it first.</li>
    <li> This was a new scent chosen for my husband. I found this to be a nice choice and I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Paid $82 in the store just because I couldn&#x27;t wait the time for it to ship. If you want attention from the ladies this is the best one out there.  Projects itself out and they come flockin!  It&#x27;s kind of a rich deep smell so maybe not the best for the office or school but when the sun goes down you&#x27;ll be happy you have jt</li>
    <li> Smells like the real stuff you buy from the mall. Same scent and cheaper price, and the scent lasts forever!!</li>
    <li> For some reason I don&#x27;t believe its real. I have had it before and its my all time fav but this time it does not smell the same regardless of how much I put on.&lt;br /&gt;Ones I had befote from macys, one could smell it all day long on me but this one you cant smell it after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with my purchase this time from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered a new one from macys today to compare it to see if its real.or fake</li>
    <li> Just as I expected..from Casual to Business. Subtle yet Crisp. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can not tell how much I love it, it is cheaper than any store , , , , , , , ,</li>
    <li> Smells awesome.  It lasts a long time compared to others that last just a few hours.  Highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. Doesnt last long though. Maybe 5 hrs. I need something that can last all day. I love smelling good but i dont want to spray myself 3 diff times a day. Come on now. DO BETTER!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne with the expectation that the fragrance would be intense.  Perhaps, it is my body chemistry or the amount that I apply, but the fragrance is subtle, not intense.  Because the cologne is suppose to be intense, I do not apply very much.  I have received only one compliment regarding the fragrance.  This causes me to doubt the intensity of the product.  Gucci Guilty Intense, however,  does have a very nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> The best cologne I have purchased thus far.  Smells incredible, the ladies dig it and the bottle is awesome looking, no lie.  Good gift for the fellas, ladies.</li>
    <li> Smells great and very good perfume. Good size and solid cap fit for travel. came well packaged and on time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne on Amazon as they had the best price (as is usually the case with most products). I receive many compliments when I wear it. You don&#x27;t need to use much as it is highly concentrated and as such will last a long time. If you&#x27;re a guy looking for a really nice quality cologne I&#x27;d order this product.</li>
    <li> Although this is the best cologne in the planet, I don&#x27;t recommend buying it online.  The scent does not last very long compared to the store-bought inventory.  What an unfortunate waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son for his 18th birthday.  He loved it and, more importantly, he got so many compliments that I know it was a big hit :)</li>
