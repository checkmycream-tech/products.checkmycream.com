      <li>Have had one by this manufacturer with toilet seat that was much larger and more secure.  </li>
      <li>This item comes in very handy when someone is too ill to get to the bathroom quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy, and works well.</li>

      <li>so she wont be going up &amp; down our stairs while pregnant.</li>
      <li>The description is very deceptive - I would never imagine that commode that can (supposedly) be used over a toilet would come with out the directing chute to make sure your waste goes INTO the toilet instead of on the rim.  </li>
      <li>This commode is sturdy, easy to adjust, and can be assembled in less than 5 minutes---NO EXAGGERATION!!  </li>

<li> husband weighs over 225 and finds this a little light weight for regular use.</li>
<li> But if you have trouble getting up and down due to weakness, and you want a high toilet seat, that leaves a large space between your rear end and the toilet rim.  </li>
<li> with both a bucket and lid AND an attachment to void the space between the seat and the toilet when using it on the stool.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this was not 5 stars is because it came grey</li>
<li> Can be used over existing toilet which is a benefit but haven&#x27;t used for that yet.</li>
<li> I bought this commode to use over my toilet.  </li>
<li> It also comes with a sleeve to use over the existing toilet that prevents splashing on the rim or floor of the bathroom.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, there is no &amp;#34;open-ended bucket&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;chute&amp;#34; to direct waste into the toilet.  </li>
<li> I have had several other &amp;#34;bedside commodes&amp;#34; and every one has come with a bucket (for bedside use) and a chute (for over the toilet use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> If only there was a way to flush away waste with a standard toilet or handle.</li>
<li> All in One Commode  is ok for a while but is very uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Key pieces of hardware that are required for operation are missing.</li>
<li> The phone number on the parts list asks me to enter a Remote Access Code.</li>
<li> What I needed person doesn&#x27;t have to go down long dark walk way to get to the bathroom.</li>
<li> If you use it over the toilet without this piece, you will get urine and feces all over the rim of the toilet underneath it (unless you are a delicate and well-aimed pooper).  </li>
<li> you will have a major mess on your hands!!!</li>
<li> This toilet seat looks like it should be used for a small child.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a really strong commode and fits nicely over one of the newer taller toilets.  It has a great shield to keep splashing to a minimum</li>
    <li> My wife uses this because she has problems getting to the bathroom at times. It shipped very quick. Excellent quality and came fully assembled. Can be used over existing toilet which is a benefit but haven&#x27;t used for that yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dad and he seems to have no complaints.  The commode is fairly easy to pick up and isn&#x27;t too heavy which makes it pretty convenient and simple to use.  We have also used it in the shower.  Overall, a trustworthy item.</li>
    <li> I received the bedside comode and it met all my expectations, I was very pleased with the ease of assembly and very happy with the quality of the product. I would recommend this product to anyone who is in need of such an item.</li>
    <li> This item comes in very handy when someone is too ill to get to the bathroom quickly.  It is easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> sturdy and portable - seat and lid snap on/off - crossbars pop out which make it foldable - perfect for travel - seat not comfortable for prolonged use, however price and portability make it a good choice</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but I question why the product name says that it can be folded. It most certainly cannot be folded up without disassembling it. Perhaps the product information has changed? I won&#x27;t return it because the need is immediate, but I do question the title that appears on this information page.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife while pregnant so she wont be going up &amp; down our stairs while pregnant. Restrooms are upstairs so sure came in handy. Lightweight and durable. fast delivery and easy setup.</li>
    <li> Commode is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Came with both a bucket and lid AND an attachment to void the space between the seat and the toilet when using it on the stool.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this was not 5 stars is because it came grey and we would have liked white.  Product is great tho.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my mom to use while she recovers in my home from a broken hip.  It was super easy to assemble and works like a charm.  My mom is tall, 5&#x27;11&amp;#34;, and I was able to adjust it to a very comfortable position.  It also fits nicely over the toilet to use during the daytime.  It&#x27;s sturdy and stable and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I have had this product now for about 3 months.It&#x27;s easy to clean, maintain, safe and easy to use. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I found this unit attractive looking, for what it is, and sturdy.  My mom liked it at first, but then found that she could not complete her hygiene needs because the opening was too small  (and she is a little woman).  She also did not find the seat very comfortable to her old bones.  THe company was kind enought to refund me.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on item and in new condition.  Works well as a spare toilet, very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Really sturdy, reliable, affordable. You can close it.</li>
    <li> INDISPENSIBLE when you have a broken or impaired leg...I never fails you ever.&lt;br /&gt;And is sturdy to support you.  I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it !!&lt;br /&gt;KOKO</li>
    <li> When the commode was delivered, the box was beat-up, but the commode was in great shape. It&#x27;s very sturdy, and works well. If I wanted to be really picky, it could have more height adjustments, but other than that--great product.</li>
    <li> Worked well in our emergency.&lt;br /&gt;Does not fold up, but it was easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great products. Meets my needs.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put together.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Clean.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I like how the legs can be adjusted.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price-my daughter had knee surgery and we purchased this product because she is unable to move much.  The bedside commode also works well in the shower--just place it in the shower, help patient to the shower and allow the patient time to take a shower!</li>
    <li> I bought this commode to use over my toilet.  Product information indicates that it can be used bedside or over the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is no &amp;#34;open-ended bucket&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;chute&amp;#34; to direct waste into the toilet.  If you use it over the toilet without this piece, you will get urine and feces all over the rim of the toilet underneath it (unless you are a delicate and well-aimed pooper).  The description is very deceptive - I would never imagine that commode that can (supposedly) be used over a toilet would come with out the directing chute to make sure your waste goes INTO the toilet instead of on the rim.  I have had several other &amp;#34;bedside commodes&amp;#34; and every one has come with a bucket (for bedside use) and a chute (for over the toilet use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does say that it has a bucket, and it does not say that it has a waste-directing chute.  So it is &amp;#34;as advertised&amp;#34;.  And it would probably be fine if you put it down low right over the toilet rim.  But if you have trouble getting up and down due to weakness, and you want a high toilet seat, that leaves a large space between your rear end and the toilet rim.  One bout of diarrhea and you will have a major mess on your hands!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for an elderly relative who was coming to visit us for the holidays.  She is about 300 pounds and this held up fine.  Easy to empty and clean.</li>
    <li> Adjustable height is essential. Fit and finish are good. If only there was a way to flush away waste with a standard toilet or handle. Makes one of the tasks of elder care easier with easy to clean pot.</li>
    <li> it really serves its purpose, my mother need it, and it stands nice and firm next to her bed, good product</li>
    <li> This product more than exceeded my expectationss. After looking at bedside commodes at Walgreens and CVS for over $100. I wss delighted when fining this on Amazon. Amazon will be my first choice for future needs. This product was equal in quality to those viewed in the stores.</li>
    <li> Although I listed this product as satisfactory, it was not as heavy weight as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;My husband weighs over 225 and finds this a little light weight for regular use.</li>
    <li> This is the same product (as close as I can tell) to the one my wife used in the hospital.  It is a good trade off between being light weight and sturdy.  Very easy assembly.  I would not say I love it, but it is very functional. Quick shipping, all in all a good experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who had some extensive back surgery a week ago.  I love the 3 way design that can be used as a bedside commode, over the existing toilet and also in the shower.  Very versatile and well built.  The arms make it easy for the patient to lift themselves up utilizing arm power if their legs are in a weakened state.  It also comes with a sleeve to use over the existing toilet that prevents splashing on the rim or floor of the bathroom.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs that extra assistance or is having any health/surgical issues.</li>
    <li> Bought after back surgery on the advice of an occupational therapist at the hospital, and was really glad I had followed her advice.  Fits easily over the regular height toilets and makes getting up sooooo much easier!</li>
    <li> This item is very serviceable. It is sturdy and easy to assemble. It is the right height for a tall person. It was delivered in good time especially since it was purchased during the Christmas season.</li>
    <li> This commode is sturdy, easy to adjust, and can be assembled in less than 5 minutes---NO EXAGGERATION!!  NO tools, NO pieces to lose, No extra &#x27;stuff&#x27;.  I&#x27;m an over-sized woman and it&#x27;s very comfortable.  The arms make it easy to use and access and the rubber feet keep it stable. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Item came very fast, as described and in good condition. The seat lid has a small dent/scrape, but I think that was due to shipping as the box was a bit mangled. It is very sturdy and looks nice (for what it is). Can&#x27;t beat this for less than $40!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed and a third of the price of stores. It arrived in three days and was easy to assemble !</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner in good shape. Works great I love it! Will order from buyer again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> very well made. goes over toilet easily.</li>
    <li> It was everything it said it would be - very user friendly, Especially useful in the sick room, if patient needs a hurry call to the bathroom. Would highly recommend purchasing one.</li>
    <li> What I needed person doesn&#x27;t have to go down long dark walk way to get to the bathroom. It is safe and easy to use</li>
    <li> Have had one by this manufacturer with toilet seat that was much larger and more secure.  This toilet seat looks like it should be used for a small child.  Very frustrated because I needed it for my Mother who is a tiny person but this is way too little for an adult.  There was nothing in the description or pictures that would have prepared me for the skimpy size of this seat.  Would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Any one on Chemo and going every two hours round the clock will benifit greatly from one. Easy to use and easy to clean. Use right a bed side. After washing out add a bit of white vinigar before you return the bucket to the chair.</li>
    <li> brought it for elder person, she love it , can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Though after a year the seat cracked at the corners.  Luckily we do not need it.  I checked and the newer ones have changed the design of the seat.  Even the replacement seats are of the new design.</li>
    <li> Key pieces of hardware that are required for operation are missing. The phone number on the parts list asks me to enter a Remote Access Code. Where is Customer Service to fix this problem? Meanwhile my mother is home at risk of falling.</li>
    <li> Bedside Commode/Toilet Seat/Safety Rails - All in One Commode  is ok for a while but is very uncomfortable. Needs larger seat for men.</li>
