      <li>The best advice would be to buy the New Nicole Miller on Amazon for $17.97 and stay clear of buying this product from merchants on Amazon Marketplace.</li>
      <li>Thank you for having this available.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy to see this product back on the market.  </li>
      <li>I am writing this VERY positive review of the product &amp;#34;Nicole Miller by Nicole Miller&amp;#34;, because it is the most incredible Eau De Parfum spray I have ever purchased and I was extremely concerned when I heard it would be discontinued.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased a handbag from nicole miller and it was very cheaply made and broke within the first week.</li>
      <li>My wife didn&#x27;t like the smell either, after reading the reviews in this forum I learned that this perfume is popular with the older crowd.</li>
      <li>I knew this particular one was discontinued after using it for years and years and absolutely loving it</li>
      <li>but this is the original one.  </li>
      <li>the delivery was way ahead of the original schedule.</li>
      <li>SO the question is it original?</li>
      <li>THINK IT IS THE ORIGINAL</li>
      <li>I like the original Nicole Miller...</li>
      <li>The product was not sealed, but in its original box.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with its scent the first time I wore it.</li>
      <li>However, I have always preferred the original fragrance for me.</li>
      <li>very much covered my expectations, thank you very much for good recommendations with you, thanks</li>
      <li>I received a spray sample of this scent and absolutely LOVED it so ordered it and received it in only 2 days.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it is great.</li>
      <li>super satisfecho estoy, no me arrepiento en nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(fluted glass bottle packaged in a black box with gold trim) is a wonderful fragrance that I highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>had been looking for this fragrance for a while and was lucky enough to find it at such an incredible price.</li>
      <li>I bought it as a gift for someone and it looks and smells nice enough for that.</li>
      <li>It starts out with a strong scent but turns soft quickly.</li>
      <li>but of course it wasn&#x27;t the right one.  </li>
      <li>and i have no regrets i love this scent</li>
      <li>Cost was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>What they sent was in a gold, flatter, more square box with a different shaped bottle.</li>
      <li>I had been searching to replace it ever since I finished my first bottle..  </li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars only because it did not have the outer transparent wrapping/seal that most perfumes come with.</li>
      <li>It had the same lovely scent that I remembered..  </li>
      <li>I love this, it&#x27;s the only perfume I can wear that doesn&#x27;t affect my migraines.</li>
      <li>I was dubious about this fragrance when I first put it on.  </li>
      <li>It is a good perfume, lasts long, but I&#x27;m 21 and this perfume is not for young people, I gave it to my mom and she likes it.</li>
      <li>This perfume is far from being original.</li>
      <li>Wow estoy super contento por el producto, muy bueno, llego rapido  y en buen estado.</li>
      <li>It is as much a statement of my personality as the clothes I wear.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s mind what it wants to be -</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t spray too much on or you&#x27;ll be over powered.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t get much done this way, wish they&#x27;d give me a phone number</li>
      <li>very strange.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When I could not find it I was very dissapointed.  </li>
      <li>so I can speak to a real person.</li>
      <li>but when they showed the same bottle and box of the discontinued one I was so excited</li>
      <li>I specifically tried to order the older version and picked that from the site.</li>
      <li>the (New) version was sent in it&#x27;s place...</li>
      <li>Received New Nicole Miller instead of product shown.  </li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to search for a new perfume...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was definately a bait and switch situation.  They show the picture of the discontinued perfume that I thought I was getting and substitute with another Nicole Miller perfume that I hated.  I knew this particular one was discontinued after using it for years and years and absolutely loving it but when they showed the same bottle and box of the discontinued one I was so excited but of course it wasn&#x27;t the right one.  No problem returning for credit but that shouldn&#x27;t be happening.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I was dubious about this fragrance when I first put it on.  I thought it was too strong, but I was pleasantly surprised when it dried down to a soft elegance.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume... I get so many compliments when I wear it. I have tried to other scent; however I like this one the best.</li>
    <li> I must admit that the order arrived promptly. But I was disappointed to find out that the perfume was not sealed (there was no plastic wrap so one could easily tamper with the contents of the bottle). It appears that Nicole Miller does not sell it sealed so I won&#x27;t blame the seller. My wife didn&#x27;t like the smell either, after reading the reviews in this forum I learned that this perfume is popular with the older crowd. My wife and I would like to share following lesson with the readers ..\\&quot;Visit nearby mall or any store that sells perfumes .. try the testers and select the one you like .. then come here (Amazon).. check the price and order it if it is going to be cheaper\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I Buy this exact Nicole Miller perfume the past 5 years and I love it! Ive never had a problem with anything like this in the past. I received it and the color was off and the smell was tainted... does not even sort of smell like the perfume. Since there is no returns (go figure) Im stuck with a bad product and need to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE!! unless I got an old one or something since the other reviews are decent... very strange.&lt;br /&gt;I gave two stars ONLY cuz shipping was one time.</li>
    <li> I love Nicole Miller for Men and since I wear both men&#x27;s \\&quot;AND\\&quot; women&#x27;s colognes/purfumes I decided to try Nicole Miller for woman. Its NOTHING like the cologne but wonderful in its own right and quite strong (unlike Nicole Miller for Men). I can&#x27;t really describe how it smells other than its very nice, but a little goes a long way. Don&#x27;t spray too much on or you&#x27;ll be over powered.</li>
    <li> This smells like gardenias to me.  It is powerful and long lasting. My husband said I smelled good which was a rare comment from him.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to see this product back on the market.  I have searched for 10 yrs to find a replacement scent, without any luck.  I had given up then I found it just browseing on Amazon.com.  Thank you for having this available.  I will never smell bad again......</li>
    <li> The bottle looks so weird it has no name on it or any sticker at then end.Without its packing no one can say its Nicole miller&#x27;s perfume.I have bought one from Macy&#x27;s its completely different so i would suggest everyone not to buy it.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars only because it did not have the outer transparent wrapping/seal that most perfumes come with. Other than that, it is great. I bought it as a gift for someone and it looks and smells nice enough for that.</li>
    <li> I really liked this perfume - bought it without smelling it and I just loved it and what a wonderful price.</li>
    <li> This perfume is far from being original. It&#x27;s a fake one. The bottle has no name on it and it&#x27;s so oily. I regret getting it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume. She has always had trouble finding it. It should never have been discontinued (her words). Order arrived in plenty of time.Cost was very reasonable. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received a spray sample of this scent and absolutely LOVED it so ordered it and received it in only 2 days. That is the good part. The bad part is that it doesn&#x27;t smell the same. It is stronger and smells like it has aged from not being used for a long time. Then I found you can&#x27;t return fragrances to Amazon so I am very disappointed. I wish I could figure out how to make the smell better so I can use it.</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years and I love the scent. It lasts a long time throughout the day, would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
    <li> NM Nicole Miller is an overwhelmingly sweet AND complex floral. On me, it&#x27;s a lot-o-note mess, and I just can&#x27;t stand it. It like NM Nicole Miller can&#x27;t make up it&#x27;s mind what it wants to be - fruity-floral, oriental, floriental, gourmand. So, I&#x27;ll make up it&#x27;s mind for it. NM Nicole Miller is scrubber. This olfactory chaos is nauseating. I might as well be on a carnival ride, at least I&#x27;d get something out of the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to prefer more simplicity in my sweets and in my florientals. If you&#x27;re like that too, you might just steer clear of this one, or at least try it before you buy it. I&#x27;m glad that I did!</li>
    <li> Love the scent. And free shipping too! What a great deal! Smells great for the mature woman.</li>
    <li> It is a good perfume, lasts long, but I&#x27;m 21 and this perfume is not for young people, I gave it to my mom and she likes it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since 1992, it is my favorite, and always will be my best go to perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I thought I would receive the item as pictured and the (New) version was sent in it&#x27;s place...I like the original Nicole Miller...the one in the black box........that&#x27;s the one I want.....I guess I&#x27;ll have to search for a new perfume...I hate the bottle used in the New Nicole Miller...too awkward to hold and heavy...Yuk!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PERFUME FOR ALONG TIME AND I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> this perfume was very difficult to find for quite a long time.  I had been searching to replace it ever since I finished my first bottle..  I fell in love with its scent the first time I wore it. When I could not find it I was very dissapointed.  I just about gave up.  I found it last year and ordered it.  It had the same lovely scent that I remembered..  It comes in a very lovely bos and a beautiful  artistic bottle.  I have been  complimented on the scent many times and I love wearing it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and used to be a great buy, however I think word has gotten out about this fragrance and the price keeps going up.</li>
    <li> THe box was not sealed in plastic as all the originals are. SO the question is it original? I think not.</li>
    <li> I am writing this VERY positive review of the product &amp;#34;Nicole Miller by Nicole Miller&amp;#34;, because it is the most incredible Eau De Parfum spray I have ever purchased and I was extremely concerned when I heard it would be discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have tried the &amp;#34;(New)&amp;#34; version and feel it is pleasant and I did buy more.  However, I have always preferred the original fragrance for me. I LOVE IT and people I don&#x27;t even know have stopped me on the street, in supermarkets at my place of employment (--EVERYWHERE!) to compliment me on the aroma!  I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE!: DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS FORMULA FOR AN EXQUISITE FRAGRANCE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider my perfume to be a part of my style. It is as much a statement of my personality as the clothes I wear. In fact, I am not completely dressed without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Nicole Miller by Nicole Miller&amp;#34; is in a class by itself! There is no substitute.</li>
    <li> I purchased a handbag from nicole miller and it was very cheaply made and broke within the first week. When I contacted the company, as I did not have my receipt any longer, they would not stand behind the product at all. They had me take pictures of the bag and it took them over a month to respond, and they only respond after I inquired an additional time. They were unwilling to stand behind their cheaply made product and the customers service I received was horrible. I would not recommend this company to anyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent amd perfect price.</li>
    <li> Item took forever to arrive and is not as pictured/described. I specifically tried to order the older version and picked that from the site. That is not what I received so the scent is different.</li>
    <li> The product was not sealed, but in its original box.  Because it was described as new, I thought it would have been unopened also.</li>
    <li> Received  the wrong product, a different Nicole Miller and now I have to go through the hassle to return it!!</li>
    <li> completely satisfiecod with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this by chance and at a great deal! The fragrance is different but I am trying to like it.</li>
    <li> Who knew the name Nicole Miller when this 1st came out? I got a sample to try, and ran the next day to buy a 1 oz bottle. Low, many yrs later, it&#x27;s still in my collect, though hard to find.</li>
    <li> Vintage Nicole Miller perfume.  This fragrance is not made anymore but this is the original one.  Fast delivery and would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Nicole Miller&#x27;s parfum I would recommend this size and brand it is a large bottle for the price and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Perfumes and fragrances do not get better with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody who buys a fragrance that has been &amp;#34;OUT OF PRINT&amp;#34; so to speak, should check the&lt;br /&gt;batch/lot code of the product before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find them under the bottle and at the bottom of the folding carton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is usually a 4 or 5 digit number, sometimes letters and called a Julian Code.&lt;br /&gt;For very small items it can be one or 2 letters or 2 numbers only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first number is the year it was made in, the next 3 is the day , so 5031 would be January 31st , 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Letters indicate shifts (A,B,C) or manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the type of fragrance they can last from 3 - 5 years, depending on storage.&lt;br /&gt;Citrussy perfumes turn faster than orientals.&lt;br /&gt;As the fragrance oils keep working , over time they turn dark and turn into a different smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrances get usually discontinued as their marketing life is about 3-5 years also, except for classics like Chanel No. 5 or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary if you have had a hard time to find your favorite fragrance for years, chances are it is old.&lt;br /&gt;It may or may not have turned bad.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragerance!</li>
    <li> Received New Nicole Miller instead of product shown.  It came in a different packaging and has a different smell.  The product that is displayed is no longer sold in most stores.  Fragrances are not returnable.  The best advice would be to buy the New Nicole Miller on Amazon for $17.97 and stay clear of buying this product from merchants on Amazon Marketplace.</li>
    <li> I really liked this fragrance, but I prefer a stronger Perfume. It starts out with a strong scent but turns soft quickly.</li>

    <li> I love this perfume.  My aunt bought it for me once and it&#x27;s since been my signature scent.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> love this perfume get compliments about it all the time, everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s the only perfume I can wear that doesn&#x27;t affect my migraines. My last purchase of 2 bottles was a different experience. What they sent was in a gold, flatter, more square box with a different shaped bottle. I saw that item when I ordered this, but instead of sending this one they sent the other. I&#x27;M NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR SERVICE....I WANT WHAT I ORDERED. They said I had to return the items UNOPENED...I had to open one of them to test the scent...to me, it is a little different. I&#x27;ve used this for years and I don&#x27;t want a substitute. Can&#x27;t get much done this way, wish they&#x27;d give me a phone number so I can speak to a real person. This is in no way a complaint against Nicole Miller Perfume, just not happy with the seller.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product by the picture you see here...This is the fragrance I LOVE...This is NOT what I got.  I got the other Nicole Miller  fragrance. Not happy at all, This stuff they sent me stinks!</li>
    <li> I just love this fragrance. I always receive many many compliments when I wear this. It is a pleasure wearing.</li>
    <li> So glad that I found this perfume.  It is one of my all time favorites.  I received my order very fast and am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> There is a reason this costs $10. It smells bad. Definitely a bad choice so make no mistake you will regret this purchase.gave it one star because there were no other choices</li>
    <li> had been looking for this fragrance for a while and was lucky enough to find it at such an incredible price. the delivery was way ahead of the original schedule. quite satisfied with this item.</li>
    <li> i cannot get this perfume any longer in my country so i bought it from Amazon and i have no regrets i love this scent and i would recommend it to any and every one</li>
    <li> This item was a guess and it exceeded my expectations. Wonderful fun fragrance, not too strong. have received many compliments</li>
    <li> would definitedly buy again</li>
    <li> Has been an excellent experience thank you very much covered my expectations, thank you very much for good recommendations with you, thanks</li>
    <li> It was a nice size for the price. I gave it to my Mom as a gift and she was very pleased.</li>
    <li> persona muy reponsable al momento de la entrega del producto son persona responsable al momento de envio del productor sin mas que decir saludos</li>
    <li> The pictured item, which is Nicole Miller eau de parfum (the fragrance introduced about 20 years ago), was NOT the item delivered to me.  Instead, the vendor shipped the Nicole Miller fragrance that was launched in about 2010.  When I contacted the vendor, they tried to convince me that only the packaging had changed.  Given that I&#x27;ve worn the fragrance I ordered for nearly 20 years, it was an unsuccessful argument.  The vendor did not supply me with a return shipping ticket, but instead instructed me to return the item at my own expense.  Thank goodness for Amazon---they were most helpful in seeing that I received a refund.  I should clarify that the Nicole Miller fragrance pictured here (fluted glass bottle packaged in a black box with gold trim) is a wonderful fragrance that I highly recommend.  In this case, it is only the vendor that I cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> IT WAS OKAY ,I DONT THINK IT IS THE ORIGINAL</li>
    <li> Wow estoy super contento por el producto, muy bueno, llego rapido  y en buen estado. super satisfecho estoy, no me arrepiento en nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gracias.</li>
