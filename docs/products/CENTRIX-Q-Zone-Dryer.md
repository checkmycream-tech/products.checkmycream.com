<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you want a quiet blow dryer that leaves your hair feeling soft, try this product. The air blows quickly, so my short hairstyle is dry in no time. Yes, the product is a little heavier than other blow dryers I have owned, but the results of quickly dried, softly styled hair in peace and quiet are worth the extra weight.</li>
    <li> I wanted this for a long time but held out because of the price. It is totally worth it! It is a small price to pay to save your hearing, and considering it&#x27;s something I use everyday I feel am getting my money&#x27;s worth. It is very quiet compared to mainstream dryers, but not whisper quiet. It has a lot of power and it dries my thick hair super fast, and doesn&#x27;t fry it. It does have some heft to it if you&#x27;re used to using a budget hair dryer, but not so heavy that your arms get tired. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because, like some other reviewers mentioned, the heat control switches can flip as you grip the handle. I would recommend this to everyone because it is a high-quality hair dryer that won&#x27;t damage your hearing.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably quiet. The best.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see how much time off my morning routine this dryer saved me. It&#x27;s supper fast and quiet.  I get up at 4am and my husband said he does not even hear it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last two months and started to smell then broke</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend that you get this dryer. On high it&#x27;s way quieter than a crappy one on low. Also, the power out of this thing is surprising. Quieter and more powerful, DO IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the motor in mine has loose mounts (so it buzzes a little bit). Not that it affects performance, it just reflects poorly on build quality.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is quiet, light weight, and dries my shoulder length hair quickly. It is easy to&lt;br /&gt;pack in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> My wife always complains about the noise from hair dryers. Now she borrows mine .hands down the best choice yet.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time in the master bathroom and I sleep right through it! Not to mention she loves the hair dryer!</li>
    <li> It is what I wanted, except for size.  I was hoping for smaller for more easy hand-held.  Other then that it is quiet, a major concern and reason to purchase.  It functions well and does the job that is needed.  Multiple speeds add to its value.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Chi dryer that was very effective and quiet; however, one day the heating element completely failed.  It seems that this is a problem reported by many others.  So, I researched and found this product.  It is very effective - quick drying with the benefits of ionic dryers.  And it is even quieter than the Chi dryer.  At this writing, we have only had this about a month,  so I cannot vouch for durability and longevity.  It does occasionally \\&quot;cycle\\&quot; to cooler air output, so given previous experience, I am slightly leery.  If it continues to work effectively, then this is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Maltese when I started grooming her myself, and I liked it so much I bought one for myself!  It really is more quiet than the usual hair dryer.  The airflow is faster than my previous &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; dryer, nearly as fast as a professional salon dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife requested this purchase.  Arrived very quickly, packaged well.  It is absolutely quieter than any other blow dryers she has used, I inquired as to its blowing power and she said it is as powerful as most any of the others.  I was told \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> In fact, there are still some noise, but a kind of smooth noise, without the unpleasent high frequencie ones. 4 stars, but not 5. But I enjoyed the purchase.</li>
    <li> All 3 of us have these quiet hair dryers! My hair thin and fine , other 2 girls thick long hair, it is efficient on all !</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very quiet. I bought it for the quietness. It seemed to have a gentle blow but the hair dry very fast. The built quality is good.Look professional.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hair stylist and have used this dryer for several years now. To my surprise, I was able to purchase it cheaper through Amazon than the local beauty supply. This dryer is quiet enough to hold a conversation while drying and light enough to keep my arm from fatigue. I also use one at home for my personal use. It dries quickly and the ionic feature keeps my hair from getting damaged. I am very happy with this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair drier I have ever owned.  It is just like the ones used at the barber and beauty shops.  It is very quiet and blows a controlled stream of warm air over your hair.  I love it and will be buying one for my daughter this Christmas.</li>
    <li> My husband found this blow dryer for me as he was tired of being woken up. He also was concerned about potential hearing loss with longterm use.  This blow dryer is well worth the money!  It&#x27;s so quiet, any other dryer sounds like a jet engine.  I shared it with my hairdresser and his group was suitably impressed.  In fact, when his dryer needs to be replaced, he&#x27;s planning on buying one of these.</li>
    <li> I wanted a quiet dryer to dry my horse after winter workouts when it is cold.  This dryer is perfect!  I can get him dry in a fraction of the time and he actually loves the dryer!  He gets totally relaxed and enjoys being pampered!</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair dryer! I was weary at first since the cost is high but it was worth it for me. Gone are the days with a high pitch whiny hair dryer! I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who is searching for a quiet hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS HAIRDRYER AS A GIFT AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.  IT IS VERY QUIET AND OFFERS A VARIETY OF SETTINGS.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could write a review about this thing and say it&#x27;s not the quietest high-quality hairdryer available!  I research my purchases extensively--both online (reviews) and locally--and this was no exception.  Went to local stores to do the hands-on testing after regretably purchasing a FHI Nano 2000 based on reviews and subsequently returned (loud, too hot, not impressed at all).  Tried MANY and narrowed it down to the Chi, Rusk, and the Centrix (which like the FHI was unavailable for me to try locally).  The Chi was quiet but had only one heat setting which was too hot for my twin 5 yr-old daughters!  The Rusk Speed Freak was impressive--tied for most quiet of the ones on display and seemed well built, but the other one it tied with was the SAME one we are replacing--the Revlon T Studio (less than half the price).  Was really hoping for QUIETER and BETTER.  Also, while the Rusk has 3 heat settings, the low was too low and the medium was a bit too scorching for my skin.  Took a chance on the Centrix and am VERY impressed!  The packaging screamed top-of-line product, the hair-dryer feels extremely well made, and the best part......ran in to the bathroom and plugged it in next to the T studio for a side by side comparison.  The result:  OMG....not even CLOSE!!  SOOO much quieter!  My daughters and I can have a conversation or listen to music while we dry, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the long term toll this ritual is having on my family&#x27;s hearing!  My wife&#x27;s hair absolutely looks healthier and she does not find it heavy or cumbersome in the slightest (5&#x27;4\\&quot;, 95lbs!).  The middle heat setting is PERFECT and it dries quickly too!  You will NOT regret this one.  Hope this helps some folks!</li>
    <li> This is the best and quietest hair dryer that I have ever had.  Nice features on the speed and heat settings.  Great cord length too.</li>
    <li> So far I find it much quieter than any other brands out there. However don&#x27;t expect it to be ultra silent.</li>
    <li> This is pleasantly quiet. It certainly makes a sound, but it doesn&#x27;t have any high-pitched whirring or headache-inducing roaring. About as distracting as the sound of gravel under a bicycle wheel (which is to say not very much, albeit noticeable). I only wish it came with a diffuser attachment for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This thing runs at 72Db +/- whereas every cheap hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had before is over 84Db. (Using sound meter android app.)</li>
    <li> The first blowdryer lost a screw within 2 days and was not quiet! Amazon fully refunded it and I ordered a new one... thinking that maybe it was a packaging issue. I received the 2nd one within days and used it for about 2  months. Didn&#x27;t cut substantial time off of blowdrying my hair, although it was definitly quieter!&lt;br /&gt;A few months after receiving it, it just died on me and will not turn back on. Not sure what happened. I am in the process of contacting the manufacturer. But, I will not purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This was not powerful enough, although it was quiet and light-weight.  I went back to my original hair dryer, a an FH1 Heat Platform Nano Salon 2000.</li>
    <li> My wife found this hair dryer online when she was searching for a dryer that didn&#x27;t make her ears ring.  She has short hair and wasn&#x27;t looking for a dryer that would dry her hair quickly since that was not an issue.  This dryer is so quiet that she can hear me in the next room while drying her hair and we can carry on a conversation if we like.  She has been using it daily for a month and is very happy with everything about it.  It has 3 speed settings and 3 heat settings.  She uses the hottest setting at the root and then uses the cold shot to lock in the lift.  She says this dryer helps her get a style like she gets at the salon.  She loves this dryer and says it is well worth the money since she uses it everyday and doesn&#x27;t want to damage her hearing.</li>
    <li> 1 star for being SLIGHTLY quieter than the normal hair dryer but then it&#x27;s downhill form there. They market this is \\&quot;insanely quiet\\&quot; , well they need to add that it&#x27;s also insanely heavy! This thing is way heavier than my cheap, pink Revlon dryer that performs just as well.This product doesn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster and doesn&#x27;t make it appear any smoother either than my Revlon that has the same ionic technology. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. I don&#x27;t believe that a real hair stylist could stand holding this thing all day unless they had Superman arms! Being only slightly quieter than an average, cheap dryer doesn&#x27;t warrant the high price!</li>
    <li> The dryer is well made, quiet and my wife says it dries her long hair much faster.  It is nice not to have to listen to a dryer that sounds like a jet in the morning.</li>
    <li> I dropped some extra dough on this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She gets up earlier than me some days and hers was just way too loud. This item is definitely an upgrade, although it does make some noise. She says it does as good of a job as the old one.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Extremely quiet and leaves your hair soft and smooth.  No complaints at all.  Even the cats don&#x27;t run from the bathroom now when I dry my hair!</li>
    <li> After less than 2 months, of using this dryer for only 10 minutes a day, it just quit! While the unit was replaced by the Cricket Company, I had to pay to ship it to them. 2 weeks after they received it (I had a tracking number), I had to call them to see when I could expect a replacement. I was told it was being shipped out that very day! What a coincidence! It arrived exactly 1 week after I called them. So, it took 3 weeks for them to get the replacement dryer to me. I also e-mailed the company and received no reply what-so-ever from them! This company has EXTREMELY POOR customer service!!!! I actually liked this dryer in the beginning. Now I am just waiting for it&#x27;s replacement to die, also! I have no confidence in this product at all!</li>
    <li> Nice and quiet (doesn&#x27;t wake the family) -- air flow is easy to control.  My hairdresser recommended this dryer and I can highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer because I was looking for a quiet one. It is! I like it. My only criticism is that you have to hold the cold air button down with you thumb.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to listen to the high pitched whine from my wife&#x27;s hair dryer, and so she would not suffer hearing loss. This unit is very quiet, especially since she only needs to use the lower speed setting to do a great job drying her hair.</li>
    <li> Very nice dryer, totally worth the price and very quiet.  I have super thick hair and it dries it very quickly.</li>
    <li> If you want a quiet hair dryer, this is the one for you.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am somewhat disappointed in the amount of noise the hair dryer makes. While it is slightly less noisy than a regular dryer, it is not as quiet as I (or my husband) had hoped. It does lack that high pitch squeal often associated with dryers and emits a deep, less irritating humming sound! (I hope the description is helpful for those seeking peace and quiet)It does definitely dry hair faster.</li>
    <li> While this is not quite as quiet as I had hoped, it still significantly better than my old dryer and also leaves my hair feeling much softer and healthier. This is a big dryer, the back part of it is a bit wide. This isn&#x27;t a problem or anything but I was surprised when I compared it to the old one. Like a few other reviewers, mine does make a slightly different sound on low but I almost never use the setting. Overall, fantastic dryer and my favorite part is how it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> Thanks to all the great reviews, I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this hair dryer a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the controls being on the outside of the handle is a bit awkward. However, this hair dryer is quiet and that&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for. I didn&#x27;t notice that it took any additional time to dry my hair, nor did i experience any awkward noises.</li>
    <li> Love this!  So happy that I spent the money.  My 3 year old daughter has long hair and hated the noise of other dryers.  She&#x27;ll sit still and let me dry her hair now with no issues.  The only thing I would change is the placement of the switches.  They are on the back and it&#x27;s very easy to turn it off or change the settings accidentally.</li>
    <li> Significantly quieter than a regular blow dryer. Works as well if not better. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to be able to watch TV in bed while your wife is blow drying her hair.</li>
    <li> I used a Tenma Sound Meter 72-935 to compare other brands of hair dryers to the Centrix Q Zone operating dryers on high. I monitored the sound level about an inch from and centered on the air intake and about an inch to the side at the front of the nozzle (not in the air stream).  The Centrix measured as much as 10db lower than the best of the four dryers to which I had access. That means it is perceived as being about half as loud. Tomorrow my wife will start using the dryer and we will learn how well it performs otherwise. Of course the price is significantly higher, but we value our hearing and comfort.</li>
    <li> From the reviews I hoped this would make my hair smooth and shiny but it didn&#x27;t.  It was pretty quiet, but my hair was in no better shape than if I had used a regular, much less expensive dryer.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present from my husband. He has complained our entire marriage that my hair dryers have all sounded like jet engines!  (We work different shifts and I&#x27;m getting ready to leave as he&#x27;s going to bed.)  It&#x27;s great!  Quietest hair dryer I have ever used. I can even carry on a conversation with someone while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my wife after I was on the other side of the house and couldn&#x27;t hear myself think because of the noise from her old hair dryer.  (I can&#x27;t imagine how awful it must have been for her to use the old one so close to her ears!)&lt;br /&gt;This new hair dryer is VERY quiet.  We can carry on a conversation in normal voices while she is drying her hair.  She says it dries her hair quicker than any other dryer she has ever used.  The power cord is also very long, which is quite nice.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after my hair dresser had bragged on it so much.  I love it and you can actually watch TV or hear someone speaking to you while drying your hair.  Mine works great!!</li>
    <li> I knew the moment that I turned it on that I had made the right choice.  The sound it makes is a subtle whir.  Weight is not an issue.  The quality is apparent.  I anticipate that it will provide me with many years of service.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer.  Super quiet and I thought worth the money .. until one of the elements burnt out after about 18months.  It does have two elements so I can still use it but it is half as hot (essentially I am using on low) and takes longer to dry my hair now.  All in all it&#x27;s a great hair dryer but for the price of it I would want it to last longer.  Think I will look for a different one to replace it.</li>
    <li> not quiet but quite a bit better.  worth buying . paid $80 so not too bad.  she likes it so..</li>
    <li> I was very sceptical when I read this dryer was insanely silent but wow, it is... Great speed and heat setting too. If you are looking for a somewhat higher end dryer this may be the one. If you are looking for a quiet one, this definitely will be the one!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is quite but very heavy and very big. The extra ring that comes with it has to be put on just right or the blow dryer make a buzzing sound. The nozzle attachment is not very stable, it spins very easily when in use. Disappointed in this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Prior to ordering the Centrix Q Zone Quiet 1500, I had never heard of it. Hairdryers were just another one of those afterthought, disposable electric implements to help you get through life. There are probably 3-4 hairdryers in various stages of use in our household. I was getting accustomed to that irritating whirring white noise, whether I was trying to sleep as my wife was getting ready in the morning, or when I was drying my hair or my kids&#x27; hair.&lt;br /&gt;Something made me think of the noise pollution from these devices and I started to research a quieter drying experience. I read the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere and decided to take the plunge with the Centrix.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick (thanks Amazon!) and the Centrix was nicely packaged in its own box.&lt;br /&gt;Since its first use, I have decided that this is a purchase I should have made a long time ago: the Centrix is supremely quiet, very flexible (3 speed settings, 3 heat settings + the cool shot feature) and moves a lot of air to speed hair drying. It bears repeating that this thing is quiet!&lt;br /&gt;Our whole family is pleased with the Centrix, and my ears are thanking me every day for liberating them from the decibel onslaught of the Centrix&#x27;s predecessors. I know it&#x27;s expensive, but buy this. Your hearing will thank you too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually give five stars but I couldn&#x27;t find a good reason to rate it lower.  It is bigger than my current hair dryer and I was concerned that it might be uncomfortable to use, but that was not the case - it is light enough to easily maneuver to any position.  My primary reason for buying the hair dryer was because it was advertised as being quiet.  My current hair dryer is so loud I put in ear plugs when I use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;insanely quiet&amp;#34; as they advertise, but it is not unpleasant - no ear plugs needed.  It has two blower speeds and three heat settings.  I use the high speed and high heat and I can style my hair in about five minutes. I am a male with relatively short hair, so I can&#x27;t say for sure how it would work for long hair - but I would guess it would be satisfactory.  It has an attachment (that I haven&#x27;t used) that is advertised to blow air at fifty miles per hour - I would think that would quickly dry the thickest hair.</li>
    <li> The Centric Q Zone hair dryer is great. I&#x27;ve had it since December and I am very pleased with it. The unit is much more quiet than any other hair dryer I have ever owned. The only thing I would like to see improved is the size of it so I could take it traveling. It takes up some space. I consider that a slight inconvenience though since I have a travel size hair dryer too. (Too bad it&#x27;s not as quiet as this one). To me, the reduced noise from this dryer makes it well worth the money I spent for it.</li>
    <li> I think there are some quality control issues with this manufacturer. My dryer was pretty quiet on the high setting, but it had an annoying rattling sound on the low setting, and it also rattled when you shut it off. The motor seemed to be installed off center inside the plastic casing as well. I expected much more from a dryer at this price point. Mine was immediately returned.</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and was excited to  get  this dryer at this price .  Unfortunatly when I use the high setting the blow dryer becomes very loud and sounds as  though the motor is rubbing against something.  I couldn&#x27;t send it back because  my  husband shot out the box .  Very sad.  Centrix  is a great product that I have used for years. Wish I could send this one back.</li>
    <li> The Centrix Q Zone Hair Dryer is the quiets of any hair dryer that my wife has had and she has had a lot of them. I asked her how it works and she was quite pleased with it, so that is a plus also. I would recommend this product to anybody. Thank You</li>
    <li> This dryer is fairly quiet (as advertised).  It works very well and has a bunch of adjustable settings which is nice.  It is a little on the heavy side though.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and this is the second one I have bought.  I paid 130 for the first one...If you value your hearing, get one of these.  It drys hair fast and is sooooo quiet.  Great buy at this price</li>
    <li> Incredibly quiet! Both my husband and I have fine, short hair and this dryer blow-dries our hair better than any other drier. The air is &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;controlled&amp;#34; so our hair does not &amp;#34;stick up&amp;#34; into the air as if we had a fright! I am definitely getting a second drier - one for each of us!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer a year ago and works great.  I don&#x27;t turn it on high so it doesn&#x27;t hum or it doesn&#x27;t smell like others have commented.  It is quiet and it does dry your hair fast.  I just bought this for my two daughters for Christmas.  Buy and enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer for how quiet it is and it does a nice job on my hair in a short time. I had my first one for just over a year when I dropped it on a carpeted floor, and you could hear the motor shake inside and the poor thing died. I was not happy about it being that fragile (I drop a lot of things) but found that I was willing to buy another instead of choosing a different model. This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned and I have had many different dryers. I find the extra cost worth it as I don&#x27;t have as many split ends and really love the quieter drying.</li>
    <li> Hopeful for a quiet, solid hairdryer, I ordered this direct from Amazon and received it quickly. I tested it out, and on full speed it was nice and quiet. I switched it to low, and there was a distinct buzzing/rattling sound, the kind that grates on my nerves. When I shook it the buzzing briefly stopped, but started again as soon as I held it steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking I received a defective unit, I returned it, and quickly received the replacement with no hassle from Amazon. Unfortunately, the second unit had the same issue. It seems to be a design defect. I returned the second hairdryer for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On low our $20 hairdryer is quieter than this unit, and less annoying. One star.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer. It has a smooth motor with soft noise and dries gently on the mid-settings which is great for my fine, straight hair. It is heavier than most consumer hair dryers and has a quality feel to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s a million times quieter than the last one. I didn&#x27;t know a dryer could be this quiet. After hearing this one,  surely the other one was bad for your ears. You can talk while she&#x27;s using it.  And...now you can hear the sports radio stream while she&#x27;s drying her hair (no more interruptions of Muse in the News).  She says it dries just as fast as the jet engine she used to have and that the ionic part does whatever ionic is supposed to do (smoother or something).  This is a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t miss&amp;#34; gift.  :)</li>
    <li> Definitely quiet, but doesn&#x27;t seem super-powerful.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Eliminates frizz when drying my hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best hair dryer ever.</li>
    <li> Great product. Much quieter than a regular hair dryer.</li>
    <li> The price I&#x27;ve paid for this hairdryer I would expect it to last at least a couple of years.  I bought this in February 2013 and it just burned out.  Did not even last for a year yet, only 6 months.  I would say it is very poorly made.  My target hair dryer lasts longer than this darn expensive dryer.  Gladly I still have my cheap target dryer or I would have wet hair now.  From comparing my target perfection quiet hair dryer, there is no big sound differences.  Price wise, I can buy 4 cheap hair dryers and last much longer than this.  not worth the price at all and it is quite heavy and big.</li>
    <li> It is not noiseless but it is very quiet. Powerful blower and good heat output. It is bigger than the picture would have you believe. The squirrel cage blower runs on a vertical axis rather than the typical horizontal axis. The cage is larger than most, about 4\\&quot; in diameter, this allows the same volume of air at a lower RPM, thus less noise.  Crazy expensive, but hearing loss is permanent so I think it is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is used by my hairdresser. I really liked it, but she said it was very expensive. I prowled around the web until I found it for $94, free shipping. I absolutely love it. It is very quiet, and very fast! My very thick, coarse hair was dry and styled in 5 minutes. It is so worth the money!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  So great for the hair!!</li>
    <li> Very quiet. It was recommended to me by a hairdresser who had experienced hearing loss from other hairdryers.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t drop it. I had an identical one for a few years that I dropped. A plastic circle that held screws to the motor broke and the dryer was not usable afterward.  I liked it enough to buy the same dryer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if the manufacturer made this circular part out of metal instead of plastic. Otherwise a fantastic dryer.</li>
    <li> I returned the Q Zone right away because it is no quieter than the cheap ones at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I do not work in a salon, but I like an ultra quiet hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had one from Brookstone for the past 15 or so years, but it&#x27;s about to quit working. Adjusting for inflation, the price on this one was comparable. This hair dryer is as quiet, if not a little quieter, in that it&#x27;s a smoother sound. It&#x27;s well-made, quick heat up, has low/medium/high settings on both temp and airflow, and feels comfortable in the hand. I like the button that switches to air-only with no heat. That&#x27;s great for kids that like to freak out about how hot the hair dryer is. As long as this one lasts around 15 years, I&#x27;ll be glad that I invested in it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a quiet hair dryer because I have hearing problems. I purchased another brand, but felt it was to loud.  Then I read about this hair dryer and sent for it and would definitely recommend it.  This hair dryer is much quieter than the other brand, which I returned. The only complaint would be is when you turn it off, it takes a short time for the motor to shut off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super lightweight and pretty quiet and looks very modern.  So far, I love it!</li>
    <li> Makes noise on low and fan is off set either dropped(there&#x27;s a mark) and factory imperfections this dryer should not have made it past inspection...this s the very first item ever I&#x27;ve received from Amazon I wished I&#x27;d not waited money on :(</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. When my first one stopped working, I liked it enough to want to buy another one. I&#x27;m sure when this one dies, I will buy myself a 3rd one.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my daughter and she said it is a nice hair dryer. It really is quiet and does the job perfectly!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how quiet this hair dryer would actually be so I was pleasantly surprised!  It&#x27;s very quiet and does a great job drying my hair.  I should have bought this a long time ago!</li>
    <li> As the description says this unit is very quiet and top of the line.  A bit pricey but then again if you are looking for the best, just order it.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> Poor design.  Handle is awkward. Quiet but I like more power&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again for the cost. FYI $</li>
    <li> This thing is exactly as advertised, its amazing, quiet, and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone, good stuff!</li>
    <li> After a year and a half of daily use, I am still a fan of this hairdryer. The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; is not very hot, but it gets the job done. And it is truly a quiet hairdryer; I can have conversations with my husband while drying my hair, which is nice (because that always seems to be when he wants to chat.) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dropped it on the floor more times than I can count, unfortunately, but it seems to be holding up pretty well. So overall, worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> I have loved this hair dryer for the last 5 years. I now have all the stylist in my shop using it. Q zone is for a reason. When you have a shop full of people and dryers running you can still hear the conversation. Love it. Well balanced in your had. Light weight. Even bought for my grandkids to use at home.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a quiet hair dryer.  I hate that high pitched whine on most of them.. This dryer has a lower pitched noise, so it isn&#x27;t so annoying.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the position of the on/off switch.  I use both hands to operate the dryer, and when it is in my left hand, I have to be careful how I hold it or I accidently switch it off.</li>
    <li> I installed a decibel meter app called Decibel 10th recently on my iPad Mini. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the most accurate reader, but I used it for a comparison of how loud the dryer is with how loud my speaking voice is (I didn&#x27;t have another dryer to compare it to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I measured and found that I hold the nozzle of the dryer about 4 inches from my head when I blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the meter registers my normal speaking voice in the bathroom at about 76 db with the iPad&#x27;s microphone pointed straight up and 4 inches in front of my face. That&#x27;s a bit on the loud side (imagine someone talking normally that close to your head). This dryer on low, in the bathroom, with the nozzle pointed so it&#x27;s not blowing into the microphone, 4 inches away from the iPad registers about 67 db. That&#x27;s quieter than I spoke, and is considered in the safe \\&quot;Moderate\\&quot; noise range, according to the American Academy of Audiology&#x27;s Levels Of Noise chart: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer on high, 4 inches away, reads about 75 db, which is in the \\&quot;Loud\\&quot; range of the chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had kept my last dryer for comparison, because it was way louder that I talked - I know, because I&#x27;d have to shut it off to say something to anyone or to hear anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I see might be it&#x27;s size and weight. I weighed it on my kitchen scale, and it&#x27;s 1 3/8 lbs (or .62 kg). So a little under one and a half pounds. I&#x27;m fine with that weight, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little under 9 inches from the back to the tip of the nozzel, which is similar to other larger dryers. However, it&#x27;s about 5 inches from side to side, which makes it bulky for travel, but I&#x27;m sure contributes to it&#x27;s quietness. I&#x27;m fine with the size as well, since it&#x27;s so quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m impressed, and I&#x27;d recommend this dryer. And I&#x27;m happy there&#x27;s a dryer out there that doesn&#x27;t necessatate wearing earplugs.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for: a substantial hair dryer, but much more pleasant to use because it is quiet.</li>
    <li> After learning that hair dryers can cause hearing loss, I researched  hair dryers looking for the quietest and ordered the Centris Q Zone. I compared it to my present dryer and found it definitely quieter.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. Quiet and powerful. A little large, but lightweight.</li>
    <li> Pros:quieter than a typical hair dryer. The heat control is very good, it actually gets hotter than I need but there are 3 settings. The design is beautiful looking black and gold. sturdy, seems high quality. Cons: To achieve quite, you lose power. Your hair will take longer to dry. There is a \\&quot;power booster\\&quot; that attaches to the tip, you can attach the concentrator onto the power booster. The power booster is a smaller aperture that effectively increase the wind speed (the claim is \\&quot;upto 50 mph\\&quot;). This add on makes the hairdryer useable. Without it there is not enough power to make it an effective product. Even with, the velocity is slightly less than your typical good quality hairdryer. Overall I like the product. However if you have frizzy hair and live in a humid environment the lower wind speed might be an issue for you. I find the dryer works best on low humidity days as I do have easily frizzy hair. I am not bothered by the weight as some reviewers and I am on the wimpy side. Overall good quality, quiet, but lower windspeed. This item was a gift from my husband who also notices that it is significantly quieter. We purchased when it was priced at about $100 and it was worth that amount. The lower price is a pretty good deal. If quite is important to you than this is your hairdryer.</li>
    <li> A third purchase of this model. Works great.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer I have ever used.  Dries hair quickly, very quiet, and the price was great.</li>
    <li> As quiet as advertised. Would definitely recommend this product. Produces as much heat as a regular hair dryer. And as much wind power.</li>
    <li> yes, my wife likes it a lot.  Yes I am happy because it is quieter than her previous one.  But don&#x27;t expect it to be whisper quiet.</li>
    <li> What a great hair dryer! It really is quite. Even my husband noticed. I bought it because I get up and get dressed first and didn&#x27;t want to wake him. It&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this drier 3-4 months.  It is extremely quiet!  But it is also very large and top-heavy to hold, which most reviews describe as large.  No. It&#x27;s hugh,</li>
    <li> Such a step up from our previous hair dryer. Quiet and functional. It&#x27;s a little on the huge side. But does make drying your hair a much more pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was ridiculously heavy, but fantastically quiet for about two months. Then it started falling apart inside and making all sorts of rattling and grinding noises. When it finally stopped working after about three months, I took it apart and found that it was constructed of cheap plastic, which was glued together with glue that, apparently, wasn&#x27;t heat proof. This is what one would expect to find inside a $20 model, not a $100+ model. I replaced it with a Supersolano 3500, which is well constructed, quiet, and weighs about half as much.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this dryer for anybody. Yes it is quiet but it has a very weak air flow. As a stylist who has used this dryer behind the chair I will tell you the awkward shape of the dryer is just terrible to work with!! The weird outer space shape on the back of the dryer gets in the way and it won&#x27;t fit into a normal stylists&#x27; holder on the station because the trunk is oval shaped. It comes with this stupid \\&quot;power booster\\&quot; that you snap on it to get a stronger airflow but it is still not powerful enough and since it is so strangely shaped you cannot buy any other blow dry difuser to use with it. This thing is lightweight but it&#x27;s so big you just cannot work with it properly! The only con is that it is quiet as it promises, but who wants quiet when the result is a frizzy shapeless blowdry due to lack of powerful airflow.</li>
    <li> This dryer lost its ability to blow hot air after less than six months. It&#x27;s pretty useless without heat. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed for a blow dryer this expensive.</li>
    <li> The dryer is very quiet, shich is why I purchased it.  Loud noise close to your ears every day will harm your hearing.  The dryer is expensive, how much is your hearing worth?&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be very well made, I like the long cord and rubber strips on the exterior to keep it from sliding off the counter, like other tools, the proffessional stuff is worth the price, dries our hair faster on the lowest setting than other loud, low quality, inexpensive dryers on high settings.&lt;br /&gt;Completely happy</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grand-daughter.  The one we had was too loud.  Now mywife is also using it.  It&#x27;s so quiet and efficient.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of whether a dryer could actually be &#x27;quiet&#x27;. My last dryer sounded like a 747 jet according to my husband trying to sleep. After reading the reviews, we splurged and are happy to say its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am a blow-out junkie. I have fine, naturally curly hair which I hate. I blow dry my hair straight every day with a round brush. It takes me about 15-20 minutes. I generally buy hair dryers in the $30-40 price range (my favorite so far is the Remington Pearl). I like to have a couple of different heat settings and I always use my dryer on the highest speed. My hair dryers generally wear out after 12-18 months, so I had been thinking about trying a more expensive dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Centrix Q Zone because it was on a great sale. I got it for about $70 bucks and though it works well, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for it. I was interested in a lower wattage dryer that supposedly had the same oomph as my 1875 watt dryer. I was also intrigued by it&#x27;s quiet claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight out of the box, the Centrix Q doesn&#x27;t have as much air power as my cheaper dryer. Once I attached the \\&quot;power boost\\&quot; attachment and the concentrator, it had the same air power as my other dryer. The low speed on this hair dryer is VERY quiet, but useless if you are straightening your hair. On the high speed the Centrix Q isn&#x27;t noticably quieter than my other dryer. Using the Centrix Q hasn&#x27;t cut down my drying time, but it hasn&#x27;t extended it either. It isn&#x27;t any lighter or heaver than my other dryer. I&#x27;ve only had it for about 4 months, so we&#x27;ll see if it lasts longer than 12-18 months. In the mean time I wonder if I&#x27;m saving the environment by using 375 fewer watts every day. Maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if having the cool shot button is really important to you, you probably won&#x27;t love this dryer. If you hold the button down forever the air will eventually become somewhat cooler, but it is hardly a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button like my other dryer. I don&#x27;t use it extensively, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is different on the Centrix Q is that this dryer sucks the air in from the underside of the dryer. Other dryers suck it in from the back. My hair used to frequently get sucked into the fan if I wasn&#x27;t careful with my other dryer. With the Centrix that hasn&#x27;t happened. The Centrix is kind of a weird shape. It&#x27;s not quite as sleek and packable as my other hair dryer. I take my regular dryer with me everywhere, including trips to Africa. I don&#x27;t use travel dryers because they are awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you are currently using one of those terrible, cheap, fold-up, travel size, tiny hair dryers you will notice a huge difference if you buy a Centrix Q. However, you will also notice a huge difference if you just start spending about $10 more and buy one of those $30-40 hair dryers. I don&#x27;t know why you would jump from buying $20 hair dryers to $100 hair dryers. Unless this dryer ends up lasting forever, I&#x27;ll probably just go back to my old $40 hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer has a nice low timbre, not the high squeal of most other dryers I&#x27;ve used. I can actually hear people talking while I use it.</li>
    <li> Loved it said package was flawed, it came to me perfect, love it works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I do love it.  My wife uses it.  She loves it for it&#x27;s performance, doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I love it for it&#x27;s quietness.  Good product and worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a _very_ quiet dryer. My daughter and I can actually have a conversation while I&#x27;m drying her hair now.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; quiet, but quite large &amp; bulky.  The back of the dryer is rounded, and at 4 1/2 inches across it doesn&#x27;t even fit in my bathroom drawer (which is 4 inches deep).  Length of barrel from dryer tip to the end of the rounded back is approximately 8 1/2 inches, and the height (handle to top of dryer) is 9 1/2 inches.</li>
    <li> Quiet and powerful!  A great combination!</li>
    <li> I simply cannot stand the shrill sound of most hairdryers. This was recommended by my stylist and it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s so quiet and seems so gentle on your hair. I would highly recommend over the $20 dryers any day! Definitely worth the extra money for a much quieter, calmer hair drying experience.</li>
    <li> Product is not so loud and it seems to dry my hair faster. I like it a lot because of the weight and slick handle.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife last x-mas specifically because it was quite......well not as loud as others and it truly was much more pleasurable to be around. It lasted exactly one year prior to &#x27;melting down&#x27;. Please keep in mind that this item was used daily for very short periods of time. I do want to be fair as overall it is a good product just very short on the longevity. In my opinion paying over $100 for a hair dryer is a little crazy and for one that lasts a year - absolutely insane.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my wife.  It&#x27;s the greatest!  Works very well, not too heavy, but mostly: it&#x27;s QUIET!</li>
    <li> This is a larger than normal hairdryer but it really is quiet and not awkward to hold. The high setting is similar to the noise level on a low setting on an average hair dryer without the high pitched whine. The technology really dries hair fast. I am really happy with my purchase even though it doesn&#x27;t fit in my bathroom drawer, it has to sit out on the counter.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer really is super quiet and it dries my hair faster!</li>
    <li> My previous dryer was even quieter but company went out of business.  This looks big and bulky but very well balanced. I was not used to the air velocity,  actually.  Luckily there is two speed s.</li>
    <li> Almost rated 5 stars as it is a wonderful hair dryer: very quiet, quick drying and not harsh. I wish it were a little smaller as I am pretty petite, so a little clumsy to hold at times for me. The good news is that it is very light, so not a problem for holding up in the air to complete the drying. I would definitely recommend for home use.</li>
    <li> great blow dryer - quiet and powerful</li>
    <li> Not as quite as I hope it would be. I got the 1st product died but still under return policy. Voltage is for US only. With the price I hope I can bring it abroad.</li>
    <li> After returning my second blow dryer to Target, I went on a short quest to find a quiet (or at least relatively so) blow dryer.  Thanks to the amazon reviews here, I found it.  The Centrix Q is MUCH quieter and the sound of the dryer doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched frequency of the cheaper ones.  It has a lower pitch in tone, in its sound, which I really prefer.  On the slow speed, it is very quiet.  On the higher speed, it is relatively noisier, but not bad at all.  It also dries very quickly on the higher speed - so I can dry my short hair in about 4 minutes.  Finally, the weight of the dryer is light.  I also like how they distributed the weight; it makes it very easy to handle.  LOVE this dryer!  It was worth every penny!  Note to others - if you search for this dryer on youtube - you can hear its sound in some of the reviews.  I found that very helpful as well.</li>
    <li> Expensive, heavy &amp; noisy.... too many negatives for me.</li>
    <li> Quiet, but heavy!  I have tennis elbow (from tennis &amp; typing) and this is heavy so I wear a band to help with that - it is quiet!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is really quite if it works.  I bought one that lasted only 18 months before the internal screws cracked out of their plastic housing.  I bought a replacement and it was broken when it arrived.  So I returned it and bought another and it was broken too.</li>
    <li> the description was not wrong… it is very quiet. It doesn&#x27;t wake up everyone in the house like my older one did. I am so pleased with this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is our second purchase of this exact dryer for travel.  It is saving our marriage.  I work late and sleep in late.&lt;br /&gt;Low pitched tone almost never wakes me up, unlike every other hair dryer we have every owned.&lt;br /&gt;And no, it&#x27;s not for travel at all, but for extended trips it&#x27;s a necessity.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. I am very pleased with it. It&#x27;s quiet and dries my hair very well.</li>
    <li> My husband said I had to buy a new hair dryer or I had to go outside to dry my hair in the morning.  Almost every day he says he is so glad that I finally bought this.  Super quiet and works well.  I had to get used to it not being as powerful as my old hair dryer but it does get very hot.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife because I was tired of the obnoxiously loud sound of her blow dryer. This thing is super quiet, it seems like it doesn&#x27;t put out much air due to the very low noise level, but in fact it&#x27;s more powerful that her old one when you put your hand in front of it. The lack of sound is deceives your ears into thinking it weak, but it&#x27;s a beast. Save your hearing and buy this thing. It&#x27;s very well worth it. Literally whisper quiet.</li>
    <li> Bought in October 2013 used daily and just stopped working by Feb 12, 2014.  For that price, I expected it to at least work for 3 years like cheaper ones.  It is quiet, but if it stops working it&#x27;s even quieter, and completely useless.</li>
    <li> Good dryer. Quiet. Yes, quiet and powerful - a good combination. A little heavy but a small inconvenience considering how efficient it is.</li>
    <li> It would have been fine it I could have used a diffuser with it. I didn&#x27;t read the description correctly. My mistake. I returned it but only for that reason.</li>
    <li> I rely on these reviews but often times forget to write them. A year after buying this blow dryer, I am still a happy customer. This blow dryer is durable and quiet. Even after almost daily use, it works just as great as it did the first day. This is by far the quietest blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I often forget how loud they can be. I&#x27;m reminded when I have used my mom&#x27;s or when I get my hair cut at the salon. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Worked as other have reviewed, real quiet.  BUT it quit working after 5 months, stopped heating, only 10% of heating coills were running.  Not worth my time and effort to have it repaired under warranty.  Only have time for this review to warn others.</li>
    <li> At my age I have probably used more hair dryers than most.  Some had too much or not enough heat, air movement or controls. All were loud.  I use my dryer daily so learned the Centrix  Q Zone was quiet, seemed to have the correct heat and air movement controls so I purchased it.  I love it.  It is quiet (for a hair dryer) has 3 heat controls and 2 speed controls. It is a fast dryer with just the right amount of controls to get the job done. A little pricey but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> As a professional cosmetologist I highly recommend this dryer!! It&#x27;s a little awkward to hold but easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful company to work with.</li>
    <li> I spent over $100 for this blow dryer and it is now useless. It is quiet but awfully heavy. There are new, lighter blow dryers out there that are equally quiet. But breaking after only 18 months....for this price! Unacceptable. Consider a less expensive blow dryer and replace yearly, you will still save money.</li>
    <li> My main interest was in getting a quiet hair dryer. It&#x27;s usually early in the morning when I use one and I hated turning on my old hair dryer because of the loud raspy noise. To be sure this one isn&#x27;t silent but it&#x27;s definately quieter than my old one or any others I have had and the sound it does make is a more pleasing tone.I also find that it does as good a job on the middle heat setting than my old one when it was set to high. It also comes with an attatchment to increase the air velocity for quicker drying if you need it.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer lasted less then 2 years. For the price, I would expect it to last longer. I contacted the manufacturer, and never encountered such a rude customer service rep. I was told that these hair dryers can&#x27;t be repaired and if not happy with the product don&#x27;t buy it any more. I definitely will look for a different brand.</li>
    <li> We really like this hair dryer because it is so quiet. It has ample power to get the job done. A little pricy but works good. IMPORTANT UPDATE: Precisely after 1-1/2 years of ownership and  daily use the motor bearing has failed. Now it&#x27;s noisy and disappointing. I&#x27;ve changed my rating from 5 Stars to 1 Star. If it&#x27;s priced like a Cadillac it should at least last like one. My next purchase will be a commercial grade unit, noisy or not.</li>
    <li> It is AMAZING how quiet this dryer is.  I love this dryer.  And the cord is 8&#x27;!  When most appliance makers are giving your shorter and shorter cords, it&#x27;s nice to have one this long.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was getting concerned about the &#x27;freaking loud&#x27; hair dryer my wife was using. I was afraid it might damage her hearing. So I started thinking about buying her a new one that might be quieter and came across the Centrix Q Zone. All the reviews were pretty good so I bought it for her at Xmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it! It does everything she wants it to, has plenty of power and wind, etc., and man is it nice and soft sounding compared to the other one she had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit larger and heavier than the other one, and at first she said something but almost immediately she didn&#x27;t think it mattered any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is happy, her hearing is protected, and she says it is an awesome hair dryer. Win! :)</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to go deaf, nevermind my wife,every morning waking up near the airport, [whoops the bathroom], listening to that damn hair dryer. Well I&#x27;d had enough, my heartthrob absolutly refused to shave her head, and I may of lost some of my chick attractment, so a divorce was out of the question. It was time to throw money at the problem. $100.00 later it dries her hair and it is quiet! Buy it if you can!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing. I put it on my wish list for Christmas, because I was tired of getting a ringing in my ears after drying my hair from the screaming of my normal hair dryer. I can&#x27;t believe how quiet it is, and it dries my hair just as quickly. I heard blow drying your hair every day with a screaming blow dryer could cause some hearing issues/permanent ringing, and I didn&#x27;t want that to happen. This is one that you can even hear what is going on around you when it&#x27;s on. Pretty great!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the quiet operation of this hairdryer.  It is much quieter than any other handheld dryer I have owned.  I was worried that the blower would not have enough power, but it is just fine.  I use it without the included nozzle that increases the velocity even more.  The unit has a longer cord than most and 3 settings for heat and 3 for speed.  The cost was a bit high, but I would have paid even more to get that screaming jet engine out of my ear that I was using before.  I deducted one star because of the size.  It is too big to fit easily in the vanity and it is a bit heavy, although it is nicely balanced. A folding handle would have rated 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/2014:  The dryer just failed after almost 3 years of regular use.  I ordered another one.  I have a couple observations.&lt;br /&gt;1.  After a few months I discovered that the top screen of the dryer could be twisted off for cleaning. This may have been in the instructions, but who reads those things? At any rate, it&#x27;s important to keep the air ways clean so the unit does not overheat.  Of course don&#x27;t use water on any electrical appliance; a dry brush works fine.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Before my old one broke I noticed that something felt loose inside.  When it finally failed I tore it apart to see what had happened.  The motor/fan assembly is held to the plastic housing with three screws that screw into plastic posts on the housing.  These plastic posts had failed right at the bottom of the screw. I noticed that the holes for the screws extend much deeper into the housing, but the screws were too short to reach all the way in. Seems to me that the company should have spent a few pennies for longer screws and avoided so many early failures.  I imagine a sharp blow might crack the posts, so I advise careful handling.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is EVERYTHING I read! Love IT!</li>
    <li> Super quiet without being wimpy. Love it!</li>
    <li> Fast drying and quiet!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift, because I had asked for a quieter hair dryer.  This fills the bill! I can actually have a conversation, hear the phone ring, etc. with this model.  I was concerned over two things...would it just be a slower speed and take longer to dry; and when I opened the package, would it be too big and heavy?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a slower speed, just much lower on the sound level.  I really think my hair is drying much faster with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;At first the size seemed awkward, but I quickly got used to it, and have no problem holding it.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars, if they can make it a little bit smaller...but really, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy a Centrix blowdryer, it smokes and stops working after about one year. Cricket Company will not fix and/ or replace it.&lt;br /&gt;The Centrix Q Zone dryer was $170.00. A lot of money for nothing.</li>
    <li> What makes this &#x27;quiet&#x27; is the tone. My puppy can handle this hair dryer over my normal dryer. The Centrix Q doesn&#x27;t make the high pitched sound most dryers make. This Centrix isn&#x27;t quiet, it&#x27;s just a more muted tone and I love it! If you put the tones on a musical scale, most dryers make a high B sharp sound and the Centrix makes a low D sound.</li>
    <li> Really nice and very quiet. Wife loves it</li>
    <li> My wife is very satisfied and me too because of the lower noise</li>
    <li> I bought three of these, none lasting longer than two years before the motor gave out.  This time I am finding another brand.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Shih Tzu dog. He normally has a problem with noisy dryers. This one is perfect. It is by far the quietest one I have ever experienced and the noise does not bother him. I run it on the highest speed, but without any of the included snap-on concentrators. It is wide from side-to-side due to the type of fan inside. This is not a problem for me, just something you should note if bulk is an issue. Very well built with a nice long and flexible cord. My wife hasn&#x27;t discovered it yet, but when she finds out how nice it is, I&#x27;ll probably be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> very silent and good working.</li>
    <li> it was perfect, just what I wanted and needed</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; hair drier as a Christmas gift for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with it, and she say that it dries her hair just slightly slower than&lt;br /&gt;her very loud previous hair drier, but the reduced noise is a very welcome improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a &amp;#34;silent&amp;#34; nor a &amp;#34;near silent&amp;#34; hair drier.  Because drying hair is a function of&lt;br /&gt;primarily wind speed, and to a somewhat lesser extent, also heat; it is impossible to&lt;br /&gt;have a hair drier that is nearly silent, and yet still dries hair in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27; just physics... there is no way around that simple fact of reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair drier is, in my estimation, about one-half the loudness of a standard 1,500 watt&lt;br /&gt;hair drier... but make no mistake, cutting the decibels by 50% is still a huge reduction in noise.&lt;br /&gt;Particularly when you consider that the source of this noise is a device that held up close&lt;br /&gt;to your head and your ears... every decibel of sound reduction is a precious and welcome&lt;br /&gt;reduction, providing a far more comfortable and pleasant hair-drying experience for my wife,&lt;br /&gt;(and a far less irritating experience for her husband who is trying to watch TV in the adjacent room.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have also noticed that the pitch of the noise it does make is a lower and more pleasant noise,&lt;br /&gt;as opposed to the high-pitched shrill noise of a standard hair drier that is reminiscent of the leaf-&lt;br /&gt;blower that our landscape maintenance workers use (and they use ear plugs all day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as your expectations are reasonable, and you are not clinging to any fantasies about&lt;br /&gt;a nearly-silent hair drier, you should be very pleased with this Centric Q Zone Quiet Hair Drier,&lt;br /&gt;and I am quite certain that you cannot find a quieter hair drier... at least... not one that can also&lt;br /&gt;actually dry your hair.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews here, I ordered this dryer a few months ago. It is awesome! Well made, comfortable grip, no buzz on low, and really very quiet. Every single morning when I use it, and every single evening when I use it on my five year old, I feel good about this purchase. Finally, something that is worth paying extra for - wish I&#x27;d have bought something like this years ago. It is a little sad how happy this dryer makes me. Really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a little worried by the review that the dryer stopped working after two years, but I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> SOOO QUIET and my hair dries fast!</li>
    <li> This is the quietest blow dryer I have ever had. Been a hairstylist for 30 years and never had one this quiet or dry this great. I ordered the diffuser separately and it s worthy the cost especially since I have curly hair. Delivered quickly and priced great.</li>
    <li> My pussy -CAT has to take a bath at least every 2 weeks because I am allergic.  She is fine with being washed in the sink and rinsed off.  It is drying that is the problem.  She hates being dried with a towel and she goes insane if I try the hair dryer.  I have always used the hair dryer on other pets, but they were dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she was a kitten I tried to dry her with a hair dryer and she sunk her teeth into my hand and would not let go.  So drying her has become a long and drawn out process that ranges from taking her outside in a harness attached to a leash in the summer, on the porch below the ceiling fans to holding her in a towel in front of the fireplace in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a game changer!  Quiet hairdryer &#x3D; happy pussy!  And this does the job fast!</li>
    <li> We like it so much we purchased a second one very quiet!</li>
    <li> This was a christmas present for my wife.  She always complained about the loud, annoying hair dryers she has used.  This one is the  quietest and most efficient one she has ever used.  She loves it and it scored points for me.</li>
    <li> We bought this last year at a hair show in Austin for my wife.  It started sparking in 3 months.  The replacement unit did the same thing but in less time.  If you&#x27;re professional stylist, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer, have been a hairdresser for 30yrs. Does a great job with fast blow drying, quiet, very light&lt;br /&gt;to handle. I replaced the one I use at the salon and took the other home to use.....still going after 5yrs!!&lt;br /&gt;Bonus...I can hear and talk to my clients!!</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer ! Very, very quiet. I was amazed, Just ordered a second one for another family member.</li>
    <li> Works better than I hoped.</li>
    <li> This is the quietest hair dryer I have ever owned. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t silent, and it isn&#x27;t even very quiet -- just quieter than normal. However, it doesn&#x27;t shrill, which is what I now realize is the most annoying part of a hair dryer&#x27;s sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a happy surprise that although my hair doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place, it still dries quickly -- very quickly. It seems my hair isn&#x27;t subjected to super high temperatures and high-speed fanning to suck out all the moisture, as it feels soft, rather than brittle when it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there&#x27;s a nice long cord, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m on a short leash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only four stars? Well, if I wrote this last week it would have been three stars. On the negative side -- and this is significant -- it took about a week to get used to the position of the switches. Horrible ergonomic design; I almost sent it back. I kept going to a higher speed when I meant to turn off and turning off when I wanted to change speeds/heat setting. So there&#x27;s a learning curve I never experienced with any of my other hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Would I recommend this? Yes and yes. It&#x27;s a good deal for what appears to be a very good hair dryer without the annoying shrill.</li>
    <li> Definately the most quiet hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve owned alot.  Not too heavy, good speed and heat control.  Only thing I&#x27;d change is the \\&quot;on-off\\&quot; button of all things.  It&#x27;s located on the back of the dryer, not underneath like I&#x27;m used to. Instead of turning it off between \\&quot;sections of hair\\&quot; I leave it on, it drys my hair so fast anyway it doesn&#x27;t overheat.</li>
    <li> Concerned about long term ear damage for our little one and her long hair... this is the quietest hair dryer we have ever heard or owned.</li>
    <li> Super quiet and very effective at drying my thick hair fast.  I would buy this again for the money.  Worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Having searched for a quiet hair dryer for years...that&#x27;s what I said folks...YEARS!  OMG.  Not only did I want a \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; hair dryer, but I actually had a few other \\&quot;wants\\&quot; on my list.  It seemed so simple to me...a lightweight, well balanced, durable, quiet dryer with on/off, temperature controls &amp; cool shot that were functional &amp; didn&#x27;t accidentally get changed while drying hair.  Did I mention not too hot on high temperature...that&#x27;s kind of a plus.  It&#x27;s especially nice when you&#x27;re blow drying your child&#x27;s hair or tiny dog...they tend to run away from you the next time they see you coming.  Neutral colors are good also.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve found some of these features on different dryers, but not all of them in one dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered this hair dryer from another source, but like it so much, I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one for a family member through Amazon.  Their prices are lower &amp; I&#x27;ve always had good service through them.  Hope this helps those of you looking for a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have been shopping for the perfect dryer.  This was the second one I ordered.  My husband said it looked like a spaceship.  Out of the box, it was big and bulky. The concentrator was very wide, but not very narrow, probably close to 1/2 inch.  If you&#x27;ve tried to blowdry curly hair straight, you know you need a narrow concentrator nozzle.  The concentrator was cheap plastic, hard to snap into place and difficult to get back off.  It also had very large air vents, which I never like - the concentrator doesn&#x27;t work as well with the vents and they blow the hair around.  I decided to turn it on anyways to hear what insanely quiet sounded like.  It was louded than it should have been and on high speed, I don&#x27;t think you could even make the claim that it was a \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; blowdryer. It is being returned.</li>
    <li> Finally no more headaches from the high pitched motors. My wife has tried 4 different driers that claim to be \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; and this one is by far the best!  Save yourself the time and headache of trying those other cheaper dryers. We&#x27;ve tried the rest and have finally found the best. This one is it! It&#x27;s well worth the money. It&#x27;s a little bit larger on the motor side than most dryers but that is fine. It doesn&#x27;t inhibit the use at all, and my wife is a very petite woman.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE after 6 months of use. Still LOVE it but it burnt out and had to be replaced.  The very first one we got was DOA right out of the box so that got replaced too. I hope the 3rd lasts longer than 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned. It is so quiet and it works fast. I can actually hold a conversation while drying my hair. Doesn&#x27;t short-circuit.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this for a month, but it is extremely quiet as compared to my old machine.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it will stand the test of time.</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago. Used it a few times since. My first impressions are:&lt;br /&gt;1. Nice control options and easily accessed in the back of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels good in terms of heft, not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;3. I took 1 star out because&lt;br /&gt;  a. this is kind of awkwardly-shaped and does not fit in the drawer I had my old one in.&lt;br /&gt;  b. my old one is from brookstone (a super quiet one) and compared to my old one, this new one, although quiet, is not as quiet.&lt;br /&gt;4. The warm air and the hot air options are very good. The warm air is only slightly warm, which I really like. The hot is not scorching, but you can feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;5. Air flow options are also good, it goes from a good gentle breeze to a pretty good force on high. On high, the dryer is still pretty quiet. (BTW, You Tube has a vid of the noise level of this dryer. Pretty good comparison.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this one. It is quiet enough for me, I truly detest loud blowdryers, so a quiet blow dryer is essential.</li>
    <li> I usually go through Hair Dryers once a year.  This is my 3rd Centrix Q Zone in 3 years.  Love Love Love this dryer.  Even got one for my Mom.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> This dryer is much quieter than standard dryers.  This dryer is also much larger than standard dryer. It has a giant squirrel cage fan on top.  Weight is similar to most dryers.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t care if a cheaper model gave up in 3-1/2 years, but this could have been avoided with a change in motor mount design.  The motor in ours is mounted on three plastic posts.  When the holes were tapped at the factory - I believe - they were under-sized which means the mounting screws are installed EXTREMELY tight, which stresses the plastic. As far as I know, our unit was never dropped.  And yet all three motor mount posts fractured at the root of the post, essentially where the tip of the screw stops when fully installed.  I was able to mend this with glue, but only to buy another two month&#x27;s worth of use until another one could be purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centrix should take into account they use a very nice, stout motor. So the motor carries a lot of mass. The three plastic mounting posts are too undersized and stressed to take any long-term amount of vibration, rapid side to side movement (which the wife tends to do), or impact to the unit. So I would classify this unit as FRAGILE.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hairdryer.  It doesn&#x27;t sound like you are holding a jet engine next to your head.  It still produces sound but isn&#x27;t jarring and high pitched like $40 units.  I travel quiet a bit and miss this hairdryer so much while using hotel options.  It&#x27;s heaven to get ready in the morning.</li>
    <li> Quieter than the Revlon quiet model(just 1 or 2 decibels).  Lower frequency as well. Attachments fit well. Heavy, but feels well made/sturdy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but I truly can have a conversation with the Mrs. while she dries her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Objectively, it runs at 78 db from 1 foot away vs the one that it replaced, which ran at 90 db!</li>
    <li> The quietest hair dryer my wife has ever had. Got tired of listening to her dryer EVERY Frekin&#x27; morning. Louder than the TV!. I barely hear this thing. She says it works great. We are both happy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Amazingly quiet and warm at the same time. Bigger than lots of other dryers so not so great for travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few conflicting reviews of this hair dryer on Amazon, but it is indeed very quite.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think you will anything nicer or less harsh. This will save your hearing, my wife has hearing loss and I couldn&#x27;t bear to hear that shrill old POS, which you could hear downstairs. Now you cannot hear this one just half way down the stairs...and no piercing motor.  Lower frequency and much quieter, nice. Expensive but nothing compares.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer after a week of using it.  It is very quiet and easy to hold, not to heavy. Also because it is 1500 Watt it dries my hair in a better way.</li>
    <li> First off... don&#x27;t expect silence, as it still is a hair dryer with a motor and fan. But this is certainly quieter than any hair dryer I have ever used.  Those expecting &#x27;whisper quiet&#x27; or silence should wait for Dyson to come up with a $500-$600 magic hair dryer.  With this, you can carry on a normal conversation, without raised voices while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was immediately apparent on my initial examination... the key to the quiet design is that it includes a &#x27;Squirrel Cage&#x27; type fan (see the images I published above).  This type of fan, due to its larger diameter, requires lower revolutions-per-minute to produce the same air flow as a straight through in-line fan.  With the slower turning, this makes for an inherently quieter motor requirement.  The audible frequencies of this unit are, therefore, in a lower &#x27;hushed&#x27; range.  This is also how central heat/air conditioning units produce air flow, also very quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have mildly complained/commented that this is a &#x27;big&#x27; hair dryer.  It is true that this is no compact unit, nor was it intended to be.  it is a salon size hair dryer.  It is a bit bigger (wider) than most, but it is a fair trade-off for the quietness.  It is not obtrusively large compared to other full sized dryers and, in my opinion, is not at all heavy for it&#x27;s size.  It, however, needs to be wider than others in order to include this fan which, as I noted before, is larger in diameter and is oriented perpendicular to normal dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another contributer to air noise in general is air turbulence.  This dryer has more air intake area, which should contribute to less turbulent flow of air being drawn in.  Any restrictions in air flow cause turbulence, and will result in noise.  The perfect example being the &#x27;speed-booster&#x27; included with the unit, which helps to produce 50 mph air-speed according to the literature.  All it is is a restrictor oriface that goes on the front air outlet.  The forcing of more air through the smaller exit does make the air travel faster, but at the expense of more noise due to turbulence.  It kind of defeats the purpose if this dryer for me, but it works in case you need more air speed.  I don&#x27;t expect frequent use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rocker switches feel of higher quality than on typical department store brands, but this, as well as the overall quality and design, should be expected of a dryer in this upper price range.  As far as any negative reviews noting longevity problems, I can&#x27;t speak to that as I only opened the box today.  Time will tell, and if problem arise, can always come back for an update to this review.  I expect longevity to maintain the 5 stars I have given it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it hits the design point spot-on for the intended product market.  I am pleased so far with the initial product quality and design.ller exit does make the air travel faster, but at the expense of more noise due to turbulence.

    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the sound that most hair dryers make. I bought this for my wife to keep me from jumping from the nearest bridge. We can now have a normal conversation while she is drying her hair and I don&#x27;t feel like pulling mine out. I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to look for this item.</li>
    <li> It is a very quiet hair dryer but the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of the dryer is wider and heavier than what the picture depicts.  My wife tells me it&#x27;s fine with her short hair and the two or three minutes that is takes to dry.  However, if she had long hair and had to hold it up for five minutes or more it would get heavy.</li>
    <li> It is as loud as others but not in the same way.  Guess we were expecting more of a humming sound.</li>
    <li> If your gal gets up before you do this is definitely the blow dryer for you. It&#x27;s extremely quiet and I hear it works well too.</li>
    <li> This thing was awesome for the first 16 months, then the plastic clip holding the motor in place broke and the motor would vibrate so bad that we ended up throwing the dryer away. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was really nice for awhile, very quiet and performed well. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. but I think a hair dryer should last for a couple of years at least, right?</li>
    <li> Does the job fast, lightweight, doesn&#x27;t get super hot</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended it and I really like it, it is light weight &amp; has just enough settings for me.</li>
    <li> Used my daughter in laws and loved it, so I bought one.  Dries quickly, is quiet and lighter weight, leaves my hair feeling polished....love this dryer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the air flow, but it is quiet.  I&#x27;ve had it one year and was just wondering if there was something else out there with more air &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high pitch of most hair dryers makes me want to scream.  I do love the quietness.</li>
    <li> The dryer is very quiet as stated in the description, however, the airflow is so weak that it would take ages to dry my long hair. I would return the item if my husband hasn&#x27;t torn the box when he opened it.</li>
    <li> Worked well, but started smoking after less than two years.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It really is quieter than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned. There are 3 heat settings and I use level 2, as level 3 is too hot for my fine hair, but for someone else, it could be perfect. The air doesn&#x27;t move as fast as my old hair dryer, but I think that&#x27;s what makes for a higher noise level: speed of air. That said, it&#x27;s very quiet for as fast as the air does blow and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in time to dry my long straight hair from my last &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; hair dryer. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I hate the loud morning blow dryer ritual so much, I bought this hoping it would bring some blessed quiet to my morning routine. Its so quiet that even on \\&quot;high\\&quot;, you can carry on a conversation. On low, however, all I hear is a loud, buzzy rattle with an amazingly quiet hairdryer humming along in the background. Better watch that quality control, Centrix. There&#x27;s NO POINT in making quiet dryers with loud noises.</li>
    <li> its not &#x27;quite&#x27;. may be quieter than a normal cheaper hair drier. but its force and heating capacity is also lesser. i use it for my dog who is scared of hair drier noise otherwise. he does not run away anymore and soi give 3 stars. if you plan to use it its not worth the price.</li>
    <li> It does an incredibly fast drying job at medium speed with a wonderful, low-noise rush of air using the optional large diffuser.  I&#x27;ve never heard a hair dryer so quiet, and we&#x27;ve owned some pretty quiet models before.  The ionic feature appears to make drying go faster with much less air flow.  Whatever it is, IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED!!  I mentioned to the beautician who cuts my hair that I had bought a Centrix Q Zone for my wife and she got all dreamy-eyed.  Ha!  It apparently has a good reputation in salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yeah.  It has a high quality feel, and is also very comfortable to hold.  Just one thing, though.  The darn cord gets all twisty just like every other dryer cord we&#x27;ve ever had.  What&#x27;s up with that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent, so I highly recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I spent more than I usually would on this because I needed a quiet hair dryer. My daughter gets very upset with loud noises due to her autism. I compared to others on u-tube to get the quietest. This did not disappoint! It is extremely quiet on low speed and my hair comes out much smoother.</li>
    <li> Great dryer! Poor manufacturer customer service. The mechanism that holds an attachment in place on the dryer wore out after about 9 months. The manufacturer would not replace unless I paid shipping to send it back and waited 2 weeks for them to evaluate the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like them to just send a replacement since it is still in warranty.</li>
    <li> This product performs as promised. The settings work for all types of hair and is so quiet that I use it any where.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works really well.  My hair dries fast.  The best part is that my ears don&#x27;t hurt.  It doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched screaming noise like most hair dryers do.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife because her old dryer made a piercing noise and was particularly painful for me each morning when I would put in my hearing aids while she was drying her hair.  The Centrix is as quiet as promised and she loves it as much as I love the peace and quiet!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer. It is fast and quiet. According to her, it is the best of the best.</li>
    <li> This is my third Centrix Q Zone dryer. Over the years, I&#x27;ve worn out the others. It&#x27;s the quietest dryer I have ever used and works well drying my thick hair. I love it.</li>
    <li> Takes a little longer than my old hairdryer to get the hair dry, but only a few minutes longer. And a couple of minutes each morning is worth my hearing in the long run. Definitely much quieter than the average hairdryer!!</li>
    <li> wow, can&#x27;t believe I waited this long for a great hairdryer. Revlon and con-air never again for me! this dryer is fantastic.</li>
    <li> The good.  I&#x27;m saving my wifes hearing. According to her, it drys hair really really well.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing bad to say at all.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, excellent price!  This same hair dryer is used by salons at three times the price.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Now that we&#x27;ve had this for 6 months plus, I can comment - it is the quietest dryer I could find and it is still quiet - sound hasn&#x27;t changed with use.  I&#x27;d forgotten how much quieter it is until I fired up one of those built-in hotel dryers - yikes!  It seems like the tone of the Q Zone is also less annoying than other dryers, apart from being quieter.  Seems like a quality piece - it&#x27;s big, has a little heft, but it&#x27;s not metal so not excessively heavy.  Comes in a fancy box, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.  I wanted the quietest dryer and it seems like I found it.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> A few months ago, I developed a ringing in my ear, and it&#x27;s aggravated by sound. I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to be quieter than the average hair dryer. It is. I measured my old hair dryer at about 95 decibels. This one is about 85 decibels. (I put the hair dryer right next to the decibel meter, because that&#x27;s how close it is to your ear when you use it.) I still wear earplugs while drying my hair, to be safe. I gave this hair dryer four stars because the on/off button is awkwardly positioned, and I usually accidentally knock the speed down to low at least once each time I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> The BEST hair dryer ever !  Hubby loves the quiet !!! Dries well, lots of heat selections, good quality, good value</li>
    <li> Look closely at the images, especially from the back (I didn&#x27;t), this is a WIDE blow dryer. In order to make it quiet they designed it to have a large and horizontally mounted fan. This makes the unit too fat and therefor will not allow it to fit in a vanity drawer. Just never occurred to me that a hand held blow dryer would be so large. It would be helpful if that fact was pointed out.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned! I have wavy hair that needs to be blown out EVERY time I wash it and it holds water too - so it makes the drying time long. This hairdryer is quiet, dries my hair very fast and it does all of that while never needing to be on the highest heat setting. My hair never feels over dried. It&#x27;s worth ever dollar I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
    <li> The Centrix Q Zone Quiet was exactly that...quiet.  I didn&#x27;t really expect it to actually live up to its billing, but I really love this hair dryer.  It does a great job and it&#x27;s easy to use.  Where the buttons are is a little different so it took a little getting used to, but otherwise it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Quiet but heavy as a mofo!</li>
    <li> This is quieter that previous blow dryers, but I am more than a little disappointed in the lack of heat produced. It was never close to the heat as my Revlon. It&#x27;s gotten worse over the 6 months I&#x27;ve had it. I can hold it 1\\&quot; from my skin &amp; feel only warm to cool air. (and yes, it&#x27;s on the hottest setting) I&#x27;m about to exchange it (Centrix will only exchange, not refund) for another. I pulled out my old Revlon while this is being shipped &amp; I was shocked at the amount of heat produced by my old one compared to this. I could never hold the dryer close to my scalp for more than 1-2 seconds. This one is very disappointing for the price I paid.  Even though it&#x27;s quieter, it takes 2-3 times longer to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> By far the quietest dryer,dries very fast good for the hairstylist that has a busy schedule. Beautiful blowouts nice and smooth finishes.Love it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this hair dryer; there is still noise of course, but it&#x27;s much more quiet than any other hair dryer I have used. The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would have enough power/air flow to quickly dry my hair, but it worked fine in that respect as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I turned it on today (only 5 months after purchasing it) and nothing happened. In the moment between pushing the red safety button on the plug and realizing it was actually on, it had nearly caught fire. The coils were heating up inside without the fan turning on.Now I can&#x27;t decide if it is worth the risk of another $80 or not.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. I had a dog afraid of blow dryers.... No more. This is great for puppies and very nice in the set- up at dog shows.</li>
    <li> Very Quiet, should have bought it years ago.  Not a powerful as my older LOUDER unit but drys hair just fine.</li>
    <li> I was so sick of the loud high pitch noise of my hairdry.  I bought it at a drug store and it was not cheap.  It was a ceramic haridryer too.  I never buy a hairdryer online before because I was too sceptical. How loud is loud, it is also subjective.  Then, I saw a youtube about this hairdryer.  Yes, this is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the quietest hairdryer I have ever had.  The noise level is low and soft.  I like the toggle switch.  This hairdryer also come with an additional ring you can attach to the nozzle to increase the airflow to 50 mph.  It works well.  It also come with the concentrator attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing I don&#x27;t like.  It is a bit big though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and my husband loves it! He hated my old one, it made too much noise.</li>
    <li> Great dryer. First, understand that it is not &amp;#34;whisper&amp;#34; quiet because it is still an appliance with a motor. It is just much quieter and, more to the point, the sound is far more &#x27;dull&#x27; than other dryers and you can have it by your ear comfortably and have a conversation. In this regard alone, it is just great. Second, it is lighter than many dryers, but it is not as light as my Rusk W8less. Still, I can&#x27;t deal with really heavy dryers and this one is just fine. Third, and this was a  big surprise for me since I already use high-end tourmaline, ceramic ionic dryers (Solano, Elchim, Rusk), this dryer makes your hair SO soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at what is has done for my damaged hair. I use it with the power booster and the concentrator and hair dries extremely fast without huge gusts of wind and scorching heat. I never burn my scalp anymore, as I do with my Rusk---a price I thought I had to pay for fast drying time and smoothing technology. Not so. Without any feeling of &#x27;wind&#x27; and extreme heat, the Centrix dries my hair with a pleasant warmth and does it very fast. The concentrator is great on my long thick hair---it is very wide, so it dries large section of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase. I had bought it to keep at my parents&#x27; house for when I visit, but I am going to bring it to my own place instead and use it full-time.</li>
    <li> When I was a kid my mom used a clunky metal hair dryer on my hair that was really quiet.  There was a slight hum and the sound of moving air, and that was about it.  This is not that hair dryer.  To be fair, the old ones didn&#x27;t move nearly as much air as the modern devices, but I wouldn&#x27;t call this one quiet.  It&#x27;s maybe 1/2 as quiet as a standard hair dryer at the respective equivalent settings.  That&#x27;s about it.  Actually, the one we received has an annoying rattle (or is it a buzz) that goes away after a few minutes - probably after it gets to full heat.  If you are paying a price premium to get a substantially quieter hair dryer, you will likely be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Has held up nicely for several months.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very well made, quiet and effective.  it doesn&#x27;t get to hot and is the quietest hair dryer we have ever see.</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer because my roommate complained about my noisy previous hair dryer (which was just a standard ionic ceramic one from Revlon). The Centrix dryer is so much quieter, it really makes a difference. I notice it, and my roommate is very happy because he can continue to sleep soundly while I dry my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;very quiet&lt;br /&gt;drys hair fast&lt;br /&gt;sufficient number of settings&lt;br /&gt;the diffuser works great with it (I got this one [[ASIN:B004KVBQKS Cricket Finger Diffuser 1 piece]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;it is heaver than my previous hair dryer (but I have gotten used to that by now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because I had to order this dryer three times: the first two I ordered were defective (one dryer made a rattling sound from the start, the other after a couple of weeks of using it). I assume that was just an unfortunate coincidence. I have owned this dryer for almost 6 months now, and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s quiet, my first Centrix Z Zone overheated and stopped working. I purchased the same hair dryer as a replacement and now, after not even a year of use, the heating element has gone out and it&#x27;s not hot at all. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Centrix.</li>
    <li> Extremely quiet, wife loves it!</li>
    <li> It is very quiet for a hair dryer. Dries about the same time as it took my other one. Leaves my hair soft and shiny too! Not sure why so many people are complaining. Its a hair dryer and it does its job. Its quiet. What more do you want?</li>
    <li> This is truly a quiet hair dryer.  My husband was always complaining that my old dryer sounded like a jet engine, and it did.  It was hard to even hear yourself think it was so loud.  This Q Zone is quiet enough that we can actually carry on a conversation while I&#x27;m drying my hair which takes about 15 minutes or more due to length and thickness.  Because this is only a 1500 watt dryer it does seem to take a tad bit longer to dry my hair, but at least it is quiet.  So if you are looking for a quiet dryer, I would recommend this.  Oh, the controls are on the back of the handle so, for me it took a bit to get used to because I was used to the controls on the inside of the handle where I could easily change speed or heat,</li>
    <li> My wife is an audiologist, so noise level was her primary concern.  She has had the dryer for two weeks now and is quite pleased with it.  The noise level is substantially quieter and drying has been better than her old one.</li>
    <li> Ok, I understand the internals of this might be a little better than a $20 hair dryer, and it was somewhat quiet. The construction is the cheapest of any dryer I have ever seen. Quiet vs shoddy construction.. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the quietest and lightest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used!  It is definitely worth every single penny.  Buy it and you won&#x27;t  regret it.  SAVE YOUR EARS!</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended, and I was excited when I first received it. It worked great and was quiet, as promised.  I typically buy cheaper blow dryers that work for a year and then die.  I chose to spend more in hopes of getting a better and longer lasting product.  Unfortunately, this blow dryer lasted for a day longer than the warranty time period covered.....how convenient.  I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. For the price, it should have lasted longer than a year. Lasted about 11 months; motor burned out. I&#x27;ll go to a competitor and buy 10 of them for the same price...</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife because the one she had was so load I was afraid she would lose her hearing over time.  This dryer is so much quieter.  She loves it and she says her hair feels softer after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after watching a Dr. Oz show recommending quiet hairdryers since loud dryers can damage your ears.  No question, this dryer is much more quiet than a conventional hairdryer.  Worked fine for about 18 months, then heating element went and the dryer only blew at a tepid temperature.  For the price of the dryer, it didn&#x27;t last very long.  Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Like all of you who are tired of loud hair dryers, and as previous reviews have stated - this is so much more quiet than our previous dryer.  I was tired of blow drying my 4 year old daughters hair and watching her plug her ears to avoid the sound.  I was also tired of my wife or guests using the blower in the bathroom and people in the living room not being able to hear the TV.  Worse yet is if you tried to blow dry while the kids are asleep - you might as well start up the lawn mower.  This blower is so quiet I don&#x27;t even hear it when someone is using it.  We can use it when our child is asleep - no issues.  Also, when blow drying my daughters hair, we can actually have a conversation at regular tone.  My daughter loves it!  Yes, it has less power (or at least it seems that way), but with the end cap it increases the flow nicely.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference in dry time.  Even if there was a difference, I would prefer to save my eardrums.  We&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks without issue.  I don&#x27;t have any experience with long term reliability at this time - if it fails later I&#x27;ll updates this post with details.  The price was worth the reduction in noise!</li>
    <li> Pros: It gets my hair super smooth when blow drying straight and it is much quieter then the other hair dryer I have on high speed.  I also love the color and edgy look to it.  My hair also drys faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a little heavier then my other hair dryer, it makes like a weird nose on low, and when your turning it off that noise even gets more annoying.  Not sure if that&#x27;s going to be an issue in the future for me, so far it&#x27;s a 2 on the annoying scale.  I&#x27;ve had it for a month so something that is a 2 can eventually be a 10 for me.  We&#x27;ll see with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this four stars because to me the pros out weigh the cons and my husband loves getting his beauty sleep.</li>
    <li> This dryer is so quiet. I love it. I am a hairstylist who uses this all day long. The reduction in noise pollution is amazing. Although, it is not as light as my previous dryer, it is still lighter than many others. My clients appreciate this quiet dryer!</li>
    <li> This my third . Perfect for curly hair. Allows you to pull hair  dry with brush without blowing hair to hard</li>
    <li> Five years ago, I bought this dryer after going through two T3 Featherweight dryers. I liked those dryers, but they always broke after 2 years of use. My stylist recommended this dryer so I bought it. At the time, I had just had a newborn baby and I loved how I could quietly dry my hair while she was sleeping in the room next to me and the dryer never woke her up. So being quiet is a huge plus as well as the longevity. Dries my hair quickly. I have fine, straight hair and cheap dryers take me about 8-10 minutes to completely dry my hair. This dryer takes 4 minutes to completely dry my hair. Huge time saver!! I always pack this dryer with me when I go on vacations with my girlfriends. 2 of my friends have really long, thick, coarse hair and they say they&#x27;ve never had a dryer that dries their hair as fast as this one does. One of my friends went out and bought one after her T3 featherweight dryer died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside, it is heavier than most other dryers. I was so used to how light my T3 featherweight dryer was and had to build up some wrist/arm strength for this. So I could see why some people who have wrist issues or prefer something light weight would not like this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this dryer. Expensive but worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS DRYER --- SOOOO QUIET</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace a cheap Conair one that was extremely loud. I liked it overall I suppose over the 2 years I&#x27;ve had it, but it has had quite a few cons. It&#x27;s super heavy to hold and hurts your shoulders to hold up. Even my hairdresser said she wouldn&#x27;t get one because of the weight. It&#x27;s not that much quieter in comparison to the Conair. I&#x27;m not sure what the shelf life of a hair dryer should be...I&#x27;ve had it for two years and it just stopped working! It started falling apart inside and making rattling and nasty grinding noises. Scary noises that made me feel like it might explode. I&#x27;m off to find a new one and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this model again.</li>
    <li> So happy i bought this for my wife.  No more annoying high pitched hair dryer sound to tolerate!  She claims it works better than her other dryer that she was attached to.  All around great product!</li>
    <li> The price is high but it&#x27;s worth it for the low noise that could save on hearing problems in the future. Even the cats are not afraid of this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Quiet as advertised! My wife was very happy with this gift and loved that it won&#x27;t be damaging her hearing the way our old one did.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after worrying for a long time about the potential effects of her [very loud] hair dryer on her hearing.  I was a bit skeptical about how quiet the Centrix really is until I saw the videos mentioned on YouTube.  It absolutely lives up to the billing: it is very quiet, but also very powerful, particularly when you install the nozzle (the nozzle boosts the air velocity by constricting the flow).  My wife is very happy with it and raves about how much better it is than her previous hair dryer.  This isn&#x27;t some \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; hair dryer. It seems to be very high quality construction, and again: the noise reduction is significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only potential issue to be aware of is the rather large size of the fan and motor unit.  The side view doesn&#x27;t reveal this, but the unit is definitely larger than typical dryers.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal, but it does mean that the dryer might not fit in a bathroom drawer or in your carry on luggage.  But in my opinion, the significantly reduced noise coupled with the overall high quality of this product more than offsets any concerns about size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone concerned about the ear piercing shrill of traditional hair dryers.  This thing is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 YEAR UPDATE: Our Centrix continues to be an awesome purchase. We have not had any issues whatsoever with it; it continues to work quietly and efficiently, and my wife loves it.  I never thought a hair dryer would prove to be a \\&quot;smart buy\\&quot; but this one continues to work very, very well. If and when we need another someday, we will stick with this brand and model.</li>
    <li> I am a very busy hair stylist that works in a busy salon and the noise level of a dryer is VERY important to me! I absolutely have to be able to communicate with my clients over the dryer. I have LOVED how quiet this dryer is! Unfortunately, the higher heat setting went out on the first dryer. The company did replace that dryer, which was off warranty, and I am very grateful for that. However, now the same thing is happening with my second dryer so, I guess I have to find another manufacturer. I am not abusive with my tools but I am using it nonstop. Anyway, the search goes on...:(</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, and it&#x27;s truly very quiet. I chose it based on this lovely woman&#x27;s chart of decibel ratings for a variety of hair dryers: http://www.howloudisthat.com/results.html  True to her testing, this came out quieter than any other hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used, even when I use it on high. I tend to mostly use it on the next speed down, since I&#x27;m particularly protective of my hearing. dries my hair great, like it quite a bit!</li>
    <li> I bought this maybe a year or so. I never use it because it feels much heavier than my old hair dryer which is the same size. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as my old hair dryer either. It is quiet though.</li>
    <li> As it is promoted, this is the quietest hair dryer I have ever been around. Girlfriend says it works good for her hair.</li>
    <li> This is not, from my experience a quiet dryer..&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based on the reviews..&lt;br /&gt;What a dissapointment.&lt;br /&gt;Either the one I got is defective,,..&lt;br /&gt;Or I do not know what..</li>
    <li> Lovely, quiet hairdryer.  I have been looking for a nice quiet hair dryer, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about the noise level.  This is the quietest one I have owned.  It isn&#x27;t silent, after all, there has to be a fan in there, but it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> Using my Smart Phone DB Meter my Wife&#x27;s Revlon Ceramic Ionic, 15.25 oz, $20.00 , Logged in 80--82 DB High Pitch Annoying Whine, heard throughout the house. The Centrix Q Zone Ceramic Ionic, 1 lb 5 oz, I paid $100...it&#x27;s now $90...arrrgg, a little too heavy for my Wife&#x27;s wrist problem, but dries her hair faster, Logged in (w/50 mph attachment) 70--72 DB on high &amp; 60-62 DB on low speed (she prefers the low setting hi heat), the Low Pitched tone made on hi speed sounded much Quieter than the 10 DB difference implies, I could barely hear it from other rooms in the house, My Wife leaves the Bathroom door open when drying her hair. I knocked a Star off for the weight; it should have been Quieter for the Weight, preferably lighter.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer, it is very quiet i can have a conversation on the phone while in use. Very light weight and it cuts the drying time in half, i have very thick hair so with a regular hair dryer it takes longer than the centrix. I would recommend this product to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Is this really a $300 hair dryer??? It was a gift to me many many years ago that I forgot how many years exactly so it&#x27;s old yet it still works! I want to buy a new one for back up.</li>
    <li> I use in a salon, love it. Super quiet. Somewhat heavy, but once you get use to the weight its a great dryer. Able to have a conversation with client while drying hair and no need to yell.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough to dry my hair anymore even on hottest option. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome.  I live in an old house without carpet -- sound carries!  I was inadvertently waking up my baby by blow drying my hair with the old dryer.  I was nervous to try a dryer with less wattage (the other one was 1850), but this dryer dries my hair just as quickly and is SO much quieter.  I can now return to drying my hair while my baby naps, which makes us both happy!  My husband also uses it when he&#x27;s up early without waking up the rest of the house.  Overall, so glad I splurged and bought this dryer!</li>
    <li> Love the sound of the hair dryer. Very quiet! Shipped fast. The handle was awkward and not comfortable to hold. Prefer buttons to be on front if the handle. Would be more accessible. But would purchase the hairdryer again.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because my old one which was 1875 watts kept tripping the electrical breaker and was a real hassle in a 2 story home. Had to keep going downstairs to reset it.  I don&#x27;t notice a loss in efficiency of the lesser wattage. It does everything it says it will and has nice settings that can be varied to your taste. The only thing I&#x27;d choose to improve would be that it would be nice if could weigh less, but it&#x27;s a minor problem. Also it&#x27;s pretty expensive. I hope it lasts a decent length of time. I&#x27;ve only had it a brief time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dryer to replace a 20 year old Italian-made professional dryer I&#x27;d been given by a friend who was the sales rep to hairstylists. This one was reviewed well in Modern Salon magazine, so I decided to order since the price was good. When it arrived, I saw on the box that it was a Cricket product, and I&#x27;ve never been a fan of Cricket. But decided to give it a fair try. It is very quiet and dries my fine hair very quickly with lots of volume. I&#x27;m right handed, and I keep getting my palm on the buttons and accidentally changing the settings. I wish the buttons were on the other side of the handle so that I could have them in between my fingers while I hold on. The dryer is not as ergonomically balanced as I would like, either. After several weeks of use I am getting used to how to hold and work with this dryer. I kept it, but would recommend only reluctantly. And I would not buy it again.  The dryer is made in China.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I had one before and I had to have another one since mine died.  thank you</li>
