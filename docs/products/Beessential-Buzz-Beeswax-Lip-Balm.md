      <li>3 provide better relief without a waxy</li>
      <li>Love that it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
      <li>scent is really refreshing.</li>
      <li>absolutely love this lip balm, I have found my holy grail and I will never switch to another lip balm.</li>
      <li>I love, LOVE this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good lip balm.</li>
      <li>I have used several lip moisturizers and this is a very good product.</li>
      <li>I enjoy all their &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; but this is my favorite</li>
      <li>I even enjoy applying this balm after my lips have already cracked, and it helps stop them from cracking any further.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has to be the aromatherapy of the light peppermint oil that makes me feel</li>
      <li>Really good and finally something which works.</li>
      <li>stuff is absolute magic.</li>
      <li>Leaves a cool, tingling sensation on my lips while also moisturizing.</li>
      <li>but the Peppermint is now my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I tried the lip balm and the ingredients are all natural and helpful to keep my lips lubricated.</li>
      <li>This is everything good that other reviews have said about it.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like the vapo-rub one would use if congested.  </li>
      <li>but this really works!  </li>
      <li>So, while there are quite a few good balms out there</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products, and most of them do a decent job on wintertime cracked lips.  </li>
      <li>I never promise a certain review.</li>
      <li>but the main side effect was it dryed out my skin and LIPS!  </li>
      <li>really like the product a lot</li>
      <li>Even frozen solid it glides on smoothly.</li>
      <li>really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really does help.</li>
      <li>This one really works and is not temporary fix.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very soothing and helps moisten more than the average chapstick.</li>
      <li>Love it, I previously tried the Lemon&amp;Lavender</li>
      <li>I was on accutane for cystic acne as a teen and lucky it worked and no scarring,</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for other guys and obviously girls will love it too!</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and like most balms, is small and easy to tuck into a pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I want to start off by saying as a man I don&#x27;t normally wear lip balms.</li>
      <li>I appreciate the fact that when I apply this balm it doesn&#x27;t render my lips greasy feeling so the point that it’s slipping off of my lips, it actually doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling like they have much of a residue at all, and I enjoy that.</li>
      <li>It sure beats the other stuff you can buy at local drug stores and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the smooth texture of this lip balm is quite nice, the fragrance is extremely unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>Just the right amount of peppermint - very moisturizing and fairly long lasting.  </li>
      <li>I have to apply it frequently, but the peeling is almost eliminated.  </li>
      <li>I wash my hands first then apply some of this to the cracked or dry areas and rub it in until it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
      <li>feel.&lt;br /&gt;All 3 are not too runny not too hard and all three have a solid case with a top that stays on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
      <li>My lips can be chapped and flaking, but once I apply this balm and rub my lips together a few times they feel fresh and soft.</li>
      <li>Bert&#x27;s Bees seems to be the standard bearer of lip balm - this Beessential is far better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It takes just a second for my lips to benefit from this moisturizer, and once they do they feel completely changed.</li>

<li> It takes just a second for my lips to benefit from this moisturizer, and once they do they feel completely changed.</li>
<li> Still not enough to eliminate my seriously dry lips,</li>
<li> I find that most lip balms wear off of my lips within a few short minutes after applying and then it renders it useless to me.</li>
<li> All of a sudden, I&#x27;m calmed down.</li>
<li> It has just enough scent and flavor that it doesn&#x27;t overpower in smell but adds little tinges of it over time.</li>
<li> since I have been it, I find I use less and less as it&#x27;s basically cured or improved drastically my need to constantly use a lip balm.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;other&#x27; lip balms and while I like them, it seems like I have to keep putting them on over and over.</li>
<li> This lip balm starts out a little stiff, hard to roll on, but what happens after it&#x27;s been on for a few seconds is that it softens and coats my lips sinking in and lasting for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> your lips instantly feel like they are cracking once the wind hits them, this lip balm goes on thin but provides tons of protection and relief.</li>
<li> If I&#x27;m feeling a little anxious or stressed, I pull this out and spread a little on my lips.</li>
<li> Buy a few, you WON&#x27;T regret it!</li>
<li> But nothing I found would also eliminate that peeling that goes on, for me at least, throughout the year, every day.  </li>
<li> Winter is upon us and during the cold months of the year my lips get outrageously dry, chapped, and, yes, flaky.</li>
<li> and sometimes it gets so bad that they crack especially at night while I’m sleeping  </li>
<li> , we are going through a crazy cold spree where I live and</li>
<li> Brutal cold really does a number on my hands and as a guy I&#x27;m not going to carry around some lotion.</li>
<li> I hate having dry lips</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also applied this to a spider bite and it decreased the itch feeling from the bump the stupid thing left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Even after I wiped this lip balm off and put on another, the unpleasant odor lingered.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I researched the best lip balms on google, and this was number one. This is the best lip balm I have ever used and it&#x27;s also the only one that actually worked. Buy a few, you WON&#x27;T regret it!</li>
    <li> Love it, I previously tried the Lemon&amp;Lavender but the Peppermint is now my new favorite. Leaves a cool, tingling sensation on my lips while also moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;other&#x27; lip balms and while I like them, it seems like I have to keep putting them on over and over.

It has just enough scent and flavor that it doesn&#x27;t overpower in smell but adds little tinges of it over time. It lasts a long time and like most balms, is small and easy to tuck into a pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep one in my car, one in my purse and one in my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I never imagined lip balm could be so soothing. This is some of the best lip balm I have ever used. Even frozen solid it glides on smoothly. The peppermint is so perfect, just the right amount without being strong or wimpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t figure out what they put in this lip balm to make it so calming and wonderful. If I&#x27;m feeling a little anxious or stressed, I pull this out and spread a little on my lips. All of a sudden, I&#x27;m calmed down. It has to be the aromatherapy of the light peppermint oil that makes me feel so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this work frozen - I&#x27;ve never seen a lip balm that works when cold - it doesn&#x27;t turn into soup when warm. I carried this around in my pocket all day, and it worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is absolute magic. Bert&#x27;s Bees seems to be the standard bearer of lip balm - this Beessential is far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> All of these products are of much better quality than most lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;All 3 provide better relief without a waxy feel.&lt;br /&gt;All 3 are not too runny not too hard and all three have a solid case with a top that stays on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for both the Lemon Lavender and the Peppermint.</li>
    <li> While the smooth texture of this lip balm is quite nice, the fragrance is extremely unpleasant.  It smells exactly like the vapo-rub one would use if congested.  Even after I wiped this lip balm off and put on another, the unpleasant odor lingered.  I would not recommend this!</li>
    <li> Pretty good lip balm. Still not enough to eliminate my seriously dry lips, but it&#x27;s very soothing and helps moisten more than the average chapstick.</li>
    <li> They sent me some free soap which is amazing! And i applied this chap stick over 3 hours ago and its still going strong!</li>
    <li> Winter is upon us and during the cold months of the year my lips get outrageously dry, chapped, and, yes, flaky. I hate having dry lips and sometimes it gets so bad that they crack especially at night while I’m sleeping  so I have become somewhat of a lip balm connoisseur. I find that most lip balms wear off of my lips within a few short minutes after applying and then it renders it useless to me. This Buzz Balm All Natural Peppermint Lip Balm by Beessential moisturizes my lips without leaving them feel greasy, and it sinks in to my lips immediately, making it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the features?&lt;br /&gt;·  Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·  Invigorating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;·  Has vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Opinions:&lt;br /&gt;I  absolutely love this lip balm, I have found my holy grail and I will never switch to another lip balm. I appreciate the fact that when I apply this balm it doesn&#x27;t render my lips greasy feeling so the point that it’s slipping off of my lips, it actually doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling like they have much of a residue at all, and I enjoy that. It takes just a second for my lips to benefit from this moisturizer, and once they do they feel completely changed. My lips can be chapped and flaking, but once I apply this balm and rub my lips together a few times they feel fresh and soft. I even enjoy applying this balm after my lips have already cracked, and it helps stop them from cracking any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this balm is great also, I love minty smelling lip products, and this one does not disappoint! The Peppermint is uplifting and invigorating and feels wonderful on your lips. I would recommend this lip balm by Beessential to anyone, it would also make a great gift! I received this product for evaluation, but these are my own opinions. I never promise a certain review.</li>
    <li> I love, LOVE this lip balm.  I was on accutane for cystic acne as a teen and lucky it worked and no scarring, etc. but the main side effect was it dryed out my skin and LIPS!  So, while there are quite a few good balms out there this is the BEST!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t make my lips shinny but is SO moisturizing, since I have been it, I find I use less and less as it&#x27;s basically cured or improved drastically my need to constantly use a lip balm.  Yay!  $2.99 is the real cost and ordering from the company is a great experience, there customer service is amazing! So, if you need a good lip balm, no wait, if you need the Best Lip Balm ever, this is it!  Enjoy!  P.S. I enjoy all their &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; but this is my favorite, I feel it&#x27;s the most moisturizing, but truly, they are all great!</li>
    <li> The best balm I have ever used</li>
    <li> I am glad that I tried the lip balm and the ingredients are all natural and helpful to keep my lips lubricated. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have used several lip moisturizers and this is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. It has many oils and ingredients I won&#x27;t expect in lip balm... But it works great and smells good. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying as a man I don&#x27;t normally wear lip balms. They are either too greasy or candy smelling and seem to serve no purpose. Much to my SUPRISE Beesential has a wonderful lip balm that in my experiences is good for more then just lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it as a lip balm the smell is wonderful, we are going through a crazy cold spree where I live and your lips instantly feel like they are cracking once the wind hits them, this lip balm goes on thin but provides tons of protection and relief. My lips didn&#x27;t crack and the parts that already were cracked felt better within about 20 minutes, and it helped clear up my stuffy nose because of the wonderful peppermint smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a mentioned this isn&#x27;t just for lips in my opinion. Brutal cold really does a number on my hands and as a guy I&#x27;m not going to carry around some lotion. I wash my hands first then apply some of this to the cracked or dry areas and rub it in until it doesn&#x27;t feel oily. The peppermint seems to &amp;#34;wake my skin up&amp;#34; and feels great. I&#x27;ve also applied this to a spider bite and it decreased the itch feeling from the bump the stupid thing left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product a lot and that&#x27;s from a mans point of view who HATES lip balm. I highly recommend this for other guys and obviously girls will love it too! It sure beats the other stuff you can buy at local drug stores and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a runner and seem to have chapped, wind/sunburned lips.  I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun but this really works!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> who told you to put the balm on?</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of peppermint - very moisturizing and fairly long lasting.  Would definitely buy again as this is a well made product.</li>
    <li> This is everything good that other reviews have said about it. Love that it isn&#x27;t sticky. It really does help.</li>
    <li> Really good and finally something which works. I have tried several products in the category and none come close to it. Why? This one really works and is not temporary fix.</li>
    <li> One of the things I&#x27;ve been searching for for years is a good lip moisturizer.  Now I&#x27;ve found it.  Buzz Balm really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products, and most of them do a decent job on wintertime cracked lips.  But nothing I found would also eliminate that peeling that goes on, for me at least, throughout the year, every day.  Nothing until Buzz Balm.  I have to apply it frequently, but the peeling is almost eliminated.  I love it and will recommend it to all my friends.</li>
