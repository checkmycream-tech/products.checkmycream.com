<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The face wash is great. My skin feels different after I use it, in a good refreshed way. Is kind of expensive for the quantity provided, but I&#x27;ll use it for a month (1 week so far) before saying if its worth it or not. Unfortunately, the bottle is of a terrible design, since the liquid is really thick, it takes ages and a lot of pushes of the small pump to get enough out. I switched it out to another empty bottle of face wash and it seemed to do the trick of making it easier to get out.</li>
    <li> WOW. I have struggled with finding the right facial wash for myself for years. &amp;#34;Rugged &amp; Dapper&amp;#34; smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I&#x27;m not sure how big a difference &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; is for facial scrubs are, but this stuff feels great. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Leaves you with oily skin. Had a pimple on my forehead 2 days after I started using it.</li>
    <li> Great scrub. My skin is softer since using this product for a week. It smells nice on top of that.</li>
    <li> I am totally digging this facial cleanser from Rugged and Dapper.  I love that it is all natural with no harsh chemicals typically found in face washes.  It has the perfect amount of foaming action mixed with graininess that help with exfoliating.  After washing my face with this product my skin feels freash,clean, and tight.  I pair it with R&amp;D moisturizer and have noticed a big difference in my skin using both products.  I am definitely a long term customer and hope this company&#x27;s product lines continues to grow.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a nicer shave after washing my face.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser works really well. It leaves an unbelievably smooth and refreshing touch, and removes the excess oil and dirt. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is good. It melts away dirt off your face. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> This product works great, smells amazing and is an overall great product!&lt;br /&gt;My nephew loves this stuff and uses it daily. It&#x27;s a must have item.</li>
    <li> I just received this and I have to say this is a great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I could feel the difference WHILE I was using it, it was so refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to my friends for sure.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience with this product as almost every other user... it&#x27;s fantastic. It smells great, feels great and most importantly, works great! I&#x27;ll be buying a another bottle of this and the moisturizer very soon. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed so product spilled all over in box.</li>
    <li> Higher on the ingredients list than any of the beneficial ingredients listed is &amp;#34;Ocean Breeze Fragrance&amp;#34;. My acne flared up and my face turned red. Also contains irritating citrus extracts and alcohol. Tea Tree Oil is almost the last ingredient.</li>
    <li> Love the product it smells greats, the texture is perfect and my face looks and feels so much smoother and even. As dark skin man with sensitive skin it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works with my skin type and this cleaner does just that. My face isn&#x27;t right and dry after washing nor is the exfoliating texture too abrasive. Well worth the price for the size and how much is needed per use.</li>
    <li> Nice one! I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks. It really works well!</li>
    <li> Awesome scent.  Feels great.  Looking into their other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and have been using it for about two weeks now. I try to use it 2x a day (am/pm). After use my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry, but full disclosure in the morning I do apply a facial moisturizer after use. The smell is great in the shower, not sure how long it lingers throughout the day, but its not overpowering in the slightest.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff!  Smells great and cleans well.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing I love the pump as it is so convenient. I love the way my skin feels after using it&#x27;s refreshing and gentle. I recommend this product from my own personal body experience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve admittedly only been using my Rugged &amp; Dapper Power Scrub for a few days but think that a review is still in order. I will update it after a time to ensure my comments are still true. I chose this stuff because of the rave reviews and the fact that R&amp;D is an all-natural product. I&#x27;m not one of those guys who avoid things that aren&#x27;t all-natural but for a while I&#x27;ve noticed that my face hasn&#x27;t been responding well to a lot of the face cleansers I&#x27;ve used. I also liked the fact that this is a cleanser, exfoliator and toner all in one. I do use another exfoliator twice a week but the exfoliating in this product is fairly gentle so I doubt it will bother your skin with combining the use. I&#x27;m no expert on exfoliation though.  My first impression was not what I expected. The scrub was very nice and refreshing and left my skin feeling very clean without drying it out so I was very pleased until I woke up in the middle of the night to notice that the pores on my face were massive! I mean like huge craters! Fortunately this seems to have been only an initial one-time effect because I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and my face looks smooth and clean and my pores are nowhere in sight. I feel great after using it and my wife says my face smell nice which is an added bonus.  So far I find this to be a great cleanser. Light with a pleasant scent and definitely something I&#x27;d keep using. I&#x27;m hoping that they&#x27;ll keep the price at a reasonable amount so that I can continue to purchase it.  Update: After about a month of using this stuff I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I can&#x27;t live without it. My face is smooth and clear. I no longer have any mild acne on my forehead and it has helped me cut down on facial oils significantly. Seriously love this stuff! It will become a regular part of my grooming routine.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this in my search for an effective face wash that wouldn&#x27;t dry my face out or make me peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a little smaller than I expected for some reason, perhaps mentally I expected for the cost that it was a larger bottle and I ignored the ounce size. As noted by other reviewers, the pump on this is just weak and too small. It&#x27;s frustrating to slam it repeatedly and firmly in an attempt to even get it to pump a pea sized quantity out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you succeed in actually getting the product out, it&#x27;s a light brown slightly gritty consistency. The smell, however, is wonderful. It is a very nice masculine scent, not quite cologne potency but certainly notable. It seems to stay with you for at least some of the day. All positive remarks from ladies in this category as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly it does the job of cleaning my face and neck quite well. My skin feels clean and smooth after. Maybe a tiny hint of dry skin, but nothing compared to many products containing things like salicylic acid for example.  I expect this to last several weeks and be my new go-to face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But please fix the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Race</li>
    <li> This is a great daily scrub facial cleanser for any man.  My husband loves the way it feels on his face.  It is not too heavy or harsh, but really feels good and makes him feel like he is getting his face clean (deep down clean) instead of just on the surface.  It is is a 3-in-1 nourishing cleanser, foaming exfoliator and energizing toner that can be used both morning and night.  When he uses it before he shaves it helps him get a cleaner shave.  He loves it and I&#x27;m glad I finally found something that he loves enough to use.  Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Bought this on sale and its good stuff</li>
    <li> Love the product and the face feels great after a wash!</li>
    <li> My husband always stole my facial cleanser until I purchased this rugged and dapper facial cleanser for him. He loves this stuff, he said that it leaves his face feeling clean and fresh. A little goes a long way, it smells good and works great! I like that it comes in a manly looking bottle with a pump top. This is the perfect cleanser for a man. I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are completely my own.</li>
    <li> I really like the idea behind a simple, natural ingredients, men&#x27;s focused face cleanser. I had been using Clinique for Men, which worked okay, but I always felt like it dried my face out a good bit more than necessary. I bought this because my dry skin started to cause acne and redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this product worked for about the first three days of using. I definitely noticed a decrease in blackheads, the feeling of fresh was awesome, no overpowering scents or dyes from what I could tell. I am not a fan of the plastic beads that they put in a lot of cleaners for several reasons, the main being the harmful pollutive effects. Anyways, I could tell my skin wasn&#x27;t as responsive the second week using this product. I figured because it was adjusting to the change, I would notice some flare ups when first using it and hoped it would clear up in the next week. The spout no longer works, so it&#x27;s difficult to get the prescribed amount out of the bottle - the beads have clogged up the tube, definitely a bad design. And my acne is worse than ever. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout this bad since high school. Was expecting more from this cleanser - about a quarter of the bottle is left and I&#x27;ll not be using any more of it. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like mine, guys, it might be worth the purchase but I think there are way better and less pricey options out there.</li>
    <li> I dont usually do this about skin products but this is by far the best face wash i have used in a long time. My skin feels remnarkable after the wash. not dry, not oily just perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf and he can&#x27;t even put into words how great it is! I also purchased the moisturizer to go with this and he love that too!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily skin. This works well.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works well. I typically shave after my shower, so I like to use this post-shave to wash off any residue that my razor may have left and to clean out my pores. I like that it&#x27;s a US product and small company.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it daily in the shower in the mornings and once again at night. It cleans and exfoliates! Only a tiny bit is enough for your face, one bottle should last a few months.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!! I&#x27;ve gone through so many facial washes and this is the one that actually makes a difference. Acne is gone, face is less oily, and it smells really good.  However I have 2 big issues:&lt;br /&gt;1. The pump on this product is useless and after a little while I just switched containers.&lt;br /&gt;2. It felt like the bottle wasn&#x27;t full when it arrived in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great but if these two things were taken into consideration I&#x27;m never buying another face wash again.</li>
    <li> Great product from Rugged and Dapper! Every time I use the product, my face feels fresh and clean and the scent has a nice masculine smell to it. This cleanser is certainly a high quality product and works to keep your face looking clean and well kept. Follow up with a facial moisturizer for best results. Although they may have a facial moisturizer, I suggest using a facial moisturizer with SPF as their facial moisturizer does not have SPF (but it may be optimal for nighttime use).</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 Rugged and Dapper facial scrubs and BOTH pumps are defective! If the manufacture really reads these...PLEASE send me the snap caps to screw on my bottles that the pump has failed! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face looking clean and starts glowing right away no more stealing my wifes stuff lol this is our solution manly man!! All over the world.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month. This is a perfect complement to the &amp;#34;Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer For Men&amp;#34; also by Rugged &amp; Dapper. I like that&lt;br /&gt;a) It is gentle enough to use twice a day&lt;br /&gt;b) It is made from natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;c) It thoroughly cleans without over drying the face.&lt;br /&gt;d) It has significantly reduced shaving irritation, instead of increasing it, like the other scrubs I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to the gym during my lunch break and I absolutely love the fact that I only have to carry two bottles with me  :)</li>
    <li> Use the Power Scrub every day as part of my routine and very pleased with the way it makes my skin feel.  Definitely ordering more - you have a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> The face wash is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It lathers  eally well with just a small amount.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use most products.  Rugged &amp; Dapper however, doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and leaves my face feeling great!</li>
    <li> So far very happy with Facial cleaner and Facial moisturizer, I have used for 2 weeks now and my skin looks and feels better.</li>
    <li> I love the 3-in-1 approach to cleaning my face.  No longer do I need multiple products to accomplish what this does in a single bottle.  After just a few days of usage, I can already tell that my skin feels cleaner and healthier.  Can&#x27;t wait to try R&amp;D&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I love the face lotion from this brand, but this had a very soapy/detergent like smell that was too strong, and there was not enough of the exfoliating particles to do anything. The company refunded me 100% and was great to work with. The product itself has gentle ingredients, so if you dont mind a stronger smell, you may like it. I give the product 2 stars, the company (and co-founder who i spoke with via email) gets 5 starts, they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> I was going to wait at least 1-2 weeks to write a review, but on day 3 this has made a big enough impression for me to say its probably the best product on the market, though i have only tried a few others. Made in USA organic ingredients, the only con is the price but you definitely get what you pay for. Keep on making excellent products R&amp;D!</li>
    <li> I am 25 and have already dreaded shaving for 7 or 8 years. Shaving still isn&#x27;t great but this lotion in combination with the face wash has pretty much eliminated my sore, torn up neck after shaving. Also, I love marketing, I think it is perfect and I have been encouraging my friends to try it out.</li>
    <li> As tthe review said,this really is a fantastic product,nice touch,nice smell, most important, doesn&#x27;t dry out after washing. the scrub are mild,can be used as a daily face wash without pain.</li>
    <li> Great product. The pumice in it is aggressive but not harsh. I use it daily with the Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer and I can really tell it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Not bad, seems to work ok.  I am still getting clogged pores so I am not blown away.</li>
    <li> Definitely a must buy for smoothing and even tone up your skin feels refreshing. Works for me though</li>
    <li> I have used multiple cleansers in the past, this one was a great surprise!  I have rough dry skin and this product seem to work wonders on my skin.  I didn&#x27;t start feeling or noticing the texture of my skin until about a couple weeks of use.  My skin is not as rough as it once was.  The size of the bottle is plenty for morning and nightly uses.  I will continue to use this product and will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> My husband likes this cleaner, says it leaves his face feeling fresh and clean</li>
    <li> I have always hated using face wash but it&#x27;s a necessity as I have extra oily skin.  But I actually look forward to using this in the shower when I get up every morning and before bed every night.  It leaves my skin amazingly smooth and makes for a fantastic pre-shave scrub to make sure you get as close a shave as possible.  Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey at $25 but it is worth every penny in my opinion, and I&#x27;ll be ordering again and again.</li>
    <li> Rugged and Dapper has a nice clean smell, the exfoliating beads are not overwhelming, and it leaves your face feeling clean and not overly dry. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Works great without drying out skin. Took off a star because its too pricey.</li>
    <li> great stuff does what it say&#x27;s it does</li>
    <li> Used it for about 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t really do anything to clear up my acne. Don&#x27;t buy if you have troubled/oily skin. 3 stars because my acne didn&#x27;t get any worse I guess.</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s facial scrub is much better than anything you could buy over the counter. I tried nuetragena mens facial wash and it did nothing about my pours. My face feels clean with this cleaner. I will also say that this is my second purchase. The smell is not bad at all so if you are concerned with that then don&#x27;t worry.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend to try. He tried it for the first time last night and LOVED it. He suffered from acne when he was younger and had a few deep spots on his face and after using it last night he said his face felt SO smooth. Even where he shaved it was extremely smooth. He said it will be a nightly routine now. He is a mechanic so a lot of times he comes home and has black oils etc on his face and it removed all of that from his hands too when he was cleaning his face. The smell is also awesome. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a nasty face wash it&#x27;s manly and pleasant..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;rugged &amp; dapper&amp;#34; husband loved this product. He wears a beard and has pretty large pores most likely attributed to his &amp;#34;hairiness&amp;#34;. Well, he was very pleased with how his skin felt after using it and the refreshing smell would give him a nice &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; too. Our only disappointment was when we accidentally left it behind in a hotel bathroom in Vegas :(....there&#x27;s one lucky man out there that was able to keep practically a full bottle for free :&#x27;(. We&#x27;ll most likely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> A&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;br /&gt;A&lt;br /&gt;Z&lt;br /&gt;I&lt;br /&gt;N&lt;br /&gt;G</li>
    <li> This thing does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Great masculine scent&lt;br /&gt;-It is ORGANIC! You have to treat your face right, and what better way than to use an organic product.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t look cheap. When you pour the quarter size of cleanser on your hand you can see that it&#x27;s not just a gel it has all these &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; ingredients that give it a unique look, and when you scrub it on your face you literally feel these &amp;#34;micro&amp;#34; ingredients working.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-The price...I know this stuff is organic so it will be expensive, but maybe like $18 will do. It&#x27;s because of the price that I&#x27;ll only use it once a day. Technically you are gonna want use it twice a day, but I ain&#x27;t rich.</li>
    <li> Seems to really do a nice job. I have oily skin and so far it seems to have improve my skin.</li>
    <li> The face wash itself was ok, but due to a design flaw in the pump bottle I only ended up using it a few times. For some reason it kept getting clumped together or something so the pump wouldn&#x27;t work and to get any out I had to unscrew it and pour. Ended up going back to my Jack Black.</li>
    <li> works great, smells nice</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a week now and I think it&#x27;s great. I have very sensitive, dry and also oily skin. This product does a perfect job catering to all those conditions. Smells good too. Keeps my poors tight and has done a good job preventing breakouts that I normally suffer from. This is a really great product. And had natural ingredients which is a must for my sensitive skin. Products  a little on the pricey side but is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and way it feels on the face. Seems really cleansing and rejuvenating.</li>
    <li> my husband love the product i got this product for free for my unbiased opinion ,&amp; we liked the smell &amp; it is very nice scrub .</li>
    <li> Love it!  Usually face wash drys me out but this stuff doesn&#x27;t give me that problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used a facial cleanser before, but I love the difference this has made. I&#x27;ve always suffered from oily skin and clogged pores, and pimples into my 20&#x27;s. Since using this product, not only is my skin noticeably less oily, but it&#x27;s also smoother and I am having fewer pimples to boot! Can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a facial cleanser made for men as my skin has become more oily and less youthful looking as I&#x27;ve gotten older (nearly 40).  At first the price was higher than I was willing to pay but the positive reviews convinced me to give R&amp;D a shot..... I&#x27;m hooked. Within a few days of consistent use, my skin felt and looked better than it has in a long while. I plan on using the Power Scrub Facial for a LONG time. I&#x27;m very glad I took the chance.</li>
    <li> Best facial scrub I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Rugged &amp; Dapper Power Scrub - This is the secound product from this company I have bought for my husband. And with the masculane pakaging it is not so hard to get him to try, really stands out from my girly products.He really likes this clenser. He says that it has just the right amount of scrubbie to gently exfoliate. No harsh chemicals  so it leaves your skin nice and soft not dry. Gentle enough for every day use .And it smells GREAT ! New loyal customer here.</li>
    <li> Feel the difference at the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potentially a 5-Stars Review Product -- will update after used up of my first bottle.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product.  It is great at removing all of the oil and debris from a days accumulation of dead skin cells and oil.  What is even more fantastic is the little tough bamboo charcoal cleansing stone that turns to the softest cleanser toold I have ever experience.  Overall they are really great products that takes just a few seconds in the shower to get that super squeaky clean feeling.  Great products.  They arrived just a couple of days after ordering.  Can&#x27;t beat that kind of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
    <li> I received a coupon code for my unbiased opinion and review which I have tried other facial scrubs for my husband and son and this one once they opened it they wanted to wash their face. My son said he loved the way his face felt how smooth and hydrated it felt as well because most dry his face out they same for my husband&#x27;s due to him shaving everyday... I would definitely recommend and purchase this again regardless of a coupon code because they love it so much and I doubt they will share</li>
    <li> A not so harsh facial cleanser that leaves my face feeling smooth. It even cleared up some of my razor bumps and acne. I use it daily along with the rugged and dapper moisturizer.</li>
    <li> After the first use I was hooked. Never thought that my face could feel this smooth, and clean! I will definitely be purchasing more from this company. Quality product, I am recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves your face feeling tight and smooth with a calm smell.</li>
    <li> Good product although they sent 7 oz bottle instead of 8.</li>
    <li> Great smelling wonderful face wash</li>
    <li> IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS  KIEHL&#x27;S AND TOM FORD&#x27;S SCRUB AND THAT&#x27;S QUITE A COMPLIMENT !!! THE GEL JUST NEEDS MORE CONSISTENCY IT&#x27;S A BIT WATERY AND THE PUMP DISPENSER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ASAP !!!</li>
    <li> How to review this product and compete with all of the witty and rather clever reviews....  Heck, after reading the reviews on this product, I was half-way convinced this product would change my life.  Most of the reviews were compensated and if they were unhappy, they still made waiver statements as though a lawyer coached them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I want to start by saying I waited a little more than a week to write a review because my first impression was to pack this stuff back up and send it back.  After a few days of use, I changed my view because what are we talking about here?  It&#x27;s a face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Does it clean?  Yup.&lt;br /&gt;Does your skin feel decent after use?  You betcha.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, do you wake up in a mansion with the title &amp;#34;Supermodel Rock Star&amp;#34;?  Not a chance, but don&#x27;t expect that from a bottle of face wash....&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very cheap and due to the density of the product, you will have to pump the dispenser incessantly to prime it enough to actually work.  There isn&#x27;t a strong scent and it&#x27;s not distinctive by any means.  The &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; portion refers to the not so &amp;#34;micro-rocks&amp;#34; that do scrub per say, but are not in high enough quantities to do much of anything.  You basically just push them around on your face and seem like ingredients to hype the label, not functionality.  Speaking of the label, I feel as though the label is well marketed to appeal to all.  &amp;#34;Organic ingredients, foaming exfoliator, fuel.&amp;#34;  Yeah it has those ingredients and they make sure to spell it out all over the label, but they seem to be more of an advertisement.  Just didn&#x27;t get the result that was claimed.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice soap, but I think it&#x27;s priced much too high.  I purchased for about half the retail price and I feel that&#x27;s still too high.  It&#x27;s new, so you&#x27;re not paying for the name and clearly it wasn&#x27;t spent on the bottle.  I will not be purchasing an additional bottle, even with the advertised discountfor a good review, but I&#x27;ll finish the one I have as it still does its job...it cleans.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy more morning scrub.  Wakes me right up!!</li>
    <li> Gentle exfoliation, no obnoxious &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; odor, leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed. Just like I said in my review title, a perfect KISS (Keep It Simple Studid) Cleanser; exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> The pump is broken so I can barely get the cleanser to come out</li>
    <li> After many failed attempts at trying to find a face cleaner, I had just about given up. Then Rugged And Dapper enters my life!!!! Simply the best face scrub a man can have. I have to say after one use i quickly ordered another bottle to have on standby. The smell is great. Not that medicine smell most face scrubs have. Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your face like most other men&#x27;s face scrubs tend to do. So do yourself a favor, and dump the epic fails that are face scrubs and get with Rugged And Dapper. You will not be sorry!!</li>
    <li> My husband  just started using this facial cleanser. He says it feels like sand. I told him that was the exfoliator  part. He is really  happy that one product  does three jobs because  there  is no way  he would  commit to that type of skin care  regiment. This  product  cleanses, exfoliates, and tones. He finds the scent pleasant and his skin looks nice and bright  not ashy. I received  this  product  for  a  discount  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.</li>
    <li> This face wash is wonderful. Its manly and fresh. It gets my face so clean, I love it. I am very impressed. It has so many great ingredients and it smells so dapper. Its thorough scrubbing beads are quite refreshing. It washes clean and rinses well. I have no complaints. This face soap is nice, Id recommend it to my friends. I did get a discount for a honest unbias review. Rugged and Dapper is stellar.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I had low expectations but I liked what I read about this face scrub. It does what it says it should do. I have always had both oily areas on and around my nose and dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks. I work with someone who is also an esthetician. She noticed my face no longer had dried out patches or overly oily areas and asked what I was doing different. That alone convinced me this stuff work was working.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best daily face scrubber that I have used, I would strongly suggest that you give it a try.</li>
    <li> I feel it is a bit shy on the scrubbing particles but feels great on the face. Definitely one of the better products I have used.</li>
    <li> Switch over from what i was using!</li>
    <li> Lives up to and exceeds expectations. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a while a product that can clean my face as well as soften by beard before I shave. I have used a lot of other products, but I really do enjoy this one. I wash my face morning and at night with this because I get a clean feeling on my face. I also do not have too use a lot either. From now on, I will continue to purchase this product for my face.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin, and I have been using this face wash every single day, sometimes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;So far this face wash has no allergic affect on my skin and I feel clean and fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It makes my face feel really clean. One slight negative is it leaves my face feeling a little tight. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this product.  Genuinely makes your skin feel great and prepped for shave.  Despite its ridiculous name and cost, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. The pump didn&#x27;t work on mine so I had to work sometimes to get it all out (that&#x27;s what she said). I&#x27;d definitely recommend Kyoku for men products over these. Less pricy and does the job just as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. They market to men hence their success but truly I think you can find a much more affordable and comparable product by Nutrogena and a few others at Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
    <li> hubby like it...fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e loves washing his face with this. He says it feels like it cleans his face better than other products. He feels cleaner and fresher after using it. He also does not seem to be having as many breakouts while using this. His skin feels good afterwards. He also really likes the scent. I like the scent on him a lot, as well. I also like the look of the box and bottle. You can tell it&#x27;s definitely for a man. I received a discount on this product for testing and evaluations. I really like this and I think it has improved my fianc&amp;eacute;e’s skin a lot. It is gentle and not too harsh. Yet it is tough enough to dissolve all the oil and acne causing bacteria. I am impressed with this facial cleanser. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Hi All, I just wanted pass on my recommendation on what I consider to be a very viable product. I for one have never use a facial scrub that&#x27;s just for men, and to be perfectly honest I never new they existed. The only reason I tried it was because of my wife&#x27;s insistence. If your anything like me (being a guy) I never used anything but soap. But after trying it, I was truly surprised. Not only did my face feel super clean but it also left it feeling tingly, so once a day everyday I&#x27;ll use it from now on. I won&#x27;t say it makes me look younger but it sure makes me feel younger.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this face wash so much. His skin is getting so clear and fresh. Its kinda funny cause he says hes getting better skin than me lol</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash. It feels like it really cleans my skin, and smells great. Will need to see how I feel after using it for more than just a few days, but so far so great!</li>
    <li> Honestly, the only face wash that has ever actually worked for me. I&#x27;ve gone through an insane amount of face washes trying to find one that would work and this is the only one that actually worked consistently without over drying and causing more problems than I had to begin with. Good stuff man.</li>
    <li> Finally something new for men. Gentle yet effective. Makes my face feel clean and smooth. I travel a lot. Maker certain spout is locked if you place it in a travel case. Good value. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning for about 3 1/2 months and im still on the same bottle.</li>
    <li> Let me explain.  This Rugged &amp; Dapper facial scrub arrived today and the actual cleanser is GREAT.  The problem, however, is the pump bottle does not work.  I am not sure if I received a defective pump, but I was forced to remove the pump, prop up the container overnight, and transfer the cleanser into a new pump bottle. It fell and I lost all of the cleanser.  Granted, it was my fault it spilled but at $25 you should not have to hassle with transferring to a new, workable pump container. Too bad.  As I said, I REALLY liked the cleanser.  Hopefully, the manufacturer will address this. UPDATE---The problem has been solved.  Customer Service from Rugged &amp; Dapper has been amazing and it&#x27;s quality matches the amazing Power Scrub.  Try it - you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My acne is gone and my face feels soft</li>
    <li> I really like the face wash and moisturizer but wow do they send you a lot of emails after you purchase.  Ease up on that guys.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the only downside is you have to pump at least 4 times to get a decent amount to scrub with.</li>
    <li> So far a great product. Not too heavy but strong enough to leave this construction worker feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the true customers that paid for this- no biased review here :)  First of all, it arrived quick, helped by the fact I have Prime.  The packaging is very nice and manly- black and white just works for most things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the product- It really takes just a small amount to lather up quick and I can see the bottle lasting quite a long time.  At first, I think I was applying the scrub too hard as it caused me to break out on my cheeks a little bit :(  I stopped using the product for a couple of days to let my skin settle down and then tried using it again, but this time being a little more cautious.  All I can say is, it works.  Any better than other products?  I don&#x27;t know, as this is the first step into looking after my skin...I&#x27;m getting old!  As for the smell, I would not say it&#x27;s out of this world good, but it is pleasant...I think it could do with being a little stronger tbh.  Thinking of going all in and getting the clay stuff too... would like to know how to get a discount to leave a &#x27;honest&#x27; review...hint hint :)</li>
    <li> Customer service is very attentive and the product is amazing.  I just got into this stuff now that I am mid 30s and I am happy to have found a company that has all natural products and is designed for men so I don&#x27;t feel weird about using them. Lol</li>
    <li> Decent scrub, is gentle with the skin and leaves face fresh and clean</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I had been using a different facial cleanser for years before learning about and trying this one. Now that I have been using for a couple of weeks the changes I can honestly say I will never go back.  It smelt and felt better immediately, and my skin feels better after using it too.&lt;br /&gt;I had a minor problem with the pump not working, emailed Rugged &amp; Dapper and they took care of the issue immediately.  Would recommend…</li>
    <li> This face wash is awesome. I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and plan to continue ordering this. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, leaves my face feeling so clean and refreshed! I love that organic ingredients are used, and you definitely get your money worth with a 7oz bottle. Every man should have this, also purchase the Rugged and Dapper moisturizer, very important after exfoliating your face.</li>
    <li> This is the best face scrub I have ever used! Feels wonderful on my face,  the oils and scrub combo leave my skin glowing</li>
    <li> Guys don&#x27;t need to smell like flower pedals. These are great products; I ended up buying all three of their available products.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he says &amp;#34;I&#x27;m happy with it. The scent is nice and it made my skin feel clean and smooth afterwards. It&#x27;s a good combo with the R&amp;D moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It itched my face and caused discomfort and dryness. Not happy with this purchase sadly. Below my expectations from what I had heard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working on getting my husband started on a good anti-aging regiment now that we&#x27;re no longer in our 20&#x27;s and I have to say I&#x27;ve been surprised by how quickly he has taken to it, especially since he&#x27;s never been one to use product other than a bar of soap. This cleanser and exfoliator is great for his skin and I&#x27;ve even given it a try and was pleasantly surprised how nice it feels and doesn&#x27;t dry us out. And only having high quality, natural ingredients in our house this fits in perfectly!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to one of the men in my life and asked him how he liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said &amp;#34;It has a natural non chemically smell that is pleasant. It works really well as a daily face wash without drying out my skin like other products do. The exfoliating grit is a bit too rough for my sensitive skin but overall I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle makes it really easy to use. Good product&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah you can tell he&#x27;s a guy. So many words lol.</li>
    <li> My husband usually doesn&#x27;t use a separate face cleanser, but after hearing good things about this brand, and seeing a special promotional offer for it I decided to order it and let him try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Upon unboxing, the black pump bottle looks so manly and classy. The pump dispensed quite a bit so he opted after first wash to just use about 1/2 a pump. It was more than enough power scrub cleanser for his face.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was awesome. We both liked it!&lt;br /&gt;The end result of his usage was he has soft smooth skin, and it did not look dry as it usually does. His face looked healthy and clean, and was so soft!&lt;br /&gt;He was very impressed with the quality. I love that this is Organic and there is also essential oil in the ingredients. I have really been getting into essential oils lately, and this product is very high quality! I will be looking forward to trying some of the other products from the Rugged and Dapper Men&#x27;s product line!</li>
    <li> Great product. Organic ingredients, no smell, is a good pre-shave treatment to make shaving easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through many face washes but I&#x27;d buy this one again anytime.  It really wakes me up and gives my face a smooth glow.  Ladies look out.</li>
    <li> Arrived before estimated delivery, and I frickin love this stuff! It really is meant for men and works great as a daily face wash. Smells great, cleans well.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband clean dirt very well I can&#x27;t stop kissing him.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face smooth but soft; doesn&#x27;t dry me out. Smells great.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews I decided to try this product as I got a facial recently and was told my skin would be cleaner if I used a better scrub/ exfoliator. I have been using Oxy daily facial scrub which is $3.50 per 5oz at Big Lots locally, and decided to upgrade... at almost $25 for 7oz this is significantly more expensive. As far as a packaging, the PUMP is horrible, it only goes up and down a very small amount and only dispenses a small portion so I need to pump the pump several times to get a dime size amount of product, whomever approved this pump should change jobs, it&#x27;s horrible, I&#x27;d rather have a squeeze tube or a longer displacement on the pump. As far as the chemical, it seems to be a good scrubbing compound, has no bad odor, and washes off pretty easily when using in the shower, however my skin does not feel as smooth or as clean as the fractionally priced Oxy daily cleanser I have been using. I used the R&amp;D product first and my skin was not smooth or feeling clean, I used the Oxy product right after as I was not satisfied and noticed an immediate difference, my skin was left much cleaner and smooth.. I&#x27;m glad I tried something different but I am highly disappointed in the products design and performance and feel it is a complete waste of money.. I&#x27;m feeling more raped and deceived than rugged and dapper.</li>
    <li> My husband is allergic to it. Will never order</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have tried. Not overly abrasive and does a good job before shaving.</li>
    <li> Really like how this feels on my face. Good face wash with good ingredients.</li>
    <li> Other than the volume mistake, it&#x27;s pretty decent face wash.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has helped a lot.  With my job I get a lot of dust and dirt on my face and this has completely solved my sporadic pimple problem.  Comes in a pump bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been one week, but my face feels smoother and notice it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend told me I need face wash. This had two of my favorite man words ( rugged &amp; dapper). I mean you can&#x27;t go wrong here, smells good, feels good, makes you look good. 10/10</li>
    <li> my hubby likes this ..he says it makes his face feel nice after working all day in the sun</li>
    <li> Excellent product that not only smells good, but is by far the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancé because he likes to use my skincare line. He loves it! The Rugged &amp; Dapper products make his skin so soft and it smells intoxicating!</li>
    <li> Works well. Smells weird.</li>
    <li> Rugged &amp; Dapper have the best products out there this facial scrub is perfect after a long day  working outside in a construction environment. This scrub has a decent scent and The right amount of grit to clean your face after a long days work.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be working well, I use in the morning while I shower and at night before bed. Skin is soft and doesn&#x27;t sry out.</li>
    <li> i gave this product a one star because I cannot for the life of me tell the difference between this 21 dollar product and the 4 dollar clean and clear morning burst bottle. They both have similar descriptions on the bottle, but have different fragrances, that&#x27;s about the only difference.</li>
    <li> im about to finish my first bottle, and its worth it. Face is cleaner, not as much redmarks or blackheads as before. My face is oil&#x27;y, and this make it feel so clean. I use it sometimes 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> Great face wash! Clears up my skin and I feel fresh after each wash.</li>
    <li> My husband really loves this product. He usually tries to secretly snag some of my face wash when in the shower...but I most always catch him. This is a great daily power scrub//facial cleanser that is ideal for all skin types. He tends to have really dry skin and struggles with psoriasis. This is a MANLY product that provides both a face wash, toner and exfoliator all in one. I love that it is made of all natural and organic ingredients such as aloe vera, vitamin C, willow bark and burdock root. I personally love the smell. Very manly and &amp;#34;strong man&amp;#34; smelling...if that could be a smell. And the consistency is nice which makes cleaning his face around his facial hair - easy. He says his face always feels so refreshed and happy after use. I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to receive and review this product! And he&#x27;s happy that he now has his OWN facial cleansing product.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I bought their moisturizer liked it so here I am leaving a review for for the cleansing scrub. It feels really good on my face, not to rough but gets the job done and I really like that it&#x27;s all organic. Packaging is cool to, I will buy this again for sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome daily power scrub facial cleanser! I have been using it every day since I got it, and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. My face feels refreshed after every use. Even a few family members and friends have noticed how clear my skin has gotten, and they have been asking if I am using something new. I can&#x27;t help but rave about this product and it&#x27;s natural and organic ingredients. Highly recommended for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried more than my fair share. Obviously skincare products are hit or miss depending on your skin type, skin sensitivity, etc. but this product has really worked wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person who has relatively oily skin (Greek skin!), I was looking for a cleanser that would also work as an exfoliator but did not include the harsh chemicals that so many mainstream cleansers contain. Rugged &amp; Dapper is a brand that I strongly recommend to any male because their products are derived from natural ingredients and are non-irritating and suitable for almost any skin type. There&#x27;s a reason this company has garnered so many positive reviews over such a short period of time, their products actually work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the ultimate cleanser for any male because it provides 3 crucial steps in 1 simple cleanser (cleanser, exfoliator, toner). Nobody likes a multi-step skincare regiment (especially males) and Rugged &amp; Dapper seems to get that. They deliver a superior cleanser that does everything it claims and more. As an added bonus, the cleanser smells great and truly &amp;#34;energizes&amp;#34; your face when using it (I use once in the morning and once before bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product in conjunction with their Age + Damage Defense Facial Moisturizer. It&#x27;s quite a 1-2 punch! Your face will thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I naturally have an oily face and by using this facial cleanser followed by their moisturizer my face feels clean and fresh. I do construction and even my co workers have noticed that I look better! Thanks Rugged &amp; Dapper!!!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I only recentrly started implemendting a facial care routine, and this cleanser is the backbone! My face feels so clean and fresh when im done, without drying it out too much. And the scent it leaves is just amazing.</li>
    <li> Just as I did with the Rugged &amp; Dapper moisturizer, I purchased the cleanser for my husband and have ended up stealing it from him because I love it so much! Great product, love the fresh smell and smooth feeling after a wash without the tight skin/dryness that some cleansers leave behind.  We&#x27;ll be ordering more so we both have our own stash!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this face cleanser and I love that he is no longer using mine! He always comes home from work with a dirty face which ends up creating breakouts because of all the dirt in his pores. This stuff is great. It&#x27;s a cleanser, toner, and exfoliator in one. It goes down into the pores to remove the dirt and oil that accumulates in a 10 hour work day. It has made his face softer and smoother in just the past few days of using it. This product is so convenient because as a man, he hates using multiple products. He just likes a quick and easy face wash. This is perfect for a man like him! It has natural and organic ingredients like aloe vera, vitamin C, willow bark, burdock root, AND tea tree oil. It&#x27;s hydrating, nourishing, and helps fight acne breakouts! Thank you Rugged &amp; Dapper for making such an awesome facial cleanser for my husband! *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
