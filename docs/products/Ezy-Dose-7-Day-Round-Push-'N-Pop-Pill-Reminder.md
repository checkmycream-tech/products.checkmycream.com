      <li>Can give can broke very easily .</li>
      <li>Out of the pill box I purchase this is by far the best one.</li>
      <li>Then when I tried to return it, the shipping would have been more then the item.</li>
      <li>Works ok, kind of cheap plastic</li>
      <li>with this she&#x27;ll never forget again :)</li>
      <li>I had a similar product that had a smooth top and it could be turned to the appropriate day (I loved it)</li>
      <li>I filled it with pills and put it in my purse.</li>
      <li>This holder holds all pills securely.</li>
      <li>This one holds more pills than you would think at first look.</li>
      <li>Super cheap plastic holder.....</li>
      <li>This is a great little pill container.</li>
      <li>However, the letters for the days of the week rubbed off pretty quickly and then the latch stopped working.  </li>
      <li>This is a cute pill container, I like the design, and the individual compartments are nice and big.</li>
      <li>It is great however for storing the larger vitamins one may wish to use this for however it was purchased for much smaller pills.  </li>
      <li>Looked more solid in the picture, so</li>
      <li>First time using it, one of the tabs broke off so it no longer stays</li>

      <li>If you take a huge multivitamin every day, they will easily fit in here, along with other, smaller pills.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also not very pretty; I got a greenish bluish color that is not as nice looking as the blue one displayed in the picture.    </li>
      <li>The hinges or the compartment locks eventually give way, but that is normal use.</li>
      <li>Used every day and even taken on trips and it still works as new.</li>
      <li>So handy for your daily pills and small.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall exactly how long I had it before I started having problems.  </li>
      <li>Great space however poorly made will not last long</li>
      <li>Sadly, I do not think it will last long.</li>
      <li>I lost my original one and looked for another to replace it and bought this one; it is a little different with plastic tabs that stick up and a rubber center so it can be opened.  </li>
      <li>This item is bigger than I thought it would be (about 4&#x27;&#x27; in diameter) and each little lid seems pretty flimsy...</li>

<li> and you have to push the center to open it.</li>
<li> I got this to use for travel as I travel several days a week but the little plastic clips that hold the individual covers closed broke off...</li>
<li> The mechanism in the middle where you push down does not always release the doors.</li>
<li> My previous holder would open &amp; all my pills would fall out.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it is much larger than I pictured.  </li>
<li> not sure how long it will last.</li>
<li> but you being rough with it.</li>
<li> Honestly it would be difficult to produce this product poorly, it is a plastic shell with clips for the separate containers.  </li>
<li> Bought several of these and have given them as small presents.  </li>
<li> I also found an individual compartment difficult to open even with the rubber button in the middle.  </li>
<li> Really, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
<li> it hasn&#x27;t broken on my yet (I just got it maybe a month ago), but I think it won&#x27;t last long.  </li>
<li> No broken tabs or anything else has gone wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> You have to fiddle with it a little.</li>
<li> she has a heart condition and has to take a pill everyday for the rest of her life...</li>
<li> I wanted something small I could put in my purse, not a huge disc.</li>
<li> my friends said im lazy taking my vitamins</li>
<li> Not good wuality</li>
<li> I was so disappointed when the item came and it was so much bigger then the description.</li>
<li> I have had this pill container now for 3 years and not one tab has broken.</li>
<li> Two of the seven days failed to snap shut.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just inconvenient to keep ordering them and paying shipping besides.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s just mildly annoying to me, but it could be a problem for arthritic hands.</li>
<li> totally worthless.  </li>
<li> I was very disappointed when I received this.</li>

    <li> I had a similar product that had a smooth top and it could be turned to the appropriate day (I loved it); I used it for the different types of pills I take or may need while I am away from home-it was perfect for my purse, and I had it for years.      I lost my original one and looked for another to replace it and bought this one; it is a little different with plastic tabs that stick up and a rubber center so it can be opened.  I filled it with pills and put it in my purse. Within a couple of days, one tab broke off and the pills were all over.  I also found an individual compartment difficult to open even with the rubber button in the middle.  I still have it and I am still using it, but if I could find the kind I had before I would switch in a heartbeat.    I still find it convenient, but it does have its shortcomings.</li>
    <li> Very handy pill case.</li>
    <li> Super cheap plastic holder.....but it will do for now until a tab breaks.  Looked more solid in the picture, so not sure how long it will last.</li>
    <li> This item is bigger than I thought it would be (about 4&#x27;&#x27; in diameter) and each little lid seems pretty flimsy...it hasn&#x27;t broken on my yet (I just got it maybe a month ago), but I think it won&#x27;t last long.  It&#x27;s also not very pretty; I got a greenish bluish color that is not as nice looking as the blue one displayed in the picture.    Update: One of the lids broke off after about 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> This is a great little pill container. I take several medications (including a huge calcium pill) and this one holds them all. I had looked all around to find just this type of design. I take it to work with me and keep it in my drawer all week and take my pills daily. I like that it clicks shut and you have to push the center to open it. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Can give can broke very easily . Not good wuality</li>
    <li> Great space however poorly made will not last long</li>
    <li> Bought several of these and have given them as small presents.  So handy for your daily pills and small.</li>
    <li> I have had this pill container now for 3 years and not one tab has broken. I have used this daily and have also taken it on trips, inside my bags. I take several pills each day and vitamins as well and this holds them all in one compartment for each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you break a tab, then its not the pill container but you being rough with it. As I said, I have had mine now for 3 years. Used every day and even taken on trips and it still works as new. No broken tabs or anything else has gone wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from another seller and that&#x27;s why its not showing verified purchase but if you look in my reviews you will find it.</li>
    <li> i am grew up drinking milo n ovaltine&lt;br /&gt;cuz its fortified w/ vits n minerals&lt;br /&gt;lately my friends said im lazy taking my vitamins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i bought this&lt;br /&gt;fill it once a week&lt;br /&gt;bring to my office mon-fri&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bring to my purse sat-sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now i take my vitamins daily : -)</li>
    <li> Out of the pill box I purchase this is by far the best one. The  days of the week are big enough to see. Although  I wish the covers are lighter so you can see the pills.</li>
    <li> This item is a good bargain. I didn&#x27;t want the standard pill box and the round shape fits very nicely on my nightstand.</li>
    <li> This is a cute pill container, I like the design, and the individual compartments are nice and big. If you take a huge multivitamin every day, they will easily fit in here, along with other, smaller pills. Sadly, I do not think it will last long. The mechanism in the middle where you push down does not always release the doors. It is not well made. You have to fiddle with it a little. It&#x27;s just mildly annoying to me, but it could be a problem for arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received this. Two of the seven days failed to snap shut. It simply didn&#x27;t work.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Honestly it would be difficult to produce this product poorly, it is a plastic shell with clips for the separate containers.  My only complaint is that it is much larger than I pictured.  It is great however for storing the larger vitamins one may wish to use this for however it was purchased for much smaller pills.  Regardless, the product works great just wish it was not as bulky as it is.</li>
    <li> This was a great size for what I needed.  However, the letters for the days of the week rubbed off pretty quickly and then the latch stopped working.  I don&#x27;t recall exactly how long I had it before I started having problems.  Really, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive so I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath for it to last years and years...it&#x27;s just inconvenient to keep ordering them and paying shipping besides.  Since then, I&#x27;ve just purchased these at the store.</li>
    <li> Great size, easy to use. I have 2 of them</li>
    <li> First time using it, one of the tabs broke off so it no longer stays shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a piece of garbage...</li>
    <li> This one holds more pills than you would think at first look. I have used this kind for years and it has always stayed closed in my suitcase or when dropped. The hinges or the compartment locks eventually give way, but that is normal use.</li>
    <li> I got this to use for travel as I travel several days a week but the little plastic clips that hold the individual covers closed broke off...item can&#x27;t be used.......don&#x27;t use this if you travel</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister... she has a heart condition and has to take a pill everyday for the rest of her life... the thing is, sometimes she forgets if she took it or not... with this she&#x27;ll never forget again :)</li>
    <li> I love this pill holder! My previous holder would open &amp; all my pills would fall out. This holder holds all pills securely.</li>
    <li> Great! But sometimes opens and spills in my purse. If they could fix that problem it would be perfect</li>
    <li> Great for travel since it locks and the pills don&#x27;t spill.</li>
    <li> Works ok, kind of cheap plastic but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> two of the lids broke up with 2 months.  totally worthless.  would not even consider buying again.  the one i had before lasted for years</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when the item came and it was so much bigger then the description. I wanted something small I could put in my purse, not a huge disc. Then when I tried to return it, the shipping would have been more then the item. Ugh.</li>
