<li> Seriously, I just bought the VS Amber Romance lotion because I heard that it&#x27;s a really good bug repellent (although it does smell quite nice).  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as quenching to dry as skin as a proper lotion is, but it works if that&#x27;s all you have.  </li>
<li> Usually, I would be inundated with bugs on or near my person after just seconds of sitting outside, but not this time!  </li>
<li> bottle at Victoria Secret for $4 first</li>
<li> I wear this scent every single day!</li>
<li> I left my porch lights on for a few hours so the bugs would gravitate towards the lights.  </li>
<li> Although the smell dies down somewhat, it still stays on a very long time.</li>
<li> and it lasts all day layered with the other products of Amber Romance.</li>
<li> Be careful ladies!!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> For hawaiian friend who loves the products but hates the prices at local Victoria Secret.</li>
<li> but NOT ONE even landed on me, much less bit me!  </li>
<li> Some things are hard to find here in Kuwait</li>
<li> Unbelievable!  </li>
<li> I also saw an interview with Anna Kendrick and she said fishermen used it as insect repellent, that you would see bottles and bottle of it empty in boats.</li>
<li> I was not really impressed with the smell.  </li>

    <li> Excellent Good product</li>
    <li> Just got my order and put some on... and this is not Amber Romance. It smells plasticky as though a portion of real Amber Romance was mixed with cheap unscented lotion. I know real Amber Romance and this isn&#x27;t it. I thought I might have been able to save some time ordering this online and not having to go to the mall, but I will be going there to get the real deal.</li>
    <li> This was on someone&#x27;s Christmas list and I was thrilled that I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall and be told they were out of it</li>

    <li> This is wonderful smell!  It has a warm smell to it.  I had a guy come up to me and ask me what I was wearing?  I told him and he was like oh, it smells really good!  I also read after purchasing this that Amber is a very alluring/sensational scent to people.  I also saw an interview with Anna Kendrick and she said fishermen used it as insect repellent, that you would see bottles and bottle of it empty in boats.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I just bought the VS Amber Romance lotion because I heard that it&#x27;s a really good bug repellent (although it does smell quite nice).  I used it on my arms and legs this afternoon.  This evening I decided to test it.  I left my porch lights on for a few hours so the bugs would gravitate towards the lights.  So I go sit outside to enjoy the cooler night air.  Usually, I would be inundated with bugs on or near my person after just seconds of sitting outside, but not this time!  There were many, many bugs out there tonight (mosquitoes, gnats, junebugs, etc.) but NOT ONE even landed on me, much less bit me!  Unbelievable!  This stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s not as quenching to dry as skin as a proper lotion is, but it works if that&#x27;s all you have.  The smell is potent but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I recommend them forever! Excellent seller! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> got it gave it to my wife as a Christmas gift will buy it again please keep it in stock  thank you</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she was so pleased with it, she loves the smell and smoothness of the lotion, Thanks!</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TOO</li>
    <li> Just as expected :) . My girlfriend loved it. I will probably buy again in the future. So far, victoria secret is doing pretty good.</li>
    <li> I wear this scent every single day! It&#x27;s my absolute favorite. Its sleek and sexy and makes my skin super soft</li>
    <li> I will forever love amber romance. It is an oldie but goodie and the best original fragrance from vici seeks. I have been using it for about 10 years and I always go back to it. It has warm notes of vanilla, amber, kinda woodsy, I love warm scents, not fruity at all.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I love the scent, smells really good, good price....I recomend it to all the amazon comunity..It is good!!</li>
    <li> good seller, and excellent product</li>
    <li> Love the smell for this lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this one in particular because it has a hint of so many different smells. Nice and soft. Not to perfumy.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so good.  It is light and airy and clean smelling.  Although the smell dies down somewhat, it still stays on a very long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance for the price because I had never smelled it before. Now that I have purchased it I like it.</li>
    <li> If you put on this scent lovemaking will ensue. Be careful ladies!! Smell reminds me of fire and ice by Revlon.</li>
    <li> She told me she wanted something romance and I wasn&#x27;t sure what she said so this was the first thing I found, hoped I was right. Later on I realized she meant ralph lauren purfume romance, but I ended up getting that to. She said she liked this lotion as well.</li>
    <li> love it , it smells great.... :)  : ): ) :) : ) :) : ) :) : ): )</li>
    <li> Love the  scent--not too strong!  I bought a much smaller 2 oz. bottle at Victoria Secret for $4 first so this was a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and it has become her favorite. She loves the fragrence and it moisturizes but does not leave a greasy feeling afterwords. Some things are hard to find here in Kuwait so it&#x27;s great that Amazon is around to offer these nice things. She has tried other lotions of course but Victoria&#x27;s Secret offers wonderful products and this one in particular is very nice. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> VS products never disappoint</li>
    <li> The lotion itself is quality. The scent is not my favorite, but I suppose that is what I get for ordering a scent I&#x27;ve never smelled online.</li>
    <li> excelente lo recomiendo ampliamente, el pedido se recibio en tiempo record en perfectas condiciones, es confiable y seguro muy bueno</li>
    <li> It was just okay. I was not really impressed with the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t last and the lotion was not what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> This is not VS Amber Romance! SCAM!! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Bottles look like the real thing but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> The packed with some heavier parts and compressed and boto all, but I presume that it is not your fault, it was liberty express what I package where it should thanks from Venezuela</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It has a super light scent and adds tons of moisture to my skin without irritating it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell,and the delivery was right on time,iwill order again.</li>
    <li> I acutally bought this product for myself to get rid of gnats of all things. I hunt alot and there were no remedies for gnats which would about carry us off at times. This stuff works.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this lotion. I use this lotion forever and I always like more and more. It is very hydratating.</li>
    <li> For hawaiian friend who loves the products but hates the prices at local Victoria Secret.</li>
    <li> I dont know what happened but I used to really like this scent. I either grew out of it or they changed it somehow. Not for me.</li>
