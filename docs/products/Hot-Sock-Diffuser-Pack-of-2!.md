<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is not enough elastic to keep the diffuser on the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Perfect diffuser and takes up no space!</li>
    <li> I bought this to take on a trip because I wanted to travel light and I figured it would fit the hotel room hair dryer. I tried it out at home first and it worked just as well as the plastic diffuser that came with my hair dryer. It did move around a little but it worked. Also very easy to pack.</li>
    <li> The Hot Sock is so much easier to use and lighter than a traditional difuser.  And, it takes up much less room in the suitcase.  I am so glad my hair dresser introduced me to it.</li>
    <li> This works very well, nice and light. easy to travel with as well.  Seems to hold the curl more than the hard plastic diffuser.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair which I only blow-dry during the winter.  These are great and don&#x27;t get as hot as a regular diffuser.  They stay on the front of my Babyliss Carrera hairdryer.  A different diffuser that I purchased said it was universal and did not stay on.  For the money, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well but the elastic should be tighter. They frequently fly off the end of the hairdryer and end up across the room. Good for travel as the hard plastic diffuser that come with the hair dryer take up too much room.</li>
    <li> great diffuser  works as it should</li>
    <li> Always a good product!</li>
    <li> For traveling with a carry on this cannot be beat. Admittedly not as good as the one I use at home but worked quite well in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It works OK, but is a little awkward to use. Goes  on and off hair dryer easily.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money - at a very reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Just as described and is so much better than dragging a hair dryer with diffuser attachment with me when traveling.</li>
    <li> Love the Hot Socks - great to travel with - easy to pack -&lt;br /&gt;does not make hair dryer so heavy - like using a diffuser attachment</li>
    <li> Love these things for drying my curly hair!!</li>
    <li> This product is so Awesome for my curly hair!  Never leave home with  out it! Give it try if you havent yet!</li>
    <li> Hot sock is a very practical and light diffuser that can travel with you anywhere! It is resistant and is able of dominating my crazy curly hair! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Bought my first one from my hair stylist but it finally stretched so much I couldn&#x27;t keep it on dryer.  She didn&#x27;t have anymore but told me to look at amazon and get one there and it would be cheaper than hers since she would not have to put a markup on it.  Bought 2 since I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Best curls ever!</li>
    <li> My thinning hair does not need a tornado for styling and drying.  These &amp;#34;Hot Socks&amp;#34; help create a gentle stream of warm -- not hot -- air which quite quickly helps put my short style into place.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I like this better than using a diffuser. I ordered  2 and I&#x27;m glad I did. I can leave 1 at home and the other in my travel bag. Fits on my hair dryer and doesn&#x27;t pop off at all.</li>
    <li> Works great for keeping curly hair from getting frizzy when drying it.</li>
    <li> Works great! I like it better than a finger diffuser for heating my hair without blowing it all over the place. My hair stylist introduced these to me, they really help my hair hold the curl.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and travels well without popping off as many of the diffusers do on even professional hair dryers.</li>
    <li> This product work just as well as my huge, clunky, plastic diffuser. It will be a really good buy for curly haired gals who travel.</li>
    <li> Great item! No more bulky universal hard diffusers, love this!!</li>
    <li> This is great for traveling and for a quick blow out.  Probably not ideal for those that REALLY want to get their hair perfect though.  It often blows off the end of my blow dryer, which can be frustrating. All in all though, it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for many years, so long that it actually had started to deteriorate on the end where the heat comes through.  I wasn&#x27;t even sure they still made these anymore it had been so long.  But sure enough, they do still make them and they haven&#x27;t changed a bit, which is a good thing.  Not New  &amp; Improved unnecessarily like so many other good things that don&#x27;t need changing.  But I digress . . .  was a good product then and is still a good product.  Worth spending $6 every 10 years or so for a new one :-)</li>
    <li> Sturdy soft foam, &amp;#34;sock-like&amp;#34; diffuser attachment.  Holds firmly onto the oval shaped &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; of my blow-dryer, where a hard plastic diffuser would not work.  The 2-pack is a good idea; one for home and one for travel.</li>
    <li> They are the best so hard to find</li>
    <li> Received my hot sock diffuser very quickly and have used it daily.  Great for curly hair so it does not frizz.</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much, I bought some for family and friends.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep from getting frizzy hair..</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as my large bulky diffuser but it was perfect for traveling. I&#x27;ll take these with me wherever I go from now on.</li>
    <li> This item is identical to the one I purchased at the salon but I was able to get 2 for the price of one.  That&#x27;s a good thing since I must have forgotten mine at a hotel somewhere while traveling.</li>
    <li> I have used these diffusers for years.  They are soft so it is easy to store and pack my hairdryer with the HS on it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the elastic eventually wears out and the HS goes shooting across the room when I am drying my hair.  I discovered that it will stick very well to the &#x27;over&#x27; hairspray that ends up on the hairdryer.  I just wet the sticky hairspray with a drop of water and push the hot sock on as far as it will go.  I got an extra year or two of use this way from the last one I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price even if you have to pay shipping.  They are hard to find in stores and I paid $10 plus tax on the last one.  I received my diffusers from this company very quickly.</li>
    <li> These work very well.  Had another one that has lasted years. Finally wore out last one. Easy to store and pack.</li>
    <li> great price for the two pack.  Good quality and much cheaper than I could have gotten them at my local store.</li>
    <li> I had a Hot Sock years ago and loved it as a simple diffuser that took little space - great for travel.  This time, I ordered two.  I tried them both, but could not stand the strong smell of burning plastics.  I felt that it must be extremely harmful to breath.  The entire bathroom smelled of this plastic, despite opening the windows.  I tried to wash them to see if they might lose the toxic smell, but it does not wash off.  My conclusion is that it is better to stick with a hard diffuser than to risk breathing fumes that might very likely be carcinogenic.</li>
    <li> I purchased these hot socks specifically for my Italy vacation as I did not want to bring a bulky diffuser.  The hot sock worked amazingly well and I am very happy with my purchase! My curly hair was not frizzy at all.  More than anything it defined my curls and my hair looked so nice and shiny even in the hot weather.  I highly recommend this product especially if you are going on vacation...making your luggage way lighter. Love love love</li>
    <li> I love these diffuser.  They work great on my wavy hair and they take no room in your luggage or even in your vanity!</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what I was looking for and with super fast shipping !!</li>
    <li> Worked as described. Good price. Gave my naturally wavy curl and volume after some product and using my hands to scrunch it as I dried it. I find it much easier and convenient than those larger ones. I have a t3 and it for the nozzle perfectly with no issues of blowing off with high speeds.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually like the big plastic diffusers (too bulky, don&#x27;t travel well), but since I have curly hair, I can&#x27;t use a hair dryer without one or my hair looks like a rats nest after a tornado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can resist the temptation to wiggle your dryer all over the place, this does a good job of keeping your hair from getting frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to my technique: I put product into soaking wet hair, then squeezed out the excess water with a microfiber towel. Then, I bent forward and used long, SLOW passes over my hair. To get to the roots at the crown, I just separated my hair at the part (still bending forward), slipped the hot sock into the part, and let it rest there until it was mostly dry. I got lots of volume and minimal frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a similar product years ago and couldn&#x27;t find another one anywhere, so I was happy to see this on Amazon when I was looking for another diffuser. I bought a two pack, so I could toss one into my always prepped travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on 2 days with Prime.</li>
    <li> After a few uses I was taking it off the dryer and it ripped. Very disappointed! I had purchased one a few years ago from my hairdresser and it held up until a few months ago but it never ripped.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for travel or anytime I&#x27;m away from home and I need to dry my hair.  Fits on any dryer.</li>
    <li> These are great.  The only diffuser I could find in local stores were big &amp; plastic, not easy to pack.  I use one at home &amp; keep the 2nd one in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, this diffuser works great. I have a really expensive  one, but this Hot Sock is better.</li>
    <li> I needed an easy to use diffuser to travel with; this did the job. It slid off the nozzle of my hair dryer, but I used a hair tie to secure it with so it was fine. It did the job and didn&#x27;t add bulk or weight to my luggage.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this and you have curly hair it&#x27;s worth it!  This is the replacement for one I have had for a couple of years, wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a diffuser that could be used universally as I travel A LOT- esp. internationally and often cannot use my own hair dryer. I spent a lot of time researching, ordering, returning various brands.  I was very skeptical about this product after reading the reviews.  After using it daily both on my hair as well as my daughter&#x27;s, I can say that it is great.  I love how easy and portable this is.  It is not like a traditional diffuser where you lay your hair on it - you hold this about an inch away from your head.  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised and arrived in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Works well on my hairdryer to tame my frizzy hair.  Also convenient to store.  Received two and gave one to my sister!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t Too Sure How This Product Would Work But Was Very Happy When I Tried It. The Sock Fits Any Blow Dryer And Minimizes The Heat For Less Damage While Still Drying Your Hair! Loved It!</li>
    <li> Great product and good value for price paid for diffusers!</li>
    <li> Fits on my dryer and stays put.  I particularly like this product for travel.  I don&#x27;t have to pack a large diffuser because this works almost as well.</li>
    <li> Love these things. They have worked great and last for years.&lt;br /&gt;I had my old one for at least 6+ years</li>
    <li> Great for travel!  Pack flat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
    <li> I have curly/frizzy long italian hair and have been searching for a universal diffuser that I could use with the cheap hair dryers that are provided to us at my local gym and at hotels while traveling. I have purchased several other &amp;#34;universal hard plastic diffusers (conair) and others that weren&#x27;t &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; as advertised. I thought I would give this one a try. First off, the picture doesn&#x27;t really show the material very well. It is actually a very cheap foam/mesh sock like cover that is supposed to fit &amp;#34;securely&amp;#34; over any diffuser. Well, it fits over any diffuser alright, because it doesn&#x27;t have a secure elastic band on the end and the first time I used it, it slipped right off the hair dryer! I brought a rubber band with me the second time and wrapped it around the sock and it did stay on, however it does not work nearly as well as the hard plastic diffusers. I tried the silicone universal diffusers but they were very hard to pull over the nozzle of some of brands making them not truly universal.  I found the conair tourmaline universal diffuser to work the best, however it does not fit all brands of hair dryers and does slip off leaving you to hold your hair dryer at one angle to keep it from falling off. I have not found a single diffuser that actually works great and is universal. The hot sock was a waste of $10</li>
    <li> Slides off my hairdryer so not for me.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair kinda frizzy, I think it&#x27;s causing the material although it&#x27;s great for traveling!</li>
    <li> love how its not bulky and expensive like plastic diffusers.</li>
    <li> Works better in theory.</li>
    <li> These are the best diffusers around. They fit any dryer and let just enough heat and air through without being too forceful like some others are.</li>
    <li> I have beautiful curly hair that looks like a million buck when I use a regular diffuser. I bought this because I was traveling for a month and didn&#x27;t want to pack the chuncky, plastic diffuser. This did not work for me. It didn&#x27;t do anything, it was basically like I was using the cheap hotel blow drier alone - same result. I tested it on my nice blow dryer when I got home to see if the fault was with the blow dryer, not the hot sock, but again - terrible results. Next oversees trip I take, I am packing my actual diffuser, not his garbage.</li>
    <li> Wish they were cheaper but work so well as long as you have the heat setting low or medium or they burn holes in them. Still like them though.</li>
    <li> The sock works great as a diffuser. My wife uses it on vacation and business trips.</li>
    <li> Works great, even fits on my travel dryer.</li>
    <li> Good purchase. It slips off my dryer at times but I guess it&#x27;s my dryer style.</li>
    <li> Have used Hot Sock Diffusers for 8 years and they are the best diffusers.  If the diffuser does not quite fit the nozzle, just put an elastic around the nozzle.</li>
    <li> Fits any blow dryer - works great</li>
    <li> Curly hair...LOVE this. Works well without too much air which would blow out the curls. Great that there are 2 in the package.</li>
    <li> I travel for a living and this works..It is very easy  to use and easy to pack and take with you and fits all hotel hair driers ....Love it</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Imagine this-I paid my former hairdresser over $25 for ONE of these several years ago. The exact same item! That one finally bit the dust and I came straight to Amazon to see if I could replace it. What a surprise! Yes, I could replace it and at a most reasonable price. These are great little diffusers that stretch over the end of a hair dryer. So much handier than the rigid plastic kind.</li>
    <li> I bought my original Hot Sock Diffuser when I was 19 or 20 (I&#x27;m 33 now) and just needed to replace it for the first time. Great for traveling or every day use and much easier to use than the huge clunky diffusers that come with the hair dryers.</li>
    <li> very nice price for two...</li>
    <li> My wife loves the Sock Diffuser</li>
    <li> They work but not as well as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; diffuser. Good for a tight spot. Glad I have one but won&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> Finally a trick so I can use the hair dryers in hotel rooms!  I have a lot of curly hair and hotel hair dryers do nothing for me.  My own hair dryer &amp; diffuser is too large to travel with so a friend recommended this product.  Funky smell for the first couple of uses but that goes away.  I have only used this at one particular hotel (on multiple occasions) and I learned that I need to have the hair dryer on high for it to really work.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. However, it just takes your hair twice as long to dry. I nixed it 2 minutes into drying my hair, i felt like it was taking too long to dry. On the bright side, this product did arrive on time and the packaging was in great condition.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work, and it&#x27;s a pain to drag along a hair dryer and clunky diffuser attachment when I&#x27;m trying to pack lightly. It&#x27;s also a pain using a hotel hair dryer and ending up with hair big enough for you to pass as an 80&#x27;s rocker.  These bad boys are convenient to pack, fit nicely over any hotel dryer, and help me to achieve nice, frizz-free, 80&#x27;s-free curls.  Definitely recommend to anyone who travels a lot.</li>
    <li> This is great product for drying curley or wavey hair. Fits over the end of your blow dryer. Dries your curls or wavey hair without drying them out. I ordered 2 because I wanted my daughter to enjoy the benefit of Sock Diffuser.</li>
    <li> LOVE these.  They fit in my small travel bag perfectly and fit any hotel dryer.  Won&#x27;t travel without them.</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair and need a diffuser if I want good things to happen when using a blow dryer, unfortunately i don&#x27;t really like to pack one around with me when travelling or to the gym. This however works great, I can put it on any size blow dryer and it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my bag.</li>
    <li> they work as always, this was the best price I could find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;says 8 more words are required&amp;#34; two more</li>
    <li> I love these diffusers. I had previously boughten one years ago and needed to replace my old one. I can travel and just shove it in my bag. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and have to take all my tools where I go so love the convenience of them fitting on all types of dryers. I&#x27;ve had clients order them because they love mine.</li>
    <li> Works great and helps reduce frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in the past and it worked great then.  So the problem could be that my blow dryer has a narrower nozzle than my old dryer.  But these that I recently ordered don&#x27;t fit tightly enough on my dryer, so they just blow off.</li>
    <li> The price for 2 definitely didn&#x27;t hurt! I have super curly hair and I usually keep it shaved or pixie short.  I&#x27;m growing it out and needed a diffuser for my hair dryer, but didn&#x27;t want to drop a lot of money on one.  These were perfect.  I only needed one of them so the second one is stored away until I magically lose the first one.</li>
    <li> Super price, last a very long time. I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, works great for very curly hair.</li>
    <li> packs flat.  works on all my hairdryers even travel hairdryers.  it was a good purchase.  Smelled a bit funky when I took it out of the box, but that didn&#x27;t end up being a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find these Hot Sock Diffusers locally, but couldn&#x27;t.  Thrilled to find them on Amazon, and that it comes in a 2 pack!  I keep one in my suitcase cause I travel a lot.  I have shoulder length naturally curly hair, and only have to partially dry it when I use a Hot Sock and I get tons of curls.  It is a &#x27;curly-haired girls&#x27; best friend!!</li>
    <li> Great for travel.  works as well as my big bulky diffuser.</li>
    <li> Works great! &#x3D;) Keeps my wave/curls in without getting frizzy or blowing them straight. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  I can put this on my blow dryer, then put it on high heat, and dry my hair without my hair going every which way!  The mouth of my dryer is pretty large and it fits it just fine.</li>
    <li> I love the Hot Sock Diffuser.  Keep them coming.</li>
    <li> I bought these along with the mitt diffuser and I love both.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service, great price.</li>
