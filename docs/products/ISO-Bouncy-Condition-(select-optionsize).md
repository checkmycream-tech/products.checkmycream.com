      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re wanting a nice smelling product do not buy this!</li>
      <li>The price was really good</li>
      <li>The conditioner is good....</li>
      <li>I have always had great success with ISO products.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I do love how it works though.  </li>
      <li>But Bouncy Cream is meant for that purpose so it might be better...</li>
      <li>Nice light conditioner</li>
      <li>The item came sealed up and safe in the box.</li>
      <li>Ok, so I thought this was \\&quot;Bouncy</li>
      <li>I have bought this shampoo before and love it.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite conditioning product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lead to crispiness or flaking, and it has an even better hold than mousse.  </li>
      <li>I love Bouncy Cream</li>
      <li>It has a great balance of moisture and protein and it leaves my hair looking great every single day!!  </li>
      <li>and it has a nice clean scent.</li>
      <li>Works just fine on my curly, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Since using this conditioner I have noticed a HUGE difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to find it and in such a big size for a great price!</li>
      <li>Creme\\&quot; when I wrote the review so I used the product without rinsing it out and it actually still worked great as a hair product to keep my curls held in place (even though I didn&#x27;t rinse it out)...  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel light and keeps my curls in tack with out falling out and getting frizzy.</li>
      <li>I guess I am one of the lucky ones.  </li>
      <li>so definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the right one.</li>
      <li>There is no other product I have found that is better for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Bouncy condition helps me get a nice curl and keeps it from looking dry.  </li>
      <li>and it really helps define my curl pattern.  </li>
      <li>It is very noticeable between this conditioner and the cheaper curly conditioners you buy at a drugstore.</li>
      <li>Really works on my curly,  wavy,  frizz prone hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to mousse users.  </li>
      <li>Putting too much in can make your hair look a bit wet, but you need enough to de-frizz, so it takes some trial and error to get the quantity right.    </li>
      <li>I use a little everyday, and I love that my curls are not frizzy, and fall really well.</li>
      <li>but the smell is strongly chemical and hard to get over</li>
      <li>It defines and separates curls like no other product.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft,  at least on the first day of shampooing.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and fine and this product give my hair a lot of volume and curl</li>

    <li> Since using this conditioner I have noticed a HUGE difference in my hair. My hair is ridiculously curly now. It is very noticeable between this conditioner and the cheaper curly conditioners you buy at a drugstore. The only reason this is not getting 5 stars which it deserves is because it STINKS! I&#x27;m not even exaggerating. Every time I put this stuff in my hair, I get a whiff of it and it smells so bad! So if you&#x27;re wanting a nice smelling product do not buy this! But if you can get passed the horrible smell you will love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product to mousse users.  It doesn&#x27;t lead to crispiness or flaking, and it has an even better hold than mousse.  Can be used to create twists in curly hair to eliminate frizz.   Putting too much in can make your hair look a bit wet, but you need enough to de-frizz, so it takes some trial and error to get the quantity right.    Update:  Ok, so I thought this was \\&quot;Bouncy Creme\\&quot; when I wrote the review so I used the product without rinsing it out and it actually still worked great as a hair product to keep my curls held in place (even though I didn&#x27;t rinse it out)...  But Bouncy Cream is meant for that purpose so it might be better... (though I didn&#x27;t notice the difference when I bought and used this conditioner to replace my bouncy creme).</li>
    <li> I have bought this shampoo before and love it. I have black long curly hair. The shampoo and conditioner makes my hair feel light and keeps my curls in tack with out falling out and getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is good....but the smell is strongly chemical and hard to get over</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner ever!!  I co-wash with it daily and it really helps define my curl pattern.  It has a great balance of moisture and protein and it leaves my hair looking great every single day!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that can be straightened or curled.  I guess I am one of the lucky ones.  Bouncy condition helps me get a nice curl and keeps it from looking dry.  The price was really good so definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioning product. I use a little everyday, and I love that my curls are not frizzy, and fall really well.</li>
    <li> I have always had great success with ISO products.  I use this product all the time and would recommend it.  My hair is thin and fine and this product give my hair a lot of volume and curl</li>
    <li> There is no other product I have found that is better for curly hair.  It defines and separates curls like no other product.</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time, it helps keep the frizzies at bay and it has a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner! I have thick curly hair and this product tames it. Great stuff. Keeps curls beautiful without frizz. Love it</li>
    <li> Nice light conditioner</li>
    <li> makes my curly hair feel great! pairs great with iso bouncy shampoo. wish there would have been a pump included.</li>
    <li> The best for my curly hair!</li>
    <li> I just wrote a review for ISO&#x27;s Curl Defining Shampoo that included ISO&#x27;s Curl Defining Conditioner. They both work well, but they work best together. I&#x27;ve been using the pair together now for years and haven&#x27;t needed to find a replacement product. My stubborn curls have never been helped by any shampoo or conditioner, until I found ISO.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed with the conditioning ability for my thick, fine curls. I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for the right one. NO SLIP at all for detangling.</li>
    <li> Not sure what hair type this is for but I have long ringlet curly hair and it made my curls flat, dry, and frizzy which no conditioner has done before. My hair always has ringlet curls even without hair products. I used it for over a week and it dried out my hair completely. The smell is terrible like chemicals and I had to throw it away since it was damaging my hair. This conditioner offered no moisture yet made by shower floor feel like an oil slick.</li>
    <li> Works just fine on my curly, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love Bouncy Cream my hairdresser started me on it. It saves a lot of hassle of putting cream rinse on in the shower and you use very little.</li>
    <li> Local stores do not carry this product!  It is great for my hair!</li>
    <li> The item came sealed up and safe in the box. It is a wonderful Conditioner. This product is hard to find so I was thrilled to find it and in such a big size for a great price!</li>
    <li> Really works on my curly,  wavy,  frizz prone hair.  Does not weigh it down.  Leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft,  at least on the first day of shampooing.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner but awful smell.  My husband even commented on how bad it smelled.  I do love how it works though.  Too bad.</li>
