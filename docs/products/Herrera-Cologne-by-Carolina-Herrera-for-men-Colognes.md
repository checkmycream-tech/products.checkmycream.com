    <li> Will certainly make this purchase again</li>
    <li> Best buy ever. Ive known about this cologne for over 20 years. When it arrived was suprised  to know it can still smell the same.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted - a lot cheaper and in the right size, just how I remembered it - the best</li>
    <li> Used this cologne for years, best price available!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent for a long time. It smells extremely clean and masculine. I have not seen this size of the bottle for sale in a retail store. Great value for price and what you get!!</li>
    <li> It smells just marvelous and has a distinct, unique smell, though one cannot simply review a smell... 6.75 ounces is more than enough... very good, yes, good.</li>
    <li> This is a much better deal than department stores and is the exact same product but less expensive. Will certainly make this purchase again. LOVE this fragrance on my guy!</li>
    <li> I cant find this in stores anymore - people always compliment the scent.  I hope that its not discontinued in the future.</li>

    <li> carolina herrera smells great.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and continue to get compliments.  The order came quicker than promised and was as promised.  I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> My wife likes me to use it so of course I do.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle while in Paris, in 1995 and I milked it for all it&#x27;s worth - using it sparingly since nowhere back home in Maryland carried it.  From time to time, over the years, I could find a bottle in small perfumeries, but it was rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found the big bottle on Amazon for a relatively low price, I jumped on the opportunity.  It was a great buy, as it has become one of my wife&#x27;s favorite scents (for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like spicy, but clean-smelling scents, I recommend trying Carolina Herrera for men.</li>
    <li> During the holiday hugging season it&#x27;s nice to get comments like &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; &amp; mmmmm what cologne are you wearing</li>

    <li> Have purchased this product for years and from many different locations.  This was the best value ever found. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> For over 20 years I have been wearing this..... In my younger days people would ask me what I am wearing.... and I would say &amp;#34;Take me Now!&amp;#34; ..... now in later years I get the same question and I say it is &amp;#34;Call me maybe!&amp;#34;  Women love it but do not put on too much... over powering...</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. Loved it but had some awful issues with the seller.</li>
