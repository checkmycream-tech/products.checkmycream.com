      <li>It is not, however, any kind of a &amp;#34;restructuring treatment cream&amp;#34;...for that you have to pay the big bucks and best work with your dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>The product has been extremely effective at lessening the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and even along my forehead.</li>

      <li>and they are such a great price!  </li>
      <li>AND FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE  USED AVEENO PRODUCTS,  </li>
      <li>I love Aveeno lotions.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I went and bought 3 more jars.</li>
      <li>, I know she will love it.</li>
      <li>, it does add moisture to your skin, which as we age we need more and more of it to keep our skin looking &#x27;plump&#x27; and hydrated.</li>

      <li>I love that it is helping me</li>
      <li>It looks more refined, radiant, and</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>If I can&#x27;t ever afford it, I&#x27;d go out and hold up a sign and beg for it.  :)</li>
      <li>I knew I wasnt going to buy it again as it was not my favorite</li>
      <li>or so they were for the most part, gone.  </li>
      <li>, I know it costs more at even WalMart</li>
      <li>I love it because it removed my wrinkles and redish spot.</li>
      <li>My skin seems brighter, plumper and the tone more even.</li>
      <li>I am definitely going to buy more of this line of products!!!</li>
      <li>Most importantly look at the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, just wanted a good moisturizer for the winter.</li>
      <li>They seem to have figured out the right balance between oils and glycerin so their products absorb immediately and don&#x27;t leave any kind of a greasy residue.</li>
      <li>Not only are my break outs more under control, but it also firms up my skin very nicely.</li>
      <li>Some stuff about it:  rubs in easy, not greasy, smells fine</li>
      <li>Makes face oily which is fine during winter time.</li>
      <li>I was amazed that I could tell a difference in my fine lines within a couple of days</li>
      <li>Some of my fine lines deepened..</li>
      <li>The smell is also fine.</li>
      <li>find the scent of the product to bel pleasant; almost odor-free, and the feel of the cream is substantial, but not heavy.</li>
      <li>I like the feel of the creams, light and moussie</li>
      <li>(I put it on after my shower in the morning AND at night) and feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s not always available, I decided to order it from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really examine my face that closely, so it is kind of a preventive medicine type of thing for me.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic face cream.</li>
      <li>it leaves your face soft and looking good.</li>
      <li>Its a rich and creamy moisturizer which leaves my face and neck feeling very soft and nice.</li>
      <li>But I noticed that the color of the top on the jars i got were different than the one I initially liked.</li>
      <li>Its creamy and great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>It spreads easily over my face and neck, and is absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>Even the box of the product itself was full of dust and kind of old yellowish color.</li>
      <li>Their whole line of products is devoted to healthy skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why they were cheaper, Haha :).</li>
      <li>This stuff does none of those things, and is very moisturizing without an overwhelming fragrance.</li>
      <li>skin is much more clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>i have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most moisturizers but aveeno always comes through for me.</li>
      <li>Awesome products aveeno,my face becomes smooth after a few days,kind of expensive ,i would love to buy more aveeno and love to share to my family and friends</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>This might be a great product for people with oily skin or those who don&#x27;t like a heavy night cream, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, and makes my skin feel great.</li>
      <li>I was sure this wouldn&#x27;t be the case with me since my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the money I thought I was saving.</li>
      <li>It seems to be ok, too early to tell what it is doing for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely worth it to spend ~$25 for this product.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin that can break out with most  products.      </li>
      <li>I love this cream for mature skin...</li>
      <li>the price is right.</li>
      <li>I also couldn&#x27;t tell if it was making my skin more restructured or younger looking</li>
      <li>After someone commented about how pretty my complection used to be</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t use creams with perfumes.</li>
    <li> Light color lid positively ageless just did not do anything compared to the dark brown lid.  Maybe one is daytime &amp; the other nighttime.  Not happy with the light lid one.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy, and makes my skin feel great. The price is good, too since you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product. I am a big Aveeno fan in general.</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old, was noticing dull, tired skin, with fine lines and wrinkles starting in the usual places. I have sensitive skin that can break out with most  products.      I have been using both the night &amp; the day \\&quot;lifting and firming\\&quot; creams for a couple of weeks.  I was amazed that I could tell a difference in my fine lines within a couple of days and it has continually improved as I have been using it longer.  So far I see results in a very short period of time (without plastic surgery) and NO acne.  I like the feel of the creams, light and moussie (is that a real word?), and my face isn&#x27;t all greasy by the end of the day.  I love that it is helping me and they are such a great price!  I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like smelly Aveeno products, and this is no exception. I finally went and got something else. If you are sensitive to smells, get something else.</li>
    <li> Aveeno products are wonderful.  I love this nightcream!</li>
    <li> Fantastic face cream. Absorbs into skin very well and regular use has resulted in soft, smooth skin. I&#x27;ve already repurchased once, and am working on my second tub. A really great buy!</li>
    <li> I AM 65 YEARS OF AGE AND FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE  USED AVEENO PRODUCTS,  HOWEVER, ON FEB.22I PURCHASED THE AGELESS LIFTING &amp; FIRMING NIGHT CREAM  AND  THE NEXT DAY I WOKE UP WITH SWOLLEN EYES, MY FACE WAS RED AND PUFFY  AND IT FELT LIKE SANDPAPER.  I E-MAILED AVEENO IMMEDIATELY AND AFTER WAITING  FOR OVER 20 MINS. ON LINE THE PERSON THAT  RESPONDED MADE ME  FEEL IT WAS  ALL MY FAULT, SHE SAID I WOULD BE REIMBURSED BUT A MONTH LATER I&#x27;M  STILL  WAITING. I E-MAILED THEM AGAIN AND TO DATE NO RESPONSE.  THE COMPANY IS   JOHNSON AND JOHNSON.  I HAVE PICTURES AND WITNESSES AND TO THIS DAY MY SKIN  STILL FEELS A LITTLE ROUGH,</li>
    <li> I use this cream day and night. It is not greasy or overly thick. So it moisturizes and firms my dry skin without being so thick that it causes breakouts. It also contains the ingredient allantoin which increases smoothness and promotes cell proliferation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for under $10 per jar and I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the way it keeps my skin hydrated (I put it on after my shower in the morning AND at night) and feeling smooth. As for it&#x27;s &#x27;positively ageless&#x27; firming and lifting qualities, I&#x27;m not sure I agree with that claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does add moisture to your skin, which as we age we need more and more of it to keep our skin looking &#x27;plump&#x27; and hydrated. This is what takes the fine lines out around our eyes and mouth - hydration, pure and simple. While Vaseline would do the same thing, who wants to have a greasy mess on their face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the scent of the product to bel pleasant; almost odor-free, and the feel of the cream is substantial, but not heavy. It spreads easily over my face and neck, and is absorbed quickly. I don&#x27;t notice any oily residue which is great as I still have a bit of a &#x27;T-Zone&#x27; issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it 4-stars: the small amount of cream you get for the price. While I scored a deal on it, I still think it would be great if skin care treatments weren&#x27;t so darned expensive. Especially when they work as well as this one does.</li>
    <li> Love it feels great on my face</li>
    <li> I have had wrinkles on my cheeks, not deep ones, for over a year. In 2 weeks, they are GONE. I was using more expensive, designer lines of mositurizers, and I had just given up on these lines. I couldn&#x27;t use any kind of blush on my cheeks, because it would just lay there in the creases, and was ugly. I was telling myself, I&#x27;m just getting older and I&#x27;m going to have to live with these signs of aging. In a short 2 WEEKS they are gone. I am using it for an eye cream as well, with the hopes it will work on those lines as well. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, but I can totally deal with it for the results. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, combination skin, so finding a product that works well for my skin type is always a challenge, but the lifting and firming cream does wonders! The product has been extremely effective at lessening the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and even along my forehead. It gives the perfect amount of moisture, never leaves my skin feeling greasy and is easy on skin that&#x27;s prone to irritation. Definitely one of my staples!</li>
    <li> After tiring of shelling out big bucks for department store moisturizers, I decided to give the drug store a chance.  I love Aveeno lotions.  They moisturize so well.  I have dry skin and in the winter, I need some heavy duty moisturizer.  Most night creams are pretty heavy moisturizers and given how well, the regular Aveeno lotions work, that&#x27;s what I expected.  That&#x27;s not what I got.  The formula is really watery.  It just absorbs into the skin and I can&#x27;t really tell that I moisturized at all.  That would be great for during the day (though I would like some SPF) but at night, I want something a lot heavier.  This might be a great product for people with oily skin or those who don&#x27;t like a heavy night cream, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 41 and I won this and a few other anti-aging products in a contest, some of which were 200.00+.  THis is by far the best of that bunch! THIS WORKS.  I will always buy this.  If I can&#x27;t ever afford it, I&#x27;d go out and hold up a sign and beg for it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 2 small worry lines between my eyes and after 3 weeks or so they were for the most part, gone.  One night I put some on, and put a Frownie on, which is a little &#x27;tape thingy&#x27; you sleep in, and the next morning, those wrinkles were completely gone and they never came back.  At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth.  My friend says she does not like the smell of it, and I know she hates mushrooms.  I don&#x27;t notice any smell really.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints in that department at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this morning and night personally.  It is not heavy or greasy and I wear it under my makeup.  There&#x27;s no tint and it goes on clear.  It leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  Do try it!</li>
    <li> I am one of those women who loves science, skin care, and trying new products. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years on new products, the latest science, and try everything from drug store to doctor&#x27;s office. I bought this because of the customer testimonials I read on a variety of sites. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, just wanted a good moisturizer for the winter. So I have been pleasantly surprised from the actual RESULTS I have gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much more clear and smooth. It looks more refined, radiant, and even.&lt;br /&gt;The deeper wrinkles over my lips (2 in particular that have bugged me for years) are going away. Wow. Seriously - wow.&lt;br /&gt;The crows feet are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;My pores are smaller and I have fewer clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is definitely more hydrated - not getting my typical winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all within just 3 weeks. It generally takes 6 weeks for a product to really kick in, if it&#x27;s going to, and these results are amazing, especially this soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works. I am seriously shocked. I was not expecting this, especially from something so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 with thin, dry skin and prone to clogged pores. I have fine to medium wrinkles and some sagging in the mid-face area that is typical with my age group. I look young for my age due to diet, genetics, and climate (I live in the NW), but I have definitely noticed more aging lately - probably due to stress and hormones. This product is actually reversing the very things that were bothering me most. And NO pimples or bad reaction of any kind. I have found my new staple. (I used Osmosis before this - expensive but very effective and a hard act to follow. Aveeno has actually done more for my wrinkles than the Osmosis did.)</li>
    <li> It makes my face burn, like little pinpoints of fire on my cheeks. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> Impressed! I used it twice on my face and chest. Both look healthier and less red. My chest looks great. The wrinkliness on my chest went entirely away. Will continue to use it and see what happens. I am 41 and am told I look younger. Maybe with this stuff I will get carded again. lol</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream at night for a couple months and I have no idea if it is working.  I don&#x27;t really examine my face that closely, so it is kind of a preventive medicine type of thing for me.  Some stuff about it:  rubs in easy, not greasy, smells fine, one lasts quite a while and its made by Aveeno, so it is quality product.</li>
    <li> Its great and it makes skin brighter and smoother, also make you look younger everytime you use it everyday. Great quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome products aveeno,my face becomes smooth after a few days,kind of expensive ,i would love to buy more aveeno and love to share to my family and friends</li>
    <li> Before I made this purchase, I read the reviews and saw that several people had allergic reactions to the product. I was sure this wouldn&#x27;t be the case with me since my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive. I was wrong. Within minutes of application, my face began to burn and turned beet red. No amount of soap and water or any other moisturizer (or even ice) relieved the condition, which persisted for two days. My advice: don&#x27;t take the chance just to save money by purchasing this moisturizer. It wasn&#x27;t worth the money I thought I was saving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s completely worth it to spend ~$25 for this product. Most importantly look at the ingredients. You won&#x27;t find mineral oil or other fillers like you do with traditional moisturizers. Aveeno only makes face products that give your face moisture and nutrients. Will not clog your pores! Don&#x27;t be afraid to use this moisturizer if you have acne. In my personal experience it has helped tremendously with acne.</li>
    <li> I had use this product before and I was convince that it works. That&#x27;s why I went and bought 3 more jars. But I noticed that the color of the top on the jars i got were different than the one I initially liked. I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference, but maybe these are fakes. Even the box of the product itself was full of dust and kind of old yellowish color. I&#x27;m a guy but I know my face products. And just in case you wonder, when we (MEN), reaching certain age, start moisturizing your face, with good face products to preserve kind of a softer skin face, because with age even our faces if not well moisture will have a bulldog, hard kind of looks. These little Averno jars are kind of pricey but I do believe they good but maybe these ones are fakes. Maybe that&#x27;s why they were cheaper, Haha :).</li>
    <li> I just bought this a week ago and I am already seeing results. My acne scars that I have treated with other things have almost disappeared. The fragrance is a bit strong, but it works!!! I use it at night and by the morning the scent is gone. I am definitely going to buy more of this line of products!!! THRILLED!!!</li>
    <li> I almost can feel it working. Yes, it&#x27;s that good. Aveeno is pure quality.Their whole line of products is devoted to healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt; I am in it for the long haul.</li>
    <li> Just recently using Aveeno products. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I alternate using between this and another product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mid of 30. I received this product as a trial. I love it because it removed my wrinkles and redish spot. The smell is also fine. This is a real good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> the amount of cream into the container was a shock, when I opened I just saw half full. So please some body all of yours was like that?</li>
    <li> I bought  this product before at  a department store.  Since it&#x27;s not always available, I decided to order it from Amazon.  It does help to keep my skin from feeling dry.  It&#x27;s gentle and has a slight smell that doesn&#x27;t stay with you.  Although these creams can&#x27;t perform miracles. at least I can feel comfortable wearing it.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price, I know it costs more at even WalMart and I refuse to pay that price.</li>
    <li> I love this cream for mature skin...IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Eileen</li>
    <li> It seems to be ok, too early to tell what it is doing for me. I like other Aveeno lotions, that is why I ordered it. The fragrance is wonderful. Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased this in a store, so I have nothing to compare it to but, the jar was only half full. Don&#x27;t know whether it was truly the amount it should have been. The lotion is fine, but I don&#x27;t have any dramatic results to report.</li>
    <li> Love this. Its creamy and great for dry skin. You don&#x27;t need much HOWEVER, came back to purchase another and saw this INSANE PRICE!  It&#x27;s Aveeno for goodness sakes. I think I paid $8.00 for it. Shame on them! No thanks!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the favorite, but it worked for the few months that I had it.  I knew I wasnt going to buy it again as it was not my favorite so I started searching for a different product.</li>
    <li> It was not as expected. Makes face oily which is fine during winter time. Did not see noticeable change. I guess need to use for long time.</li>
    <li> I sent it back because it irritated my skin and felt terrible upon application. I was surprised that Aveeno produced it.</li>
    <li> At 29 I have just the start of a couple of lines on my forehead and a handful of sun freckles. However I&#x27;ve also been on cancer treatments for over 3 years now which has left my skin dull and splotchy. After someone commented about how pretty my complection used to be I did a little research and decided to use this as a night cream. A month later I am so Iimpressed with the results! My skin seems brighter, plumper and the tone more even. The couple of lines on my forehead are much less noticible. I&#x27;m so impressed</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely but then my skin feels a little tingly or raw rather than moisturized. I&#x27;ll admit, it doesn&#x27;t say moisturizing cream but I guess I assumed that it would also moisturize.  IT DOES NOT.  I also couldn&#x27;t tell if it was making my skin more restructured or younger looking so I stopped using it. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it another shot soon.</li>
    <li> Very nourishing cream. Great for winter. My skin is normal and this is wonderful for the drying colder months. I have been using it with retinal cream and I can see a lot of improvement in my skin. I don&#x27;t have lines/wrinkles but I do frown a lot and the reason I got this was for preventive and to delay aging skin. I&#x27;m sticking with this cream, its nourishing and the price is right. I&#x27;m going to order one for my mom, I know she will love it. I do tend to use a lot of it and unlike most jars that last me 2-3 months, I can see this lasting me half the time.&lt;br /&gt;Love Aveeno, natural and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Smells great goes on non greasy and smooth. Makes my skin feel amazing I put it on every day before bed. Along with there eye cream. I enjoy this product but I like to change up what I use so will go with Olay next time</li>
    <li> Used it for months. Didn&#x27;t see any improvements. Some of my fine lines deepened.. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suppose to do that. Might as well save your money and go buy a moisturizer in store</li>
    <li> I found this product in a beauty magazine as a great but less expensive night cream.  I replaced my Elemis night cream with the Aveno, and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Aveeno products...so based on this and their pitch as a producer of natural products I was shocked by the overwhelming perfume scent for a facila product. The product feels great on the skin however. BUT and this is a big but....I have been having facial itching from the day after first use...I have sensitive skin and therefore I am not sure if the perfume is responsible OR the Shitake mushroom which is one of the ingredients...I did a bit of research and the mushroom could cause an allergic reaction so becareful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent. I used to use Aveno ultra calming moisturizer, but my complaint with it was that it increased my rate of breakouts and actually reddened my face more, as well as had a crazy intense fragrance. This stuff does none of those things, and is very moisturizing without an overwhelming fragrance. I have noticed a tremendous improvement in my skin and I am very happy with this product. Not only are my break outs more under control, but it also firms up my skin very nicely. I am only 27, but this is a product I will use as I get older to assist in wrinkle prevention, considering how wonderfully firm it makes my skin, I have a feeling my fondness for this lotion will only improve with time, I have found the perfect moisturizer for myself with this product.</li>
    <li> Its a rich and creamy moisturizer which leaves my face and neck feeling very soft and nice. It does help with making my skin more taught as well. Great product!</li>
    <li> Very nice moisturizer! My skin is smoother. Only problem I had with product is the jar seemed to be half full. Maybe too much jar for product????</li>
    <li> i can always count on aveeno ! i have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most moisturizers but aveeno always comes through for me. it leaves your face soft and looking good.</li>
    <li> This is my face cream of choice, so I was happy to find it on line.  It came as described, not damaged and on time.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this non-greasy treatment and it has slowly diminished the sun spots on my face especially on the driving side. I highly recommend this and all Aveeno products.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  It is not, however, any kind of a &amp;#34;restructuring treatment cream&amp;#34;...for that you have to pay the big bucks and best work with your dermatologist.  Aveeno makes the best moisturizers for my skinl.  They seem to have figured out the right balance between oils and glycerin so their products absorb immediately and don&#x27;t leave any kind of a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and so far seems to provide adequate moisture for my face.</li>
