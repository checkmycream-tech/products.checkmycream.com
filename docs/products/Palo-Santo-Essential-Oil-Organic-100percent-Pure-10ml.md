      <li>smells wonderful and gives a sense of peace.</li>
      <li>Perfect scent for cleansing the air and space</li>
      <li>awesome.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quality and I am very happy.</li>
      <li>Wonderful in keeping the Boogie Man away.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a very pleasant smell (earthy and tropical mix.)</li>
      <li>This is a great price I bought my 4th bottle already and have yet to use one fully.</li>
      <li>Worked great.</li>
      <li>to just leave it in the oil burner and not burn it.&lt;br /&gt;cut it a bit, and it smells great.</li>
      <li>Great for out- of -control kids, smudging cars for protection, aftermaths of arguments, pets on a rampage and husbands in foul moods.  </li>
      <li>and they burn easily and smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>Works great :)!</li>
      <li>Product is fine, price is the best around, BUT it took forever, and I don&#x27;t know if it is an Amazon thing or what, but why not let the buyer know if it is going to take 14 days to send something BEFORE the purchase is made?</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this oil, but the quality is good.</li>
      <li>But if you are pregnant or nursing it is best not to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with both of them and the company&#x27;s owner was eternally helpful and polite.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I will be trying more from EarthWise!</li>
      <li>Bought it to concoct my own bug deterrent oil blend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We liked the sweet smell of this oil and we liked the calming effect it produced for us both.  </li>
      <li>And on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
      <li>It surpasses some of my favorite brands.</li>
      <li>I love the citrusy woodsy smell of this oil - even better is letting it drip onto a smouldering stick of the palo santo wood ...</li>
      <li>Energy and vibrations is much better than sage.</li>
      <li>, it will singe the nose hairs, as potent as the smell is.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I was glad when I found it here in Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am glad I found this oil and will be purchasing some more to give to friends and family.  </li>
      <li>you will love it</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anything better.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>: I get a brown glass bottle with a misting nozzle, add 30 drops (or more depending on size of the bottle,) and add distilled water to the mix.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple vendors and found this to be the most authentic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you get the gist.</li>
      <li>so far great results on helping with tick control</li>
      <li>This is my favorite oil, I am so excited to find it at this price point.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong scent; can even smell it thru the bottle.</li>
      <li>We put it into a diffuser and very shortly thereafter the beautiful scent of Palo Santo was wafting through the house.  </li>
      <li>I love Palo Santo and the essential oil is amazing!</li>
      <li>We each used a tiny drop on our skin and experienced no problems.  </li>
      <li>She said this stuff was much more powerful then what I was using.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s too much for any type of lackadaisical burning at home.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s almost nice</li>
      <li>When diffused, it gives off a rich almost buttery aroma.  </li>
      <li>Most people probably don&#x27;t care, but for me it is important these oils are being harvested and distilled ethically.  </li>
      <li>It is woody and sweet with some citrus and minty undertones.</li>
      <li>Slightly sweet and lingers.</li>
      <li>This one is a product of Equador (as near as I can tell) and is the best of the lot, hands down, for me.  </li>
      <li>Any time I order, UPS takes forever, so I started always using the cheaper option of USPS, never fails it takes days to UPS&#x27;s weeks!</li>
      <li>This essential oil seems to be the only one that Earthwise produces, and they certainly seem to do a great job!  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic for places and spaces that have lots of intense energy, (like psychotherapy offices, jails, funeral homes and hospitals</li>
      <li>They smell terrific and it&#x27;s nice to see quality oils being sold without the trademarked labels that companies use to raise prices on their oils.  </li>
      <li>Earthwise Aromatics is worth buying from.</li>
      <li>this is powerful.</li>
      <li>If you go to YouTube you can read about the powerful properties of Palo Santo.</li>
      <li>doesnt smell the same as burning the wood, but still nice in an oil burner</li>
      <li>Tried a little dab on my wrist and it produced a very nice smell.  </li>
      <li>However, I find it overpoweringly strong (still too strong with only one drop diluted in three ounces.)</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, if you have other purchases this oil is good to add on your shopping cart.</li>
      <li>I guess if I make a new batch with each use it would be fine.</li>
      <li>Essential oils in a misting bottle can be a great substitute for smudging which is why i chose to smudge with Palo Santo Essential oil spray.</li>
      <li>I found the EarthWise oil more potent and with a nicer smell than the more expensive brand.  </li>
      <li>Sure hope it comes back.</li>
      <li>Even when the seller offers free shipping Amazon won&#x27;t honor that.</li>
      <li>Burning Palo Santo (the actual wood) stands out as one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>My only trouble is that Amazon has this items as &amp;#34; add on&amp;#34;, but you must buy $25 of their own products, otherwise you end up paying shipping which sometimes turns out to be more than what the product cost.</li>
      <li>But be careful, some folks need to dilute it a bit with some carrier oil as this is pretty potent.  </li>
      <li>Also Wwrks great for relieving headaches and allergies from poor air quality.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
      <li>They do so to ensure ethical practices</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for an oil that matches the same scent profile as that original bottle.</li>
      <li>Other brands on amazon smell burnt, they also sent a free piece of wood with each order, which works nice as a diffuser when a few drops are added.</li>
      <li>but I like it better than the more expensive $20</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this oil.  </li>
      <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
      <li>When you smell the essential oil directly, it is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t come across the same as burning Palo Santo.  </li>
      <li>So the 3 stars is my annoyance that this arrived more than a week after my other products from the same shop, same order, not reflective of the Product which is 5 stars for price and quality!</li>
      <li>However, when applied to the skin or to a base oil like (jojoba oil) it tempers down very quickly and the beautiful fragrance I am accustomed comes through.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It blends well with other oils and seems to bring a peaceful, mellowing effect to the room.  </li>
      <li>By using this in a spray bottle, it keeps it very discreet when you&#x27;ve got to clear some heavy energy.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, subtle and intoxicating.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so far great results on helping with tick control</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality</li>
    <li> Product is fine, price is the best around, BUT it took forever, and I don&#x27;t know if it is an Amazon thing or what, but why not let the buyer know if it is going to take 14 days to send something BEFORE the purchase is made? Also why does everything I purchase on Amazon com from ups? USPS is cheaper and takes a few days, why has no one figured this out yet? Any time I order, UPS takes forever, so I started always using the cheaper option of USPS, never fails it takes days to UPS&#x27;s weeks! So the 3 stars is my annoyance that this arrived more than a week after my other products from the same shop, same order, not reflective of the Product which is 5 stars for price and quality!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this oil, but the quality is good. A little pricy, but a lot of essential oils are. I am using it for a bug repellant.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for cleansing the air and space</li>
    <li> There is a very sharp or bitter greenness to the scent of the oil - if you&#x27;ve only smelled the wood, don&#x27;t expect this to be a mimicry of the sweetness.</li>
    <li> I have several different manufacturers of palo santos, all from Equador the only place where it is grown (only on the Pacific coast), all, I hope, made there.  This one is a product of Equador (as near as I can tell) and is the best of the lot, hands down, for me.  When diffused, it gives off a rich almost buttery aroma.  It blends well with other oils and seems to bring a peaceful, mellowing effect to the room.  I can&#x27;t imagine anything better.  This essential oil seems to be the only one that Earthwise produces, and they certainly seem to do a great job!  It surpasses some of my favorite brands.</li>
    <li> This is another acclaimed oil use for itchy scalp and hair growth. It is difficult to find it in stores around my area so I was glad when I found it here in Amazon. My only trouble is that Amazon has this items as &amp;#34; add on&amp;#34;, but you must buy $25 of their own products, otherwise you end up paying shipping which sometimes turns out to be more than what the product cost. Even when the seller offers free shipping Amazon won&#x27;t honor that. Nevertheless, if you have other purchases this oil is good to add on your shopping cart.</li>
    <li> This is a great price I bought my 4th bottle already and have yet to use one fully. Other brands on amazon smell burnt, they also sent a free piece of wood with each order, which works nice as a diffuser when a few drops are added. Also Wwrks great for relieving headaches and allergies from poor air quality.</li>
    <li> Burning Palo Santo (the actual wood) stands out as one of my favorite fragrances.  It&#x27;s sweet, subtle and intoxicating. I purchased this essential oil in hopes of incorporating it as a cologne.  When you smell the essential oil directly, it is quite strong and doesn&#x27;t come across the same as burning Palo Santo.  However, when applied to the skin or to a base oil like (jojoba oil) it tempers down very quickly and the beautiful fragrance I am accustomed comes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, when researching the company I learned the founders/owners/operators actually do site visits to where the raw products are sourced.  They do so to ensure ethical practices are in place in the harvesting of raw materials and to establish a proper business relationship with the people of the area. Most people probably don&#x27;t care, but for me it is important these oils are being harvested and distilled ethically.  I dig the oil and the company.</li>
    <li> my wife&#x27;s friend brought us a small souvenir size bottle of Palo Santo oil from their honeymoon in Ecuador. I&#x27;ve been searching for an oil that matches the same scent profile as that original bottle. I&#x27;ve tried a couple vendors and found this to be the most authentic. It is woody and sweet with some citrus and minty undertones. I would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Just noticed that tis product is now unavailable.  Hate that. I used it on my ankle for a tendinitis flare up. Worked great. Sure hope it comes back.</li>
    <li> In the past I used White Sage/Copal and Cedar to smudge spaces of negative energies but I was turned on to Palo Santo by a Shaman Lady I&#x27;m currently working with.  She said this stuff was much more powerful then what I was using.  Smudging usually requires setting something on fire then walking around fanning the smoke into the areas that need to be cleared.  This can get rather dicey for those with breathing problems or places where smoke can be a problem.  Essential oils in a misting bottle can be a great substitute for smudging which is why i chose to smudge with Palo Santo Essential oil spray. FYI: I get a brown glass bottle with a misting nozzle, add 30 drops (or more depending on size of the bottle,) and add distilled water to the mix. Shake before using, it requires requires no refrigeration but store bottle away from sunlight.  I can&#x27;t explain the way it smells but it&#x27;s a very pleasant smell (earthy and tropical mix.) By using this in a spray bottle, it keeps it very discreet when you&#x27;ve got to clear some heavy energy.&lt;br /&gt;** If you go to YouTube you can read about the powerful properties of Palo Santo. This is fantastic for places and spaces that have lots of intense energy, (like psychotherapy offices, jails, funeral homes and hospitals OR you&#x27;re around some negative characters,) I&#x27;m sure you get the gist. Our emotions put out energy and energy can stick and stay in places. Great for out- of -control kids, smudging cars for protection, aftermaths of arguments, pets on a rampage and husbands in foul moods.  You can spray yourself, your vehicles and anything that&#x27;s suspect. Wonderful in keeping the Boogie Man away.  NOTE: **Do not get spray in eyes as it can be irritating.  I&#x27;m totally sold on this stuff for the convenience and discretion of use. I bought the cones as well for further back up and they burn easily and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> awesome. this is powerful. cleared my dry fingers in 2 days. smells wonderful and gives a sense of peace. Energy and vibrations is much better than sage. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. you will love it</li>
    <li> I love the citrusy woodsy smell of this oil - even better is letting it drip onto a smouldering stick of the palo santo wood ... So incredibly relaxing &amp; soothing!!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product. However, I find it overpoweringly strong (still too strong with only one drop diluted in three ounces.) The smell is like licorice, and not at all what I was expecting from palo santo.</li>
    <li> Acceptable fragrance for the price</li>
    <li> for the price, 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;up too close, it will singe the nose hairs, as potent as the smell is.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s too much for any type of lackadaisical burning at home.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s almost nice to just leave it in the oil burner and not burn it.&lt;br /&gt;cut it a bit, and it smells great. otherwise, cut your nose hairs.</li>
    <li> I have never used products from this company before but I wanted to try a less expensive Palo Santo essential oil to compare it with the $23 Palo Santo oil I had previously bought .  It arrived today and immediately I opened the bottle and asked my wife to guess from the scent what oil it was?  She instantly said, &amp;#34;Palo Santo&amp;#34;.  We put it into a diffuser and very shortly thereafter the beautiful scent of Palo Santo was wafting through the house.  Tried a little dab on my wrist and it produced a very nice smell.  But be careful, some folks need to dilute it a bit with some carrier oil as this is pretty potent.  We each used a tiny drop on our skin and experienced no problems.  But if you are pregnant or nursing it is best not to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We liked the sweet smell of this oil and we liked the calming effect it produced for us both.  This oil is one of the least expensive of the Palo Santo oils offered on Amazon but I like it better than the more expensive $20+ bottle that I had purchased.  I found the EarthWise oil more potent and with a nicer smell than the more expensive brand.  I am glad I found this oil and will be purchasing some more to give to friends and family.  I highly recommend this oil.  Even if it is one of the less costly brands, in my opinion it beat the more expensive high end brand I bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five big stars for this Palo Santo.  I will be trying more from EarthWise!</li>
    <li> I love Palo Santo and the essential oil is amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought two oils from this company: Palo Santo and Frankincense.  I was very pleased with both of them and the company&#x27;s owner was eternally helpful and polite.  I use essential oils as an Acupuncturist and will continue to use these oils.  They smell terrific and it&#x27;s nice to see quality oils being sold without the trademarked labels that companies use to raise prices on their oils.  Earthwise Aromatics is worth buying from.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil, I am so excited to find it at this price point. It&#x27;s quality and I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought it to concoct my own bug deterrent oil blend. Works great :)!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. But diluted in water it smells so bad. And on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s too strong. It kinda just reminds me of cedar wood. Maybe it&#x27;s all in the same family. I got it to use in a spray bottle with distilled water for spiritual cleansing. But after being in the bottle for a couple of days, it would smell kinda gross. I guess if I make a new batch with each use it would be fine. Ehh idk.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Used it for bug bites.</li>
    <li> doesnt smell the same as burning the wood, but still nice in an oil burner</li>
    <li> Smells great! Slightly sweet and lingers. It&#x27;s a strong scent; can even smell it thru the bottle. It won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> This oil was cheaper than the regular Palo Santo Oil I purchase.  Decided to try it.  But had to go make to my regular more expensive type.</li>
