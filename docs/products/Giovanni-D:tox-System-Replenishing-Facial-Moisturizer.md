      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>so i love with it</li>
      <li>I now own full sized bottles of 3 of the steps.</li>
      <li>Light texture and applies very smoothly.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t like using too many products at once, and would rather use products that make more of a positive difference in my skin.</li>

      <li>my opinion, this is worth tons more than I paid.</li>
      <li>Light moisturizer that is not greasy.</li>
      <li>The moisture and feel of this product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>lotion is light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>This product is worth more than what they charge if you ask me.</li>
      <li>and Id been looking for a moisturizer that was smooth and creamy without leaving my face feeling greasy</li>
      <li>Also it is VERY gentle, so would be great for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>love this product, really works!</li>
      <li>Its quality and effectiveness surpasses many high priced products that I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
      <li>Which is wonderful for night, but not good for morning because it will make you too greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very runny though, more like an essence or first esscence.  </li>
      <li>Love it so far.</li>
      <li>I rarely find that a serum or cream lives up to the outlandish claims on the box.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, simple moisturizer.</li>
      <li>you have problem skin, and everything you&#x27;re trying isn&#x27;t working, this is really worth a go.</li>
      <li>Not greasy or heavy just nice and light.</li>
      <li>I found the all natural ingredients intriguing, and was excited to give it a try.</li>
      <li>perfect, a little goes a long way,</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>so I know it is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>I was absolutely glowing!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I was using cetaphil cream (wayyy too greasy for my face), then i tried philosophy which was OK, because although it goes on smooth which is what i look for in a cream/lotion, it settled feeling greasy (not cheap either).</li>
      <li>I got to a certain point in the healing process and hit a wall.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
      <li>It is very natural and the price is right.</li>
      <li>Quite a large amount of product is included which makes it really cost-effective.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky and have tried everything.</li>
      <li>Reasonable, Been using it for years.</li>
      <li>I really like Giovanni&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>This is really gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Too lightweight, doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin.</li>
      <li>I originally tried a few free samples of the Giovanni D:tox System.</li>
      <li>Only clear, super soft, glowing skin from a light scented miracle cream.</li>
      <li>As a former user of the very expensive but exceptional Dr. Grandell skin care products, Giovanni products are comparably as good in quality and result.  </li>
      <li>The morning after my first night application, I could not believe how soft and satiny my skin looked.</li>
      <li>Its only my 2nd day of using it, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion because I truly do look and feel younger when I use it daily ...</li>
      <li>, seriously, I am not someone who believes the hype of beauty products.</li>
      <li>Skin immediately absorbs completely and the smooth, supple effects last all day.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.(this coming from a guy)</li>
      <li>So decided to try this product after humming and hawing in whole foods for a while staring at the myriad of organic/all natural stuff (as i&#x27;m not into chemicals on my skin).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Totally recommend it for people who wanna try going with natural products and people with sensitive skin - BUT STILL WANT A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT WITH A REASONABLE PRICE</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>It sinks into my skin quickly.</li>
      <li>Since I have dry skin, however, the body bar was just not the right call for my face.</li>
      <li>Being a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34;, I appreciate any help possible and find that this little, inexpensive item sure does the trick.  </li>
      <li>It goes on clear, leaves no traces.  </li>
      <li>This is completely natural and the price range is just about 9$. I can put it on my eczema directly and have no burning sensation whatsoever</li>
      <li>I recently went through a traumatic period of intense breakouts that became the gift that kept on giving.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought at Sephora or ULTA. I&#x27;ve spent 5x this much on moisturizers before and did not feel or see results like the results I&#x27;ve gotten from this moisturizer. My skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Target because I was looking for a moisturizer that was \\&quot;hopefully thick and rich\\&quot;. This caught my eye because the ingredients were ALL NATURAL :D and includes wonderful stuff like aloe vera and shea butter. I try to avoid using chemicals, and this fits the bill.    It was also 3$ cheaper than my neutrogena lotion I was using. 10$ for this (at target) while the other wa 13$    The only issue is that, it literally is thick and rich. Which is wonderful for night, but not good for morning because it will make you too greasy. Plus, theres no sunscreen-which isnt good for daytime anyways.    Its only my 2nd day of using it, and I love it. Ill update if anything changes (like if my acne-prone but on accutane at the moment) skin still breaks out)</li>
    <li> Has a thick, sunscreen feel to it going on. This would&#x27;ve clogged my pores in my younger years!</li>
    <li> I was at Target looking for the 50:50 Giovanni shampoo, but they didn&#x27;t have it- but I stumbled across this. Now, I am an amazon junkie and will probably not buy something if there aren&#x27;t enough reviews or a high enough rating- but I said, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema around my mouth and my skin is usually oily around the t-zone and dry everywhere else. This is completely natural and the price range is just about 9$. I can put it on my eczema directly and have no burning sensation whatsoever and there is NO greasy feeling. So far it&#x27;s very wonderful and I do not have to use a lot of product for it to penetrate and hydrate my skin! Love it so far. Next paycheck I&#x27;m going to get the purifying facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend it for people who wanna try going with natural products and people with sensitive skin - BUT STILL WANT A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT WITH A REASONABLE PRICE</li>
    <li> I bought this item specifically after researching many products so I know it is exactly what I wanted.  It is a little greasy for my liking, leaves a little shine on my face but I still use it.  It is very natural and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Bought so many times now since both me and my mom love it</li>
    <li> The best ever. No allergic reaction.  The moisture and feel of this product is fabulous.  Not greasy, just moisture and I can even use it on my eyelids.  Other eye products caused an allergic reaction.  Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at my local store. It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer. That&#x27;s saying a lot brcause I&#x27;m very picky and have tried everything.</li>
    <li> IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 3 STEP DTOX SYSTEM.  THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.  IT REDUCES YOUR SKIN IF ITS OILY WITHOUT DRYING OUT THE REST OF YOUR FACE.  ITS NOT AN OILY PRODUCT AND YOU WILL NEED VERY LITTLE BUT THE LONGER YOU USE IT THE BETTER IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> I have Asian/European skin and Id been looking for a moisturizer that was smooth and creamy without leaving my face feeling greasy but i&#x27;m not so into the ones that go on like air and leave my skin feeling as though i put nothing on. I know thats what a lot of people like in a moisturizer but if it feels as though there is nothing there and my face isn&#x27;t moisturized, then whats the point? So decided to try this product after humming and hawing in whole foods for a while staring at the myriad of organic/all natural stuff (as i&#x27;m not into chemicals on my skin). This product is worth more than what they charge if you ask me. I put on a small pea sized amount on my finger and spread it around because thats all you need, and for me i like to \\&quot;saturate\\&quot; without feeling greasy. I was using cetaphil cream (wayyy too greasy for my face), then i tried philosophy which was OK, because although it goes on smooth which is what i look for in a cream/lotion, it settled feeling greasy (not cheap either). This Giovanni d-tox moisturizer is BAR NONE, the best moisturizer i&#x27;ve EVER used. My skin is soft, supple, and i feel it there (making my skin soft and supple) but with NO greasy feeling AT ALL. Perfect. The only thing its missing is Spf, which sucks as you should Always wear an SPF, But lucky for me i&#x27;m a night nurse, so i get to put it on in the evening under my makeup before i head off to work and when i go to sleep in the morning. :)&lt;br /&gt;Best part about this product is that its about $10 and i bought the 4oz tube 5 months ago and still have half the tube left! No breakouts, No greasy feeling (at all). Only clear, super soft, glowing skin from a light scented miracle cream. (By the way, this is only my second review on a product but i&#x27;m so i love with it i had to write one).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I found it one day while shopping at TJ Maxx and have been using it for the last eight months.  As a former user of the very expensive but exceptional Dr. Grandell skin care products, Giovanni products are comparably as good in quality and result.  And its much more affordable.</li>
    <li> I have D tox body lotion Goji and berry and it smell awesome and great lotion&lt;br /&gt;but this one for face it really smell awful&lt;br /&gt;I expect it will smell the same as the body lotion but it wasn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Light moisturizer that is not greasy. Smooths out my dry patches.</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed, when the store I usually buy from stopped selling it.  The price is also better online than in the stores.  This is a light moisturizer, perfect for oily skin.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Have received great affects. Does as it says. And will buy again. Look forward to exploring other products from this brand. Plan to use on a regular basis for cleansing.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent at least six months looking for a product that I like that actually works on my face. I&#x27;ve tried anti-wrinkle moisturizer, it dried my face out. I&#x27;ve tried oil free moisturizer, it dried my face out. This moisturizes my face and within a week I saw a noticeable difference in my skin tone. My face looks healthier using this. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Too lightweight, doesn&#x27;t really soak into my skin. Leaves skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This is really gentle on the skin. It&#x27;s very runny though, more like an essence or first esscence.  There&#x27;s no spf in it. It goes on clear, leaves no traces.  It&#x27;s okay but I&#x27;ve started using other brands with SPF to prevent darkening from the sunlight.</li>
    <li> Great product! Reasonable, Been using it for years. My skin is smooth.  Love it! Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin. My skin is very oily but I get severe dry patches so my skin is extremely difficult to manage. Exfoliating is not option because is causes me to break out. This is the only moisturizer I have ever used that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts out and still moisturizes.</li>
    <li> perfect, a little goes a long way, not greasy, nice smell but not over powering.</li>
    <li> My daughter was given a sample from her nanna and her acne is so much better than using proactive</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Non-greasy moisturizer that softens, moisturizes skin without having the greasy appearance or feel.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> It was everything I dreamt it would be</li>
    <li> This lotion Iis wonderful.....it even FIRMS!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because I truly do look and feel younger when I use it daily ... and it&#x27;s so good that my girlfriend uses it too! ;)</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this lotion. I LOVE the detox face wash but feel like the face lotion clogged my pores. I hate saying that bc I love the brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product line. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use a non-natural product line, and have avoided natural products in the past few years because those I tried in the past either did nothing for me or, worse, caused breakouts. I recently went through a traumatic period of intense breakouts that became the gift that kept on giving. I got to a certain point in the healing process and hit a wall. I simply could not get over that last obstacle to clear skin. I was using the body bar in the shower and decided one day out of panic/frustration to try it on my face. Lo and behold, the stuff started to help! My inflammation reduced by the time I toweled off, my itchiness subsided, and by bedtime the redness was starting to reduce. Since I have dry skin, however, the body bar was just not the right call for my face. I picked up the cleanser, the scrub, and this face lotion. It&#x27;s been a week (only a week!) and my skin is *just* about back to its normal, clear, can-get-by-with-a-tinted-moisturizer self. Lately, I&#x27;ve been going through concealer like crazy. This week, I&#x27;ve barely had to use any. It&#x27;s blissful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is light and non-greasy. It sinks into my skin quickly. Makeup goes on over it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problem skin, and everything you&#x27;re trying isn&#x27;t working, this is really worth a go. It&#x27;s inexpensive compared to other charcoal cleaner sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seriously, I am not someone who believes the hype of beauty products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my products. I get suckered into trying stuff all the time, but I don&#x27;t buy into dramatic results or instant changes. I rarely find that a serum or cream lives up to the outlandish claims on the box. I don&#x27;t typically dab on eye cream and suddenly think look 21 again. I don&#x27;t think any mascara has ever confused people into thinking I stuck on false lashes. However, honestly, I saw immediate results with this product. I had immediate relief. A week ago, I was embarrassed to leave my house, even after plastering on half my makeup collection. Today, I ran errands bare-faced without thinking twice about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is worth tons more than I paid. I cannot believe my good fortune--a product that healed my skin, and is affordable to boot. What a score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue here is with my skin type, not the product. I have such dry skin that every couple of days I switch this out for my standard moisturizing lotion. Otherwise, my skin just keeps drinking it in. Also, since it&#x27;s not got SPF, on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup (hooray!! those days have returned!!), I mix a little sunblock with it.</li>
    <li> love this product, really works!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, simple moisturizer. It is a great on-hand product to mix with some foundation for a light coverage. Don&#x27;t expect dramatic results from this product - it didn&#x27;t change the appearance of pores, skin texture, etc and seemed to have no effect on the occasional pimple. Quite a large amount of product is included which makes it really cost-effective. Overall, I doubt I would buy it again just because I&#x27;m really picky with skin care products and I don&#x27;t like using too many products at once, and would rather use products that make more of a positive difference in my skin. But this is probably the best affordable basic moisturizer out there. Also it is VERY gentle, so would be great for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it every day. Not greasy or heavy just nice and light.</li>
    <li> An amazing product.  Light texture and applies very smoothly.  Skin immediately absorbs completely and the smooth, supple effects last all day.  I happened upon it by accident about a year ago and have been delighted ever since.  Being a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34;, I appreciate any help possible and find that this little, inexpensive item sure does the trick.  Its quality and effectiveness surpasses many high priced products that I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
    <li> Soupy. Made skin break out.</li>
    <li> The cream was to sticky . Icould feel my face sticky for hours. Maybe it was just an old tube.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  It really sinks right in to my face and is lightweight.  Has no offending smell, DOES NOT rub off in to little white balls on the surface of my skin like other weird moisturizers I have used. I really like Giovanni&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Amazing ingredients and feel after massaging into your face. They used to sell it at target but not any more for some reason. Highly recommended.(this coming from a guy)</li>
    <li> I originally tried a few free samples of the Giovanni D:tox System. I found the all natural ingredients intriguing, and was excited to give it a try. The difference that these products made on my face, in just a few short days was crazy! I now own full sized bottles of 3 of the steps. This moisturizer is not greasy at all, and I usually apply morning and night. The morning after my first night application, I could not believe how soft and satiny my skin looked. I was absolutely glowing! If you have hopped around with skincare lines, never finding almost instant results, then you definitely need to check into the Giovanni D:tox line, you will not be disappointed!</li>
