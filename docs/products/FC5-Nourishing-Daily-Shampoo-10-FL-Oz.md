      <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>but it is good stuff.</li>
      <li>Its okay .. not that great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s by FAR the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>Sounds too good to be true?  </li>
      <li>Now I have more hair than I&#x27;ve EVER had in my life.  </li>
      <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>so had oily part on top and whitesh portion on bottom and had to shake to mix up&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I want to go more organic.</li>
      <li>if your hair is normal and you&#x27;re not having issues with hair loss, I doubt that you would find this shampoo remarkable.  </li>
      <li>If you want your hair to feel healthy and clean</li>
      <li>As a shampoo it seems to work fine.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special however except being vegan/cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying something new though because this shampoo is kind of pricey</li>
      <li>Your hair is clean and silky.</li>
      <li>sure it is great, but small bottle.</li>
      <li>In this case its true.</li>
      <li>However, if you are experiencing significant hair loss, this is definitely worth a try.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried this shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
      <li>After seeing every kind of doctor imaginable, they finally concluded that I was just going bald.  </li>
      <li>Yeah, right, I thought -- how could a shampoo do that?  </li>
      <li>This product does a really good job with just a little bit of shampoo</li>
      <li>/&gt;Keratase is a worldwide famous brand thus open to counterfeiters.&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
      <li>Would most likely buy again.</li>
      <li>This is just my first reaction I will do and update in a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>adds so much bounce and fluffiness!  </li>
      <li>My mother said that she had a friend whose hair was thinning so much that you could see right through to her scalp.  </li>
      <li>Love the shampoo, but the vendor took a long time to ship the item.</li>
      <li>does seem a little softer but nothing amazing or out of the world.&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
      <li>Oh I noticed how much my hair will grow after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair was always fine (and still is, but not nearly as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to use Suave or TRESsemme and had to use conditioner every day to avoid static and dryness, but now I only use a deep conditioner about once a month.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to use conditioner and my hair was very soft and shinier than I have seen it in years.</li>
      <li>Have very sensitive skin and broke out in sores from product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s thinning considerable.  </li>
      <li>It makes your hair silky soft after one application and you won&#x27;t have dandruff again even if you don&#x27;t shampoo for weeks.  </li>
      <li>reading over the top reviews about this overpriced product, I am not very happy about</li>
      <li>As of the date of this review the short ingredient list in the description is highly misleading.  </li>
      <li>and I have only purchased professional hair products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>My mom said her friend&#x27;s hair grew back completely, from just using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Searching the web for the complete ingredients list found it to contain 61 different ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Some made my fine hair way too oily and some made the dryness worse.</li>
      <li>I am a 71 year old woman with very dry brittle hair.</li>
      <li>I was excited about this product being vegan and all, but it left my hair feeling dry ad frizzy which made it hard to style and control.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> sure it is great, but small bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but the vendor took a long time to ship the item.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was advertised as having no quaternium 15 in it as I am allergic to that.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As of the date of this review the short ingredient list in the description is highly misleading.  Searching the web for the complete ingredients list found it to contain 61 different ingredients.  A few of which were listed as moderate hazard and a few as high hazard in the EWG (Environmental Working Group)database of chemicals.  As a shampoo it seems to work fine.  Low suds.  Adds some luster/shine to hair.  Nothing special however except being vegan/cruelty free.  Very pricey especially considering the addition of unnecessary ingredients of moderate and high hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the 5th largest ingredient on the label is now banned in the European Union according to EWG.</li>
    <li> The product is expensive and comes in a limit quantity but it is good stuff. Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product being vegan and all, but it left my hair feeling dry ad frizzy which made it hard to style and control. I had to use tons of product afterwards to control my hair. I was disappointed because I had good expectations about this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product does a really good job with just a little bit of shampoo so it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I started seeing doctors, because, at 44, I was losing my hair.  After seeing every kind of doctor imaginable, they finally concluded that I was just going bald.  They told me the only thing I could do for it was to use Rogaine.  Well, after a month of that with no obvious results, I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals on my head for the rest of my life.  My mother said that she had a friend whose hair was thinning so much that you could see right through to her scalp.  Mine wasn&#x27;t that bad, but I was having to take time to make sure to cover any spots that were really thin.  My mom said her friend&#x27;s hair grew back completely, from just using this shampoo and conditioner.  Yeah, right, I thought -- how could a shampoo do that?  Anyway, I started taking biotin supplements, and using Nioxin.  I just bought the small bottle, because at that point, I didn&#x27;t really think anything was going to help.  Well, my mom bought me a bottle of this, and I started using it after the Nioxin was gone.  I figured I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose by trying it.  Well, it took a few months, but my hair started growing back (thank goodness!).  I have ONLY used this shampoo/conditioner for the last year and a half.  Now I have more hair than I&#x27;ve EVER had in my life.  My hair was always fine (and still is, but not nearly as much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your hair is normal and you&#x27;re not having issues with hair loss, I doubt that you would find this shampoo remarkable.  However, if you are experiencing significant hair loss, this is definitely worth a try.  It gave me back my hair!</li>
    <li> This product left my hair a tangled mess after use. I have very thick, wavy hair and was a nightmare to comb after use. Even using matching conditioner did not help tangle issues.</li>
    <li> Everything came as described. Have very sensitive skin and broke out in sores from product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo ever.  Your hair is clean and silky. When I run out of Arbonne&lt;br /&gt;shampoo Yes I panic. Oh I noticed how much my hair will grow after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to use other shampoos that has all that toxic chemicals in it.  Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I am a 71 year old woman with very dry brittle hair. I guess that comes with the territory. I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners that just didn&#x27;t work. Some made my fine hair way too oily and some made the dryness worse. I decided to give FC5 Nourishing Shampoo a try because I was experiencing a lot of breakage and was leaving a lot of hair that I can&#x27;t afford to lose in my brush! The first time I tried this shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I didn&#x27;t even need to use conditioner and my hair was very soft and shinier than I have seen it in years. This is just my first reaction I will do and update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve had.  I have very fine hair and it&#x27;s thinning considerable.  This gives my hair volume .... it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I hate to review this product since it may cause a run on the bank, but it&#x27;s so good it deserves a review.  This is some secret ingredient product in a world of them, only this one is the real thing.  It makes your hair silky soft after one application and you won&#x27;t have dandruff again even if you don&#x27;t shampoo for weeks.  Sounds too good to be true?  In this case its true.</li>
    <li> Not sure why people go crazy about this shampoo. It is the same as any shampoo out there....works the same for me</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!!  It&#x27;s by FAR the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used...and I have only purchased professional hair products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This adds so much bounce and fluffiness!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought the conditioner with this to get the best results but I like the shampoo a lot. Would most likely buy again.</li>
    <li> Its okay .. not that great. Maybe it does not suit my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After reading over the top reviews about this overpriced product, I am not very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;For one it leaves my hair dry and frizzy if i use it without a conditioner .&lt;br /&gt;Hair does seem a little softer but nothing amazing or out of the world.&lt;br /&gt;overall i say its overrated for the price&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely switching after this bottle gets over..</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. I almost never use conditioner anymore. I used to use Suave or TRESsemme and had to use conditioner every day to avoid static and dryness, but now I only use a deep conditioner about once a month. I&#x27;m trying something new though because this shampoo is kind of pricey and I want to go more organic.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to feel healthy and clean this is the one shampoo that will do the trick.</li>
    <li> 2 shampoos that work for me have thick wiry hair&lt;br /&gt;this one and Keratase bain 2 BUT concerned about Keratase available on Amazon .....may be fake&lt;br /&gt;last time i bought Keartase it had seapated in bottle so had oily part on top and whitesh portion on bottom and had to shake to mix up&lt;br /&gt;Keratase is a worldwide famous brand thus open to counterfeiters.&lt;br /&gt;Who ever heard of FC5 thus whom would want to counterfeit this product</li>
