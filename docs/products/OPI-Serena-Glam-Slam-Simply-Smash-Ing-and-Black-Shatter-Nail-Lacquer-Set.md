      <li>I have tried crackle polish before, and I wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
      <li>But never put more than 1 coat.</li>
      <li>Noted works better if placed on a topcoat over the nail polish).</li>
      <li>It was risque for me since I&#x27;m more a conservative polish wearer, however I so enjoyed wearing this.</li>
      <li>I love the shatter.</li>
      <li>Tried it out for the first time and I loved the way it looks.  </li>
      <li>Then when it&#x27;s done add a light top coat.</li>
      <li>Both nail polishes were shipped to me quickly and I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
      <li>so it looks even more amazing when you put a clear top coat-</li>
      <li>It is so pretty Kind of gives you the leopard appeal.</li>
      <li>Ok so i got the kit quick and easy.</li>
      <li>My problem with this series of nail polishes is that they chip off really quickly (even with a top coat).</li>
      <li>No such luck, lol.</li>
      <li>The company was very helpful dealing with a lost item, through no error of their own.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply, my new favorite.</li>
      <li>So when I heard about this newnail polish that has the shattering effect it sounded so cool</li>
      <li>Simply Smash-ing is a gorgeous greenie-gold color.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s ot to say it won&#x27;t be amazingly cool to someone else.</li>
      <li>The black shatter is amazing, works fast and its really effortless to get that great shattered look.</li>
      <li>Very pretty on</li>
      <li>but its actually really pretty and has a unique sheen to it.</li>
      <li>I tried the black shatter over different colorsand the best has to be light pastel colors in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Crackle Nail Polish is so crazy popular right now and having the faces of Katy Perry and Serena Williams is making it that much more popular!</li>
      <li>I can honestly say it was very simple!</li>
      <li>Its worth having it even if all you want is the shatter.</li>
      <li>, I think it looks gross, kind of like peeling nail polish.    </li>
      <li>After my 3rd application,I can honestly say that I REALLY like this set!</li>
      <li>Black Shatter by far was simply amazing :)</li>
      <li>i wasnt really interested in it</li>
      <li>really pretty-</li>
      <li>I just have to say that I can&#x27;t believe how FAST this order got to me!  </li>
      <li>A lot of you saying top coat is not necessary.</li>
      <li>I have an extensive nail polish collection which puts most nail salons to shame.</li>
      <li>so I was nervous at first about the application.</li>
      <li>Really, really pretty when you apply it, even on the first coat</li>
      <li>and it looked pretty.</li>
      <li>the other color shatter polish that I ordered since the first was kind of a flop for me.</li>
      <li>But the following week when I removed the nail polish (with 100% acetone mind you), much to my horror I discovered my nails had been stained bright yellow.  </li>
      <li>I find the silver shatter is better but who knows for how long.     </li>
      <li>Make sure that the color is dry before you apply the shatter.</li>
      <li>but as you layer the polish it only get&#x27;s more intense and vibrant.</li>
      <li>I love the fast dry Seche Viche.  </li>
      <li>so fast it is really a pain to deal with.</li>
      <li>I expected to be able to expertly apply this set with no issues at all.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait until the Shatter is available in the blue</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The color appears green, but on my nails it&#x27;s a nice gold.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see it arrive today when I was thinking that it would get her next week.  </li>
      <li>The colors look better than katy perrys does with black shatter.</li>
      <li>Bought this set for homecoming game (school colors) and loved it.</li>
      <li>and it is right next to me!</li>
      <li>OH MAN, takes your nails to a new level.</li>
      <li>Particularly if you are using it on your natural nails, like I am.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Fast Service, love the black shatter but the Simply Smashing gold stains your nails yellow and will not come off your nail bed.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I tried this with the black shatter...</li>
      <li>I am a 26 year old self proclaimed nail polish guru.</li>
      <li>I was told my toes look professional, and I suck at painting nails.  </li>
      <li>and i was pleasently surprised with the serena nail polish</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it does stain a little</li>
      <li>she was surprised that this product is the same as other cheap brand that will turn nail to yellow.  </li>
      <li>Worth buying Black Shatter, if you can find it.</li>
      <li>I bought other OPI products from other store and they were fine.</li>
      <li>The yellow stain did not go away until my nail completely re-grew.</li>
      <li>Serena&#x27;s color is like a funky green tennis ball with sparkly golden undertones.</li>
      <li>That makes applying a thin layer of the Shatter more achievable.</li>
      <li>Black shatter was so fun to put on over simply smashing and watching the nail polish shrink.</li>
      <li>The color is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all because of the staining. :(</li>
      <li>I had my order in less than a week, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s not dry, the crackle paint wont last.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the shatter on my acrylic nails with three different base colors - love them all. this sparkly green seemed a little over the top at first, but now I am not sure I want to change it!</li>
    <li> I expected to be able to expertly apply this set with no issues at all. No such luck, lol. Let me tell you, applying this set takes PRACTICE. Particularly if you are using it on your natural nails, like I am.  After my 3rd application,I can honestly say that I REALLY like this set! Can&#x27;t wait until the Shatter is available in the blue colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**TIPS**: Add a little bit of nail polish remover to the Black Shatter to thin it out some. That makes applying a thin layer of the Shatter more achievable. Also, using base coat and top coat are highly recommend for longer lasting wear. One application lasts me 4-5 days before it chips; but I type on the computer A LOT within my profession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Wow! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! WARNING! Don&#x27;t do the fast shipping you will just waste your money just do the standard one because I ordered this on the 19th of april and today is the 21st and it is right next to me! I am soo happy with this order I made! Thank you to the owner!</li>
    <li> The shatter is awesome and clearly everyone loves it. The problem is, it ages so fast it is really a pain to deal with. My bottle has only been opened maybe 5 times and the rim of the bottle is clumpy and nasty. It&#x27;s a shame. I find the silver shatter is better but who knows for how long.     As for the other color in the bottle it is a bit tacky and I only used it one time before deciding it just isn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s too \\&quot;draggish\\&quot; looking. Totally not my thing. I&#x27;m gonna donate it in my next Goodwill drop off for sure.</li>
    <li> Disappointing all around. I love the green &amp;#34;smashing&amp;#34; color, but the black shatter was horrible. I used it once and it looked pretty. I put the bottle away for a month and went back to use it and the formula was completely dry! I spent a lot of money on the product, so it was it was frustrating that I got one use out of it.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for homecoming game (school colors) and loved it. Got a lot of compliments. It&#x27;s true that it does stain a little but i didnt think it was a big deal.</li>
    <li> I like the aspect of the shatter polish, but it loses its appeal after a while. The green color that came with the shatter stains your nails ALOT.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! Both nail polishes were shipped to me quickly and I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased. I am not the best at doing my own nails so I was nervous at first about the application. I can honestly say it was very simple! My nails look great!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I couldn&#x27;t wait till I received it and when I did, I had to try it out. Shipping was fast! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love love love this collection! It is so pretty Kind of gives you the leopard appeal. It lasted me 2 weeks without chipping. I love the shatter. But never put more than 1 coat. A lot of you saying top coat is not necessary. I feel it is because it gives your nails a shine you cannot get without! I love it!</li>
    <li> Ok so i got the kit quick and easy. The company sent it was great! Black shatter was so fun to put on over simply smashing and watching the nail polish shrink. Black Shatter by far was simply amazing :) But Simply smashing died my fingers yellow as soon as i took it off! I thought it was just me but my sister has the same on had the same thing done to her. This was a  major downer since i usually go with plane nails for a while. It took 3 days of consent nail polish remover and washing. I finally got that yellow off. So I would still buy it for black shatter but use a differn&#x27;t nail polish then Simply Smash-ing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set for my daughter. The colors look better than katy perrys does with black shatter. You wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this polish.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of coompliments on it.  It&#x27;s different, and instead of getting designs on  your nails the shatter makes its own design.  I ordered the white cracked from another company.  The gold and black of this set is really different.  I recommend getting it.[[ASIN:B004KAW540 Serena Glam Slam Simply Smash-Ing &amp; Black Shatter]]</li>
    <li> well i ordered this becuase of shatter and ofcoarse it says wat it supposed to do it looks awsome and i was pleasently surprised with the serena nail polish i wasnt really interested in it but its actually really pretty and has a unique sheen to it. really liked it them both ,the company was great even though there was a huge storm that hit that hit that week.as soon as everything was moving again i got it 2 days later</li>
    <li> These two colors are beyond AWESOME!  I have been wearing Black Shatter and getting tons of compliments.  I can&#x27;t say enough about these colors.</li>
    <li> My girl friend only used once and left it on for two days, when she remove the color she was surprised that this product is the same as other cheap brand that will turn nail to yellow.  She was glad that she didn&#x27;t had it on her finger nail. I bought other OPI products from other store and they were fine. I don&#x27;t recommend any one on purchase this product from this seller!!</li>
    <li> The Smash-Ing nail polish stained my nails yellow (my nails looked diseased...). The yellow stain did not go away until my nail completely re-grew. I DO NOT recommend it.     The shatter nail polish is awesome though. My problem with this series of nail polishes is that they chip off really quickly (even with a top coat).</li>
    <li> Fast Service, love the black shatter but the Simply Smashing gold stains your nails yellow and will not come off your nail bed.</li>
    <li> I got it from MissPinkCat before the prices of other sellers got really ridiculous. The black shatter is amazing, works fast and its really effortless to get that great shattered look. Simply Smash-ing is a gorgeous greenie-gold color. Its worth having it even if all you want is the shatter.</li>
    <li> It works and looks just as expected.  My daughter loves it and has worn it every day, I think it looks gross, kind of like peeling nail polish.    Ahh, the generation gap strikes again!</li>
    <li> I am a 26 year old self proclaimed nail polish guru. I have an extensive nail polish collection which puts most nail salons to shame. So when I heard about this newnail polish that has the shattering effect it sounded so cool I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy it. Well it was sold out of most beauty stores in my area so I finally opted to order the black white and silver shatter. The black shatter came with a greenish gold color to put under it. I did not like this combo at all. I tried the black shatter over different colorsand the best has to be light pastel colors in my opinion. But even with the other lighter colors I was not very amazed and felt a bit dissappointed with the actual product. I have not even cracked open the other color shatter polish that I ordered since the first was kind of a flop for me. But that&#x27;s ot to say it won&#x27;t be amazingly cool to someone else. If you&#x27;re into nail polish I would say give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was told my toes look professional, and I suck at painting nails.  This product looks awesome when it dries. Worth buying Black Shatter, if you can find it.</li>
    <li> I love this set! I have tried crackle polish before, and I wasn&#x27;t pleased. I love the color and the quality. I would say definitely pay attention to the directions. Make sure that the color is dry before you apply the shatter. If it&#x27;s not dry, the crackle paint wont last. Then when it&#x27;s done add a light top coat. I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and even with closed toe shoes my paint hasn&#x27;t chipped yet. The color appears green, but on my nails it&#x27;s a nice gold. I&#x27;m going to get more from the line!</li>
    <li> The shatter works great (although does chip off quickly. Noted works better if placed on a topcoat over the nail polish). But disappointed in Simply Smashing for STAINING the nail. After removal a yellow stain is left on the nail which is virtually impossible to remove. Color is pretty but did not expect a product from OPI to leave such a bad yellow stain on nails.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I tried this with the black shatter... my nails looked amazing.  But the following week when I removed the nail polish (with 100% acetone mind you), much to my horror I discovered my nails had been stained bright yellow.  I used this nail polish in April and it is now mid-June.  The yellow never faded... I have just had to wait for it to grow out a 1/3 of my nails are still an ugly yellow color. The color is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all because of the staining. :(</li>
    <li> This dynamic duo of polishes blew me away. Serena&#x27;s color is like a funky green tennis ball with sparkly golden undertones. Very pretty on it&#x27;s on own. When you add the shatter...OH MAN, takes your nails to a new level. People were actually grabbing my hands looking at my nails in awe. It was risque for me since I&#x27;m more a conservative polish wearer, however I so enjoyed wearing this. It was easy to apply, my new favorite. The black shatter dries quickly only 1 coat is needed. This black shatter can go over any color polish with the exception of holographic nail polishes, made a big mess, lol. Must have for nail polish lovers, you won&#x27;t be sorry. I had my order in less than a week, fast shipping. Very pleased &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> I just have to say that I can&#x27;t believe how FAST this order got to me!  I was so excited to see it arrive today when I was thinking that it would get her next week.  Great packaging too!  Would definitely buy from this seller again!!!!</li>
    <li> Crackle Nail Polish is so crazy popular right now and having the faces of Katy Perry and Serena Williams is making it that much more popular! Bought this set because it seemed like a bargain instead of just the black crackle.  Plus the Smashing Pumpkins color itself is really pretty- darker gold- green tint color.  It was really easy to use! Tried it out for the first time and I loved the way it looks.  The black crackle is comes off matte so it looks even more amazing when you put a clear top coat- I love the fast dry Seche Viche.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the black crackle with other colors to see the combo effect.  I ordered the China Glaze Grey and White crackle so will compare brands!</li>
    <li> Really, really pretty when you apply it, even on the first coat but as you layer the polish it only get&#x27;s more intense and vibrant.</li>
    <li> The product is great and price was too. The company was very helpful dealing with a lost item, through no error of their own. Thanks.</li>
