      <li>Just as expected and perfect for what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It fits easily in my purse so I can take the oils with me that I may need during the day.</li>
      <li>The remaining six slots easily hold 5ml bottles, but not the 15ml bottles.</li>
      <li>The fabric is nice with a pretty design.  </li>
      <li>If it going to just hold oils on a desk or something it would be fine.</li>
      <li>Perfect little case for travel.</li>

      <li>Positive side of that is the oils are very secure for travel</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a great little travel bag at a great price.</li>
      <li>I love it so much I ordered one for my sister and she loves hers too.</li>
      <li>Perfect for ten bottles of essential oils.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is nice sturdy fabric with net holders inside for separate oil bottles.</li>
      <li>Nice bag for a few oils :)</li>
      <li>just the right size for your purse.</li>
      <li>Super cute pouch to hold both 5ml and 15ml bottles of essential oils.</li>
      <li>It does not have as much cushion as I would like if it were full.</li>
      <li>Love the size and how it holds the oils upright and has extra room in between for additional items.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this bag for my essential oils.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>;).</li>
      <li>I love this bag to carry essential oils in.</li>
      <li>The seller is great, and delivery was earlier than expected.</li>
      <li>Will attempt to sew back together but wish it held up a little better on it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>Well-made and about the size of a large pencil case</li>
      <li>The elastic is nice and tight</li>
      <li>I am really bummed...</li>
      <li>However, 15ml bottles only fit into the four end slots.</li>
      <li>I did extensive research and liked the inside and organizing of this product for essential oil bottles.  </li>
      <li>I can carry 10 of my favorite 15mL bottles with room for a couple of my roller bottles in the center!  </li>
      <li>This has not been filled completely with bottles that would possibly result in the seam issues.  </li>
      <li>I use this everyday, very spacious, many compliments as well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to carry your oils in your purse or for travel.</li>
      <li>I love this little case!  </li>
      <li>Love this bad for my essentail oils :)</li>
      <li>Even though there are only 10 pouches inside, several more bottles came be added to the center section.</li>
      <li>I can fit 10 bottles of essential oils in the side pockets, and larger roll-on bottles in the middle.</li>
      <li>The fabric is thick canvass, and each EO fits securely in the individual slots so they don&#x27;t touch.</li>
      <li>I do not like that after only 2 months of use that it is falling apart at the seams which is unfortunate because I really like how it is secure...</li>

<li> bottles are a bit difficult to retrieve from the inside netting, but probably becausei use the small ones.</li>
<li> A little disappointing, since I even emailed the seller.</li>

    <li> THIS BAG WAS OVERPRICED AND UGLY.BUT I&#x27;LL KEEP IT. i DON&#x27;T WANT TO BE BOTTERED TO RETURN IT.</li>
    <li> The best and cutest oil holder ever!!</li>
    <li> I love this bag to carry essential oils in. The bag is well constructed.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this bag.  I did extensive research and liked the inside and organizing of this product for essential oil bottles.  I do not like that after only 2 months of use that it is falling apart at the seams which is unfortunate because I really like how it is secure... just don&#x27;t like the poor construction.  I purchased 2, one for myself and one for my mom to use.  She also likes the bag but she is starting to have the same issue at the seams.  This has not been filled completely with bottles that would possibly result in the seam issues.  I am really bummed...</li>
    <li> bottles are a bit difficult to retrieve from the inside netting, but probably becausei use the small ones. i use the case for convenient  travel, i like that the bottles can stand up.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and fits nicely in my purse.</li>
    <li> Nice carrier for the price.  1/2 the price of the other I bought but also thinner material.  Best bet is to judge by how much you carry with you!  I prefer the higher priced that is thicker &amp; more padded in that I carry my oils with me everywhere.  If it going to just hold oils on a desk or something it would be fine.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, very spacious, many compliments as well.</li>
    <li> Nice bag for a few oils :)</li>

    <li> This bag is perfect for traveling with essential oils. However, 15ml bottles only fit into the four end slots. The remaining six slots easily hold 5ml bottles, but not the 15ml bottles. A little disappointing, since I even emailed the seller. But, it will still get plenty of use!</li>
    <li> Love this! Holds my oils perfectly and fits wonderfully in my purse. It&#x27;s a cute, practical and perfect way to keep my oils on the go with me.</li>
    <li> I like this case but getting oils in and out can be hard. Positive side of that is the oils are very secure for travel</li>
    <li> Nice size and nice looking exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Enough room for 10 bottles.</li>
    <li> Super cute pouch to hold both 5ml and 15ml bottles of essential oils. Even though there are only 10 pouches inside, several more bottles came be added to the center section.</li>
    <li> The oil bags are really nice but the two I ordered didn&#x27;t come in the colors I asked for and I got two black ones instead</li>
    <li> Great bag for the price.  Cute.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my purse.</li>
    <li> Perfect little case for travel. It holds about 16  5ml bottles because of the space in the center. It could also hold rollerballs there as well. Others have said it would hold 2 15ml on the ends but I don&#x27;t see it. That is just me. Overall, it is a great little travel bag at a great price. Style and color are very cute!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oils carrying case. I carry it in my medium-size purse with me every day. I can carry the ten oils as shown in the description plus a couple extra bottles in the middle of the case (loose) if needed. The case holds 5 ml, 15 ml, and the 10 ml roll-on essential oils bottles. The elastic is nice and tight so I don&#x27;t worry at all about the bottles getting loose.</li>
    <li> Great case to carry oils when traveling.</li>
    <li> Love it. Holds oils nicely. Can fit two 5ml bottles in one pocket</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this bag for my essential oils.  I can carry 10 of my favorite 15mL bottles with room for a couple of my roller bottles in the center!  I wish they were still available to order another!!!  Great seller to work with as well!  Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the size and how it holds the oils upright and has extra room in between for additional items. Made up a 4oz. spray bottle of Thieves as a hand sanitizer. That fits nicely there. Unfortunately, after only a month of use has torn on the top. Will attempt to sew back together but wish it held up a little better on it&#x27;s own. Perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t have put the Thieves bottle in the middle. ;).</li>
    <li> I love this bag!  It holds my 5 and 15 ml EO bottles as well as a few roll-ons in the middle.  It has become my favorite EO travel case.  I would definitely buy this bag again, or possibly in a larger size now that my EO collection is growing.</li>
    <li> love it!! just the right size for your purse.</li>
    <li> This is a nice bag for oils. It is nice sturdy fabric with net holders inside for separate oil bottles. It does not have as much cushion as I would like if it were full. Would work well as a cosmetic bag where you only wanted to carry a 3-4 oils. It will hold 10.</li>
    <li> Nice case. I can carry 14 10 ml bottles</li>
    <li> Great EO bag and cute design! The fabric is thick canvass, and each EO fits securely in the individual slots so they don&#x27;t touch. It&#x27;s about the size of a pencil bag. I can carry my top 9 oils plus 15ml of carrier oil everywhere I go. The seller is great, and delivery was earlier than expected. I will be ordering more of these for friends and family.</li>
    <li> Perfect when traveling for all of your oil needs! Cute and well made.</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;traveling oil bag&amp;#34; and I love it.  It keeps oils bottles snug and safe.</li>
    <li> Love this bad for my essentail oils :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this holder along with another one and decided to return this one because it wasn&#x27;t as durable as I needed.</li>
    <li> I love this little case!  Mostly  I carry 10 - 10ml bottles, a couple 5ml bottles too, and I can always squeeze one or two down the middle section if I need to.  I have also put 15 ml bottles in as well, I just can&#x27;t carry as many then. I love it so much I ordered one for my sister and she loves hers too. It&#x27;s the perfect size to put in a bag, the car, or diaper bag. It really will hold quite a few bottles and still zip up.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter said I did a good job of selecting this stylish essential oils carrying case!</li>
    <li> This bag is just what I wanted. It has 10 mesh pockets to put my oils and keep in place. No elastic or velcro. I highly recommend this product to carry your oils in your purse or for travel.</li>
    <li> Just as expected and perfect for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love!!!! Perfect size for all my favorite oils and compact enough to through in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is a well made, quality item. I can fit 10 bottles of essential oils in the side pockets, and larger roll-on bottles in the middle. It fits easily in my purse so I can take the oils with me that I may need during the day. I will look for this seller again and buy a slightly larger version.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s pretty but the elastic is too tight for my deTorra 15ml oil bottles, hard to get it in and out. but the purse is beautiful. would have give it 5 stars if  this can be resolved.</li>
    <li> Great for carrying 5 &amp; 10 ML bottles.</li>
    <li> This bag holds all my essential oils perfectly and fits great in my purse!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s softer than I had anticipated which for me means that it is not as protective of the oils as I had hoped. Like another reviewer mentioned some of the stitching had not been completed.</li>
