<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been SUCH a lifesaver. I use it both as a skin wash and in a sitz bath, and it has proven more healing and less painful than Epsom salts. Instead of causing pain, this natural salt, when mixed correctly to 1% per the product description here on Amazon, relieves pain and soothes irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix 1 tablespoon of this salt in 1/2 gallon of warm water. (That was my approximation fir a slightly hypertonic solution, like seawater.) Then you can use it as a soak or a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super fine grain allows it to dissolve quickly and easily, it smells beautiful, and it is so much gentler on my skin than all the alternatives I have tried. If you are unsure, go for it!  You won&#x27;t regret this wonderful healing salt, and the price with Prime shipping here really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Awesome for Baths...peaceful relaxation! I purchased this item for my mini spa days at home and was delighted with it&#x27;s calming effects. I would recommend if you are looking for a quality bath salt.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Himalayan salts have over 80 minerals.  I poured it&lt;br /&gt;into a bowl and added essential oils like orange and lemon...stirred it up&lt;br /&gt;and put it into small mason jars.  It made for great gifts.  I like the fine&lt;br /&gt;salt because it dissolves faster in the tub.</li>
    <li> Made the water soft and silky. Want to get more.</li>
    <li> We enjoyed our healing baths and definitely will order again. If you have never tried a bath with Himalyan Pink Crystal salt, you are in for a treat. Fast and efficient service, too. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Wonderful in the bath, and very pretty in an extra-large apothecary jar on the guest bath counter; I&#x27;ve gotten lots of complements on it. So nice to know I&#x27;m soaking in healthy salts without all the artificial additives and chemical scents.</li>
    <li> Very gritty and never did dissolve all the way during bath.  Nine year old agreed and asked me not to use it again..</li>
    <li> This is overpriced nonsense. It is salt, dyed pink and has no health benefits whatsoever. One of the other reviews said it came in a really pretty glass jar. Because of that and the price, I decided to give it a try. The review was a lie - it comes in a plastic bag, not in a jar. I suspect that review was from the seller of this crap just trying to trick people into wasting their money. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Amazing, will purchase again, perfect for homemade bath salts!!</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift to my sister  and she said that she loved it</li>
    <li> No real smell.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t change the water.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t feel relaxing at all.&lt;br /&gt;I was highly excited to get this product but was very let down):</li>
    <li> I bought this for detoxification purposes to improve my health, as the description made it sound like it was used for. I did not notice anything major, but it made a nice and relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this product, first of all when it arrived was leaking from the package itself. It was big mess when I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;They should have double seal on this kind of packages. Basically I had to clean up the mess and more then half I had to throw since it spill all over. Want buy this again😡</li>
    <li> These are a good deal for the price.  I think this may be food grade salt but because it was labeled &amp;#34;bath salts&amp;#34; I have only used this as a comforting soak.  I have purchased food grade Himalayan salt in a disposable grinder and I am very pleased with the smooth flavor of this. I now buy low sodium products so I can add the Himalayan salt.  Regular table salt is bitter in comparison.</li>
    <li> Seemed way too expensive to me, then I saw it in a local store for much less.  it was fine in the tub, nothing earth-shattering.</li>
    <li> Super soothing bath salts, super fast shipping, and works wonders. The scent is very nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of bathes but started taking them for health reasons. I was told to use Epsom salt and found the Himalyan Salt and really like it for detoxing. Gave some to a friend and she Really likes it too.  We&#x27;ll be back for more !</li>
    <li> This was supposed to be from Spice Lab and instead was repackaged from IndusClassic. Not the same at all. You&#x27;d think salt is salt, but it didn&#x27;t look as pictured, and there were no instructions for use, and it just came in a ziplock type bag.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bath salt.  I will be using it to make Christmas gifts with using a bath salts recipe I found online.  The price through amazon was great.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that since these were super fine they would dissolve quickly. That was not the case. It did not have any smell nor did my skin feel softer. It seemed like fine salt that was colored. The did mention that it could leave so black stuff when you drained the tub. So don&#x27;t be surprised there. I did not feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these as gifts. They&#x27;re pretty pink but they come in a plastic bag, not in the beautiful shell container in the picture. So I bought 3 [[ASIN:B007K9D26I Prodyne Sugar Please Acrylic Sugar Jar with Spoon in Glacier]] to go with them. The &#x27;sugar&#x27; containers are nice because they&#x27;re pretty, unbreakable, covered (against humidity) and come with a spoon to sprinkle the salts under running water in the tub. They look pretty in the bathroom. No suds so you can add something for bubbles if you wish. I&#x27;m told the salts dissolve fast. The salt and container together make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Good product, but a bit expensive.  Will buy occasionally to treat myself</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Himalayan Crystal Bath Salts, I got the coarse salts first, and they are really good, but I like the Fine Grain better, The just dissolve better with the same quality.</li>
    <li> I love to relax in a very hot bath with salts and essential oils.  When I used this salt in my bath I found it to be very gritty.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the salt did not dissolve all the way or there were stones ground with the salt, but I found it so uncomfortable that I  ended my bath after only a few minutes.  I now have a kilo of this stuff which I will probably turn into a salt scrub to use in the shower, but never again in a bath.</li>
    <li> As someone who loves bath salts and gets a lot of therapeutic satisfaction for my tired old joints...these salts do nothing.  No relief whatsoever and they don&#x27;t really dissolve so I have way too much grit left over.  It is like bathing on top of kosher salt, very uncomfortable underneath. When I pulled the plug...I watched a gooey mess of pink gelatinous stuff slide down the drain.  Probably from Hoboken rather than Himalayan.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife for Christmas, she says it is okay, but not as fragrant as she had hoped, will look elsewhere the next time</li>
    <li> I got them right away.  Kudos to the Spice Lab.  I gave them as gifts and have heard nothing but wonderful feedback.  I wouldln&#x27;t hesitate to recommend them.</li>
    <li> very relaxing nice smell.</li>
    <li> These are bath salts and they seem to work pretty well. Pink color is a bonus. Fat sack will last a while.</li>
    <li> Nice large bag of bath salts.  The smell is negligible (which I actually wish it scented the bathroom a little better).</li>
    <li> Like being at a spa!! These salts are really wonderful. They dissolve really quickly and don&#x27;t dry out my skin. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It dissolved well but I was disappointed that there was no nice smell to it. It didn&#x27;t smell bad just no smell at all. This may be typical for Himalayan Pink salts for your bath as this was my first time buying any so I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> Very nice will try dead sea salt also available here too makes my skin soft</li>
    <li> Trying to live with less chemicals that is all I use for taking a bath. You can mix some essential oils with it and have a lovely smelling healthy bath.</li>
    <li> I bought this for detox bathing and was so impressed with the salt that I filled a mason jar and put it on the kitchen table!</li>
    <li> I use the salts with the essential oil to make my own bath products. Great to soften skin and relaxing.</li>
    <li> Took a bath with it and basically used it to create my own personal spa bath incl essential oils.  This salt made my skin feel very soft.  I would not recommend putting in too much or sitting in it for too long as it starts to burn on the skin.  I am planning on replacing all of my sea salt to this Himalayan salt to cook as I understand it has many benefits as well for ingestion.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; transaction</li>
    <li> Works great in my salt scrub. this salt send to be perfect for my salt scrub. I am not sure what other uses it has, but it really seems great.</li>
    <li> Meets all its claims.  Will buy a bigger size next time.  Want to try adding essential oils.  Make wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> I love the size of this salt but I really wish it had a smell. I had to add a smell to make it better.</li>
    <li> love how I feel when I soak in these salts!! Really helps the joints!! I only wish it was sent correctly the first time.</li>
    <li> I purchased these bath salts for my baby shower to put in the favor bags.  Everyone loved the little gift.</li>
    <li> love this for my bath scrubs!</li>
    <li> Love this pink salt!  The texture is just right for a good foot-soak and dissolves rapidly in warm water.  It&#x27;s also perfect on the table or stovetop in a salt shaker.  Tastes great; has lots of salty zip, with abundant minerals.  Doctors tell people my age to reduce their salt intake because of high blood pressure, etc., but I&#x27;ve used it to my heart&#x27;s content for several years and have not developed any BP difficulties.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful salt! Made my scrubs and soaks beautiful. Will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> We use this in our foot machine.  It uses this salt and sucks out all the mad stuff in your body.  This salt was the best buy I saw anywhere.</li>
    <li> Beautiful pink crystals are very evenly sized, perfect to create bath salts for your holiday gifting. Why use dyes when this is so pretty naturally!</li>
    <li> Great Deal!  Great Quality!</li>
    <li> i did not receive product. I was sitting at home and got a text it was outside. When I Got to the door nothing</li>
    <li> My mom bought these for my baby shower last year to use as a favor and they looked so pretty in the jar. I do wish they were more smelly though.</li>
    <li> In addition to recommending Himalayan bath salt to all of my patients to relax before going to bed, I use them myself. Because lavender Himalayan bath salt is a bit overpowering, I mix lavender and pink 50/50. All of my patients concur -- once you try it, you&#x27;re hooked! The fine grain dissolves rapidly.</li>
    <li> While working around the house I was so soar.  I took a hot bath poured in the salt and soaked......aaaahhhhh.  Certainly helped.  The cute little spoon that came with the salt is just that, cute, I needed more than that so I just poured it in.</li>
    <li> Poor Package And My Salt Was Spilled in the Box</li>
    <li> It was my first time using this kind of salt and company. I was very satisfied with the product. Made my skin feel great and helped with my Hidradenitis Suppurativa sores. Salt is the best and most natural form healing. This salt was pure and ground fine so it dissolved fast not perfumes or dyes. It was great. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> works great, feel amazing after a bath in these salts!</li>
    <li> Came as expected. I&#x27;m using this salt for a shower party favor, putting it in jars with ribbons. It&#x27;s color is beautiful and it&#x27;s perfect for my needs!</li>
    <li> Perfect for bath time</li>
    <li> YES! Love to mix the coarse and fine salt &amp; add some essential oils!</li>
    <li> I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE LOW COST AND THEN THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE SALTS, I HAVE PAID WAY MORE FOR LESS AND THEN THE QUALITY WASN&#x27;T THERE.  THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.  NOW I NEED TO GO SOAK AGAIN AS IT IS SO RELAXING:)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nightly footbaths, to aid in detoxifying, as well as ease my tired feet at the end of a long day. I am very satified with the purchase. The salt dissolves easily into hot water, it seems to be doing so without any artificial means. It seems to be pure himalayian salt, as advertised. My feet were soft and pain free after 35- 40 minutes of soaking with 1/4 c of the salt and a few drops of essential olis. Usually I can only soak for 20 minutes, I have to force myself to sit still for that long, but I dozed off for a few minutes, until my son looked over at me and laughed and woke me up. I recommend this to anybody who likes to soak often, it&#x27;s a large ammount so if you just want to try it out then go for a smaller bag of it. Great price on a 5 star product! I will buy this brand again when I need more.</li>
