<li> I wasn&#x27;t hoping for much and so this wasn&#x27;t a huge disappointment...</li>
<li> though so it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> The train behind the crown is a bit shorter than I expected, but the overall look is sweet.</li>
<li> also arrived all the way from China in a plastic envelope, so EVERY flower was completely squished flat and the vine is green, not brown, as shown in the pictures.  </li>
<li> the tails arent as long as pictured</li>
<li> The flowers were a bit flat and closed when they arrived from the shipping bag, so I squeezed them and rolled the petals until they looked fuller.</li>
<li> Not high quality</li>
<li> A little bit big</li>
<li> I recieved it and it was crushed.  </li>
<li> Added some pink and purple daisies</li>
<li> Of course coming from China it would take a little while longer than the other purchases I made that same day</li>
<li> The hang downs are a little long</li>
<li> I guess I should have expected this - for $5!</li>
<li> Not worth returning, so I&#x27;ll probably just unravel it and use it as a ribbon when wrapping a gift.</li>
<li> This sucks big time</li>
<li> but it got here a day before the earliest day in the expected delivery, as is usually the case with Amazon.</li>
<li> Thought the train of leafs would be a little longer</li>
<li> The crown is a bit too big for my head and the flowers are not only made out of paper, but all of them were crushed badly when I received the package.</li>
<li> but I just wrapped them around a few times and problem solved.</li>
<li> Its ripped , the flowers look like crumpled paper and its not even round anymore.</li>
<li> Like seriously?????</li>
<li> But seriously tho...</li>
<li> why not plastic NORMAL fake flowers????!!!!!</li>
<li> I ordered it just to get an idea of how an artificial halo might look.</li>
<li> its Hong Kong dont mean yall have to bust out origami flowers!!!???</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> Love this.  I think I am too old to actually wear it?  But it still looks great on my lamp.</li>
    <li> Worked great for my daughters Halloween costume.  Not high quality though so it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> great buy! great price! looks good!</li>
    <li> Pretty cute, somewhat cheap looking but what do you expect from china. Fits on top of your head not around like other flower headbands. Has no stretch but bends slightly to where you can fit it on your head. Recommend pining down with bobby pins to make sure it stays.</li>
    <li> It looks great in person, especially for the price! I ordered it just to get an idea of how an artificial halo might look. I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
    <li> The delivery date estimation was April 30-May 17 and I got it on April 16th! What a great surprise! The flower crown is so cute and exactly what the picture shows, it looks gorgeous on and fits perfectly! Anyone looking for a flower crown for the spring/summer: this is a must have! Great price and quality!</li>
    <li> Love it! Added some pink and purple daisies now it is perfect for my upcoming bohemian hippie wedding at the end of the month!</li>
    <li> Very easy to add my personal touches. I look forward to wearing this later this month for my wedding celebration.</li>
    <li> So it just arrived, in a plastic bag no packing stuff to protect it....ITS CRUMPLED AND MANGLED!! THE FLOWERS ARE FREAKING ORIGAMI!!! Like seriously????? Just bc its Hong Kong dont mean yall have to bust out origami flowers!!!??? why not plastic NORMAL fake flowers????!!!!! I was even gonna use this for my outdoors wedding and I CANT BC ITS SO UNUSABLE! But seriously tho...origami??? This sucks big time</li>
    <li> Its cheap but I like it and you obviously knew it was cheap when you bought it for such little money.</li>
    <li> I recieved it and it was crushed.  I cant even salvage it. Its ripped , the flowers look like crumpled paper and its not even round anymore. Pissed!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t hoping for much and so this wasn&#x27;t a huge disappointment...It is very cheaply made and the flowers are so fake it is unwearable. Not worth returning, so I&#x27;ll probably just unravel it and use it as a ribbon when wrapping a gift. I posted a picture to help show the quality.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have expected this - for $5! The crown is a bit too big for my head and the flowers are not only made out of paper, but all of them were crushed badly when I received the package. I was able to rejuvenate the flowers for the most part, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s still cute. I can wear it and fully transform into the faerie and woodland nymph I actually am :D</li>
    <li> I intertwined two together and it worked perfectly for my wedding</li>
    <li> I love it and they are perfect for my bridesmaids.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. Love it. I wear it often, it fits nicely and looks so good, very sheek and 70&#x27;s look.</li>
    <li> Cute.  Easy to adjust to fit my toddler.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.......This is super cheap and dinky....also arrived all the way from China in a plastic envelope, so EVERY flower was completely squished flat and the vine is green, not brown, as shown in the pictures.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> very cute and well made. the tails arent as long as pictured so i just wrapped them around the crown.</li>
    <li> Of course coming from China it would take a little while longer than the other purchases I made that same day but it got here a day before the earliest day in the expected delivery, as is usually the case with Amazon. I was excited when it finally got here. It&#x27;s even prettier than in the pictures. I got it for the flower girl in my wedding and it&#x27;s beautiful. I&#x27;d recommend it for sure!</li>
    <li> The train behind the crown is a bit shorter than I expected, but the overall look is sweet. The flowers were a bit flat and closed when they arrived from the shipping bag, so I squeezed them and rolled the petals until they looked fuller. With patient fingers there shouldn&#x27;t be any rips or damage. The little pearls are a nice glossy touch and the green is pleasant. A very sweet look for a young lady.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought it she loves it. She wears it all the time. She would buy another one. Great item</li>
    <li> Beautiful. I love it, thankyou!</li>
    <li> i never reseved this item so why shoud I leave good fed back I know it was only a couple dollars but it is the idea of it</li>
    <li> Super cute and my favorite style.  I&#x27;ve been trying everywhere to find one its wirey like this and will just sit on top of my hair and it seems this may be the only one. I personally love it. The hang downs are a little long but I just wrapped them around a few times and problem solved. It&#x27;s a little cheap but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Thought the train of leafs would be a little longer they&#x27;re pretty short but still wearable</li>
    <li> Love it when my daughter wears this flower crown.</li>
    <li> I love my Bohemian Style head band! So dainty and cute! I wear it out on dates with husband and I get alot of compliments!</li>
    <li> A little bit big but it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
