    <li> Broke after less than a week of gentle home use.</li>
    <li> Cheap and easy to use.  Saves on always spilling a big bottle.</li>
    <li> The supply  tube splits easily  and if u want  to keep using them you have to figure out how to make them work!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner. It was well packaged. But the metal top of this bottle (the whole reason to buy this thing) is very cheap, scratched up and does not look new at all.</li>
    <li> crappy dont get this buy a better quality one this one sucks&lt;br /&gt;regretted it immediately!!&lt;br /&gt;flimsy. cheap. not worth it...</li>
    <li> The 3rd time I used it, the pump doesn&#x27;t work any more. I contacted the seller many days ago but they didn&#x27;t answer my email. It&#x27;s a very bad quality. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what i was looking for. the only complaint i have is that it does leak a little around the top, but i am sure i can figure out what the problem is. great product and super happy with my purchase</li>

    <li> It broke about 2 days after I got it because the stick was not right</li>
    <li> A great helo when your working with others. Saves product time and space.</li>
    <li> This pump worked great for about an hour... then the little tube that goes into the alcohol split so it wouldn&#x27;t pump anymore.  I had the great idea to just use the other end.  I flipped the tube around and attached the other end to the metal pump and- PRESTO!  That worked for all of 5 pumps and then that end split as well.  So now i have nothing more than a fancy bottle of alcohol on my nail table.  It worked great at first but i wish it came with a bag full of replacement tubes.  This is going in the trash. &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> Wished the bottle to be glass. Discretion did not make that clear.</li>
    <li> So easy to clean nails now!  Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get one of these sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it zero stars if I could. Broke right away and I never ended up using it.</li>
