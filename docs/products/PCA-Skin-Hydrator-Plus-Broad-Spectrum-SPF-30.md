      <li>This product is a great daily moisturizer and sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>My order was shipped on time, item was well packed and arrived exactly as described online.  </li>
      <li>Great for all types of skin, my husband has normal and I have delicate skin.</li>
      <li>It really is non-comedogenic (spelling?)</li>
      <li>VERY GREASY.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>The product itself is a lightweight, unscented, untinted facial moisturizer with an SPF 30--very clean and gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it go on smooth, have a high SPF(non ickey smelling SPF) and act as an illuminator, it also battles discoloration/blotchy skin with consistant use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really fluid, absorbs quickly, does not leave white cast and feels comfortable on the skin.</li>
      <li>I love all PCA products and this did not let me down.</li>

      <li>Light and non greasy, pump bottle puts out just the little you need and keeps product clean, lasts long time.</li>
      <li>I use it pretty much every morning (other than in the middle of the summer when I switched to a higher SPF), and it has served me very well.</li>
      <li>I first started using this when I got a facial, she sold the line.</li>
      <li>I am a travel photographer, and in the heat of summer I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation when I am working outside, so this is all I will use on those hot summer days.  </li>
      <li>PCA products are my favorites as my skin is sensitive to break outs even at the age of 59.</li>
      <li>I am 58 years old with combination skin.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and you only need a little bit so the pump bottle should last you sometime.</li>
      <li>Will definitely reorder from this merchant in the near future.  </li>
      <li>However it doesn&#x27;t last as a durable all-day long spf if you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time outside in direct sun.</li>
      <li>but I cannot live without it and will not use any other product.  </li>

    <li> Not only does it go on smooth, have a high SPF(non ickey smelling SPF) and act as an illuminator, it also battles discoloration/blotchy skin with consistant use. My skins glows when I wear this(which is every day). It does not make me break out. It does not make my skin feel greasy. It does take a few minutes to absorb but I cannot live without it and will not use any other product.  I&#x27;ve tried many. At the age of 30, I can finally wear a facial moisturizer everyday like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
    <li> Great price on a wonderful product for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not the same products. Made with different ingredients. Made my skin breakout. Used PCA products for 10 yrs. Not happy with my order at all.</li>
    <li> I love all PCA products and this did not let me down.</li>
