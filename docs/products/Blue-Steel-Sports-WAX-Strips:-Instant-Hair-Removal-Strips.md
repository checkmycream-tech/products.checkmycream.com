      <li>Make sure your skin is body temp before using!&lt;br</li>
      <li>when we go on a cruise :).</li>

      <li>more like Sasquatch or something.  </li>
      <li>so I decided better of it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping item was great</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get the sticky stuff off my neck using the recommended procedure.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure to follow the directions</li>

      <li>for the most part.</li>
      <li>Theses work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Blue Steel Wax Strips based on the fact that it had good reviews (to be honest, more so because of the Ben Stiller Zoolander</li>

      <li>I found that Coconut Oil is the best thing to get rid of the sticky mess</li>
      <li>I was looking for a long time for a good product!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving the new smooth him!</li>

      <li>These worked great to remove my upper lip hair.  </li>

      <li>Easy to use, just separate the pads, take a hair dryer to them quickly, apply, and riiiiiiiiip....</li>
      <li>I am an amateur at home waxer and these were one of the best products I have used.</li>
      <li>I love how easy it is to warm the product up, between your hands is the only requirement, and quick to use.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time and the first product of this kind that I have used.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;You really had to get the strips warm through activation and pull the hair in the right direction.  </li>
      <li>Most important is to check the direction of the hair growth and to keep the skin very taut when you pull the strip off quickly.  </li>
      <li>wasnt as expected but still worked great if used correctly</li>
      <li>It works well for waxing bikini area and safe for the sack area and works very well</li>

      <li>I primarily use it for facial waxing and its so easy I love it.</li>
      <li>I was able to get my feet, shoulders, neck, and most of my back with one box.  </li>
      <li>With the first removal of the first strip, my wife was able to remove 6 months worth of growth as well as a 37 year old mole and that pesky top layer or two of skin.  </li>
      <li>Easy and ready to use.</li>
      <li>First off, this hurts like a b*tch!</li>
      <li>So, I got these strips to try on myself, and I tried them on my fianc&amp;eacute; to see if they worked on him first!  </li>
      <li>His skin was pretty soft and with minimal irritation when we were done and it looks awesome.  </li>
      <li>really leaves the skin smooth.</li>
      <li>Worth it though.</li>
      <li>I ran right home and tried them out on my underarms that evening.</li>
      <li>Upon receipt of the Wax Strips, I prepped my back with a nice hot shower, forgoing the shampoo and conditioner despite the need for it and asked my wife for assistance.  </li>
      <li>The key I have found is to pull the skin taught (just like the instructions say) to have greater success.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not messy.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery and</li>
      <li>Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that you will need to use a fair number of strips to cover a fairly large area</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll have those sexy human feet you&#x27;ve always wanted</li>
      <li>You can reuse the strips several times which makes the value that much more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item sticks too much to the skin.</li>
    <li> The product was easy to use even for the first timer. It removed the hair, left only couple leftovers. Not too painful. No skin irritation which is a big plus. No real mess/residue left behind. Baby oil took easily take care of the minimal wax residue from the skin. I was able to re-use the strip approx. three times efficiently, although that was not included in the instructions but I gave it a try anyway. I was quite happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband who isn&#x27;t overly hairy, but definitely has more than he (and I) would like especially on his back.  Since he was game for anything and doesn&#x27;t really let pain get in the way I went to work using these strips.  We couldn&#x27;t believe how easy they were to use and that you can reuse each strip 3 and sometimes 4 times each.  His skin was pretty soft and with minimal irritation when we were done and it looks awesome.  A great product that I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Nads brand is better, since they are on cloth. These are on plastic, so they are difficult to use.  They hurt quite a bit more than Nads, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent; painless and effective</li>
    <li> Works very well - just make sure to rub the strips between your hands to get them very warm - works a lot better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. Wax stuck to back and was very difficult to remove. Did not remove hair like advertised. Removed a small patch of hair and left the wax on the rest.</li>
    <li> great product! very easy to use and not much hurt. really leaves the skin smooth.</li>
    <li> So, I got these strips to try on myself, and I tried them on my fianc&amp;eacute; to see if they worked on him first!  Ha, it was funny and awesome at the same time.  You just rub the strip in your hand for about 30 seconds, peel them apart, apply it to the skin, rub it in the direction of the hair, then pull.  His hair was gone!  I tried it on myself yesterday and they worked great (used them on my arm pits).  Of course it hurts, but that&#x27;s just how waxing is.  It only missed a couple of stubborn hairs that were growing in a weird direction.  These strips are great!</li>
    <li> These strips are similar to others I have used but most of the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; stays stuck to my skin without removing hair. Messy..</li>
    <li> Smoother than a baby&#x27;s bum</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t remove all traces of hair, and the glue gets stuck on the skin</li>
    <li> uneven distribution of wax</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It fits to areas you want to wax easy. Since it was my first time waxing I should have ordered some numbing cream since it hurt really bad when pulled off.</li>
    <li> It works well for waxing bikini area and safe for the sack area and works very well I was looking for a long time for a good product!</li>
    <li> This is completely useless - I followed the directions precisely on 5 separate attempts, different days, and at most removed 1/3 of the hair and was extremely painful. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works great and is SO easy to use.  It does leave some irritation on the skin, especially with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It works.  Plain and simple, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It will leave a slight sticky residue on the skin, but it can easily be removed with oil.</li>
    <li> I followed directions.  Rubbed pads for 30 seconds and applied to skin.  Removed almost no chest hair (my hair had never been shaved so was plenty long enough).  Also left a thick, waxy residue that could not be removed with soap.  Had to use Avon Skin So Soft lotion to remove.  Product made in South Africa (no wonder it doesn&#x27;t work).  I am returning.</li>
    <li> I expected Wax Strips!  What I got was a bunch of sticky, messy, glue-like stuff, sandwiched between thin pieces of plastic film.  No wax at all!  The sticky mess did not come off when I pulled the backing off my skin.  The stuff on my skin could not be removed with soap and water.  I had to use dry cleaning fluid to remove the mess.  I should have read the other single star reviews before I wasted money on these !&lt;br /&gt;Review Update October 6, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Just a note to others contemplating buying Blue Steel Sports \\&quot;WAX\\&quot; strips.  Seven out of the nine glowing five star reviews were submitted by people who have only one review.  (Check the \\&quot;See all my reviews\\&quot; links)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get the sticky stuff off my neck using the recommended procedure.  I had to just let it wear off overnight while I slept.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample box of the wax strips and its the best! I primarily use it for facial waxing and its so easy I love it. I used to have a honey waxer and that stuff can get everywhere plus its hard to remove globs of it. But with these wax strips, I just cut it down to size and I&#x27;m done in 5 minutes! TIP: I use coconut oil to remove residue, if any.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no heating, no residue, portable, and it picks up all the hairs in the first pass. This is the best at-home waxing product I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
    <li> It is far superior than other products.</li>
    <li> Too small. Have to keep them warm. By the time i got the two sheets to separate it cooled down. With having to use such short strip it felt worse than getting a tattoo.</li>
    <li> I read the instructions but the wax just stuck to my back and didn&#x27;t pull any hair off.  I ended up shaving it.</li>
    <li> These are excellent strips for men who want to remove unsightly body hair. Don&#x27;t worry, it isn&#x27;t painful to use. If you have never waxed before, it can be slightly uncomfortable; imagine how it feels to rip off a band-aid. If you can handle that, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Give them a try.</li>
    <li> Aggravated the skin and left razor burn like bumps evvvverywhere for a few days...</li>
    <li> It was to sticky and made a mess. Either I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing are this stuff is not all that.</li>
    <li> First time waxing my back...&lt;br /&gt;You really had to get the strips warm through activation and pull the hair in the right direction.  There was little to no pain, but not all the hair came off and you had to do spots over a few times to get all the hair.</li>
    <li> These strips are so easy to use! Easy to heat up and use multiple times.</li>
    <li> Although it is way better than Nads, it still feels like you overpay for what looks like thin scotch tape.</li>
    <li> The results were not good. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m black but I tried using it on my thighs and it picked up only a few hairs each time before I gave up trying.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I was not expecting much (I have never had success with strips), but wow, this really removes hair!  I have extremely thick hair and was able to remove entire sections with one pass.  Just make sure to follow the directions (as everyone else is noting)  It is important to apply in the direction of hair and pull in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li> These worked great to remove my upper lip hair.  Was easy to use and cleanup was no problem.</li>
    <li> It works.... it was easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the seller was polite and even emailed me.  Id consider this product for leggs and arms not sensitive sensitive areas. Just my own experience. makes itchy legg hair and thigh hair gone and smooth. its lasting also! usually if i shave it comes backin a few days! little stubble.. so far.. NOTHING. been awhile still smooth  thats awesome if you ask me,</li>
    <li> This product works great for men, if you are athlete or into fitness and need to get rid of excess body hair !!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on others&#x27; reviews and was not disappointed; it&#x27;s very easy to use, much less messy than many of the alternatives, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> it does remove hair , but although it claims you can use bothsides ,most of wax usually sticks to on side, BIGGEST COMPLAIN STRIPS ARE TOO SMALL you end up using alot strip to remove small amount hair, I think you save about 30-40% by doing this yourself vs paying someone to do it</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great...once you get over the initial fear. Trust me, just go for it. It&#x27;s less painful.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping item was great</li>
    <li> Theses work pretty good.  This is the first time and the first product of this kind that I have used.  I will buy them again.  You can reuse the strips several times which makes the value that much more.</li>
    <li> not worth the money. too sticky and quite misleading because each double strip only really has one good strip. The other is a joke.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and exactly what I ordered. No switch a roo. Product was as described. Totally professional grade. I thought there would be issued due to the low cost point but boy was I mistaken. This stuff seems to rip those hairs out from my soul. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product and service. A++</li>
    <li> These are really good. I had no problem doing under my arms, except I&#x27;d waited for it to grow out for about 3 weeks longer than planned. They still got it off. I&#x27;ve got got dark body hair on light skin and have battled forever. These are THE BEST wax strips I&#x27;ve ever used. I do advise puttin two damp washcloths in the fridge to chill before starting because it will sting. Worth it though.</li>
    <li> First off, this hurts like a b*tch! I give it a 4 star review because it missed some hairs and hurt big time but that&#x27;s expected of course. Other than that, it works as described!</li>
    <li> I received a sample package at a recent cycling event. I typically go to a professional salon for waxing, and have used home wax kits a few times many years ago but they were messy and involved.  I must say I was very pleased with the ease of using these strips.&lt;br /&gt;I tried them on my arms, which I seldom wax.  I was able to reuse each strip two to three times to remove hair from a larger area.  It was painless (I suppose that is relative), NO MESS and very quick!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any residue remaining, but perhaps because I reused the strip a couple of times that it picked up any remaining wax.&lt;br /&gt;I intend to try the other strip on hair I shave often, to see if the strip adheres sufficiently to rip out those bad boys.  I will definitely purchase more of these in the future.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review the day after use of this product that raved about it&#x27;s awesomeness, however about 2 days later realized the hair was coming right back in. It apparently must not have gotten the roots so all of that pain was for nothing. And since then, his whole area that was waxed has broken out in severe acne and it has been several weeks. Not a product for him, threw out the second box purchased, waste of money.</li>
    <li> These wax strips have made my day.....I have used waxes for years on myself but never on anyone else.  My husband agreed to have his shoulders waxed and I&#x27;m loving the new smooth him! I expected him to  object but all it took was a couple of strips and hey presto it was all off!  These are the most effective strips I&#x27;ve tried!  Have to agree with Wax Pro that there are a lot of strips in the pack - 30 - that&#x27;s almost double any of the others.  I also like the slightly smaller size especially for the tricky areas - like shoulders! If the anti-chafe is as good as the strips I&#x27;ll have to give that a go as well!</li>
    <li> I love how easy it is to warm the product up, between your hands is the only requirement, and quick to use.  Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that you will need to use a fair number of strips to cover a fairly large area but it could still be much cheaper than having someone else do it for you.  Cleaning up a few stray sticky residue marks is achieved with any oil, even olive oil which everyone has on hand!!  Definitely read the instructions before hand  and for a home use product this can&#x27;t be beat!!</li>
    <li> Hard to give a pain-inducing product 5 stars, but in this case, it needs to be done.  Apparently the Rogaine that I attempted to spray onto my hairless scalp caught a draft and ended up on my back.  (And if the growth on my back is a direct result of the Rogaine, I can&#x27;t recommend that product enough, the growth is amazingly thick and rapid)  Regardless, my wife said we shouldn&#x27;t shave it because the hair will just grow back thicker and quicker.  I tried to explain to her that that happens to be an old wives tale (already a bad start with the \\&quot;old wives\\&quot; part) because if that were the case, my head would be more full of hair than the Steelers Troy Polamalu, given the fact that I shave it every other day.  Following one eventful family movie night when my 7 year old attempted to \\&quot;braid my hair\\&quot;, I decided it was time to address the ever growing issue.  I ordered the Blue Steel Wax Strips based on the fact that it had good reviews (to be honest, more so because of the Ben Stiller Zoolander \\&quot;Blue Steel\\&quot; reference built into the name of the product).  Upon receipt of the Wax Strips, I prepped my back with a nice hot shower, forgoing the shampoo and conditioner despite the need for it and asked my wife for assistance.  After showing her the product (and waiting for the laughter to subside), she agreed to help.  Her gentle touch and calming reassurance were no match for the in-your-face, kick-you-in-the-teeth strength of the wax strips.  With the first removal of the first strip, my wife was able to remove 6 months worth of growth as well as a 37 year old mole and that pesky top layer or two of skin.  But boy was the area soft!  This was continued around the back and lower neck, half of which I was awake for while the other half the pain had luckily caused me to become unconscious.  The neck and shoulder area were not too bad, the worst was the lower back (around where the love handles would be) as well as the sides on the middle of the back.  Those are apparently sensitive areas.  The strips removed the majority of everything on my back, there were some stragglers that would not be swayed to leave but a quick scouring with the tweezers left my back smooth and silky (albeit red and a bit tender).  For as bad as I make it sound, I have ordered this product multiple times and will continue to do so.  It is a great, mess free product that packs well for travel and just plain works.ve areas.

    <li> Great price but the product was just OK.  I suffer from unwanted hair in all the wrong places.  Just doesn&#x27;t come off that great.</li>
    <li> Read the directions on the box. The first time I used it I pulled off in the wrong direction and I thought the product sucked, but when I read the directions and did it correctly I was able to get everything and even reuse the strips a couple more times.</li>
    <li> After reviewing lots of strip waxes, these are the best ones out there for the money (that WORK). They work even better than most store-bought (and more expensive) &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; ones.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I got these.  It&#x27;s such a little package.  These are indeed double-sided, but to be able to use both sides, you have to warm the strips up (I just tuck them under my shirt for a few minutes), and then pull the plastics sheets apart painfully slow.  Too slow, in my opinion.  Then, apply to where you need, and give it a good rub or pat on the area.  Hold the skin taut, and pull in the opposite direction of growth.  These do a really good job of removing hair, and I can usually use each strip three times before I have to toss it.  But, and this is a big but, it leaves so much residue!  Luckliy, I still had some all natural azulene oil from another company&#x27;s waxing strips.  This has done the trick, except for one time on my legs.  I absolutely could not get the sticky goo off, so my plan to wear a skirt that day was foiled.  Two showers later, it was finally gone.  I basically used a razor and shaved it off!  These did cause minimal irritation for me, which may be because I was also following it with azulene oil. So, a mixed bag.  I really like how much hair these remove, and it seems to be from the root, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
    <li> This is for woman. Not men athletes trying to remove hair. Or men with women hair.</li>
    <li> I have hairy feet.  No, not like &amp;#34;hobbit toes&amp;#34;, I mean *really* hairy feet....more like Sasquatch or something.  We were preparing to go on a cruise to the Caribbean, and the last thing we needed was Animal Control to be called in to shoot me with a tranq dart while I&#x27;m enjoying a foofy girly drink by the ship&#x27;s pool.  Preventative measures needed to be taken!  My wife didn&#x27;t want to deal with traditional waxing methods on my furry feet; so she decided to try this stuff out.  For the most part, this stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use, just separate the pads, take a hair dryer to them quickly, apply, and riiiiiiiiip....You&#x27;ll have those sexy human feet you&#x27;ve always wanted&lt;br /&gt;- Not as messy as traditional waxing methods....for the most part. You do get some residue sometimes. Scrubbing the area with good hand lotion will remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- More expensive than traditional waxing at home&lt;br /&gt;- If the area you are waxing is cold (e.g. cold toes), the wax will fail miserably and stick to your hairy toes.  Make sure your skin is body temp before using!&lt;br /&gt;- One box doesn&#x27;t go very far.  I was able to get my feet, shoulders, neck, and most of my back with one box.  Fortunately, I only do this once a year...when we go on a cruise :).</li>
    <li> I am only a PRO because I have waxed for about 40 years.  I have used all the different wax strips on the market and Blue Steel Sports works for me.  Very generous pack of 30 strips, a bit smaller than most leg strips on the market but I like the size.(It works especially well when I wax my husbands back). I travel a lot and these are so convenient. Most important is to check the direction of the hair growth and to keep the skin very taut when you pull the strip off quickly.  Since I have waxed for so long, I don&#x27;t have to wax very often and the hair is sparse. I am able to use the same strip a few times which makes the pack very economical.</li>
    <li> Ever think something sounds like a good idea....until you try it, and have that, oh s**t moment? This is probably a good product for some people. Maybe it&#x27;s just my Irish skin but yea, not a product for me. I know how to read directions and I know how to use products properly, really I do. It&#x27;s been hot so I figured sure let&#x27;s try and remove some hair from your abs and chest, just in case you want to go for a swim. Applied a patch and my stomach was full of goop. Reading the directions I kept re-applying the patch as it stated would remove the goop. Uh, no, just made it worse. So I grab my phone to look up how to remove this stuff. It&#x27;s at this point I realize I&#x27;ve somehow gotten it on my hands, and now my phone is stuck to my hand. About this time I&#x27;m thinking I could slap some on my knees and crawl around my apartment building like Spiderman it&#x27;s that strong and goopy. The cops though would probably frown upon such a thing so I decided better of it. I found that Coconut Oil is the best thing to get rid of the sticky mess and I just happened to have some. After my bathroom went from a sticky mess to an oily ice skating rink in a matter of seconds I&#x27;m happy to say everything is cleaned up, including me, and I used a razor to finish the job. More trouble than it&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> Make sure to read the whole directions before using it, especially if you never used this type of product before. To get the excess wax off, use baby or mineral oil.</li>
    <li> wasnt as expected but still worked great if used correctly</li>
    <li> Bought these for a friend, worked so well and affordable!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not messy. Gets most hairs out. Kind of pricey.</li>
    <li> Used when getting ready for a century bike ride.  Got it done in my own home and spared the shaver...  I&#x27;d recommend it because its really simple to use.</li>
    <li> I got this product at a half-marathon expo in Washington as a sample. I ran right home and tried them out on my underarms that evening. The strips worked well, and the instructions were very clear. Then I had the after thought, \\&quot;Oh no! You just did that right before a race, where you will maybe chafe!\\&quot; Not the best plan, BUT I didn&#x27;t chafe! I ran and had no problems! The key I have found is to pull the skin taught (just like the instructions say) to have greater success. I tried them on my bikini line a few days later and had equally the same success! Clean up of the wax residue was easily resolved with some baby oil. I am an amateur at home waxer and these were one of the best products I have used. The areas I waxed were only irritated for a couple minutes after each session and were calmed easily with plain lotion. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> These strips work well for removing the hair but they leave a sticky residue.  Other brands did not leave the sticky.</li>
    <li> This product work exactly as described, I will most definitely be reordering as needed.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Easy and ready to use. Great for traveling! No mess, wax is not water soluble, doesn&#x27;t really leave much residue, came off easy with oil (I used azura oil) oh, and they smell great!</li>
    <li> Николаы - Super fast shipping and the strips were fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> Worked really well and there was very little sticky residue mess. I&#x27;ve tried nads in the past and it&#x27;s just a mess. This brand is way better.</li>
