      <li>It&#x27;s nice.  </li>
      <li>It feels kind of \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; to me.  </li>
      <li>When our dog got some kind of sticky stuff on her fur</li>
      <li>My hair stays straight and it has a sort of \\&quot;move\\&quot; to it that is wonderful.  </li>

      <li>The good thing is that it does go through hair easily, but it just did nothing for my hair.  </li>

      <li>I have had more problems with the BBB not sending my membership plaques, stickers, literature that they were supposed to send me and this happened every year with them.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I did not purchase this product on Amazon, however as many others have also said, these people are crooks.  </li>

      <li>I love this product ...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We have finally found an all natural lotion that works!! We got two bottles but will def be ordering more soon!! 5☆</li>
    <li> fantastic conditioner !</li>
    <li> definitely recommend this all natural product. my husband uses this regularly.. he has curly hair.. after having tried everything there is on the market i definitely think this is great. its water based so it is not sticky nor does it leave a residue. also great to use as a moisturizer, a body scrub- i mix it with granulated brown sugar and coffee beans and its a great scrub for dead cells..</li>
    <li> I think its too much money but I do like it.  I&#x27;ve used it for years now.  I love that it is 100% natural.  you could eat it.  Try it out I think its worth the cost it if you like it.</li>
    <li> Pine needles? Are they joking? What happened to the rules the FDA has set on every other cosmetic sold in this country stating the ACTUAL ingredients must be listed?  Why haven&#x27;t these people been investigated? Why are people so naive to believe the list of ingredients?  If they got these ingredients to clean anything, let alone lather, I have a bridge to sell all of you.</li>
    <li> This product is still advertised as packaged as a pump dispenser, but is shipped in a cheap squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it since it is not as advertized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this incredible conditioner for about four years, I discovered it after my hair got almost destroyed after a color process. I use it as a leave in hair conditioner and as a body balm. It will leave your hair like silk and your skin soft with no residue. Also makes a great facial cleanser. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I happend to come across this product when searching for organic condiioners on amazon. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I purchased it at my local whole foods co op today and it was 22.00. It seemed procey but after after using it I decided its well worth the price. I have extremley sensitive skin. I used it to shave and as conditioner in the shower. But what I was most impressed with was it as a skin lotion. It made my skin feel soooo soft and silky. It absorbs well and is not greasey or oily but still leaves a silky soft feeling. I even put it a littl e on my face and I can not use any lotion on my face becaus eit is so sensitive. I love this product and will not get without it form now on!</li>
    <li> I first bought Tate&#x27;s for my husband last year at a health food store and he absolutely loves it.  He uses it as a lotion, but it can also be used to wash body and hair.  It&#x27;s a total conditioner.  We received the order quickly and will re-order again in the future. We sent some to my daughter, who has exzema, but it hasn&#x27;t helped that for her, sorry to say.</li>
    <li> I do not have a skin allergy reaction with this conditioner, which is really great since I react to almost all skin and hair care products.  I also appreciate that this has very little to no smell.  A little bit of this conditioner goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Look at the complaints board regarding this companies business practices and the FACT they refuse to specifically list the truthful ingredients.  They list fruit and nothing else or chemical structures/compounds/enzymes etc.  Just blueberries, strawberries etc.  This is FALSE and I assure you that they would be creating a smoothie and not a conditoner. I am a pharmacist and this just maybe illegal to do what they are.  It may work for you or not, just  not based upon at minimum ingredient omissions and maximum blatent lies</li>
    <li> Love this and use it daily for makeup remover, light skin moisturizer, and happy it is of all natural ingredients</li>
    <li> Tate&#x27;s lotion is wonderful for taking off my make up, and moisturizing my skin without harsh chemicals. Leaves my skin feeling soft without the greasiness most lotions leave behind. Because it is natural, if it gets into my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t even burn. I refuse to use anything but Tate&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Alright, after two days of use this has caused my face to become very red, i used it as a cleanser then moisturized with it, but my face seemed more dirty. I wouldn&#x27;t every use this on my face again. It seems like its just cetaphil repackaged, so i&#x27;m not quite sure how much of the berries, nuts and spices are actually part of the mixture. I would even bet that 90% of that mixture is just water, cetyl alcohol, and salt. Im gonna use the rest of my small bottle as a fabric softener or something. I was disappointed as this was so different then any product i&#x27;ve ever seen before. Im going to stick to olive oil, soap and witch hazel for my skin. Do not use this on your face as seen on [...]. After two days my face feels red and tight. Hope you all luck, this product is misconceiving.</li>
    <li> My husband and I came across this product in a health food store and gave it a try.  It is excellent for various uses, including a body and hair conditioner and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> very light, easily absorbed, pleasant, mild smell. use it a lot</li>
    <li> I have used the conditioner for several years now on my hair after showering and like it (it helps my dry hair). I live in a place where I can&#x27;t find it locally now so I was looking to order it on-line. But after looking at the reviews here questioning the business practice and product ingredients, I decided to call Tate&#x27;s today and ask them firsthand. I spoke with Rachel. When I asked her about whether she was aware of the reviews on Amazon, she said she thought Amazon was probably selling an altered product. That seemed odd since I hadn&#x27;t said anything yet about the nature of the reviews. She laughed when I said there was a review that said it might be made of baking soda. I didn&#x27;t get around to mentioning the review that said it might be cetaphil. I asked her about \\&quot;Kathy&#x27;s Family\\&quot; and she said they are a \\&quot;sister\\&quot; company. While she wasn&#x27;t completely sure what that meant she said they share the same mailing address and the all natural facilities for making the products including a wood filter system. When I said someone thought Tate&#x27;s and Kathy&#x27;s Family make the same product, she said they don&#x27;t and that maybe the shampoos are the most similar. She said the facilities are nearby but not at the 4041 Erie address. (After the call I looked at the BBB review and found out there is yet another company called Natural Sundae at the same address that also makes body care products.) Rachel said it is the citrus plus the wood filter system that removes the color so the product is white. She talked about coconut and citrus combination acts like a soap. Not sure if she also meant that the coconut contributes to the whitening of the product (besides that it is white). She said she didn&#x27;t know how the wood filter works. She wasn&#x27;t aware of the BBB issues except to say they had one UPS shipping complaint recently where a package was lost. I noticed all three companies (Tate&#x27;s, Kathy&#x27;s Family, and Natural Sundae) received F&#x27;s from BBB. There is a note that Tate&#x27;s said they changed their sales procedures last year but BBB continues to receive complaints. The complaints mostly seem to be by small business owners. I actually heard the same story from a local store here (about getting stuff they didn&#x27;t order, etc.). Rachel said they are a very small operation and the owners started out making the conditioner at home. The owners are old (and not very internet oriented) and their children help run the business. Might be more useful to talk to one of their children who might know more.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a little pricey until I considered what I would spend on all these products separately -- and this is far superior to any brand of moisturizer, makeup remover, hair products, or shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s worth $22 to have a product I love and only ONE bottle on the counter! I always shave with this, and since it doesn&#x27;t have to be washed off I used it this morning for a last-minute dry shave, with no rash. I also like it to take off mascara, as facial moisturizer (absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy), and conditioner for my thick, wavy hair (shower or leave-in). Whatever is left on my hands I slather onto the eczema on my arms.  It works great for sunburns, too.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my daughters eczema.i worry about using to much creams with coritzone creams. This Is so much better.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  There is one store I found it in years ago and no where else since, happy to be able to get it online.  No other conditioner compares in terms of performance and ingredients.  I recognize every ingredient on the label, and non of them came from a lab!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this product the label was an instant turn off and using it as a hair conditioner in the shower proved to be useless.  However, I know that things don&#x27;t always work the same for everyone and started trying it for other uses.  It is an amazing detangeler for after the shower for my daughters unruly hair and a little goes a long way.  We have had friends tell us how much they loved it for a skin conditioner so we tried that and loved it.  We took it on our vacation in Mexico and at the resort passed it around to the people who had had too much sun and they asked if we had any for sale. It took the burn out immediately and the next day they were tan instead of burned.  We did notice that if you don&#x27;t get it on right away or within a few hours after the burn happens you will need to re-apply it a few times since the skin is already burned a deeper layer at that time.  I have a friend who does massage and she says her clients love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  I love all the other tates products too especially the acne solution.</li>
    <li> I read about all the great reviews before buying this conditioner, and so I went on with my purchase. I was blown away by all the uses; I ran right to the shower to try both, the conditioner and shampoo out. At first I thought it felt a little watery in my hand, but then I let it soak in my hair while I shaved my legs and so on. After I rinsed it out, my hair was so smooth and fresh; it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down, like when I gob on other creams. ((I have fine hair but SO much of it, I have to use a decent amount of cond. so it doesn&#x27;t knot up or tangle))  I also used it on my legs as I shaved. When I dried off, I even used it as a face cream, body cream, and smoothed a little on my lips! My boyfriend said I felt like silk! SO, I ABSOLUTELY recommend this MIRACLE  cream! I also, HIGHLY recommend The shampoo- you can wash your hair, your face, AND your body at the SAME time!!   P.S.- I am buying this for my sister-in-law to use on my 10month niece, since it so much healthier than Johnson &amp; Johnson baby products! TRY IT :)    -Sarah, Narberth PA</li>
    <li> i got this stuff at a \\&quot;health food store\\&quot; and it was fabulous - but wicked expensive. found it here for MUCH less so i bought 3. it is wonderful - NO SCENT AT ALL. get out of the shower, towel off - use it on your whole body and your hair - theres NO greasy slimy feeling. can use it on your face and it wont feel oily at all. a dime size will detangle your hair and leaves NO residue/traditional heavy conditioner feeling. we have the bottles placed strategically about the house - use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m buying more since my last batch has run out. I use it for my hair, skin, and everything. I even use it to make homemade facial masks.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tate&#x27;s for many many years.  I still am finding new ways to use it.  I have never had any negative reaction to the conditioner.  I feel good about it because it contains all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have used Tates conditioner for years. My dryish fine hair does very well with it as a leave in conditioner. I also use it for skin/tissue irritation and it helps heal considerably and quickly.</li>
    <li> I use this for everything it comes with a booklet to tell you the many ways you can use it, I even use it as a fabric softener</li>
    <li> I picked up this conditioner (and the shampoo) at a friend&#x27;s natural products store about a month ago. It came with a little booklet that listed about a zillion strange uses for this product - everything from a hair product, to an eye cream, to a saddle conditioner, to a fabric softener! But it&#x27;s too expensive for me to want to waste it on anything but my skin or hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thick hair and it works beautifully to detangle and soften my hair. You can rinse it out or use as a leave-in conditioner - it&#x27;s not thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on my skin - hands, elbows, face, and lips. When you rub it in your skin, it disappears almost like water, with NO oily residue left on your hands (I hate oily lotions!) and my skin feels very soft and supple. It doesn&#x27;t burn after shaving. I have applied it to peeling sunburn and it helps to hydrate without any sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a scent that is hard to describe - it&#x27;s not strong or perfumey or fruity... it smells \\&quot;wholesomely plain\\&quot;, and a bit like aloe. (The shampoo on the other hand has a wonderful almond scent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this product has not irritated my eyes or face at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do highly recommend this product. I hope my descriptions help. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used to condition my have hair,body etc. I will always use this product for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I use this for after shave and night face location.  It works like a champ.  Never will I use after shave again.</li>
    <li> great smell, smells clean...feels nice, I &#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> When I first purchased this product I wondered how the listed ingredients could end up as this white emulsion so I had my doubts but after using it for 2 years I am amazed at how it helps my skin. That&#x27;s right, one of the uses for this product is as a skin moisturizer and it is wonderful. It moisturizes without any trace of a greasy feeling and somehow calms my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel itchy in cold weather. It lasts a very long time too.</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT!  EVERY BIT WHAT I EXPECTED!!</li>
    <li> We love Tate&#x27;s.  All skin problems seem helped by it especially healing burns and scrapes.  Not usually what I reach for if I have dry skin since it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak in&amp;#34; as well.  But if I need lotion for the babies, it&#x27;s one of the few I trust.</li>
    <li> Despite the issue with the ingredients list, this shampoo and conditioner are amazing.  They have made my hair thicker and healthier.  I use the shampoo as a face wash, body wash &amp; bubble bath.  I use the conditioner on my skin as a moisturizer, make up remover, lip balm, insect bite/anti-rash balm!  The scent of the shampoo is light - yes, sort of like bubble gum.  It&#x27;s nice.  The conditioner seems to be unscented.  Very wholesome &amp; natural, but also effective.  I am hooked.  GREAT products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  It has replaced my hair conditioners and hair lotions.  I have colored treated hair and it keeps it soft and smooth, doesn&#x27;t look damaged from the color and highlighting.</li>
    <li> I have allergies to just about all the chemicals in most products. I have to have a natural product with mim. chemicals. this is wonderful on my hair and I am no longer losing hair.</li>
    <li> I use it mainly to take off my makeup and it&#x27;s not harsh like other removers. It can be used a body lotion or conditioner. Who can beat that!</li>
    <li> This conditioner does not have any harmful chemicals in it and we use this after shampooing, but it is also used as a skin moisturizer on body and hands, too. P Pratt</li>
    <li> This is great for hiking, camping, backpacking and traveling. You can use it to wash dishes, your hair and clothes. Natural, so it&#x27;s safe on the environment. You don&#x27;t need to use much to be effective.</li>
    <li> I found this at my local health food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long and very thick and coarse wavy hair that is VERY difficult to blow dry straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I didn&#x27;t use conditioner after I washed my hair and then put this on as a leave-in conditioner right after towel-drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to blow dry my hair.  I usually just use a big round brush on the front and then just scrunch and dry the rest of my head because I cannot drag the brush through my hair - too much resistance.  For the first time ever I am able to straighten all my hair because this product makes it so light and smooth and there is absolutely no resistance to the round brush.  My hair stays straight and it has a sort of \\&quot;move\\&quot; to it that is wonderful.  This product is not at all sticky and absolutely not greasy unlike all the other styling products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon will start carrying a gallon bottle of this!</li>
    <li> I think the product is good.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel when I use it and smell pretty good. My only complete is the price is way to high.  For that reason along I problem won&#x27;t but it again.  Amazon delivery service was great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it so much, keeps her curly hair nice and hydrated. As soon as she is out of this I&#x27;ll have to buy more.</li>
    <li> Tate&#x27;s is a great lotion and I have some in my room at all times.  But this last order had leaked out the side when it arrived.  i did not lose much but it was messy.</li>
    <li> If I could afford it, I would never use another product for lotion again.  No scent, totally non-greasy, and instant soft skin.  A very small amount goes a long way.  It absorbs immediately and leaves nothing but softness behind.    I was looking for something that is unscented and non-toxic AND not greasy.  This is it!  I use it primarily for my face and hands.</li>
    <li> Read this before you buy!  I bought a house in 2002 and a bottle of Tates was in the bathroom unused.  I used it.  I liked it.  I called the company and ordered another bottle.  One of the biggest consumer mistakes of my life!  This company has called me for 12 years.  They used to call at least monthly, sometimes weekly and leave these LONG messages with every product detail they had, it was at least a 5 minute message.  After the third month back in 2002, I asked them to please stop calling me.  They were using all my cell phone minutes back when that mattered!  Over the years, they have continued calling me and I have gotten more intense in my requests that they please stop calling me.  I have laughed, I have cried.  I think this is a one woman operation, because the same woman has called me since that first order in 2002.  She just called me today 6/30/2014 and I said WHY WHY WHY are you still calling me after I have asked to not be called at least 25 times?  I asked to speak to the owner.  She put me on hold then came back stammering and said that she was on the phone and they would take me off the list.  They have said this every time I have asked, all 25 times, to be certain. If you can&#x27;t tell, I think this company is horrible. I wouldn&#x27;t doubt it if the other poster is correct that they don&#x27;t have the ingredients in it that they say they do, only because I have never met such LONG-TERM incompetence.  I hate to have to report this, I own a small business myself, but this is really one of the most irritating consumer products that I have ever accidentally gotten involved with (if you can call making a purchase online getting involved.)  I even thought about switching my phone number at one point.  I have contacted the FCC at least once over the years, and they did stop calling for a while.  But they are back at it now in 2014 after about a year hiatus.  Just last week she called and I explained the whole thing and begged her not to call again, and there my phone was again today, the restricted number calling...Tates, like something out of a Seinfeld episode.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this product on Amazon, however as many others have also said, these people are crooks.  The salon I work at received a box from ups with the return label ripped off (red flag #1). And in it was this shampoo conditioner, after telling these people 3 times on the phone NOT to send us their shampoo, they did anyway with a bill for 55$.  The ingredient list is a joke.  I can assure you that if you put spring water mashed up apples and cinnamon on your head it will NOT lather or clean your hair.  This shampoo appears to be comparable to the worst dollar store shampoo.  It smells like chemicals.  However I cannot vouch for how well it works because there&#x27;s no way I would use this on myself or anyone I know.  After this company scammed us we thought about donating these products to people less fortunate.  After second thought we thought this shampoo might even be so bad that it could harm people.  That&#x27;s right, this stuff is so questionable we wouldn&#x27;t even give it to homeless people.  Do not buy this,  you will be better off with the cheapest drug store shampoo you can find, at least that will be hovers about its ingredients</li>
    <li> I hesitated about buying this product because there are some negative comments about it.  I was almost out of the product I had purchased at a mall store and decided to order it anyway.  I am glad I did as I have had absolutely no problems with it.  My favorite feature of this lotion is after applying it to my very dry skin, there is no stickiness and gooey feeling as with some lotions.  There is very little smell and does not bother my sensitivity to fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  There is nothing else I know of on the market like it.  Goes on smooth, dries quickly, leaving my face soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Excellant product.Does the job.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lotion for shaving! I have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving my legs and I get razor bumps so easily - for me, nothing out there works but this stuff. I was very excited when I discovered that this stuff works. I use it for shaving and after shaving. This lotion is great for so many things, but I just use it for my legs because it&#x27;s a little expensive (for me anyway!). Highly recommended! I wish I could afford to use it for more than just a shaving cream/lotion! Also, I love that it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky; it is very smooth!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years, and simply love it. One of my favorite uses is as an eye makeup removal (even my waterproof mascara). It works so great and is gentle and not greasy like other makeup removers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a facial lotion. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this works wonderfully, without irritating my skin. My skin really drinks this stuff in, so often apply it twice (just a few minutes apart) to get the level of moisture that I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use for this is as a leave in conditioner. I put a pump on my hands and run it through the ends of my damp hair and then style as usual. You could even mix a drop of argan oil with it for extra nourishment.</li>
    <li> After reading all the 5-star reviews on this conditioner, I thought I would be amazed.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  I tried it first as a regular conditioner - I really didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel.  First off, the product is very watery, so I had to use quite a bit to get through my hair.  My hair is thicker, but it&#x27;s only shoulder-length, so it shouldn&#x27;t have required that much product.  It also didn&#x27;t rinse out well at all, and it left my hair feeling very limp and dry.  I should mention that I didn&#x27;t used the shampoo first though.  I used my regular shampoo (Aubrey Organics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it as a lotion, and I REALLY didn&#x27;t like it for that either.  It feels kind of \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; to me.  It also doesn&#x27;t absorb well, and leaves a residue-like feeling on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, I tried it as a leave-in conditioner.  The good thing is that it does go through hair easily, but it just did nothing for my hair.  My hair felt no improvement with it in.  It just made my hair feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.  This is a very expensive product and just not worth the money at all, at least not for me.</li>
    <li> We like Tate&#x27;s, (With all due respect)the individual that said use bs, does the same; I don&#x27;t agree. I find Tate&#x27;s leaves our skin silky smooth and not at all greasy. When our dog got some kind of sticky stuff on her fur I used just a tiny bit of Tate&#x27;s and it came right off! AND I didn&#x27;t feel concerned that our dog would be licking this. It is expensive and I think it should cost less or you should get more for the money; but, I continue to buy it because it really cleans my skin AND conditions (hair, too) and I like it just for this even. I like bs for a lot of things, but, not in place of Tate&#x27;s (miracle) lotion. Try a smaller bottle to see for yourself and then it won&#x27;t seem like an expense you regret IF you don&#x27;t like it well enough. My husband, myself and our dog LOVE it! I just wonder HOW it is white and not green, or blue, or whatever(because of the list of ingredients, like blueberry,etc.) I asked the folks who make it and they said they didn&#x27;t know. That is a mystery to me. Does anyone know why it is &#x27;white&#x27; and not some other color? since there is no &#x27;chemical&#x27; used in it. ??thank you. Rainbow</li>
    <li> My sister first introduced this conditioner to me about 3 years ago.  I read the label and thought, well, it&#x27;s natural and can be used for SO many things why not try it. I found it is the BEST body creme for dry skin (especially in the winter) and an excellent hair conditioner-- all in one. It&#x27;s great to have one &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; bottle instead of having 4 products to do various things set out all over your vanity top.  I highly recommend it. It is non-greasy and absorbs well. I use it as a leave-in hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I usually buy mine locally from a health food store or co-op. Couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so i ordered it from amazon. The bottle does not have a pump lid which doesn&#x27;t matter to me. As far as ingredients are concerned, they have to disclose what is in the product for liability reasons. Just because it says apples instead of apple puree, does not mean it is not apples. I have multiple severe allergies. I have never once reacted to this conditioner. I use it for lotion, hair conditioner, shaving lotion, etc. It works awesome! It even made the lines around my mouth fade away better than expensive organic face care lotion. This stuff lasts forever. I just pulled out an unopened bottle I have had in my cabinet since 2001. I opened it, and everything is fine. Works as well as the new one I bought. Do not be afraid to buy this. It is amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this off another site before reading the reviews here on Amazon. As an experiment, I ordered the shampoo &amp; conditioner off of Amazon to try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner I purchased did not have a pump, and had a thin, icky consistency. I have not yet tried this as an actual hair conditioner (waiting for the shampoo, then I&#x27;ll try &amp; review both)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, despite its claims of being all natural, has a strange, chemical scent. Not offensive, but decidedly odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this as a body lotion first: left my skin soft. But not feeling hydrated? I found that the best results were to apply Tate&#x27;s miracle first, followed by regular lotion second. Which is redundant, so I won&#x27;t be doing that again. So scrap this as a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried it as a shaving cream - it worked well, but so do drug store brands, and at a fraction of the cost! So scrap this as a staving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I tried it as a leave in conditioner. This was the only area I had any real success with the product. I applied about a nickel sized drop and worked it through my wet hair before blow drying. Even though it was raining, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz or start flying away.  In this aspect, the product is a win and I&#x27;ve moved it over by my hair dryer to add to my styling routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t dare apply this to my face! Despite their claims, I&#x27;d advise doing so at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing this product is good for that isn&#x27;t noted on the bottle: even the tightest rings will come off with ease when you apply this stuff to your hands.</li>
    <li> This is a superior body care product. Pricey but we think worth it. It&#x27;s a staple for us.</li>
    <li> Read a review by a former employee that this is just rebottled Cure Care Conditioner.  Yup.  I totally agree.  Maybe they added something else to it to keep themselves from being sued, but it feels, looks, smells and preforms the same:  Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Bromide, Hydrolized Keritan, Methyparaben, propylparaben, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisonthiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.  Look &#x27;em up if you want to know what you are putting in your hair and on your skin.  Ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they should get sued.</li>
    <li> Works well for shaving, leaves smooth hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1FGSM22PFK6JX]]Hello,    My friend made this video, enjoy it!    This conditioner is seriously amazing.  I absolutely love it.  I use it for my King Charles Cavalier Spaniels all of the time.  No soap wash for them, just the conditioner.  I never wash ALL of it out, I leave some in.  It makes their coats SO NICE!    Whenever I have guests, they love it!  They use it for a body wash/shampoo and even a conditioner!  LOL    I bought mine here:[[ASIN:B00HQKWU2S Tate&#x27;s the Natural Miracle - Organic-tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle Conditioner - 18 Fl Oz/hypo-allergenic// FREE 5oz Conditioner]]    For a buck or so more you get the small conditioner which is great for travel or in a separate bathroom.  They ship Priority mail and I got mine in just 2 days so it&#x27;s basically ordering Prime, if you have the membership.    This company really gets a bad rap with the BBB but it may be just because of bad customer service, I don&#x27;t know.  I do know that their products are amazing!    I highly recommend their conditioner and their shampoo also!</li>
    <li> The picture shows that this comes in a pump container but it does not.  Great lotion though!!  I&#x27;ve used this for a long time and I really like it.</li>
    <li> tates lotion is the best for sunburns! takes it away in a day.  This stuff is amazing.  I used it to clean my face too and it cleans out the pores so well.  love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this product and was really hyped to try it.  I guess there were a few things that should have served as red flags to not get my hopes up:    1) The ingredients include an extensive list of purely natural stuff, primarily water and various fruits and herbs.  I did think that all those ingredients (30?) was overkill. Rather gimmicky in fact.   I mean, sure, looked great on paper but was each and every one of those ingredients serving a real purpose?  And was there enough of each of those ingredients to make a difference?  My guess is not really.      2) The word \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; is used in the name of the product.  I guess that should&#x27;ve been my biggest clue.    3) I originally bought it as a hair conditioner.  It came with a booklet describing about 80 different ways you can use this stuff, from hair to face to laundry to sunburns to nails.  First off, they state you can add 10 pumps to your laundry as a fabric softener.  Maybe that&#x27;s true, I haven&#x27;t tried it.  But that is some dang expensive fabric softener!  10 pumps dig a pretty deep hole in this not-inexpensive bottle.     I suspect that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to use this conditioner in all the ways they suggest: as a dishwashing softener, diaper rash treatment, hair gel, plant food, arthritis, and the list goes on and on.  But I also suspect it wouldn&#x27;t HELP very much either.  I tried the conditioner as a skin moisturizer on my arms and it made no difference whatsoever.  I experimented with just putting it my right arm so I could compare to my untreated left arm.  My right arm actually became drier! I&#x27;m not blaming that on the conditioner, but it clearly didn&#x27;t help.    So as I mentioned, I bought this with the intent to use as a hair conditioner after shampooing.  I have very long and thick hair, prone to tangles. It&#x27;s important that my conditioner be able to detangle.  I&#x27;ve used some conditioners that detangled on contact, requiring just a little bit of the conditioner.  Tate&#x27;s required a lot.  It does detangle eventually.  Then it hit me . . . . just like baking soda!    For those of you who don&#x27;t already know, baking soda is often touted to have numerous uses, one of which being a natural conditioner.  You just mix it in water, then apply to your hair like any other conditioner.  I have used it in this way not too long ago.  It doesn&#x27;t work GREAT as a conditioner or as a detangler, but it does work somewhat, and it&#x27;s very cheap and totally natural.    This got me thinking.  If Tate&#x27;s reminded me of baking soda when I used it as a conditioner, might it have other resemblances? So I googled uses for baking soda and lo and behold, almost all the uses Tate&#x27;s lists for the conditioner is also something that baking soda can be used for.  And like Tate&#x27;s conditioner, which has no scent or color (something I originally loved about it but now just makes me wonder), baking soda is free of those as well.     So, while the concept behind Tate&#x27;s Natural Miracle Conditioner is interesting, for all practical purposes, it doesn&#x27;t deliver any more than regular baking soda.    UPDATE: Before you buy, read the 1 and 2 star reviews left for their Miracle Shampoo.  Misleading labeling and an F rating on the Better Business Bureau (which I confirmed--look them up on BBB under Tate&#x27;s the Natural Miracle Conditioner). Wish I had seen those reviews before I wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> Never buy a product from this company.  I bought it 11 years ago and it was OK.  I never wanted that product again.  They kept calling my cell phone ever since, despite many attempts to tell them not to call me, putting them 10+ times on Do Not Call registry, etc.  They used 3 different numbers and now use private numbers so that they can sneak up on you.  Awful.</li>
    <li> This company is lying to us! I enjoyed this product thinking it was all natural and only contained the products listed on the ingredient list. Unfortunately it&#x27;s a lie. Those ingredients aren&#x27;t in your conditioner and THERE ARE CHEMICALS in this conditioner. They just don&#x27;t list them.</li>
    <li> First time I have felt compelled to write a product review ever.  Do NOT waste your money on this.  Maybe I received a watered down bottle (very runny) but this stuff is no miracle!  I admit i was fooled by the price.  It wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap so I figured it had to be better than average.  Unfortunately it does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product the first time I sampled it at a little boutique called Amethyst Moon.  My skin LOVES it, too.  It does not have a greasy feel to it once applied, it doesn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;trapped&amp;#34; feeling of overheating that some heavier lotions have, and has a multitude of applications.  The fact that it&#x27;s made of all natural ingredients is a big plus!  The cost can be daunting but keep an eye out for the best price - start looking before you run out and eventually you&#x27;ll find a great deal!  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great, non-greasy, leave-in conditioner for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product ... but did you know there are ex- customers and employees of this product and company, reporting that Tates is just a repackaged product of Sallys&#x27; Beauty Supply?  I bought both and they appear to be identical. I can not say for sure, but it seems very suspicious.  I would hope that Amazon would not support this type of &amp;#34;piracy&amp;#34;, and would investigate as such.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, greaseless....</li>
    <li> it is the only hand lotion he will use! he doesn&#x27;t like anything oiley so he tells all his friends how great it is!!!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about it and of all things, it works as a WONDERFUL natural deodorant!  It will even &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; you if you just need a quick touch-up.  Love it....Love it!</li>
    <li> Before I say anything else I must state that this is appears to be the same exact company as Kathy&#x27;s Family Healing Lotion. The two companies share the same address, only their names and phone numbers differ. I have tried samples of both of their \\&quot;Family Recipes\\&quot; and they appear to be the EXACT SAME THING...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all their product seems to be very nourishing for the skin. However it would be nice to see a complete breakdown of what is actually in their product. I read another review about how watery their product is and it is pretty true, before you use the lotion you should shake the bottle to make sure everything is mixed well. I feel that the lotion does a good job re-hydrating your skin, but the price is a little steep... And the fact that there is another \\&quot;family owned company\\&quot; that shares the same street address and puts out a product that is indistinguishable to the naked eye is a little concerning.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite lotion!! It feels like a drink of water for your skin.  I use it several times a day on my face &amp; neck.  The anti-aging properties are pretty compelling!  I have been using it daily for four years and have not noticed any aging over those years.  I actually noticed my skin looking tighter the first several months of use.  It also makes a fabulous lip balm.</li>
    <li> We have been very Happy with the conditioner and the price</li>
    <li> this works great and makes my hair feel really good. the only downfall is i have to use a lot</li>
    <li> I found it in a store next to me, i read the label which claimed ingredients which they use on their products are natural or organic, i was looking for organic shampoo and conditioner, I decided to order it in bulks, I made a huge mistake dealing with company and personally with Steve who is managing it, from the very begging everything went wrong, Steve was not professional, receipt were not provided for products i paid for 259 dollars, he charged me twice on my cc and then said it was mistake but still wouldnt provide a receipt, promising he would do it tomorrow and so on for over 2 weeks, saying products were shipped , i was insisting on providing a tracking number which was never sent to me. I kept on calling them asking to respect customers rights who trusted them by giving away their cc number and ordering their products, which, of course was not respected nor calls or emails returned nor products received, nor additional charges explained. I question every single ingredient ,every move or word company says or claims. I personally experiences all of it on my own skin, so to speak. I and BBB tried to do something over it but the problem was not resolved. If you check out BBB website and see how many complains are there over the products and business, it would start you thinking may be if what they claim to be is what it really is. Not mentioning their disrespectful attitude towards customers.  [...]  Check that out 39 !!!complaints which being closed by now and 10!!!complaints which are not closed including mine....I mean how many ppl out there who just said WHATever those frauds???after being treated like that and being cheated?  [...]</li>
    <li> I use this for lotion and leave in conditioner, as well as face lotion. It heals the skin and evens tone. It needs a light moisturizer with it though cuz it heals but feels a bit dry on the skin. The best stuff . Love it</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Thanks so much!  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great for &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; hair!</li>
    <li> It has many uses and wroked great for all uses.  My grand kids love to use it as well for a lotion.</li>
    <li> This is a very light moisturizer/conditioner.  If you have very dry skin/hair you will need to reapply often.  I love the list of ingredients but have always been curious about how all of those things (pine needles, strawberries, cinnamon) wound up being a smooth and completely white moisturizer...  hmm...</li>
    <li> The best lotion EVER! Much cheaper here than at the Chiropractor&#x27;s office, which is where I first came in contact with this item. read the bottle well! You can use this for EVERYTHING!!! AND it&#x27;s all natural!!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I moved to a humid state and my hair went crazy! I had knots constantly and my hair was no longer soft. My dad gave me this conditioner and it has literally saved my hair!!!!  No more knots, back to soft and silky!!</li>
    <li> Do NOT give this company your address, phone number, credit card information or any other personal information! They will relentlessly harass you and fraudulently try to collect money from you. I am a business owner who has been contacted on a daily basis, cursed at, illegally invoiced and downright harassed by \\&quot;Tate&#x27;s\\&quot; for months now. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and most recently a harassment complaint with our local police department.    Go look at this place&#x27;s complaints with the BBB!! [...] ***(and by the way, this shady \\&quot;business\\&quot; is NOT BBB accredited.)***    I have never in my life come across such a unethical, shady, scam artist like this. It all started with a unmarked, beat up box we received in the mail one day containing a suspicious bottle of \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; and an invoice for almost $100. Are you kidding me? Naturally, we called them to let them know they had mistakingly shipped us something we did not order, and their response was that it was a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; of their product that we needed to sell in our practice! I run a health care practice, not a beauty supply store! Every attempt at resolving this scam has been to no avail and has resulted in nasty messages left at my business, harassment of my employees, and now an open complaint with the BBB and police department.    WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it as hair conditioner, and body lotion.  I like that is does not leave a greasy feeling.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> My business received product two times, unsolicited, and then sent bills, reminders and called for payment after I told them I didn&#x27;t order. They call continuously, with a restricted number, for placing orders after I have asked them to remove me from their list.</li>
    <li> This product stinks - literally. Horrible chemical smell that I couldn&#x27;t wash off my hands. Based on all the complaints filed against this company with the BBB, I highly doubt that what is in the bottle is what the label says. Stay away!</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using it for several years, and would not change to another lotion as this one does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting on the miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted that I seriously wonder about the use of &#x27;miracle&#x27; in any product name (in this case Tate&#x27;s Miracle Conditioner), I went against my (it turns out, better) judgment to take the recommendation of a friend who reported that Tate&#x27;s worked to clear up his eczema. I tried it myself, and had different results – it had no effect on the eczema. That continued to advance as I practically bathed and soaked in the Tate&#x27;s for a full week (applied it liberally twice a day minimum; and often more than that). I couldn&#x27;t stand the itching any more, so I went back to the dermotologist-prescribed steroid ointment that works like a charm (for 1-2 weeks [max], and then I must take at least a week off and usually have to start applying again at the end of that week or two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted the retailer to ask for a refund, on the Tate&#x27;s. It may well be a decent-enough lotion for some purposes, but as far as I am concerned -- eczema does not belong on the list of issues it addresses. At the same time I realize eczema may be a pretty broad category, presenting differently in each person – and I hoped there could be a natural remedy. But alas, the Tate&#x27;s Miracle Condioner is clearly not the one for my eczema.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  It&#x27;s hard to find in store where I live, so this is a great way to get it to me!! Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best multi use product Ive purchased. Its my lotion, conditioner, shaving gel, face cream and so much more. Best yet, I can eat all of the ingredients.Its safe for me and my family. A little goes a long way. Thanks Tate&#x27;s for making the product we wish we had for our whole lives. I will definitely order this again, and have suggested to friends. Bravo!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 9 years and love it. I use it for a hair conditioner/detangler and I use it on my face as a light moisturizer under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have used their products for years, they have made a huge difference in my life as I have very serious skin problems. The conditioner has worked fantastic. I have literally tried every other conditioner on the market which are greasy, slimy and don&#x27;t help at all. As far as the BBB goes they are a rip off themselves. As a business owner they want over $200.00 a year just to belong. I maintained a A+ rating the whole time. What you have to remember is the BBB has no power to do anything. Its just basically a site for complaints, in order to get a realistic view of a company or product you must be open to both kinds of reviews not just negative. Ok they have 42 unresolved complaints. What you have to realize they are unresolved because they have chosen not to pay the BBB their blackmail of $200.00 a year. The BBB will not let you as a business owner respond to any complaint unless you pay to belong. I finally quit paying the BBB even though I have a A+ rating. I have had more problems with the BBB not sending my membership plaques, stickers, literature that they were supposed to send me and this happened every year with them. They were right there to get their money, but failed repeatably to give my business what I paid them for. So who rates the BBB for their business practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Docs Computer Service LLC</li>
    <li> My son and his wife are sold on this product so I ordered some. My son&#x27;s hands crack and bleed in cold weather and he is seeing great benefits from using this product.  They even lather thier 5 month old baby with the lotion. I tried some and it rubs in easily with no greasy film. My only disappointmet at this time is the bottle is not as pictured and &amp;#34;Mainly there is no Pump Applicator&amp;#34; on the cap of the bottle. The bottle has a push down slotted snap cap so you will have to pick the bottle up and squeeze the lotion out (Bummer).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had fantastic results with this product, but I got quite the runaround trying to get my order straight and fell prey to their tactic of double shipping my order then asking me to pay for it. I insisted they send me a return label but we worked the price down to a small fraction of the original so I just went with it. The other issue is that I&#x27;ve also gotten the runaround when I&#x27;ve tried to get an accurate ingredients list from them. Particularly when discussing cocamide dea in their shampoo. It was listed on the label of one order, but crossed off the label of another order, and their explanation was that the shampoo no longer contains that ingredient, but they are using up old labels. When asked about the rich lather, they insisted it was just the combination of the remaining ingredients on the label. This is just BS plain and simple.</li>
    <li> NOTHING I EVER USED BEFORE ABSORBED AS WELL, AND AS QUICKLY AS THIS DOES. GLAD SOMEONE ONCE GAVE ME A GIFT OF IT, SO I GOT TO EXPERIENCE THIS CREME.</li>
    <li> I use this not only as a hair conditioner, but also as a de-frizzer (curly hair). This is also great to use as a body lotion, this product has many uses, but, these are the only ones I use it for as it is expence.</li>
    <li> theTates conditioner received  on 03/26/15 contained 16 oz.not 18 0z. as indicated. in the picture. previously purchased Tates did contained 18 oz.</li>
    <li> This product is great for co-washing my 4b-c African American hair...&lt;br /&gt;It detangles and makes it more manageable after washing.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my mixed son&#x27;s loose curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love Tate&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE.    I feel duped and angry. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as a skin lotion, having purchased it at a local health store. I just came upon the negative reviews about the misinformation and terrible business practices of this company. It seems likely that the ingredients are not what they claim. From reading reviews and forum posts by people who identify themselves as former employees of the company, this conditioner looks to be a repackaged version of a cheaper product, Sally Beauty Cure Care, which contains parabens and is not all-natural. Basically, Tate&#x27;s is a profiteering scam. Cure Care is discontinued, so I can&#x27;t confirm its ingredients or compare the products myself, but needless to say Tate&#x27;s has violated consumer trust on multiple levels and I have no reason to believe that anything about their products or business is pure.    On the other hand, this conditioner has become an integral part of my skincare routine. I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer terribly when mosquitos bite. This product has been my first line of defense against itchy bug bites and skin irritations and is a soothing after sun lotion. Until now I&#x27;ve used it daily as a face and eye serum. I have also used Kathy&#x27;s Healing Lotion, and am just learning that they are the same dishonest organization. It all appears to be a sack of lies.    I feel stupid for believing that a combination of pine tree bark, papaya, and other ludicrous fruit combos could possibly be behind the product that I rely on and believed to be natural. I don&#x27;t want to give Tate&#x27;s any more money, but I&#x27;m unsure where to turn. Suggestions?    In summation: zero stars on account of lies and lack of integrity. Five stars for satisfaction with performance of the product, whatever it actually is. That evens out to three stars?</li>
