<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked great for storing my Iwata-Medea airbrush paints.  A little snug fit as the bottle tip rubs against the top shelf, but I can live with that in exchange for the convenience of storing all those bottles.</li>
    <li> love it. fast shipping</li>
    <li> holds 70 OPI bottles and a row of assorted nail art stripers.</li>
    <li> I have ordered tons of these, my friends see it and immediately want one</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t get this after seeing reviews about it arriving broken. After looking at so many different kinds. This still seemed like the best choice. When I got it I was glad to see it got here 100% safe. It was so padded I really don&#x27;t see how anyone got there&#x27;s broken. Aside from that I LOVE this. Like I&#x27;ve said I&#x27;ve looked at many different kinds. And this was the best!. Cause its on the wall my kids can NOT get to it and everything is lined up so I can easily see everything.</li>
    <li> I have 4 of them in my nail salon, they work great!</li>
    <li> I have a huge polish collection and this is the perfect way to store and display them.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, item is as states, arrived perfectly, and fits all my OPI, China Glaze, Essie, etc. Only con is it does not come with mount screws.</li>
    <li> I wish it came with the screws and anchors to put it up, besides that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Love at first sight !! Its just want I wanted!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this! Came in a giant box, slightly padded and unbroken. Easy to hang with a partner to draw marks through the holes and balance while you drive screws. Extra tall bottles,  including remover, need to go on top shelf, but there were no issues with bottle width for standard bottles.</li>
    <li> I love these nail racks, this is my third one, fast shipping !!</li>
    <li> Love it! any nail polish fanatic should buy one!</li>
    <li> Why should I get this if I don&#x27;t have nail polish? Because it&#x27;s a low impact organizer of small tubes. Like say... for mini paint pots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://miniaturetim.blogspot.com/2015/02/hobby-productivity-means-organization.html is why I put down for two.</li>
    <li> I have at least 100 nail polishes and this holds them all looks so neat and organized. It&#x27;s just clear and blends right into the wall. . I wish I got this years ago.</li>
    <li> Came broken in two places</li>
    <li> Love, love this nail polish rack. It holds all of my polishes with room to spare. Also, super easy to affix to wall.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Easy to install. I am not using for  nail polish but for acrylic paints in my artist studio.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this in her room</li>
    <li> Good quality. Packed very well with styrofoam with a tight fit in the box. Very clear, no blemished or scratches.  I bought tis to hold hobby paints (like Vallejo, or Gaming paints, the eye dropper type). They fit perfectly, 20 to a row. Smaller paints will fit also, such as the Tamiya small jars, and Testors, including the Model Master jars. I used 2 screws to fasten it to the wall above my work desk. Now the paint is easily within reach, and I can read and see all the bottles at the same time, but they are out of my way. I thought it might be a bit expensive at first, but the quality makes it worth it. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I thought about spray painting the back of it, maybe black, but I haven&#x27;t decided yet. But that&#x27;s an option you might want to consider, if you want it to be a color, it should be easy to do.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! It holds my polishes as well as my foundations.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition and easy to install.</li>
    <li> I have bought 5 of these shelves..all packaging was good but 1st one had a cracked shelf, 2nd had a missing corner, and 3rd was completely broken in half....very disappointing :(</li>
    <li> I have all 91 of my polishes up in color coded, it&#x27;s sweet. Easy to install . Packaging was excellent. No cracks or dents, thick acrylic material excellent quality.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack was just what I needed! It didn&#x27;t come with any screws but luckily I had some. It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to install. I never realized how many nail polish bottles I had until I put them on here and realized I had a problem and needed to order another rack!</li>
    <li> arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;rounded edges. easy to hang.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these.  One was broken upon receipt.  That sucked, but things like this happen in logistics.  No fault of amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, these things are flimsy, thin pieces of crap.  The fact that they&#x27;re $40 is purely for the fact that they&#x27;re acrylic to save weight.  If you want a quality nail polish rack, build one, it&#x27;s easy, google the instructions, make your own modifications.  My wife loves nail polish.  I&#x27;m building her a rack.  I&#x27;m going tomorrow to buy the supplies because we can&#x27;t find one worth a damn on the entire friggin internet.</li>
    <li> I have my dōTERRA Essential Oils on this rack &amp; it works GREAT!!! Love it! I put my spray bottles on the top row &amp; all my 15 ml bottles on the rest.</li>
    <li> awesome idea and great value</li>
    <li> This is my second order for this Home-it Nail Polish Organizer! Love it! Didn&#x27;t realize I had so many bottles of polish; of course, now I will have room to purchase MORE beautiful colors!</li>
    <li> I have it hanging in the bathroom, I love it.  I can easily see what colors I have.  So often I was buying the same color over and over and not realizing it.  By having all of the shelves you can separate by color and type.  I have base coats, strengteners, and top coats on one shelf and quick drying on another then everything else.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as of now she has had no complaints. The box came broken up but everything inside was OK. Probably ups issue.</li>
    <li> Actually my daughter loves it! Displays so many polishes and easy access--Almost like a piece of Art for the bathroom. Lightweight and easy to&lt;br /&gt;put up.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED with this item. Makes having so many polishes easier to maintain and see what i own. Fast delivery. Product described is exactly what I got, and perfect price.</li>
    <li> This rack worked out wonderfully for my collection of essie polishes. It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to mount on the wall. It came with the four screws needed. The item is listed as having Prime shipping, however, it took about a week to arrive. I also was hoping to buy more for the rest of my collection, but over the course of a couple days the price increased by $20 for no apparent reason. I thought it was great for $39, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again at $59, which is too bad because I could use 3 more.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack was extremely well packaged and holds all varieties of nail polish. It looks professional and I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I really l love this rack!  I have a lot of polish so when I need a certain color it keeps me from searching in all the boxes. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack is exactly how it looks in the picture. It really can fit 102 bottles. Trust me, I counted! It is exactly what I needed for my nail polishes to be organized and not taking up space on my shelves. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> luv this rack using for my pigments &amp; glitters perfect!!! 100% suggest buying this rack if ur a makeup enthusiast like i am :)</li>
    <li> Well packaged, looks beautiful on my wall!</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised, as described and in great shape. Mounting hardware included.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying a second one of these nail polish racks because I loved it so much and had more polish to store. I am planning on buying a third rack soon. Easy to install, and I didn&#x27;t have a problem fitting any of my polishes on the shelves. So happy I bought these!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter for a valentines gift. Not only did she love it, but i love that her nail polish isn&#x27;t all over the place anymore.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this polish organizer .. It&#x27;s defiantly a space saver</li>
    <li> Very Nice Holder, but wish that it came with wall anchors, washer and screws so I could put up without Hubby&#x27;s help.</li>
    <li> great item and holds a pretty good amount of my Life Color paint pots... just about holds the whole line..  have to get a couple more to make sure I&#x27;ve got everything on the wall with in easier reach.</li>
    <li> Arrived to my house Cracked and dirty I&#x27;m so annoyed .</li>
    <li> This product came broken but it overall is a nice product. I will be taking it back in return for a new one. Hopefully not broken! Really nice size though!</li>
    <li> Packaged and handled with care perfectly! Love it! It&#x27;s big ! A lot does fit I will purchase another soon!</li>
    <li> My wife had one of these in her shop, and liked it so well, we purchased 2 more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sturdy and well made.  The plastic is not cheap and the clarity of the plastic makes for a nice nail polish display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has several holes to accommodate a variety of wall mounting options (no hardware included).  I use 4 &amp;#34;molly bolts&amp;#34; in dry wall to affix these.  The one that we originally purchased has been up for over a year, full of polish, and it is rock solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely made product.</li>
    <li> There was lots of potential for this to go wrong but it arrived perfectly packed. The quality is great; I could use another one.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my teen-aged niece who has a huge collection of polish.  Just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> This arrived very well packaged and holds my nail polishes very nicely. My only complaint would be that I had to use my own screws because you would need to use screws with drywall anchors to support the weight of the rack, especially filled with nail polishes. It is definitely a statement piece in my bathroom and people love it. I actually need another rack because I have a bit of a nail polish addiction.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality polish rack.  Mine&#x27;s not completely filled up yet, but it will be soon! I would recommend this and would buy another when needed.</li>
    <li> It works great but didn&#x27;t hold up 102 nail polishes. Other than that it works perfect. Although unhappy with the claim will probably repurchase in near future</li>
    <li> I love a great nail rack to display my polishes and gels!!! can&#x27;t wait to show everyone at my home private shop!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I&#x27;m able to take all of my nail polish and display them so I know what I own.  Looks a lot less cluddered then having containers everywhere.  And yes I had containers plural.</li>
    <li> Perfect item. Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;I am vert satisfied</li>
    <li> The rack is made of heavy duty acrylic plastic and was packed well for shipment. Arrived very quickly and is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I like this hail polish wall rack a lot; it really does hold over a 100 bottles.  It has helped me clear off my desk and better organize my polish bottles.  The rack is sturdy and I can easily get my bottles in and out.  The only down side would be that the screws and anchors included don&#x27;t match the instructions.  I had to use other means to attach the rack to the wall.  I would recommend this nail polish rack to anyone who wants to better organize their nail polish bottles.</li>
    <li> I have close to 100 bottles of nail polish and really had no good way to store them, until now.  This is a well made shelf that I hung in my closet and it holds all of my nail polish.  It looks neat and I can easily find whatever color I am in the mood for.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this. I put it up on the wall in bathroom and now all my polish is displayed. I can pick my colors easily and it looks neat and tidy at the same time.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Doesnt come with the nails necessary to hang it but we had some to spare and this rack went up as soon as I got it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece, who showed all her friends (who were totally impressed and they went out to look for their own organizer.  It arrived in perfect condition and was easy to hang up.</li>
    <li> Easy to order and quick delivery. Great Wall Rack.  If you have daughters with a lot of nail polish, this is a great way to organize them.  Before all the polishes sat in a bin and now they are displayed in their bathroom on the wall.  You can see/find every color.  Love It!!</li>
    <li> Awesome! All expectations met. This is a clean way to store and sort the many colors of polish I have. It was easy to install and looks great.</li>
    <li> My first bad review, ever.  To start with, it does NOT hold 102 bottles of china glaze as advertised. It holds 84, tightly packed. The box was in fine condition, however it came with no hardware. Im aggravated, as it advertised it would hold 102 bottles of opi or china glaze. 6 shelves, 14 per shelf is what it holds. that&#x27;s 84 bottles.  If properly advertised, and if it actually came with hardware, I would recommend this unit, as it is sturdy. However I actually needed it to hold 100 bottles of china glaze. and it fell short by  18 .  The pictures are misleading as well. It shows 2 units,which looks like 1 very large unit. it is not. 4 years of being a prime customer and 63 reviews, this is my first one star. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had researched so many nail polish racks here on Amazon to find the perfect one that would fit the most bottles for the most reasonable price, so I purchased this one, and I am not disappointed! This holds SO many bottles of my polish - especially if you own any Julep polishes - and the material is high quality and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all!</li>
    <li> The rack came in perfect condition. The only issue was that the box said it came with screws to hang it bit the screws were no where to be found.</li>
    <li> This is extremely sturdy and there is 4 screws to hang it with. This is actually my second one I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;ll be buying a third soon.</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful and organized</li>
    <li> says holds up to 102 polishes.  It only holds 84 OPI nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Omg so cute so perfect pretty big bigger then I was expecting but great b cuz it fit everything all my different brands and even off brands haha. Great I love it and everyone who sees it loves it ! Buy it haha</li>
    <li> got it for my wife she loved itlooking into getting another on for my daughter and niece its a strong and sturdy product</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a long time for a rack for my polish, I had been looking at spice racks thinking that would work, but everything I say that would work was pretty ugly.  This is perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> holds all my polishes and seems very sturdy. I&#x27;ve had it hanging on my wall for about 2 months now and all seems well. very good buy!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for my daughter&#x27;s large collection of nail polish.  She has bottles of many different shapes and sizes and all of them fit fine. One thing you need to know is that there is not hardware included. This wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because I have lots of hardware left over from other projects.  But if you don&#x27;t have these already, you&#x27;ll need to make a trip to the hardware store for 4 screws and anchors.  Be sure not to overtighten the screws or you might crack the acrylic.  I mention this for the benefit of those who may not have a lot of experience with home projects, not because there&#x27;s a problem with the quality of the product; it&#x27;s solidly built.  It&#x27;s great to walk in the bathroom and see the bottles all in one place, not falling off the counter, in an attractive organizer.</li>
    <li> Shelf is great but was delivered damaged. The corner was broken completely off but hopefully a little super glue will fix it. The packaging was thin and not at all protective. Not worth all the trouble to send it back but also not a satisfying purchase.</li>
    <li> I personally wont be buying again from here thought because it had some good reviews the nail polish rack would come out good but mine didn&#x27;t it had this beige spot in one of the rack holders like if the material been broken and this was a patch to fix it ...... it also had many streaks</li>
    <li> We got several of these for our daughter who is a beautician/hair stylist to keep her nail polishes in for display and ease of use. Works very well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for essential oils. I love it because I can see exactly what I have.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it. It holds bottles of all shapes and sizes securely.</li>
    <li> I ordered two racks.  One came with a broken side.  It was very difficult to do return and order again because I needed the racks.  I used super glue but It should not have happened!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my sister. She loves it and now has an organized rack of nail polishes in her room. She now needs another one, I might be ordering one again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, one corner was broken but it was easier to reglue than to send back.  Love it.  It would be nice if they included nails or screws to hang it with.</li>
    <li> Use for essential oils.  Holds 102 bottles of oil.  Makes it easy to find the oils and put them back.  I have my own system for the oils and appreciate being able to see where I want to put them.</li>
    <li> Such an amazing price for this little guy! Holds about 80% of my polish.... but that&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not big enough, more that someone has a problem! Easy to install on the wall and sturdy plastic. Overall it was a huge improvement for my polish collection and the absolute best price I could find for something of this price.</li>
    <li> Love these. They are so sturdy</li>
    <li> Awsome ! Ilove my nail rack so much. However i have so much nail polish one isnt big enough i may need to purchase another one soon. Awsome seller product arrived alot earlier than i expected which is great. Thank youu (:</li>
    <li> This helps me see what I have which is great. Now I won&#x27;t purchase the same color twice. Very easy to hang.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Makes my fingernail polish just in one spot and easy to get too! And the package was right on time as well</li>
    <li> The rack looks pretty good and does come with mounting screws. I am using it for my son&#x27;s lego minifigures. He likes to build custom guys and such and I thought this would be a fun and easy way for him to show them all off and quickly find what he has. I bought some lego base squares to add to each row so the figures would stick and stand. Check out the pic for how many fit across a row and such. Even big figs like the Hulk fit nicely. (Not quite big enough for a cave troll though, haha.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is poor packing. It came with the top corner busted (about a 2&amp;#34; by 1&amp;#34; section). I super glued it back on easily enough, but you can kinda see the fracture line. Bah. It would&#x27;ve been too much hassle to return and I need it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Purchased to hold model paint.  Holds 20 Vallejo per row, 14 model Master , or 14 Tamyia bottles .  Works Great well packaged .</li>
    <li> I use this rack to organize my Wiccan oils and other smaller supplies.  Sturdy and big.  Think outside the box for its usages.</li>
    <li> I brought it as a birthday gift for my sister, she loved it. It just didn&#x27;t come with nails to hang it up. Other than that. It was wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I was able to hold more than 102 bottles.</li>
    <li> We love this!  I bought this for my teenager.  It was easy to hang.  I was nervous after reading the other reviews that it would be broken, but it was in excellent condition!</li>
    <li> Good product however does not bring screws for installation</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I do wish there was a bit more lip on the shelves because I&#x27;m a little clumsy and I nearly knock things out, but no real complaints! It also just looks really pretty, a huge improvement over my clutter from before.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer!  Mounts on wall very easily, holds many bottles of polish! Perfect for my salon!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, LOVE!  Great Price, Great Quality, Free shipping, can&#x27;t beat it!  I bought 1 of these, and immediately ordered another one after receiving the first!  Both times, it was delivered within 2 days of ordering!  It holds a lot of bottles, I didn&#x27;t count because so many of my bottles are different shapes depending on brand, I&#x27;m sure it will vary for each person.  I have read the other reviews about it being broken in shipping and I don&#x27;t see how it could have been broken unless you have the mail person from hell whose throwing it around.  It was packaged so tight with Styrofoam corner protectors and wrapped in bubble wrap in a box fit to size so nothing inside moved at all!  No, it doesn&#x27;t come with screws.  It has 4 openings for screws, but I only used 2 openings for anchors and screws and 2 minutes later it was up on the wall!  Easy peasy! Buy with confidence, buy 2, and what are you waiting for, buy it now so your polish can be put on display where it belongs!</li>
    <li> This is the coolest!  Only thing wrong is that the first two rows slant down a little to the right; but I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It really frees up my work space.</li>
    <li> I really like the titanium magnetic and it meets all my expectations, however the clasp on the like bracelet  does not stay closed and I almost lost it three times. I am taking it to a repair person to see if he can change the clasp.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say totally worth it! I am very satisfied with my purschase! Would totally purchase another one for my mom :)</li>
    <li> These are perfect for organizing and viewing your collection of polish. They hold every brand I have. My only complaint is that I purchased two and the lip is half the size on one, I am concerned I may knock things off that shelf easily.</li>
    <li> My niece loved this rack...she was able to get 106 bottles on it and she wants to start another rack lol.  Great piece.  Quick and fast service.</li>
    <li> Salon quality I love it easy to hang can&#x27;t with hardware</li>
    <li> I bought one of these about a year ago and filled it immediately  So I had to buy another so I could by more polish... Love being organized .Now I can see every color at the same time. I am happy I picked this particular one because it is well made . Not flimsy and came with the screws to hang it with. Also wrapped very well. two boxes and noodles. Good shipper.</li>
    <li> holds plenty of polish.  Just like pictured. This is the second one we have purchased for our salon.</li>
    <li> all my polishes look so pretty in it. strong and sturdy. I&#x27;ve been looking for exactly this for years. it&#x27;s perfect. thanks:)</li>
    <li> I loved it!  Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because it displays all the polishes I have and looks like a salon. I had to buy 2 of them because I have so many polishes but it holds up well and makes them so organized. It fits all of my polishes perfectly except NICOLE brand bottles slightly have to be sideways but you still see the label so it&#x27;s not a big deal. It doesn&#x27;t come with screws but you can simply use ones you already have and it works great. I did notice some clear glue spillage in corners but since it&#x27;s covered by polish you don&#x27;t notice and it is clear anyways.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS THING!!! My boyfriend bought it for me when my nail polish collection starting getting out of control. Great buy, BEWARE tho, no hardware included. The rugged man of mine was able to hang it with no problem, tho.</li>
    <li> Used for essential oils and works great.</li>
    <li> Love it!  And I love being able to see my collection, so many colors I didn&#x27;t even know I had in my stash.  The only down fall was that I had to order two, I didn&#x27;t even know I had that much nail polish until I installed the first and it didn&#x27;t all fit.  102 bottles sounds like a lot but I suggest you count your hoard ladies :) And then order a couple of these, I love mine :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Love this!  I&#x27;m using it to store my Young Living Essential Oils.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I put it on the wall in our half bath.  Installation was easy.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a nail polish obsession, so i bought her 2 of these racks to organize her collection.  They are great quality and easy to hang on a wall.  The price was extremely reasonable.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We love this product!  I installed it in the bathroom that our 3 daughters use.  They had so much nail polish and this is a fun way to display all of it along with tools and other nail gadgets.  Their friends think it is so cool when they come over, they love picking stuff out to do their nails with!</li>
    <li> I love this!!!! Easy installation and I surprisingly &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; another one.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Put this in my room on the wall behind my door and it worked out wonderfully. Great material - great shipping. No cracks or damage. Easily install and holds sooo much nail polish! I love it. Great buy for sure.</li>
    <li> Slim design effectively stores your polish.  However, unless you have a lot of smaller bottles, you will really only be able to store about 85 standard polish bottles.</li>
    <li> look after hung up ease  to use</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this item! It only held 96 bottles for me. But, they&#x27;re all different shapes and sizes so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to get 102 on it. However, it was missing the screws or it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment. Product is great! Will probably order more in future as polish collection grows!</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous.  I am so glad that I finally decided to buy it. Now friends and family want one too! It is spacious, came well protected and well made. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my husband put in up for me in my diva space and it holds all my nail polishes any size. I love the packing, it arrived on time, and packed very well and its just like the photo. I may order another one if I continue to buy tons of nail polish</li>
    <li> When I realized how many bottles of polish I had, I had to do something, and fast!  I looked at more expensive racks but none could possibly have fit into the spot I had for it.  It fit, perfectly, and I maxed it out immediately . . . and I&#x27;m not even in the manicure business!  I retired from the beauty salon business, years ago, only to find my self in a position of having enough polish to go back into manicuring.  Fat chance!!  I&#x27;m home to stay and will enjoy having all my polish bottles in one place and extremely accessible!  If I ever (and I hope not) have to have another rack, it will be this one!  The price was right and it couldn&#x27;t have fit my need if I&#x27;d had it custom made.</li>
    <li> 4 stars cause I could only fit 97 bottles lol, I will definetly buy another one of these soon, EXTREMELY FAST SHIPPING. 👌</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves it!  It&#x27;s up and filled already!  Excellent price and great service.</li>
    <li> I use it for all of my nail polish and essential oils.  You can get pretty creative with the location to save space.</li>
    <li> Love this, using it to store my Young Living Essential Oils - it&#x27;s perfect for this purpose!</li>
    <li> Loved the first one so much that we ordered another one.</li>
    <li> is awsome, like other review it doesn&#x27;t bring any tulls to put it up. What so ever  you can purchase them at home depot it fits about 98 nail polichaces and like 4 up side down. looking foward purchasing another one!!!</li>
    <li> great product - fast shipping</li>
    <li> Love this!! It&#x27;s perfect to display my nail polishes.</li>
    <li> It arrived broken. I was so excited to get it and it probably would have worked great but it was broken. Returned it for refund. will probably make my own from a wood board from Home Depot that will last a lot longer. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Like others have written my rack also came with a cracked off corner. It  should have been put into another box to protect it. It did come in styrofoam, so I wonder if it was all ready cracked in the warehouse. It looks very nice but wish  it hadn&#x27;t come broke.</li>
    <li> Great rack for my CND!</li>
    <li> It only fit like about 90 nail polishes but overall if was a great product . They should be more specific</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition and holds all of my polish perfectly. I&#x27;ll probably order another one as my polish collection grows. VERY easy to put up and feels very sturdy. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was as expected it.  Was very easy to install and there is plenty of room for fingernail polish and other items that will fit in the slots.</li>
    <li> This is the exact same storage shelf that my local nail salon has. The only downside, this didn&#x27;t come with screws for hanging, but my husband had some and he had it up in a matter of minutes. I&#x27;ll be buying more when I need to.</li>
    <li> Very nice polish holder</li>
    <li> I love the organization but since i have alot of nicole o.p.i and essie&lt;br /&gt;it holds about 70 bottles</li>
    <li> Simple, but solid product. Very well constructed. I bought three of them to organize my Vallejo and other eyedropper hobby paints and it works perfectly. My wife wanted one for her nail polishes after seeing mine and we ordered a fourth. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I just ordered my third one! I love this rack. I&#x27;m a polishaholic and this suits my needs perfectly. And with all my polishes accessible i can see what i have And avoid buying so many duplicates. Lol! Some reviews say that this didn&#x27;t come with mounting hardware but mine did. It was taped to the inside of the box. Maybe they just didn&#x27;t see it? Anyway, hardware or not I give it 5+ stars.</li>
    <li> Nice rack!  Love it.  Ordering 2 more, one for foils and one for glitters</li>
    <li> It was broken before I even took it out of the box.  But the return process was amazing.  I ordered a different style.</li>
    <li> The rack is ok, it holds all my daughters polish bottles. Seems sturdy. Only thing I was disappointed in was that it didn&#x27;t come with any mounts. Not even screws so my husband had to hunt around for screws that would fit to hang this on her wall. I&#x27;d probably not choose this again.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was worried it might be cracked or messed up somehow when I got it the packaging kept it from moving and it&#x27;s beautiful. So far I have 87 bottles and growing! Sure beats lugging around a basket that weighed too much.</li>
    <li> I had read a few reviews that product was received cracked but I took a chance.  Product arrived &amp; it stayed in the original box until I had it loaded on the moving truck.  Lots of furniture got scratched during the move but this polish holder arrived in perfect condition.  I think it should be packed again in a cardboard box with filler to protect it but mine was ok and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  Now I can see all my polish at one time.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these items since my wife seems to want to buy every bottle of nail polish she finds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sadly, one of the racks was already broken when I took it out of the box.  There was no damage at all to the shipping box itself.  It seems the acrylic material it is made out of does not handle the shipping process very well and is easily cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am nervous about putting up the second one that did arrive okay as I feel it might also easily crack when screwing it into the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: This rack does not come with any mounting screws or even any instructions on how best to hang it.  You are on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the rack we still have will work out okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  We have had the one that did not break in shipping up for quite some time now and it is very helpful and a little like a colorful art piece, in an odd way.  My wife loves it as she can easily store many of her nail polish bottles (like a nail salon) and it keeps them all in one place rather than scattered on a vanity top or elsewhere It. It is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: it did not come with any brackets to hold the shelf to the wall.</li>
    <li> works great for essential oil containers. :)</li>
    <li> I already had a pretty extensive nail polish collection kinda tossed in a beauty supply bag...but when my teenager became obsessed with polish, it was time to better store the growing collection. Now we have them neatly sorted by brand &amp; they aren&#x27;t lying upside down or side ways...drying out in a bag. We love this organizer!</li>
    <li> Love this! Held up well, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t hold 102 nail polish bottles. I could fit around 90 bottles on my rack.</li>
    <li> Excellent for organization where I can finally see all of my nail polish at once. I could wish for a slightly more secure-feeling mounting mechanism, but it seems fine.</li>
    <li> Love it, holds all my polishes</li>
    <li> The acrylic Nail Polish Wall Rack does not hold 102 polish bottles.  It only holds 85. Additionally the dimensions are 2 inches shorter in width. All of my polish bottles are OPI.  As a professional Nail Tech the  purpose in purchasing the wall rack was to maximize the space available.  I never gave it any thought that there might be any discrepancies.</li>
    <li> Holds all our bottles. I didn&#x27;t hang it up, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. Nice to see all the bottles displayed.</li>
    <li> Just love it. My first time purchasing a nail polish rack.</li>
    <li> What a great product! It is well made and holds all diffrent kinds of polish bottle sizes and shapes, durable and is just deep enough to prevent the bottles of polish from falling out when bumped.I hung mine on the back of a door. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this nail rack! Perfect for my ever-growing obsession. Has four tiny holes to screw into the wall, screws not included.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I will most likely buy another!</li>
    <li> i need another one already.  works out perfectly for my collection</li>
    <li> Thinking of buying one more.  Sturdy and beautiful product...</li>
    <li> Incredibly disappointed in this purchase. The rack came in busted on the bottom and the original packaging was thin and flimsy, even partially opened. I don&#x27;t know if it was dropped during delivery or if it was just junk to begin with but I do not recommend purchasing this rack at all. I will have to use epoxy to fix it, but I doubt it will be stable enough to hold 15+ bottles of nail polish. It&#x27;s split in the corner and the entire bottom shelf piece has come loose, with maybe 2 inches still attached. Very poor quality, very disappointing. If the delivery driver was the reason it was broken, then why didn&#x27;t Amazon package it better?</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Would definently recommend.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift and she loved it.  It was the perfect solution for her in organizing her nail polish.</li>
    <li> It arrived to my house broken on the side.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shelf forMy nail polishes its so comfortable to have them all arranged up there! Very sturdy and beautiful clear design.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful way to display nail polish and makeup. I selected this rack because this is one of the better ones I saw.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I need one more because I had more polishes than I thought.</li>
    <li> Received the item as described. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, holds all my nail polish, looks cool, but since its clear you can see the nails holding it up. Its not a big deal, especially when the nail polishes are in front you can barely tell they are there.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Will order more! They are the sturdiest ones I&#x27;ve seen yet,  and they have 4 screw holes, two at the top and two at the bottom, where as most just have two at the top. Came to me in perfect shipping,  completely encased in Styrofoam and in perfect condition, complete with the needed screws to hang them.  They are large enough to hold the amount of polish that they say in the description, possible more, I have several rows of smaller polish bottles and fit way more than the amount described. And a great price!</li>
    <li> I love it! The only reason I made the rating a 4 is because it came to me chiped on the top left corner inside the styrofoam. You can&#x27;t notice it unless you&#x27;re standing really close. Pictures provided) other than that, It does what it needs to do. :)</li>
