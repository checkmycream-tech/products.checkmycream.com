      <li>This may be a good product for someone with VERY oily skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels so clean after using this! I love that is never feels dry ! And I have such sensitive skin but it actually does look better after using ! Will add to my essential product list</li>
    <li> WAY too drying for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to a friend of mine with oily skin and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda K Chandler</li>
    <li> This soap works wonders. I just use it 2-3 times a day and my face has never felt cleaner. It does not dry your skin out like other products but leaves it feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> The soap does leave your skin feeling clean, although it really doesn&#x27;t set itself apart from other alternative choice/boutique soaps, such as Dudu-Osun or Tarocco. I havent really noticed any upgrade from those two in particular, which i use regularly. In fact, with the Dud-osun especially, i have found that this Jericho bar doesnt compete well at all...it doesn&#x27;t clear your pores as well, although the drop off is admittedly negligible, which brings me to my two main issues with this soap, given that fact. Price and scent....it cleans almost as well as the aforementioned two brands, but is priced higher ($8 for this 4.4 oz bar vs the same $8 for Tarocco&#x27;s 5.2 oz bar or $10 for 4 Dudu-osun 5.29 oz bars). Additionally, this soap actually smells like mud, which cant be said for any other one i&#x27;ve tried. That isnt really pleasant, and i feel for the price, there should be some sort of compatible aroma outside of just simple mud scented. For all those reasons, i knocked two flippin&#x27; stars off my rating, but three stars aint bad, and reflects the quality regardless of how poorly it stacks up next to other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m not trying to dissuade you from trying this soap. It is very good. I just feel you will find plenty of comparable soaps that are more pleasant and less expensive. Personally, i expected more out of it.</li>
    <li> It was good and felt good on skin but the eczema I have it did not help much.</li>
    <li> this soap is very good and i would recommend it to anyone. i used it everday and it lasted for me about 3 months and it never dried out. very good.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed with the soap so far - did not make my skin smooth and moist....would rate it  &#x27;okay&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells a little weird, but it makes my skin feel amazing. It makes my face feel so much cleaner and it has helped a lot with acne. My acne is like completely gone.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It gets your skin really clean without drying it out.  My skin is very sensitive, and it loves this soap.</li>
    <li> I liked the soap but it flaked and fell apart very quickly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap about a month ago because of the reviews I found here on amazon.com and the soap hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.  It has really changed the look and feel of my skin for the better.  My skin was awful before and i was using a soap that was organic and had pure ingredients...however it wasnt doing much for my skin, it was almost like it wasn&#x27;t cleaning it well enough, but after using Jericho&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Soap, the tone of my skin has become more even, my pores have shrunk significantly, and i dont breakout anymore.  This soap is truly a miracle.  Love it! And will continue to buy it. The scent isn&#x27;t that great, but it works like magic!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I am still on the lookout for a natural non-comedogenic soap for my body because I have shoulder and back acne. It did get my squeaky clean, but I definitely needed a good moisturizer afterwards as my body was excessively dry.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t care much for soaps, lotions, etc. I buy what&#x27;s on sale. But I bought some dead sea premier a few years back and was given a free bar of soap with it. The premier didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me, but this soap has done wonders for my acne. Since I started using it almost four years ago I&#x27;ve had fewer and less severe outbreaks. And one bar goes a long way for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some comments saying it dries out skin, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between this and any other product I use. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but I recommend giving it a chance if you are a sufferer of acne.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the same results as other people stated in their reviews and that was a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> I did not noticed any improvements or worsening in my skin symptoms after using this soap for 3 weeks. I have sensitive skin, prone to exsema, dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for about two weeks now and it&#x27;s honestly amazing. My skin looks noticeably clearer already. It does leave my skin feeling kinda dry and tight after I use it but I have thay problem with almost every other soap I have ever used on my face. I just moisturize with a couple drops of jojoba oil and bam I&#x27;m good. Anyways I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I used to use a different brand of dead sea soap, but the price for that shot up so I switched. This soap is exactly the same - leaves a great feel on my face and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all. So much better than regular, chemically facial soaps.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great for rosacea. i don&#x27;t use it all the time because it seems like it does some clogging of pores, but you wash then rinse then rub your skin where there is rough skin and it will smooth it out. also seems like it keeps it much more clear and manageable so that you don&#x27;t get repeat sensitive breakouts</li>
    <li> Gave this a five star rating because it leaves your skin so moisturized and clean. I even shave with the lather of this soap when washing my face with it and have experienced excellent results. Never will buy shaving cream again. This leaves your face feeling vitalized with the natural nutrients. Would definitely suggest a buy on this one.</li>
    <li> I did notice a difference in my skin the first time i used it. My skin was squeeky clean after i was done taking a shower and once i dried off then my skin was very smooth, i followed up by using johnson and johnson&#x27;s original baby lotion. Man I was so smooth i thought my clothes was gonna slide right off me. The scent of the soap is not what we&#x27;re used to with the brand of soaps at the stores, it does smell like mud, but very subtle so i don&#x27;t mind it. It seems like it will last a while because it is a pretty dense soap. Also, i noticed that it lifts the dead skin off your body rather quickly. After i first used it and dried off, i was rubbing the lotion on my body and felt skin rolling off my body, so gross but at least it&#x27;s coming off. I&#x27;m sure that in no time, my skin will be where it&#x27;s needs to be. I recommend that everyone try it at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ok so i have been using the soap for nearly a week now and i don&#x27;t feel my skin rubbing off anymore, it seems like it got all the dead skin off and my skin is starting to glow. The dark skin under my armpits are getting lighter. I&#x27;m very happy about that, because i&#x27;ve tried the dove cleartone deoderant and it did nothing for my armpits.</li>
    <li> Before buying this product, I read a review that said that it helps to reduce blemishes.  And after trying this soap out on my face, it INDEED DOES reduce or practically eliminate pimples and blemishes.  YaHOO!</li>
    <li> Great product little mashed up</li>
    <li> not my favorite as it seems to become a mushy mess in soap dish....</li>
    <li> Very good soap high-quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  It does not moisturize any better than Ivory soap, and it makes an unsightly mess in the shower.  Granted, I don&#x27;t have any major skin conditions; it is relieves itching for those who do it&#x27;s probably worth it.  If you&#x27;re looking for a luxury soap for normal skin, this is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> While it was a good soap, I can&#x27;t justify spending this much in the long run. I like Dove and will stick to that because it is inexpensive and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent Mud soap that compares very closely to the much more expensive products you can get from direct sales.  Very good product and a very good price</li>
    <li> Been using Jericho dead sea black mud soap on face for over a year now and I love it. MY skin tone has evened out, and it does not over dry my skin. A great soap for face and neck.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for many years, does not leave you smelling like perfume or feeling like something is left on your skin. I will use it forever.</li>
    <li> It is good for the skin</li>
    <li> I use this to battle my psoriasis, Fortunately , its not very bad but this soap does help the itching. I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this soap is gentle, but after bathing, I definitely needed a moisturizer because my skin was dry.  I bought it to see if it would clear up my eczema.  It did not get rid of it, but it made it less severe, except for the dryness.  It would probably be great for teenage acne.</li>
    <li> fast shipper...thankyou&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy it but it does definetly tighten the pores which is great but it is a bit drying on the skin so a moisturizer is needed after use</li>
    <li> I have only used a couple of times and notice a difference in my skin. Would recommend it highly. Awesome product!! Ordering more.</li>
    <li> I honestly think my skin has been worse in the week that I&#x27;ve been using this. I broke out the morning after my first use and it hasn&#x27;t stopped since. I&#x27;ve tried to stick with it to see if it was temporary, but I think I&#x27;m going to have to call it quits.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  A little on the expensive side, but when I read the ads of the other soaps that were similar, I had a concern about granuals in their soap for exfoliation.  I did not want it, so I was willing to pay the extra few dollars on this brand.</li>
    <li> It is true that this soap does not smell the best but oh boy, it does make your skin feel better. It has made mine look a lot better, too. My pores are much smaller and my face feels really great. I am very pleased with how this soap is doing. I am careful not to leave it in water or in a wet soap dish so it won&#x27;t get soppy. I try to leave it where it will dry out and harden back up again. I believe that this soap is a very good product and I am quite happy with it. I plan on keeping a supply of it especially during the winter months when the weather is so tough on skin.</li>
    <li> I returned this product. I should have read the ingredients, this product contains palm oil, which I do not use do to the deforestation and elimination of critical habitat. If this matters to you, do not but this product, there are other alternatives.</li>
    <li> Has helped my dry skin . Great to use on my face.</li>
    <li> This soap works wonders. I just use it 2-3 times a day and my face has never felt cleaner,It does not dry your skin</li>
    <li> I will get used to it.</li>
    <li> It is a dense bar of soap that can be used all over your body, but I purchased it for use specifically on my face.  It leaves my skin clean and refreshed.  I think it will last a long time, so I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  I will consider buying other Jericho Dead Sea products in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this soap. I felt so clean while using it. It leaves no scent behind, which I like sometimes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s just soap! I have a lot of off-and-on cystic acne. I was hoping it would help. The first couple of days it helped dry up my oily skin, but other than that it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
    <li> This is a great, natural daily facial soap. I&#x27;ve used soaps, scrubs, and all the acne cleansers and this product works great. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This soap is the Best! It leave the skin smooth and soft.  I have eczema and it helped heal my skin quicker than normal.  Just costly for daily use.</li>
    <li> Great soap for eczema.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I had read a bit about the dead sea salt mud.  Seems to clean well and leave my skin feeling good. A bit pricey though for a bar of soap IMHO.</li>
    <li> This soap is a great substitute for the pricier soap sold by Erno Laszlo. I have no acne and my face is never dry. My 14 year old daughter has been using this product for 3 weeks now and her skin is clear, acne is fading  and she is really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Very good soap! I used it to wash my face and was very pleased!  Purchase it! You wont be sorry!!!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I&#x27;ll say my rating is based on my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself seems to be good quality, and I like the particles in the soap for exfoliating the skin. It smells fairly nice, and is good as an all-over body bar in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said; I was hoping this mud bar would be more like a budget \\&quot;Wonderbar.\\&quot; Unfortunately, it severely dries out my face, and I would not recommend it for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, especially considering how expensive it is. I loved the ingredient list and really thought it was going to help my skin. The exfoliation on the soap is really nice..but that&#x27;s about it, The soap made my skin break out and I didn&#x27;t feel any sort of improvement in the softness or overall quality of my skin even after using half of the bar. I just don&#x27;t feel its worth the price. I would rather spend money on an expensive bath bomb.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this soap, I was blown away. I had never felt so clean before, so soft! There was no mud smell, which I had been afraid of, and no salty residue, despite the grittiness of the soap. It completely erases any and all budding zits. It&#x27;s made my pores almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your skin feeling very tight, which is initially a rather uncomfortable feeling, but if you apply moisturizing lotion apres-shower, that issue is resolved. All in all, I&#x27;m very glad that I decided to pay $8 for soap.</li>
    <li> This was delivered in a timely fashion and in new condition as stated.  I have used almost of this and plan on reordering it again.  It is great soap and leaves your skin so soft.  Thanks again</li>
    <li> Thank you!  The product was shipped promptly and no quality issues noted.  I have not used it yet, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness...</li>
    <li> this soap will help a lot for itching in moderate to severe psoriasis sufferers. I started using it one year ago and will use it as long as I can find it at a decent price. My dermatologist did not recommend it but noticed an improvement in my condition</li>
    <li> This soap is by far the best I&#x27;ve used in awhile. I&#x27;m not a big beauty buff, and don&#x27;t usually buy $10+ dollar bars of soap. I bought it because I developed a nasty case of psoriasis on my shins. It seems to be helping slighty, but I have yet to see it make a real impact after using it for a month now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Dead Sea salt products, but I was disappointed in this soap.  It does not lather much and I haven&#x27;t found any therapeutic benefit as I have with the other products I use.</li>
    <li> I am not joking, this soap stopped acne that was forming in the first use. Three days later there is only remnants of acne left. Yeah! Also works great on sensitive skin. So happy!</li>
    <li> it was a decent soap.  i didn&#x27;t notice anything different.  it didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis and it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel any different.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  My skin is smoother, softer and brighter.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone of any age</li>
    <li> This soap is very nice, my skin feels nice and clean after washing my face will purchase more in the future</li>
    <li> Amazing bar soap! Exfoliating and smells so natural.</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of research I felt that trying some type of Dead Sea product might be best for my type III rosacea face. This bar last forever I am only halfway through and I&#x27;ve had it for couple of months. I keep it out of the shower to help make it last longer. There is no fragrance really to it. It has done wonders for my face it helps control my rosacea it has made my skin look great.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have any skin problems but I do have sensitive skin and have used this product for years and absolutely love it.  Used to buy it directly from Isreal but it&#x27;s nice to know that all I have to do is order it online and it is here in two or 3 days.</li>
    <li> The bar was left in the shower on the rack and after only a week the bar dried out and started to crack all over not to mention I had to start using moisturizer. This may be a good product for someone with VERY oily skin.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest smelling, just a neutral smell but great foliater.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok but I think Ivory soap would work just as well and it would also be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Heard about this soap and I guess its ok. Not really noticing anything different. I use it to wash my face every time I am in the shower. It does have a little grit to it so I am sure it is pulling some dead skin off my face? Luckily it was not too expensive. I really have no option one way or another about it.</li>
    <li> Great soap, but overpriced--could buy a pack of Dial for less than that.</li>
    <li> Ahhh this reminds me so much of Israel. The soap is so nice. It has a wonderful texture and makes me feel so healthy.</li>
    <li> Makes you feel like you are exfoliating every time you shower, yet leaves your skin feeling amazing. you are not feeling clean unless you have a shower with this one.</li>
    <li> bought this for a coworkers son and she says that it helped him within two days!  I bought this for my husband, can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> hate the clean up... It produces a good amount of mud and an oil-ring on the bathtub that needs to be cleaned every time... So I love the soap, but have limited to using it just on my face, as it is too much maintenance to clean the whole tub twice a day :(  Other than that, it makes skin so soft as well as balances it.</li>
    <li> This soap helped to get rid of my daughters acne. We tried everything, too many chemicals in most products. This is more natural and not only helped rid the acne but she has beautiful glowing clean skin. Use on face, arms and back. Thank you for making such a great product. I give away your bars as gifts all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Lexie Derouchey</li>
    <li> The price is good but not crazy about this soap. My skin didn&#x27;t feel as clean. the adovia mud soap is much better.</li>
    <li> My girls used this and after a few days, one did see a difference in her brlackheads.  But it also dried their skin.  My husband used it once and it burned.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with a few small eczema spots that have appeared during my pregnancy.  Normally, these spots appear randomly during periods of stress and I spend 5-10 total minutes in a tanning bed to kick them.  However, being pregnant, that&#x27;s not an option.  This soap was intended to help with the eczema and has not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, it&#x27;s a lovely soap with a very foamy, smooth lather.  I like the soap and I like the lather.  I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I&#x27;m sure there are lots of smooth lathering soaps at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of mud soap and like this one the best.  There are exfoliating sea salt granules in this that feel nice against the skin and do not flatten out as the bar disintegrates.  My skin feels healthier, not as dry and smoother.</li>
    <li> I have eczema.  This is the only soap I can use on my face.  It does not make my skin break out or cause dryness or itching.  I have been using it for over 25 years to cleanse my face and remove makeup.</li>
    <li> I used this a day or two before I realized what was so great about it. I did not really notice anything special as a body soap but as a face soap.. LOVE hat it tightens up your pours and makes you skin smooth and soft.  Best my skin has looked in forever.  I live in the southeast and recently traveled to Breckinridge Co. It was very dry there and I realized that people in a dry climate may not like this soap at all. I couldnt imagine using it while I was there as I was struggling to keep moisturizer on the entire time (which I never do). My skin type is normal and I try to drink plenty of water so I don&#x27;t really know how oily or dry skin people would feel about it.  My guess would be, NO way for dry skin, perfect for normal and probably helpful for oily.  Will for sure reorder this. (Only negative is wish it was organic since I really don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are.)</li>
    <li> Its mineral composition helps to draw the dirty oil out of my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This product in combination with Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Lotion has helped me see significant improvement in the feel and texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> clears up any skin problems...love this soap!!!</li>
    <li> this is the only soap i will use on my skin! I have very dry and sensitive skin. I love that you get the super clean feel without the drying effect. it dose have small scrubbing balls that help exfoliate too! i would usually not spend $10 on soap, but so glad i did! will never go without it again!</li>
    <li> I used to have such issues with skincare.  This is the end all be all!  I use it everyday and my face is so happy!</li>
    <li> Nice soap and heals the skin!</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with itchy, rashy skin for about 4 years now. It started all of a sudden, drs said I just became allergic to things. Well I went to perfume, dye free everything (almost). But still would claw myself to death after showers. I don&#x27;t know if it was the soap I was using (dove) or if it was the water. Well I got this soap for me and my daughter (she has eczema) and I have fell in love with it! Not only has my itchy rashy skin stopped after the first use, but it makes my skin very soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave a waxy feeling like most soaps do, and makes my legs feel amazing when I use it to shave. I had tried every lotion, soap, and cream out there. The rashes and itching would get so bad I would have to get a steroid shot. This soap has saved my sanity!</li>
