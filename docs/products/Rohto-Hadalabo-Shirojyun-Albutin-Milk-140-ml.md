<li> Not good, not bad</li>
<li> Anyway, when I apply this in the evening, I wake up in the morning and my stupid bright red acne scars have faded into a light pink, no more red!</li>

<li> The only bad thing is the cheap plastic label which the whole thing came off when I heavy handedly tore off the perforated sealer strip.</li>

<li> Due to the whitening ingredients in this, it takes down redness like crazy for me!</li>
<li> and it was difficult to find a moisturizer that would penetrate the surface levels of my epidermis and repair the deeper portions of my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this as an additional moisturizer for my skin on the days when my skin feels a little dry. I have oily acne/clog prone skin that is sensitive and dehydrated (which causes an over oil production). This is an excellent addtional moisturizer on the days when my hada labo tokyo Replenishing hydrator isn&#x27;t enough. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; white liquid moisturizer. It is very white. I have not noticed any &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effect for two reasons. 1. I am already rather pale. and 2. I do not currently have any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the surface redness on my facial skin is much less than it used to be before I introduced this Milk and hada labo Replenishing hydrator in my routine. These are a MUST for me. Your experience my differ based on your skin type and skin type needs.</li>
    <li> This, combined with a Benton product, seems to have helped diminish the feeling of tightness on my facial skin.  I am relieved to have found something that helps for now.  It goes on well, and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I have used this before, so I know how great it is. BUT I was hope there could be a life/EXP date on the product so I could know how \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; the product is. I also know there&#x27;re no this kind of regulations in the US, but I think a good seller should understand and satisfy buyer&#x27;s need.</li>
    <li> This item is described in the header as &amp;#34;Milk&amp;#34; (what we call an emulsion) but is actually a &amp;#34;Lotion&amp;#34; (what we call a toner).  You will not receive the item described in the header or in the picture - you will receive the item described in the fine print (under &#x27;Product Description&#x27;).  I find this sometimes happens with third party sellers - especially ones from outside the US.  Not the end of the world - just a hassle.  Buyer beware and read those descriptions!!!</li>
    <li> Recommended for combination or dry-combination skin. I had severe dry skin (characterized by flakiness, scaliness, tightness around mouth, cheeks and chin, premature wrinkles) and it was difficult to find a moisturizer that would penetrate the surface levels of my epidermis and repair the deeper portions of my skin. After using the Hadalabo moisturizer for about 2-3 days, I saw and felt a noticeable difference. It helps reduce hyper pigmentation as well (since it is primarily a skin brightening/whitening complex). This product also did not irritate or cause acne flare ups as my skin is very acne prone. It is gentle enough for daily use. Keep in mind, this product is very rich so about 3-4 drops is enough for the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was decent (purchased through Amazon Prime) and came with English instructions. Very reasonable pricing for shipping and product.</li>
    <li> Needs some instructions!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it as an emulsion after my Benton Snail Bee essence and I adore it! It&#x27;s super moisturizing and I feel like my skin tone is way more even after using this! I highly recommend it! Oh and my skin type is oily, sensitive and acne-prone.</li>
    <li> Nothing is special. Not good, not bad, just so so I will not use it in summer because a little bit stick.</li>
    <li> A person can crawl out of bed, look in the mirror, and think &amp;#34;Oh, no.&amp;#34;  After cleaning your face, put a tiny bit of this product on your face, and then look in the mirror.  You will look so fresh!  Love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin. At least it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out but it doesn&#x27;t make any improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle at a Chinese cosmetics shop in LA&#x27;s Little Tokyo in September. It&#x27;s now March, and the bottle is still lasting! I apply it in the morning and at night, and it moisturizes really well. I have terribly dry skin, yet people have complimented me on how soft my skin is when I use this! I use it in conjunction with the lotion (aka the toner). My face has brightened a little over time when using them.</li>
    <li> Wow! Love this moisturizer, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;m picky and used to use real pricey products. This does the trick for much less. Light moisturizer ion, makes my skin look young, doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> So far, I am really enjoying this product! I mix it with rosehip seed oil in order to lessen the number of steps in my skin care regime. Very moisturizing and works well under my bb cream.</li>
    <li> Not a very rich cream</li>
    <li> a bit greasy and sticky,however this has faded my dark spots from acne,and has brightened up my face,i hope they make a body lotion as well,i would definitely buy it.</li>
    <li> I actually see improvement after using it for a few days! I have very dry skin, and my boyfriend&#x27;s skin condition is even worse. But now I can see both of our skin glowing even after hours putting this moisturizer on. No breakout for any of us either which is amazing because my boyfriend has acne-prone skin, I have been trying various products to solve his acne problem. This is much more better than I have expected especially with this price it is definitely the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, glad you can get it on amazon.  Comes with instructions in english which is very helpful.  Great moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
    <li> it works great, I use this one together with other lotions, it helps to keep skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;the price is low, so it is a very good buy.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my body as well, seems working very well.</li>
    <li> Nothing life changing. A light facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> When I got the product, the bottle is very dirty and sticky. It looks like a used one or second-hand. Very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the milk a.k.a. lotion. It&#x27;s thicker and creamier. You&#x27;re supposed to put it on after you apply the toner (watery lotion) for extra hydration. Comes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smell! And great results so far. No breaking out. Tastes like a bunch of chemicals, but this product isn&#x27;t for eating anyway.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and perfect for morning wear under sunscreen.  Has a bit of shine if you do not wear powder or foundation.  I was hesitating at first since it contains parabens but after some research and came across Paula&#x27;s choice parabens discussion by its chemist (which makes sense), I no longer afraid to use it ..especially if the whole product produces good skin results.  The only bad thing is the cheap plastic label which the whole thing came off when I heavy handedly tore off the perforated sealer strip. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a non descriptive white bottle with a blue cap.</li>
    <li> I used for months but did not see significant brightening effect from using it. Will try other products of this brand.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh... What can I say about this beauty? Well, let&#x27;s talk about the pros first ;)&lt;br /&gt;1. VERY moisturizing, I wake up in the morning now with only a couple of dry flakes and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Melts into the skin like water... Or a gel! It definitely is not a thick lotion, when you squeeze the milk out, it obviously looks thick and creamy like a lotion, but then when you start rubbing it in... It truly gets watery and milky and just melts into the skin beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;3. Due to the whitening ingredients in this, it takes down redness like crazy for me! It&#x27;s so bizarre that other people didn&#x27;t see that happening for them! Maybe you guys aren&#x27;t applying enough? Anyway, when I apply this in the evening, I wake up in the morning and my stupid bright red acne scars have faded into a light pink, no more red! It is such a blessing! :&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;4. Has been keeping pimples away... Not sure why exactly, since this doesn&#x27;t contain any acne fighting ingredients, but then again... Some people say Vitamin C helps with acne. Who knows, weird.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gives a beautiful dewey look! So keep in mine people with oily skin, if you wanna use this under your makeup, you WILL have a glow. I personally have annoying oily skin, but I love the benefits of this product so i just deal with the dew under my makeup and just apply powder.&lt;br /&gt;6. It does NOT feel greasy or leave any kind of film. It sinks into the skin, unlike most lotions. However, it does feel sticky on the skin for the first half hour after applied &amp;#62;:/ Which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;7. Fragrance freeeeee, yay! Very good for sensitive skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons D:&lt;br /&gt;1. Like I said, it may not be liked for oily skinned people to use under makeup due to such a glowy look it gives. Not greasy though, just glow.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product specifically for the brightening effects, but unfortunately about four or five days, my skin suddenly reacted very poorly.  I had redness, bumps, and skin flaking, all of which lessened and eventually went away once I stopped using the product.  I&#x27;m not sure what ingredients my skin reacted to, but I will not be buying this again.</li>
