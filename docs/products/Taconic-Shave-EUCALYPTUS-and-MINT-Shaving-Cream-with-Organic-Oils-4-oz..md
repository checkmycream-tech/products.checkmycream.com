<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Honestly, this is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used and it easily deserves all five stars.</li>
    <li> I just received it, and the seal was already broken. :(  Hopefully that won&#x27;t affect the how well the product works.</li>
    <li> Nice but not as nice as Art of Shaving. Doesn&#x27;t lather as well. This is a smaller size than art of shaving as well.</li>
    <li> great product with rich lather.</li>
    <li> I had tried several &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; (i.e. fewer ingredients &amp; chemicals) creams before finding Taconic - very glad I tried it. It is a much more creamy base for your brush. Smells nice but not overbearing like some. During the course of a shave, it does need to be reapplied a little, but needs less water to stay on your face.  I appreciate the formula containing organic ingredients &amp; will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Razor bumps disappeared after using this product! Great shave!</li>
    <li> Lathers exceptionally well w/just a little dab but make sure you hands and face are wet and you can get two shaves. The eucalyptus mint feels good and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This will take a place next to my tubs of Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond Shaving Cream and Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar Shaving Cream, I&#x27;ve thrown all of my old cheap shaving creams out (those in a can and in a soap bar).  Doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a rich lather, razor floats with it, and has a great smell to it as well.  Leaves my face feeling nice.  Not sure how long the tub will last, but predicting it will be summer before I need to replace it, using a portion about the size of a grape or a little bit smaller, wetting my badger hair brush with hot water and mixing it in the mug is all it takes.  I have enough to lather up for a shave two times (old habit from thirty years in the military - shaving twice each time).  Am 100% satisfied and would/am recommending it to friends/family!</li>
    <li> Great product...close comfortable shave for face and head...</li>
    <li> Thus is great shaving cream. The smell is amazing and my skin has never been better. And the blade just glides over. Huge amount for the price</li>
    <li> Fist of all, don&#x27;t base your decision to buy on the scent. It&#x27;s VERY mild, and doesn&#x27;t stick around for long. The consistency is so creamy, you&#x27;ll think that you&#x27;re going to scoop half it out with your brush, but you won&#x27;t. I dip my brush right into the tub, and never get too much. I was using Proraso, which has a bit of \\&quot;grit\\&quot; to it that always prevented me from getting as close as I thought I could, and dulled my razor, which is unforgivable. I like this Taconic much more. I don&#x27;t care about organic ingredients, I just care about how it treats my skin and the closeness of the shave. This soap delivers in both areas. It lathers up well, and is quite slippery. Cartridge blade shavers might not get the most from it, it&#x27;s so slick. But it&#x27;s definitely a quality product, and is better for your face than the cans of foamy aerosol soap that do nothing for your skin. It&#x27;s great for those, like me, with sensitive, bump-prone necks. As a plus, a tub will last for a really long time. I shave 2 or 3 times a week, and a canister lasts me over a year. If you use a safety razor, you&#x27;re already saving money, so why not splurge on it? Your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> The stuff is a little on the spending side but a little goes a really long way.&lt;br /&gt;Also it smells nice and my wife wants to kill me 20% less than before.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using the cream. I have used it both brushless and with a brush. There is a significant difference between the use in favor of brush. The lather was good. I used Mach 3 as the razor. It left a cool feel after the shave and the shave was very comfortable. Recommended</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Not only does it use organic ingredients, it smells great, feels great, and goes on thick.  I apply it with a brush that I&#x27;ve shaken the water out of to make sure it&#x27;s nice and thick.  Some people may see it&#x27;s thickness as a downside, but I find that it helps to protect me from nicks and cuts while still giving me the superior wet-shave.  I bought this when my Art of Shaving Sandalwood shave cream almost ran out, and I think I&#x27;ll replace my Taconic cream before I do my AoS.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the scent is perfect for warmer months; cooling and refreshing to help you get going in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re looking for added protection during your shave.</li>
    <li> The feel and smell of this shaving cream are second to no other shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. The good folks at Taconic Shave personally checked on me to ensure arrival of their product and if I was satisfied, which I am! I have told family and friends about this and will continue to spread the good word. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Best shave ever with this shave cream.</li>
    <li> very nice.  lathers well in a bowl with a brush before applying. smooth shave with my Muhle r89 and feather blades.  I use Taconic pre shave oil before this.  Few if any cuts ever and a nice smooth shave.  Scents pretty mild, not really noticeable when your done.</li>
    <li> I prefer another product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shave cream. Combined with the preshave oil, I have had a few great shaves everytime I use these products. The eucalyptus and mint smells wonderful and provides a very slick cushion to work with. I could not be happier, thank you! I was a ToBS fan and still am. But, I think this is my new favorite go to shave cream.</li>
    <li> Wow, this shaving cream is amazing.  Who needs anything from the drug store?  I was using The Art of Shaving but that&#x27;s a thing of the past too....I&#x27;ll be a return buyer, but you do t need much and the product will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Wow! What a fantastic product!  A little dab goes a long way (3 shaves).  my face feels so much smoother and well moisterized after the shave.  The smell is amazing and leaves a cooling effect for 15 minutes or so.  This product makes shaving less of a chore and into an expirence you are looking forward to.  The oils are top notch and do not clog pours.... PSSST this cream, a quality safety razor, and a badger brush make a great gift.</li>
    <li> provides a close comforting shave</li>
    <li> gives me a nice comfortable shave</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product, a little goes a very long way. It left my face feeling good after my shave was complete, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have been shaving with a safety razor for about 3 years. Besides the money I have saved and the close shave I had less problems with sensitive skin, with the addition of Taconic Shave I now have ZERO issues with sensitive skin and the after I shave burn.&lt;br /&gt;A little dab on my brush is plenty for a great shave. I shave everyday and I have never had such a great shave. Like someone else here said the money I saved by going to the safety razor will easily pay for Taconic Shave to be a part of my daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping at least two jars in the house.</li>
    <li> An interesting product that comes up short. The gold standard in this type of product is The Art of Shaving as far as I&#x27;m concerned. As a shave cream it remains thick and foamy on the brush and on the skin. It does not dry out in the jar - if kept sealed - and consistently allows for a friction free shave. The Taconic on the other hand proved to be difficult to work into a smooth lather and was thin and watery on the the brush and skin leading to a rough and dragging shave. My needs were not met with this product.</li>
    <li> I can not believe the lather you get from barely touching my badger hair brush to the crème. Slightly wet brush just poked at crème, didn&#x27;t even see any on the brush, and it lathered up my face and neck fully. Nice cooling feel while shaving, and smells good too.</li>
    <li> Smells great, tingles my face just enough, a little goes a long way, its organic and its perfect, try it!</li>
    <li> After weeks of sneaking dollops of this cream from my husband&#x27;s stash, I finally got my own jar! Works great on my husband&#x27;s face, works wonders on my legs! The foam is so rich and luxurious, and a little goes a long way! The smell is minty and invigorating.  This stuff makes shaving less a chore and more a pleasure.</li>
    <li> This product uses deceptive labelling by saying their are organic oils (true) and then using not so cool or healthy other things (deceptive). I bought it because I wanted a non-toxic shave. My friend in product development at a skin care products company said that this product contains ingredients which could be toxic. She said it is not terrible but not great either. Considering my goal and hopes in purchasing the product, I felt disappointed that it was sold in a certain manner that was misleading to me and therefore returned the product.</li>
    <li> My husband just tried this product and he said it was awesome.  He said he knew it was made by natural ingredients by the smell alone.  It smelled incredible and it made his face very smooth.  I bought this as a present. The nice thing about this company is that they sent me instructions  to my email as to how to apply the shaving cream. As soon as I gave it to my husband I forwarded him the directions. He was definitely impressed and would order this product again</li>
    <li> I have used The Art of Shaving products for quite a while now, and decided to see if there was something out there that would provide comparable quality at a better value (no interest at all in a lower quality shave just to save money).  Taconic has definitely filled the bill - I really like this product.  It is not as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; as The Art of Shaving cream, but still lathers on the brush very well (maybe requires a bit more water), and has a nice smell.  Used with their pre-shave oil the overall experience is about as good as The Art of Shaving, at a more reasonable price (and again, The Art of Shaving can charge a premium because their products are also excellent).  If you&#x27;re looking for a very good quality/value mix, give this a try - I doubt that you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to shaving with a double edge safety razor. Being a man of &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; razors haven&#x27;t worked for me in the past but so far so good with this cream in combination with Merkurs razor!</li>
    <li> I use a dab about the size of a nickel every morning and have barely made a dent in the can after almost 2 months of use.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice shaving cream. I dab a little on my brush and use my shaving bowl to get a nice lather going before brushing it on my face. Since I use a double edge razor, I really like when I reapply the lather for my second pass. There is a nice &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feel when the lather touches my face. I don&#x27;t concern myself with the aroma since it is light and I apply a post shave cream after my shave.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving cream.  I provides a smooth glide for my double-edge safety razor and therefore I get a nice, close shave.  The mild fragrance is nice too.  I will purchace again!</li>
    <li> I greatly enjoy using this product.  The scent is pleasant and creates a very nice lather for shaving.  The fact that it is natural and organic is just a bonus to me.</li>
    <li> I like the shave cream but switched to a tube based cream</li>
    <li> Great lather &amp; a very close shave! Love the spearmint aroma!!</li>
    <li> I did not like it !!!!</li>
    <li> Much better shave now.  Do not have to bear down on the razor as hard.  Face smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It easily compares with the Art of Shaving brand cremes. Though the consistency is much thicker than AOS and lathers slower, it offers a better razor glide (IMO) and costs $7-$10 less. The smell is nice but not overbearing and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my brush or in my mug after use. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Great ingredients! I shave with a straight razor, and this cream allows me to get a super close shave, without any razor bumps or ingrown hairs. All the while, having all natural ingredients...</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving creme, lasts forever too</li>
    <li> I use this not by itself but with some raw aloe vera and pacific shaving cream. This mixes slower than most shaving creams. It&#x27;s almost a cross between a soap and a cream. The ingredients are top notch and though it has a strong minty smell it does not linger  once lathered. This product is mostly of natural ingredients and so is the Pacific shaving cream. This combo forces you to really mix and swirl well so you get a great lather. I use my badger brush. Great product if you don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals on your face. Works great with a double edged razor. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I am very pleased with this and it should last 8-12 months. Saving money less toxic works for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great \\&quot;little way\\&quot; of pampering yourself!  The Eucalyptus Mint scent is very soothing and relaxing.  The lather is very thick and rich, and doesn&#x27;t take much of the product at all to achieve.  I&#x27;m using it in combination with their \\&quot;pre-shave oil\\&quot;, which really makes a difference.  Do yourself a favor and buy both for a wonderfully luxurious, smooth-shaven pampering!!!</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream.  Very clean shave and a nice cooling effect.</li>
    <li> I thought It would have more of a menthol effect. It does the job just fine though, no real complaints.</li>
    <li> Amazed that the recommended thumb size amount is actually plenty for my large face</li>
    <li> I LIKE TO USE THIS CREAM WITH REALLY HOT WATER ON A BRUSH, LATHERS UP VERY WELL AND LEAVES YOUR FACE SMOOTH AND SOFT FOR YOUR LADY.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It smells good. It lathers well. And then it rinses off and I can&#x27;t smell anything any more. All good.</li>
    <li> Found this by accident but thought I&#x27;d try it.  Glad i did!  nice thick lather, especially if you use a brush to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in good time and in good shape.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just tried this today along with the [[ASIN:B004K3QUSE Taconic Pre-Shave Oil]] with a disposable multiblade razor and I have the closest shave I have had in years. I can&#x27;t wait to try this when my DE razor shows up. I have sensitive skin on my neck and this left my neck feeling fine. Also the smell is pleasant and very mild. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This cream does not have as much of a eucalyptus smell as I was hoping for, but it lathers really well and I get a great shave with it.  It does have a nice smell, just not what I was expecting.  I would definitely use Taconic again, but I may try a different smell next time.</li>
    <li> This shave cream gets double duty use on my face and head.  A thin dollop is all you need, as it creams up and thickens nicely.  The scent is delightful and leaves my face and head feeling fresh and clean.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Taconic shave cream is an excellent product: it makes plenty of lather only using a small amount; it feels very soothing on the face; and lastly, it has a very mild, aromatic mint scent that does not linger at all -- which is in stark comparison to other creams I&#x27;ve tried and promptly thrown away.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works pretty well. I would definitely use a brush.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is very thick, but it does not lather very well. I am still using it, but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Compared to AOS and Taylor of Old Bond St,  I rate this a distant third. The product delivers a significantly thinner lather than the others mentioned.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand on a whim,  even though I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the Art of Shaving products. The jar is much smaller--about half the size of the AoS jars--and the product is much thicker. More like a gel than a cream. After 3 weeks I put it away and went back to my AoS cream. Smells good,  though.</li>
    <li> WOW - more than I can imagine&lt;br /&gt;Gives great shave and the eucalyptus and mint leave your face feeling great&lt;br /&gt;Only takes a little to go a long way&lt;br /&gt;This one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years now.  Outstanding shave.  My wife even uses it exclusively for her legs.  I have always had an issue with razor burn.  This is the best product I have used.</li>
    <li> This is my first go around with the shaving cream.  So far I enjoy the clean shave this shaving cream give me.  The reason I choose this product was for the strong reviews, partial use of organic materials and the hope for a strong scent.  There is definitely not a strong scent to this product.  The scent is gone before you even leave the bathroom.  It seems like it takes a long time to lather but since I have never used another product it is impossible for me to compare.  Overall I am still happy with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> absolutely great product moisturize my face and exfoliate my pores greatly, smells amazing I felt refreshed and no razor burn after my shave.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am buying this cream, fully satisfied and will get another one when the time comes</li>
    <li> Best shave ever with this stuff. I&#x27;d absolutely buy it again</li>
    <li> + Makes for a comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;+ A little goes a pretty long way&lt;br /&gt;+ It smells great&lt;br /&gt;+ It lacks stupid gender markers&lt;br /&gt;+ mostly natural / organic ingredients</li>
    <li> Great to use with Badger Hair Shave Brush. Tried the Rum &amp;#34;Raisin&amp;#34; Just didn&#x27;t work for me. Great Smell - Use as much or as little as you like depending on the amount of stubble on your face.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. I really like the scent and that it doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy feel on my face.</li>
    <li> Good shave cream. Smooth and minty. Lubricates well.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaving cream. It was really thick, almost a soap, and created a really thick lather. I use a brush and bowl, and a couple swipes with a wet brush was enough the make a good lather. It was fresh, rich scent, too.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this cream at all. It was difficult to apply on the face. Maybe it&#x27;s because of the organic oils or something but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not that awesome to me... It was smaller than I expected. It didn&#x27;t help or have a good smell... I used for a while, trying to see if it would grow on me, but I ended  up throwing it away... I think this is a product better purchased in person... But that&#x27;s just me..</li>
    <li> Not as good as &amp;#34;the art of shaving&amp;#34; products but it works ok.</li>
    <li> I have used this in combination with the Taconic pre-shave oil as well as the Proraso pre-shave cream. It makes a great lather and smells really nice. The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but it is subtle. I will definitely purchase this shave cream again.</li>
    <li> smaller then I thought but I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This shave cream lathers up nicely with a cool mint feel. However, this shave cream does tend to dry out the skin so additional moisturizers are needed.</li>
    <li> The point is that I just gave up dry shaving, I used to shave with Phillips electric razor and before that I have used shaving foams and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is my first shaving cream, I am not sure if there are better products on the market, but I&#x27;m definitely happy with it. I create a decent lather, certainly I had problems first couple of times, but as soon as I adjusted right amount of water, I managed to build up a perfect lather pretty fast. The smell is also good and not strong. It leaves good feeling after shaving, however I felt a little too dry few times, but after putting a nice aftershave balm it was OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most is that it is ORGANIC, it does not contain Parabens and other unhealthy stuff, as other popular creams and soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After one month of shaving with this cream I realize that the lather becomes thinner and some kind of watery for the second pass. I lather up in a bowl with tweezerman badger brush, the lather is perfectly thick and nice in the beginning, but when I need to re-lather for the second pass, it is not so thick any more and does not stick well to my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot better &amp; less expensive than the previous brand.A good lather clean shave no razor burns,itching &amp; leaves a very smooth sent  after which I have very sensitive skin.i would purchase this again &amp; recommend to my family &amp; friends.</li>
    <li> It was not as thick as some of the other soaps and creams I have tried. This product has a rich smell and an oily look to it. You do not need to use very much of this to get a good thick lather.</li>
    <li> I shave both my face and head, and I have tried tons of different shaving products.  I like more natural products, but many of them either do not offer good shaves or clog up the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gives a great shave, smells great, the container lasts a long time and does not clog the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - buy it!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice all around shaving cream.  I use a DE razor, and this cream makes an easy, water-friendly lather.  It&#x27;s very protective.  It smells great.  It has a bit of a cooling feel to it.  It rinses off my skin and the razor with ease.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized. And it&#x27;s made with products that don&#x27;t come with major health concerns.  Oh and it&#x27;s American made.  Definitely at least give it a try if you&#x27;re on the fence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some words of warning:  All of these Taconic Shave creams are made with natural products, not using those chemical ingredients that make everything shelf stable and white and pretty.  When you open the container, it may be off-color, it may be separated, it may have a really funky look to it.  Grab a popsicle stick or the handle of a spoon and give it a stir.  Everything will mix back up and as long as you don&#x27;t get it hot again, it should stay incorporated.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem with my order, but I&#x27;ve talked to others who have.  It&#x27;s an easy fix and a great, very effective product.  Don&#x27;t let the quirks of &#x27;natural&#x27; dissuade you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as with a lot of natural scented oils like fragrance oil and essential oil, especially when mixed with things like butters (cocoa/shea), honey, and other strong smelling ingredients, if you stick your nose in the tub, it&#x27;s going to smell funny.  It may even smell bad.  But smell the prepared lather and those oils come to life.  Don&#x27;t judge it by what you smell in the jar.</li>
    <li> Great product! The scent is not overwhelming and it makes a very nice lather when used with my badger hair brush.</li>
    <li> feels great, smells great, foams up great. haven&#x27;t had any problems with spreading it or working it in with my brush. i&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> feels good on the skin</li>
    <li> While I would rate the lather and use of the soap as fair to good, the fragrance in at least my jar was minimal to barely perceptible. I like both Eucalyptus and Mint but neither of these two were that notable.</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS THE ART OF SHAVING CREAM AND COSTS MORE AND YOU GET LESS</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cream. I like how simple the ingredients are with no added perfume. I also like that it is made in the USA with mostly organic ingredients. I have had good success getting a rich lather using both the Eucalypse and Mint scent and the Tequila Lime scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like some other users stated the jar is smaller (4 oz) than in other brands (5 oz or more). But when you compare the price per ounce you can see it is not more expensive. About $3.97 per ounce for Taconic vs $5/oz for Art of Shaving. It is more expensive than Taylor of Bond Street ($2.60/oz) but that is not made in the US and it has added perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a little extra money (compared to some creams)is worth it for the Tuconic Cream and I would recommend it, especially over similar natural ingredients creams like Spencer and Devon.</li>
    <li> I imagine this will be better in summer than winter.  It is much more liquid/ fluid than proraso.  This give a nice cooling effect to it-- I find it too difficult to get a rich hot lather from this.  However, it does give a very comfortable shave.  I like how it works differently than my norm-- proraso, which works best as a hot lather.  This is more of a cooling ready to go lather.  No extra work needed, it works straight out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A con to this, is its viscosity.  it is like glue, and always clogs up my sink (so I dont use it everyday).  Im having trouble reviewing this, since its not the typical kind of shaving cream I prefer, but it works amazingly well.  Last summer, I remember shaving got uncomfortable with my hot lather.  This will be perfect for those hot summer days.  Smells great and makes me want to keep shaving.  Thumbs up. Doesnt dry out my skin, glides smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I used this continually for a week and it clogged my sink up bad.  Before, I would only use this a day or two a week.  After stopping use of this (and unclogging my sink), I had no more sink issues.  Its also very hard to keep this hot.  Ill keep the rest for summer since I&#x27;m curious to see how this works in hot weather.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving cream.  I have to shave everyday due to work and this cream is excellent.  I never have any of the irration issues I have had in the past.  I orginally found this looking to switch to something organic and created without tons of chemicals.  I just reordered and will be trying out the bay rum this time.</li>
