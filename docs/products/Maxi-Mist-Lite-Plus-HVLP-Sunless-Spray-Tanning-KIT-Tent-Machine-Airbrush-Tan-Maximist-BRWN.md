<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great buy for the price. Does everything I needed it to do. Started an at home tanning business and never had any issues with any of my customers</li>
    <li> very good kit I recommended!</li>
    <li> I love my spray tan machine, but how the hell do you get an even non orange tan? It is soooo hard! I have my husband do it for me and he sprays me according to the instructions that came with the machine, but damn it&#x27;s hard to get an even nice spray! I used you tube to try to find some help, which it helps a little bit, but I still can&#x27;t get an even tan. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the color that comes with the machine or what. I would recommend turning the nozzle way down! You don&#x27;t want blotchy runs down your body. I would also recommend spraying more like 6 inches away, not the four the instructions say to do. If you do six inches, you can go over your body twice and get a better looking tan. If you do the four inches, it seems like you can only go over your body once, if you do it six inches away. If you do it twice, you get orange and streaky. The machine came fast, everything was there that was described in the add. Love love love my machine, just wish there where more ways to find out how to spray it on correctly. If anyone out there has any tips on how to get an even, nice, not orange tan, please let me know! I&#x27;m basically the orange Ginnie pig right now and it&#x27;s kind of embarrassing!</li>
    <li> great system for the money!</li>
    <li> I love this sunless spray kit. Came with everything it described and have had no problems with any of the equipment. I have used this tanning kit about 4 times. You do need someone to spray you so that you have an even tan. Would absolutely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> this machine works great! Just need a little more practice together more even tan lol and I like all the different color samples you get to try so you know what product you like.the only thing would be it needs a little better spraying  application instructions</li>
    <li> Great product!  The spray tan system is amazing!! The customer service is the best customer service I have ever experienced - Prompt, informative and EXCELLENT!!!  I cannot comment on the solutions that came with this kit because I use a different brand.</li>
    <li> This system is wonderful!  If anything changes, I will post a new review as I have only used it twice, but so far so good!  I have absolutely no experience with spray tanning and neither does my husband, but I am white as can be and know that I hate paying $30+ for spray tans, so for christmas he got me this.  Again, my husband has NO experience, and he is pretty lacking in the knowing what women do to feel pretty market.  The only thing he has going for him when it came to spraying me is being a perfectionist. Also that we read the reviews here to get little tips and tricks of using the system. Anyways, with that said, this product did not disappoint!!! It was easy to set up, came with all parts and directions (tent sent separately, but came 1 day after the rest), and easy to use and clean.  We watched 2 youtube videos on how to spray, did a test spray down with just water in the container,  and then threw caution to the wind since it&#x27;s winter anyways, and tried it.  We used the 6.5% that came with the product and he went over me once, let dry, went over again, dried, and then did a touch up to parts that he thought weren&#x27;t good or dark enough.  (tip if your guy plans to spray you: according to my husband its kind of like painting a car--might help them understand the technique)  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use; pleased with purchase.  Still trying to perfect it since this is the first time I&#x27;ve used anything other than store bought sprays and foams.  I love being able to tan whenever I want to without making an appointment and spending about $50 per session.</li>
    <li> I really like the machine. It works great. I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I didn&#x27;t use the tanning solution because I had my own.</li>
    <li> First time ever for a spray tan.  I sprayed my wife and she sprayed me. Neither of us had any experience and after the spray we sat down and located some online video&#x27;s and realized very quickly we might be in trouble.  Fortunately the next morning after a shower our tans looked like we had been in the tanning bed for several weeks, no splotches, no orange.  I assume from this that the machine is pretty close to idiot proof. The only major problem (that is why I said pretty close to idiot proof) was the bottom of our feet, the over spray settled in the bottom of the tent and now the bottom&#x27;s of our feet are solid brown and this didn&#x27;t come off in the shower even with a scrub brush.  The reviews on the adhesive foot pads are less than flattering (I suggested duct tape but my wife shot that idea down almost before I presented it) but we noticed in the videos the people being sprayed seemed to be standing on a towel, we&#x27;ll try that next time.  I do recommend watching some instructional videos before you start.  Because of some of the other reviews we did not use the tanning liquid that came with the machine, instead we ordered the Norvell Dark solution from Amazon.  This is the first time we have used the machine so I can&#x27;t speak to the durability but I certainly would recommend it and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great at home spray tan system. I would recommend buying a different lotion than the one it came with as it has an orange tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;A great investment for having a nice tan without the damage done by the sun.</li>
    <li> The shipped the system really quick. I had one of my son&#x27;s friends that work in a tanning salon try it on me. She said the gun was really good, and she liked using the system. The hose fell out a couple times while she was spraying me, but she wasn&#x27;t overly concerned about it. The spray came out even, and nice. The tent was a good size and folded small to store, so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room. I got a nice even tan. The color was good. I only used one coat, and it faded nicely and naturally. A couple of the bottles were defective, the company asked a couple questions, was very apologetic, and replaced them right away. Great customer service. The only recommendation I would have, would be to charge $10 more and include and instuction DVD. I was lucky, I had someone that new how to spray, but if I have to do it on my own, the paperwork that came explaining the unit gives minimal instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly buy this system, great value, great customer service, and the end result looks good.</li>
    <li> This machine is a must have for anyone who enjoys looking tan without the damaging affects of the sun. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this. It has been my best purchase this year. It&#x27;s so eas to use (My blue collared manly man mechanic husband is a pro at it😁) it&#x27;s easy to clean, was to set up &amp; take down. The tent is wonderful &amp; provides plenty of windows for light to make sure you have an even flawless tan. Being able to have the capacity to unhook the sprayer &amp; use the blower afterwards to assist in drying, the warm air feels incredible &amp; really speeds up the process. I&#x27;ve also never once had trouble with it clogging or not working the way it&#x27;s suppose to. It&#x27;s definitely something I recommend to anyone serious about buying their own spray tan system</li>
    <li> Good product.  Wish came with better instructions on how to use it.  Good product</li>
    <li> I have used it once with the lightest solution that came in the kit.  Easy to assemble, Easy to Use.  It may seem like it setting it up is complicated but now that I have done it once I am confident I could get the tent set up and start spraying in about 5 minutes. I saw some reviews being negative about the noise volume but did not feel it was that loud.  I did learn that you should turn the spray adjustment all the way down and then slightly open it.  It seems like nothing is coming out when in fact it is.  If you open the adjustment more then about a quarter turn you will get drips and streaks.  I loved the results and I am ready to go again to get some places I missed and darken it up some.  When I think about how much money I have spent on commercial tanning salons I cringe.  This is something I should have bought a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying an at home spray system and settled on this one. It has been amazing! Once you get used to it you will have a perfect spray tan. It does take some practicing. I used to go to the salon twice a week and I like this just as much or more. I did buy a different sution because I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the ones it came with. I love Novell Venetian.</li>
    <li> This sprayer system works great I owned a salon at one time and really missed my sunless tans.</li>
    <li> Again.....product, shipping and ad was confirmed- all excellent!</li>
    <li> This system is easy to use and the results are perfect.  Prior to purchase, I read a review stating that there were no instructions included, which worried me; however, I received very clear instructions on how to use and clean the machine.  If anything, the instructions make the system seem more complicated than it actually is.  From set-up to clean-up, even on first use, it was faster and easier to use this machine than to drive back and forth 10 minutes to the tanning salon I normally go to and tan there.  I agree that there are better tanning solutions out there than what is included, but what&#x27;s included does the job if you can&#x27;t afford separate solution at first.  The set includes prep solution for your skin, several bottles of tanning solution for different levels of darkness, and cleaning solution, as well as the tent and machine.  It&#x27;s a phenomenal value and one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was asked to get a spray tan membership at a big name tanning salon, well to my suprise, this was half the price, and works very well, besides all of the tanning solution that comes with it will last a while, so save some money and buy this</li>
    <li> Works great, love it.</li>
    <li> I wrote an honest review and then the company rejected it. I guess honesty isnt their best policy.</li>
    <li> I love the sprayer, the motor is just so light but powerful enough to do the job perfectly, and I ordered a bottle of Norvell Sunless tanning liquid to be used first because everyone was saying how great it looks and goes on.  And they were right!  It dried by the time my husband finished spraying me and we were cleaning and putting up the equipment.  The color looks great on me.  I had it sprayed on yesterday afternoon and it is now the next morning and I will rinse the bronzer off to see what the color really looks like.  I am very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this machine and it works fantastic! best purchase this year! It is a tad bit noisy but the machine sprays wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Easy to use.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The arrival time for this machine was good and everything was packaged nicely. Machine works great but Im afraid that the trigger is going to break. The tent is huge! (Be careful when you get it out because it is literally a POP UP tent!! Lol). The machine is louder than I was hoping but not extremely loud. Make sure you use a barrier cream with this solution!</li>
    <li> Came much quicker than the approximate delivery date! Used just twice now, and it seems to be a very good quality machine! Louder than expected, but I&#x27;m ok with that. The Tampa Bay solution seems good too!</li>
    <li> I love my Maxi-Mist Lite sprayer, I have sprayed 4 people in a row without over heating.  The tent was very poor quality and shredded within the first week.  The seller sent me a replacement but I have not tried it yet.</li>
    <li> Love it no prior experience to using it get the Noevell Vanetian tan solution the best ever!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan very well, so I decided to get this product after reading the reviews. I have used it once since I got it almost 2 years ago. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s a bad product - it&#x27;s just so much work. You need to have an outdoor area to put the tan tent up. We did this on our patio. You need someone to spray you - and hopefully they do a good job and get even coverage. My husband did mine, and it&#x27;s a little time consuming. You also have to hold your breath because the spray fills up the booth fast. I had to step out several times so I could breathe. Make sure you shave and exfoliate the DAY BEFORE. Do not put this stuff on freshly shaved or buff skin. Make sure any streaks are wiped so you don&#x27;t get weird lines. You also have to wait a half an hour to make sure it&#x27;s dry. It does come off and can stain. The whole packaging takes up some space too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sound like I don&#x27;t like it, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m lazy and it&#x27;s work to make sure you get what you want out of it. It is a good product, but it would have been easier for me to go to a place that does it all the time than doing it myself.</li>
    <li> Love my machine!  Works great and easy clean up. The tanning solution that comes with the machine is ok. It has a good color but doesn&#x27;t go on that well. That&#x27;s not the machines fault though because other brands go on much smoother!</li>
    <li> Nice kit, go to youtube to see videos on how to apply. Saving tons of money tanning my kid, wish I could spay myself!</li>
    <li> It works but you need help :). It&#x27;s difficult To manipulate by yourself. The color is nice. The tent is a must have</li>
    <li> Works exactly how you would expect. It took me a couple sprays to get the technique down. After that my girlfriend has said she can&#x27;t tell the difference between a salon spray and using this system. I would recommend it for anyone who spray tans regularly. I would also recommend buying a different solution, the ones that come with it weren&#x27;t as effective as some of the other brands we tried.</li>
    <li> works great and saves me so much money</li>
    <li> I love it! The solution is really nice too. I am allergic to almost everything and smooth sailing after 4 spray tans. I am very picky and I have not one complaint</li>
    <li> Great at-home do-it-yourself spray tanning kit. Easy to learn how to spray and saves a ton of money from having a monthly membership fee at a tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;Pays for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping, quality product (no damages), easy to use. I bought a different solution for the product, so I am not sure how those would be.</li>
    <li> The wife has definitely gotten her money&#x27;s worth out of this! It was better made than we expected and the little air pump/sprayer has done a great job of spraying the tanning solution neatly on. Be sure to adjust the volume screw almost all the way back (so as to limit the amount of trigger &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;) so that you don&#x27;t over-apply. I started with it fully off (no trigger pull) and slowly adjusted to allow the product to be applied at a manageable rate. That wound up being just less that 1/4-turn open. The whole apparatus works by blowing a constant stream of air out the nozzle and, when you pull the trigger, it allows for the product to be entrained in the air stream and applied. Really a great little unit and considering the cost of paying to be spray tanned, it has been a great purchase. Also, she is using a different spray tan solution than what came in this kit but that is no reflection on the spray equipment.</li>
    <li> Not a very good spray.</li>
    <li> Yes it was delivered on time and easy to use after a YouTube video all went great .very happy</li>
    <li> Great machine! This machine is as good as the professional salon machines. My daughters and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> This machine is great! Also came within 1 day and great customer service. I would definitely recommend you cancel your spray tan membership and get this! My only problem with it is that it does leak solution which is frustrating. The whole kit that is comes with is awesome for personal use or if you plan to spray others.</li>
    <li> I bought this for personal use and it is perfect!!!! Tent folds up super easy, tons of samples to test, and the machine works like dream. The only downside is that there were no instructions. That was not a big deal since I researched how to use the machine before I even ordered it. I love love love this kit! By far, best purchase of the year!</li>
    <li> i practiced on my daughter. the sprayer is a little hard to get used to but the color the solution came with was awesome!!</li>
    <li> This is great, I used with Norvelle tanning solution and my tan comes out very nice.  It is possible to spray yourself, just check out the youtube videos on it.</li>
    <li> I had been researching my buy for spray tanning systems and with so many out there I was a little reluctant to buy one in case I got a bad one.  I took a chance after researching and decided this one would be the best for my money and I was right!!!!  I am so happy that I bought this one.  It is so easy to use and leaves my skin even.  I am not that impressed with the solutions it came with but that is not what sold me on the product so I am not too worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a responsibly priced machine get this one!</li>
    <li> Great little machine.&lt;br /&gt;Need to get use to how handle sprays but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Company was great in shipping promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Also with this order several products came to try out. Still looking for a good solution that looks natural and doesn&#x27;t blotch when fading away.&lt;br /&gt;Machine works well tho and is recommended .</li>
    <li> Works great, many pieces, shipped well. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Present for my daughter...she loves it...says she constantly gets compliments on how natural the tan looks...she did a great job of training Hubbiy to be the operator.</li>
    <li> Love it! Love,it.  Easy to use.  No problems.  Leaves a great color with the Norvelle tanning solution.</li>
    <li> Great machine very easy 2 use.  The color it comes with is not my favorite but it is easy to clean and takes up very little space. It is a great starter machine.</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase for those who love getting spray tans! I have already saved enough money to pay for this set! (I have not used the solution that came with the set - instead I purchased Norvell solution here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt; Being able to get a tan in my own home without having to make an appointment and driving there and back is great! You just need someone who is willing to learn how to spray tan you! (We watched videos online)&lt;br /&gt;  I have a friend who has this set and gives spray tans out of her home - charging $25 per tan. It&#x27;s a great job for her (she&#x27;s a stay at home mom) and it only takes 10 - 15 minutes total to do the entire visit.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and their customer service was very responsive.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use! No streaking! My husband sprays me and has yet to leave me blotchy or streaky! Easy set up and clean up. Takes us 15 minutes start to finch and gives a great summer glow! Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> never have any issues, works great. Comes out a little powerful, but it dries even. Easy to spray yourself with</li>
    <li> I love the machine so far and the tanning solution is fantastic. The rapid tan absolutely blows my mind and how quickly it works. The product is not orange or streaky. Everyone I have sprayed looks incredibly natural,  even the ones who I went really dark with.  I&#x27;m going to continue ordering my solution from this company.  I feel like it dries nicely and smells great,  I can not say enough good things about this product.  It produces such a beautiful tan!  I am so excited to have found this!!!&lt;br /&gt;The tent that comes with it though is a huge pain to put away. A huge pain. I&#x27;m looking for a different one. But I didn&#x27;t buy this product for the little tent that came with it. At the risk of sounding like someone reviewing their own product, my recommendation is to stop looking for tanning solution and buy this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not receive the pop up tent!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny how things spiral out of control.  I owned a &amp;#34;Luminess Tan&amp;#34; airbrush tanning system that I purchased from Sam&#x27;s Club a couple years ago and I needed to buy refills of the tanning solution.  I decided to save some money and buy one of the &amp;#34;Kahuna Bay&amp;#34; sampler solutions.  The solutions were too thick for my small appliance to manage and I wasn&#x27;t certain how much I should dilute the mixture for my machine...so, I decided to take the plunge and buy the &amp;#34;Maxi-Mist Lite Sunless Spray Tanning Kit&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a couple of days in excellent condition.  I used it for the first time last week and the results have been favorable.  I have extremely pale skin that does not tan.  I have used all kinds of sunless tanning products that produce the undersirable orange, blotchy, unnatural skin tone that has been accompanied by an allergic reaction to the chemical component that tans the skin.  Despite my allergies, I decided to take a chance with this tanning system.  So far, I have experienced no allergic reaction and the tan that resulted from the application is by far superior to any of the previous products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband applied &amp;#34;Kahuna Bay Rapid Tan&amp;#34; to my skin.  The results were immediate; however, some areas of my body like my neck, knees and feet looked overly wet and splotchy.  I was worried that I would look like a freak and have to stand under the ceiling fan for an extended period of time for it to dry properly.  After allowing the solution to remain on my skin for 20 minutes, I decided to jump in the shower and rinse it all off.  Believe or not, that did the trick!  My tan continued to develop and it looked totally natural.  I followed up with organic coconut oil to moisturize my skin. As of this writing, I have had no allergic reaction to the solution and because of that, I will continue to use this product with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent system and it comes with almost everything you need to develop a natural looking tan.  I would highly recommend the purchase of PH wipes/spray solution and the exfoliating wipes to prep your skin before tanning.  The tanning booth is an added bonus, but be careful to exercise caution when opening, as the booth springs to life in the blink of an eye.  It&#x27;s gigantic, so make sure to find a space that is more than adequate to accomodate the size.  Restoring the booth to the zipper pouch is a bit tricky, but manageable.</li>
    <li> Really love the machine.. the colors that it came with are not as dark as I would have liked but they work just fine. no streaks. applies even.</li>
    <li> Love the machine I use the Norvell solution with it.It is amazing .</li>
    <li> how long the tan stays ?</li>
    <li> The amount of money I&#x27;m saving blows my mind.  Great product, works with several solutions.  Easy to transport and store.</li>
    <li> LOVE! Perfect way to kick start my mobile air brush tanning biz. Easy to use. Light weight. Products that came with it are great as well. Tent is so easy to set up and take down. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Low quality. Ive been spray tanning for a couple of years and this is the worst product ive used.</li>
    <li> I was paying someone to tan me with this machine when I decided to buy one for myself. It is easy to use and a great value! I would absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> The cup that holds the solution doesn&#x27;t screw in right onto the gun so it drips out and makes a mess, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the gun part or the cup that is defective</li>
    <li> Very easy to use for a first time sunless spray tanner.  My husband uses a similar sprayer to apply paint on cars and liked the spray gun for this application.  The spray was easily adjusted to whatever volume needed.  Fast delivery.  Appreciate the carrying bag.  I haven&#x27;t used the solutions that came with the kit.  I only used Norvell Dark Spray Solution as indicated by other responses.  It gives a very nice, natural tan.</li>
    <li> Read all reviews and questions before operating!! I had to tighten the nozzle to the finest mist setting to avoid freckling. My first spray tan experience was horrible, but after reading all reviews I figured out how to use better. Also used less product with a finer mist. First time I ended up using twice the recommended amount. Just takes some real playing with to figure out how to use it correctly.</li>
    <li> This is a review for the Maxi-Mist Lite Sunless Spray Tanning Kit.  This review is after a year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the husbands spraying their wives.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first start off by saying.... YES, THIS IS WORTH THE $200 BUCKS. MANY,MANY TIMES OVER.  JUST CLICK BUY AND YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me next say....It is much easier than you think, you will not be perfect when you begin, but you can definitely do it.  Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in IL, tanning and spray tanning was a subscription service; typically could range for regular tanning ($10-$15 a month unlimited) and spray tanning packages (4 for $30 a month, low tier solution).  Well fast forward when we move to Texas, holy smokes prices were through the roof.  $30 a month for just regular tanning and $50 a month for 4 spray tans.  That&#x27;s where I drew the line in the sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research,Research, Research, landed on Maxi-Mist unit.  Great unit, will last forever, still have it, never broke, still using it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you are wondering now... how do I spray my wife and not make her look horrible so she will leave the house aka so you don&#x27;t have to hear complaining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice makes perfect.  Less is more.  Take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rule of thumb is pour 3oz of liquid and use about 2-2.5oz.  The reason I do this is the unit is going to have trouble spraying out every last drop of the solution and it will start spurting liquid at the end.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Nossle:&lt;br /&gt;For chest, face, neck, back, rear end, stomach &#x3D; go side to side.&lt;br /&gt;For legs, arms, and sidebody &#x3D; go up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shoot her from about 8-12 inches away from her body, if you start to see liquid dripping, you are too close, back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Tightening the screw controlling the amount of spray and open it 2 twists, at max 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are burning through the solution, you have it on way too high.&lt;br /&gt;If you constantly see dripping, you have it on way too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always like &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; because if you get done with your spray and still have 1-1.5oz left, no worries, just do a lighter 2nd coat.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Tent:&lt;br /&gt;Seems a few people cant figure out how to collapse the tent... just practice then it is 2nd nature.  You kinda of move your arms over each other.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Solution:&lt;br /&gt;The level of DHA % will tell you how dark the solution is going to turn out.  I like the darker stuff on my wife so 12-14% DHA for sure.  However, you can&#x27;t just keep raising the DHA and expect it to turn out.  There is a level where the skin won&#x27;t reflect that level...diminishing returns.  I presume 8-12% will work on most skin.  Start low and move higher.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Solution Brand:&lt;br /&gt;I have tested all the major brands that a consumer can acquire... from the super expensive ones to super cheap ones.  You can find Salon grade solutions if you search hard enough.  I&#x27;m not a paid marketing rep for any solution companies so they can market themselves.... or pay me ;) (tough chance on that).  I have narrowed down to 3 of the better solutions that I use on my wife.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Frequency of spraying/ How long will it last:&lt;br /&gt;Highly dependent on a few things....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure you wife is exfoliating before the spray tan and moisturizing with a GOOD product after showering.&lt;br /&gt;2. The brand of spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;  *Take time to find the right one... I have found the good ones will last 4, maybe 5 days.  The crappy ones will last 2-3.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;When to spray:&lt;br /&gt;Do it at night after she showers.  Let it soak in overnight and rinse off in the morning.  You will see the best results.  It might be obvious but sleep on a separate blanket!  You will stain your bed sheets easily.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Best Practices on cleaning the unit:&lt;br /&gt;After you are done spraying, pour the rest of the solution back into the bottle carefully.  I then fill of the sprayer solution container with hot water and put it back onto the unit.  Turn the sprayer on full spray and spray the water directly into the sink.  This should keep the gun clean for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a quarter, I would recommend using the Cleaner solution that you can find on Amazon.  This will really open up your sprayer and keep the parts clean.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will edit if I think of any other tips..... Just think of all the money you save with this simple process.  Just think of all the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; benefits too ;)owering.&lt;br /&gt;2.

    <li> Works great, once I figured out how to control the flow!</li>
    <li> A decent start up gun. The tent is great. The solution that comes with this is a waste of time &amp; money. Make sure to order some Norvell solution with this. Glad I ordered the brown tent any other color would be brown anyways!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Works like a charm</li>
