<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used the whole jar, without any change in my skin.  It is okay, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I am 34 years old and have always had pretty decent skin but a little on the dry side. In the past few years, I have started to notice a huge increase on the fine lines around my eyes. Recommended by my dermatologist, I have been using this product for the past 8 months. This is the best anti-aging facial cream I have tried so far. It leaves the skin super smooth and the pores less noticeable. I also purchased the skinceuticals eye cream and I exfoliate my skin twice a week.The fine lines have had very little improvement but the overall texture of my skin improved 100%. Sure the price is steep but it&#x27;s less than half of what I used to pay for the anti-aging creams at Lancome and Shiseido, and the results are better. Also, I am still on my first pot (applied only at night) so it lasts quite a bit. I don&#x27;t believe there is a miracle product out there, since genetics, age, and habits play a huge role. But I am happy with the results skinceuticals has given me so far.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market with much less price and less fanfare. The results are greater than most of these high priced, over advertised products with funny French or Italian names behind them. I am not working for this company, but would like to say this is the best you can get and will not regret to buy.</li>
    <li> Showing some skin improvement with minimal use.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful stuff. It&#x27;s thick so you don&#x27;t need much. Warm a small bit between your hands and lay it on lightly. Don&#x27;t forget your neck, and then rub any that&#x27;s left over your hands. You&#x27;ll be glad for this purchase. It turns back the hands of time and lasts as long!</li>
    <li> I have used just about every face cream on the market but this one is the best I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m 57 and this really made an improvement in the look of my skin. I had bought this in the samples sizes and once they were used, had to go buy the larger size. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This skin cream is fantastic.  I use a thin layer at night only.  My skin color has evened out and my skin appears tighter after using it for more than a month.  My skin is sensitive and does not react in any way to this cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I am 50 and noticed my skin getting a bit crepy.  I tried a sample of this and I noticed a difference in my skin immediately.  I have oily/combination skin and I use this at night only and it does not break me out.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I have been getting compliments on my skin regularly since using.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This face cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I was told to give it a little while before deciding, and I did just that.  Now that I&#x27;m on my second jar, I am really seeing a difference.  And, it feels amazing.  My skin is hydrated, glowing, and feels and looks 10 years younger.  I will definitely keep using it!</li>
    <li> I feel that this product has not made much of a difference to my skin.  However, it may be due to the fact that I play beach volleyball and am out in the sun quite a bit, although I use a good sunscreen with a very high SPF.</li>
    <li> Odorless thick cream, soaks in immediately.  This is medical grade skincare not the hype oriented stuff  you see in magazines.  Skin is smooth, tight, practically poreless.  Great for the neck as well.</li>
    <li> I found out about Skinceuticals reading an article in a British newspaper and decided to try it.  I bought this cream first and I love it. I intend to buy other items in the line that suit my skin&#x27;s needs.</li>
    <li> First bought this morning and night cream at a high end spa for twice the amazon price. Even at 2x the price, worth it. I have Tzone skin (oily and dry) and love that this product moisturizes and softens skin without leaving it oily. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Like the product but far too expensive for a small tub.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if will buya again.Small amount goes a long way. But price is excessive.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  However, even being very conservative in applying it (you really do not need to put a lot on), a 1.7 oz. jar only lasts 2 months.  At an average of $125 per bottle, this means an expense of $750 per year.  I cannot justify the price any longer.  Bottom line:  I will find some other way to take good care of my skin.  Sorry to say goodbye.</li>
    <li> After application skin appears to be rejuvenated</li>
    <li> Have not seen any improvement yet with this product.  I&#x27;m a huge SkinCeuticals fan  especially of the CE Ferulic but this expensive product missed the mark with me.</li>
    <li> To fight wrinkles, I call this the &amp;#34;BIG GUNS&amp;#34; - this stuff is amazing, expensive but well worth every penny, you can see results within a week if used consistently</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is spoiled or not but it smells like vinagar and is gritty in texture. I&#x27;m afraid to use it and not sure how to locate seller to report this. [[ASIN:B001LZFUX0 Skinceuticals A.g.e. Interrupter Mature Skin Treatment, 1.7-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I have recently begun using this product.  It is a good overnight cream that does not make my sensitive skin break out and seems to leave it well-hydrated in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is the fragrance - according to the company, the result of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients as opposed to fragrance additives.  Nonetheless, it is a strong fragrance, much stronger than those in other natural or organic products that I use.  I am not sure if I will continue to purchase this product, although I like the results - hence the 4 stars - because heavy fragrance gives me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sniff before you buy.</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a guy. So the fact that I&#x27;m writing and trying all kinds of eye products to get rid of my eye circles kind of creeps me out. I&#x27;m 48 years old. But my dark circles are hereditary and have really degenerated quickly in the last two years, and I&#x27;m sick of people telling me I look tired all the time and having to say, \\&quot;yeah, I&#x27;m pretty tired\\&quot;, even when I&#x27;m not.     I&#x27;ve tried about 10 different products, wasted countless $$$ and gone through about 4 different product samples from my dermatologist, including other Skinceuticals products. So far, this is the best I&#x27;ve come across and I actually see some results with this product. I also use retin-a ($19 @ Costco w/prescription). But that by itself really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my eyes, and while it&#x27;s great for other things, it&#x27;s not designed or advertised to get rid of sunken eye circles.     I&#x27;ve learned the hard way to manage my expectations. You can&#x27;t undo your genes, so I&#x27;ve learned I can&#x27;t get rid of them, but I can make them look better (or at least not as bad). But that took months and months and lots of money I could have spent on better things. Fortunately my wife has taken all my unused products off my hand, so I least I&#x27;m recycling them! What this product has done for me is to increase the \\&quot;volume\\&quot; (for lack of any other word) or increased the thickness of the skin under my eyes, which along with the retin-a which has helped the lines formed by the circles, has left them still there, but I no longer look goth. I can handle how I look now and not stress about it. Even when I&#x27;m tired I look better. I would give it 4 stars, but I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a 5 star product out there. Burt&#x27;s Bees gets good reviews, but it makes me smell like a woman so I didn&#x27;t give it a chance (only my money). Other products were just like a cheap bottle of generic body lotion and did nothing for me. So it&#x27;s worth the $$$$$$$ only because it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Soooo moisturizing!! Keeps me feeling great and it smells so nice...leaves my skin dewey fresh very easy to use and I get great comments fr others.</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a day-AM &amp; PM and love it.  Very light and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin certainly will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am 58 and have had good results with Skinceuticals. I have tried many other products out there. I am seeing good results in about 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over six months and it works wonders. I am 44 years old with some fine lines. My lines have diminished and skin has a beautiful glow it didn&#x27;t have before.  I used it religiously in the am and pm and it took about two months before I saw the effects. I also use the CE ferulic and B5 and cleanse daily using my Clarisonic Mia (if you don&#x27;t have this buy it).  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has an unusual smell. I&#x27;ve used SkinCeuticals for over 10 years and have never had an issue with a product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in conjunction with retinol.  I alternate every other night with these two products.  These products were included in a skin regimen by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Awsome skin line!!! Their products are almost all FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, although very expensive. Excellent service by Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and is my only moisturizer. The price was less online than what it is at his office.</li>
    <li> Love the product. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve been using for 7 months now and gives me the extra I need for my maturing skin. The intellishade is a great moisturizer. Use it moderately or it is too thick on your skin. The brightening wash is excellent. My face feels nice and clean after using the product. No soapy feeling either.</li>
    <li> I am so glad with my purchase. I arrived on the time and perfect! Like i was waiting. Then i point the company to everybody!</li>
    <li> This expensive product made my skin look and feel very good for a couple of years.  Over the past year I&#x27;ve noticed whiteheads, blackheads and bumps that I think are due to a build up of dead skin cells under the outer layer of skin.  I read the ingredients more closely this time and among the ingredients listed are liquid wax.  I am now wondering if that wax is what makes my skin look smooth. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it penetrates the skin. On my skinit may be blocking my pores and congesting my skin.  I am using Skinceutical&#x27;s micro scrub gel and trying samples of firming face creams and serums for sensitive skin (currently firming cream from Body Time) to see if my skin improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern is that the cream contains aluminum something.  I don&#x27;t want aluminum anything in my skin products. Some studies have suggested Aluminum plays a part in Alzheimers disease. I would not recomment this product because of this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be a concern for many of you so I&#x27;ll check back in at this sight in a month to update my review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a number of years - yes it&#x27;s expensive but it works great. For maximum effect make sure all dead skin is gone and put on slightly damp face. I use about 2.5 jars a year.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product that I have been purchasing from my dermatologists. Even the scent is different. I got it smelt it, felt it, and shipped it back. Do not recommend, just spend the extra money in store, so you can save yourself from being ripped off.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE, FAST SHIP</li>
    <li> Will never buy anything else ever again. This is it. Does more for my skin than anything I have ever tried. It really does brighten and even tone. I use this following my retexturizer. Talk about supple, moist, skin. WOW! It is one thing I will splurge on no matter what the cost.</li>
    <li> excelent! I´ve been using for a while and skin texture is like a peach!</li>
    <li> FABULOUS PRODUCT.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This is a very expensive product.  Having said that you only need a very small amount each time so the jar lasts a long time.  It feels so nice when you apply it - like gently brushing your face with velvet.  The scent is subtle, it is non greasy and my sensitive skin does not react to it.  BUT the deal clencher is that it really WORKS and that&#x27;s the real reason I fork out for this luxury!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on smooth and silky.. It firms my aging skin and when I apply my make up, it looks flawless and stays that way the entire day.. I have been using this product for more than 6 months and it works great for me...  My friends always wonder how my skin looks so young..</li>
    <li> Of all the products I have used, this is by far the most effective in renewing the overall feeling and appearance of my facial tone and texture.</li>
    <li> Definitely see difference...</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! Wish they made a bigger jar. - DD</li>
    <li> Love the product...but it is so pricey that I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.  But it is much cheaper here on Amazon than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, even when on sale.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my sister said it was the only thing that kept her skin from flaking from the dryness over a particularly harsh winter. It has a really nice texture and scent, and it is not greasy at all.  I was concerned that such a rich moisturizer would cause me to break out, but it never did.  I didn&#x27;t really focus on its impact on aging (or anti-aging), but I do like it as a night time moisturizer that you can layer with other serums and etc.  I did find my skin to look fresh in the morning, like it had a good night&#x27;s rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that drug-store products can&#x27;t be great, but I do feel there is a difference between similar products from Skinceuticals vs. a less costly brand in terms of how the product feels and how my skin looks after using it.</li>
    <li> I faithfully used this cream daily; moreover it is highly recommended by my dermatologist. I received positive comment about my face</li>
    <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  When I approached the company  about this situation they refused a refund. I finally received my refund a couple of months later but not by them. This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It feels wonderful going onto my skin.  I do have to be careful not to use too much since it feels so good.  I was told that a little goes a long way and it is way too expensive to waste!</li>
    <li> This product adds elasticity and strength to my fragile aging skin. I have used it for a few months now and have been very impressed with the improvement in my skin&#x27;s overall appearance.</li>
    <li> Great skin cream - a tad on the expensive side which is it&#x27;s only drawback.  Noticed results right away. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Good for mature skin.</li>
    <li> Might work for some but not all.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market. Price is high, however, results are great.</li>
    <li> Made me break out. Didn&#x27;t do much for the dry skin.</li>
    <li> as far as face creams go,it is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Over the last years or so i have tried many many products and i like this the best for moisturizing, none greasy and covers the skin with a light film that even outs complexion. One of best products out there...Only downside is the cost, wish it was less...</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It really works and is worth the price.  Besides, it has a very wonderful texture, i.e. for me that means non greasy and non sticky.  It feels good on my skin and I love its subtly fragrance as well.</li>
    <li> Outstanding.  Convenient.</li>
    <li> Great product. Been using it for several years now and will continue to.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. Very smooth and easy to put on</li>
    <li> Quicker than expected delivery.  Used this last night and woke up to an obviously happy complexion.  Wow!  Will never stop using this.  Very thick and moisturizing and way better than La Mer.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my aesthetician  and it is terrible.  My skin is burned, chaffing and dry.  PLEASE try this cream before purchasing from this site because beauty products are not returnable.</li>
    <li> pricy but worth every penny</li>
    <li> I love this rich face cream. It&#x27;s smooth and feels so good. I use morning and night. Just a little in the morning under makeup</li>
    <li> I love this night cream.  It goes on so smoothly and rubs in without being slick and greasy.  It&#x27;s heavy though and not for oily skin I don&#x27;t think.  It feels like silk.  Ill by over and over!</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and skin protectant!&lt;br /&gt;If actually helped with lines/wrinkles I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but it definitely moisturizes and protects skin.</li>
    <li> Love SkinCeuticals! Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals! I really like this AGE Interrupter Cream! A thin layer goes a long way and makes my skin feel so good. I noticed a visible difference in the look and texture of my skin in the first week. I use it morning and night and have combination skin. The more I use it, the better it gets. It has prompted me to invest in more of the product line... Which I love, too! Product arrived on time, in good condition, unopened and authentic. Recommend seller.</li>
    <li> Yes I very much like it will certainly buy again hopefully it will be at a good price again when I need it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and I do feel it make a difference in my skin, but, as with most expensive skin products, this is not a large jar and I go through it more quickly than I would like</li>
    <li> Have been using for several years and love it.  I get a lot of complements on my skin and I attribute to this product.</li>
    <li> After using so many products for years I do believe this product made a difference just as it claimed it would.</li>
    <li> Good for your skin!  Keeps your skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> I broke out the two times i tried it. Both times I didnt find it moisturizing it felt like it laid on my skin only. Return policy stinks too. So, I suppose I will throw it.  (I am 39.) I have used high end brands and thought I would explore my options and heard great things of this brand.  I ordered the day cream and AGE eye cream as well. I think the eye cream is satisfactory. I will finish this bottle of it and not order any more of this brand of products.</li>
    <li> I really love placing A.G.E. Interrupter on every morning after putting on my Vitamin C Serum and Feurilic Acid! I didn&#x27;t do either one for approximately 3 months and my skin started to look sallow but immediately perked up again when I used both products. My skin looks radiant and glowy all day long and absolutely no one can believe I am the age I am and I attribute it to the good skin care products I use, especially this one!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Skinceuticals A.g.e. Interrupter is just what it promises ... a wonderful treatment for those of us who admit to having &#x27;mature&#x27; skin.  I have hypothryoidism, a condition that can cause many skin problems, especially dryness.  The Skinceuticals A.g.e. Interrupter is the best moisturizer I have found in my quest for &#x27;normal&#x27; skin.  It is not greasy, and literally goes on like velvet.  Almost immediately after application, makeup can be applied.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of face creams, and this is one of the best.  It feels wonderful on my skin and hydrates without a greasy look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey, but you don&#x27;t need much.  A bit of sunblock and I&#x27;m all set.</li>
    <li> It has done wonders for my skin! Since I am in my 40s, I must keep my skin very moisturized! This product does the trick.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> This is good skin cream.  Not greasy and almost no scent.  Clears up my dry patches after a few days of use.  It was recommended and sold by my dermatologist, but it is less expensive at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I certainly am mature,53, but my skin doesn&#x27;t look it.  I am always getting told that I don&#x27;t look my age.  I have used this product for the last two years.  It works without clogging pores.</li>
    <li> Best cream l ever used</li>
    <li> very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Great product, my second order--very rich but not heavy and skin is so smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> keeps you looking young</li>
    <li> I like it, but I not crazy about it.  It light not grease, and soft my skin for me is an average cream, but good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals A.G.E. Interrupter for about 3 years and it by far the best!!!  Also....I save $70.00 per jar by shopping&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon..</li>
    <li> So far this is a great product, and I love it.</li>
    <li> The product is great but it seemed a little old.  The lid never screws on correct.  Not sure I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Great Seller and Great Product</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for a treatment/serum to use daily where I would actually SEE the results.  And with this cream, I have!  It goes on easily, feels silky and has helped reduce my fine lines, pores around my nose &amp; the creeping that is starting.  I am early 30s but have had a fair amount of sun exposure most of my life.  Highly recommend &amp; amazon has the best price!!</li>
    <li> I noticed right away my skin was smoother and I had fewer visible lines.</li>
    <li> my wife has used this daily for years</li>
    <li> I have tried many...too many moisturizers. I have combination skin. Other moisturizers would make my skin appear oiler than it actually was. This moisturizer goes on and into the skin. It actually gives the skin a smooth almost matte appearance....even after hours of wearing it!</li>
    <li> Great product, have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> Age and sun have taken it&#x27;s toll on my face and body. I&#x27;ve tried many, many creams. To date, this works well for me.  The crinkling is minimal and the tautness of my facial skin has improved. I&#x27;ll continue to use this for a few months more to see if I get a continued improvement like I&#x27;m seeing now.</li>
    <li> I have not had this cream long enough to see any noticeable change, but it is great as a moisturizer and I love the way it feels on the skin - very silky but not greasy at all!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very soft... I can tell the difference when I cleanse my face....soft....</li>
    <li> Dr recommended - smell is awfull- can hardly stand! Not sure if sample dr gave me smelled this bad! Doesn&#x27;t smell once on- I am so sensitive to product smell. My skin is also &#x27;mature&#x27; &#x27; - 57 and sun damaged- years of Tazarac (Retina product) - just switched to Renova- much gentler. Used to be oiler- now dry and sensitive- very hard to find products that don&#x27;t sting. - this stings somewhat at first- be careful not to use too much- per other reviews. Product would be quickly gone! - not sure if I&#x27;ll repurchase- plan to talk to dr about another product.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the results in just a few days! Texture of my skin has improved, can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few weeks!</li>
    <li> Moisturizes without feeling greasy. Seems to make the skin feel more supple and tightens the skin. I have recommended this cream to others. Great on-line price.</li>
