      <li>yes, it was worth the wait!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite large, so make sure you have room for it.</li>
      <li>Before I would lose things right in front of my face, but not anymore!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Need to Package better. The acrylic was cracked but we love the item itself..... Thanks</li>
    <li> Honestly if your debating just do it. WORTH THE MONEY AND YOU WONT FIND IT CHEAPER.</li>
    <li> The handles on this are horrible! they are very sharp! I bought a similar one with smooth round pulls. The way it should be. Sorry, but it needed to be said. It has a lot of room for makeup hoarders like me..Lol! It came packaged very well. No cracks.</li>
    <li> This item is not like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item has arrived, but it was different from the picture at the Amazon website.&lt;br /&gt;-the picture has logo for \\&quot;sherrieblossom.com\\&quot;, but what I got does not have.&lt;br /&gt;-They took someone-else picture instead of your real product pictures&lt;br /&gt;-There is visible glue and the edge is rough, it has only 1 divider, the handle is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The measurement of the product is correct.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pls be aware this is not the actual &#x27;sherrieblossom&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived broken after a two month wait. Mar Display agreed to send a new one out but never did, I&#x27;ve been unable to contact them by phone and by e-mail after about 10 attempts.</li>
    <li> I have had this make-up organizer for a few months. The lid has already cracked. I believe the acrylic is too thin. I have another similar case for several years &amp; there are no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I never dreamed I would love this thing so much!  I wasnt even sure I would keep it. Then, I filled it up with my stuff, and it has made my life easier!</li>
    <li> Love this cosmetic case. It&#x27;s large &amp; durable &amp; can hold all of my make up &amp; brushes.</li>
    <li> LOVE this! Very good quality, thick acrylic- not thin flimsy or flexible type. Can fit a TON of makeup &amp; you can dedicate a drawer to each type.... eye shadow in one, blushes in another etc. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because of the high price, though I did do my research &amp; found this to be the best bang for my buck 👍</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing organizer. I ordered this on a Friday, June 13th and received it the following Tuesday, June 17th .  I was really impressed by the speedy delivery.  But I was even more impressed with the organizer itself.  It looks just like the one in the picture.  It was packaged really, really well.  I love the size and look of it. It fits fine on my bathroom counter. The drawers are really deep. This is an AWESOME gift to myself.</li>
    <li> First of all this came in a gigantic box, so big I thought oh no!  This will never fit on my vanity!  Opened it up and to my relief the hugeness was from the wrap.  It was bubble wrapped so well that I seriously think it could have been dropped off an airplane and still been safe!  Took me 10 minutes to get it all unwrapped!  It is big, but not too big for where I put it.  It&#x27;s perfect.  I was able to put ALL my make up in it and I&#x27;m so much more organized now.  Before I would lose things right in front of my face, but not anymore!  Worth every penny.  Well made and pretty too! I&#x27;ve tried Lori Greniers carousel organizer and I hated that thing.  It would get caught when rotating it and stuff was always falling out.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on that or any others.  This is the perfect one!</li>
    <li> I love this for all of my makeup.  Great size for my new makeup vanity that my hubby made for me.</li>
    <li> For anyone who is looking to buy an acrylic makeup organizer but doesn&#x27;t want to spend $300+ for the Icebox, buy this one!! It&#x27;s large, functional, fits a huge amount of makeup, and looks amazing! The box was very well packaged with no damage at all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This organizer comes in useful, as you can see all of your items that you are holding. The top opens up, like a jewelry cabinet. I find that useful to see and access items that are used day-to-day, and it does hold quite a bit, as the drawers are spacious. It&#x27;s sturdy, and easy to clean as well. The seller, Mar Display, shipped it very quickly, and definitely took care in making sure it arrived damage-free.</li>
    <li> Great product .  This thing is huge.  Watch whet you put it.  I&#x27;ve ran into it a few times.  Holds all of my make up neatly.</li>
    <li> I really did not realize how huge this item is. I do have tons of make up and this thing will swallow almost 75% of my collection. I did not wish to put my entire make up collection in this thing as I am sometimes ashamed of my habit, lol.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the buy and a great investment. it was package nicely with one small minor scratch on it. Probaly came from the manuafactoring process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you dont have anough make up to fill this up, you will spend money so that you can fill it up.&lt;br /&gt; Enjoy ladies.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer. It&#x27;s quite large, so make sure you have room for it. It holds all of my cosmetics. And it&#x27;s very useful that the top lifts up so that I can store bottles for q-tips, cotton balls, and floss picks. It came bubble wrapped and stored in peanuts, so it was in perfect condition. It took less than one week to arrive. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, despite the high price tag.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I ordered it for my wife and she could not be happier! It has plenty of space in each drawer, the workmanship is also great! I called to order some extra dividers and experienced terrific customer service, thank you Jamie I will definitley be doing business with MARDISPLAY again!</li>
    <li> Awesome customer service. Prompt response. The acrylic unit is strong and built very well. Definitely high end. Worth the $$$$. Will hold a lot of makeup on one drawer. I love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i have been reading on every kind of clear large make up box on google, i went to amazon ,and fell across this , i love the box so,so much i feel it is the dream make up storage. it is huge compared to my munji drawers. and i love how big it is. the drawers are deep and long i can even stack full size products on top of each other and still close the top lip and drawers.i know I&#x27;m going to buy this again, and the price is crazy cheap, compared to clear cube, sherry blossom ice box, and the diva clear make up box. its like 300 to 250 bucks lower than the others wow i was shocked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this organizer it is perfect my cosmetics are in order and free of dust! thank you</li>
    <li> I LOVE this organizer. I use it for my jewelry. It is amazing and so useful in storing and organizing. I purchased it about 9 months ago and it&#x27;s very sturdy; I haven&#x27;t had any cracks or problems with it (with daily use). I did a ton of research before buying an acrylic organizer since they can be pricey. I found this one to be the nicest and worth the price. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this item because of certain reviews, however, I&#x27;m SO HAPPY I did.  The packaging was great and it was delivered in a timely manner.  It looks exactly like the picture and resembles the much price brand COSMOCUBE.</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer has exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The wrapping was wonderful, they took care to make sure it would not get damaged while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is excellent, it is very roomy it fits all my makeup with room to grow.&lt;br /&gt;It came with an X divider, I would have liked to have the option of ordering different configurations of dividers.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has seen mine has commented/inquired about it. My daughter loves it and wants me to order one for her as well.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I purchased this makeup organizer! It was a little pricey, but worth every penny by consolidating all my makeup, brushes and even having room for more! Totally worth it :D</li>
    <li> Perfect!! I did a lot of research and the quality is GREAT!!! I love the size and depth of the shelves. Its VERY well made!  The shipping is free and what a savings that is!  :) it comes so well packed, i swear it could have been dropped and it wouldn&#x27;t have damaged!  It had three layers of packing stuff. Shrink wrap,  then bibbke wrapped (TWICE ), and then peanuts. I cant reccomend this more!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. The quality is great,very sturdy. Shipped fast. Great,safe packaging. I will be ordering more, for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality acrylic chest I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Incredibly well wrapped with peanuts,  bubble wrap and plastic sheeting, it arrived in perfect condition.  It is huge.  Make sure you measure your space before ordering.  All I thought about was the footprint, not how tall it was going to be.  Drawers are wonderfully deep.  Thick,  transparent acrylic makes it so easy to see where everything is stored and forces me to be neat. Sturdy enough to tolerate my 10 lb. Cat sitting on it every day</li>
    <li> I love everything about this makeup organizer! It was packaged very well for shipping, all of my makeup fits, items are easy to find, very sturdy construction, easy to keep clean and it looks great on my vanity. Well worth the price, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> I love the amount of drawer compartments. I just wish it had smaller compartments on at least 2 drawers. love the height and width.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife for mothers day she loved it its pretty big but holds alot of makeup if u have. very strong and not cheap. shipped fast i ordered it saturday afternoon was here by tuesday. it was well wrapped in bubble wrap and popcorn. i would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for anyone who loves their cosmetics! It arrived in two days in amazingly effective protective packaging. Needed to contact the manufacturer for small issue and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer or more cooperative. Very customer friendly. Highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> I had to contact the seller about ahipping details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were excellent and very accommodating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your thinking about buying this item, it is certainly worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mar Display&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Sharon L Cunningham</li>
    <li> I got this for my older sister for Christmas, and she loved it! absolutely love it. They did a great job in shipping, nothing was broken or there wasn&#x27;t any damage to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely  recommend!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is not an inexpensive organizer by any means, however I must say that in this case you get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;It is sturdy &amp; well made.  The organizer is quite large and substantial, which is what I wanted.  Plenty of room&lt;br /&gt;for organization.  One thing I wish was also available was more drawer dividers to personalize your own way&lt;br /&gt;of organizing.  The second drawer (which is the first pull out drawer) comes with an \\&quot;X\\&quot; shaped divider which&lt;br /&gt;is helpful, but having the option to personalize the other drawers would make this surpass excellence!&lt;br /&gt;As it is it is a real winner &amp; I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the product was superb.....the seller was very conscientious in their packaging to this&lt;br /&gt;organizer.  I was very impressed with the lengths they went to in order to insure my organizer arrived without&lt;br /&gt;any damages.  I would say that you may have to be patient for the shipment to arrive, as it took 16 days to&lt;br /&gt;arrive......yes, it was worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this makeup container. The price is great and it looks great too. It looks bigger than the photo which is fine for me because I have a lot of make up. It came packaged like Fort Knox. They &#x60; amazingly packed it so well I actually recommend this box to everyone!</li>
    <li> this purchase marks my 4th one of these boxes...my 82 year old mom keeps all her meds sorted in one of these...i have one for my creams and cosemetics, another for my meds and first aid and otc stuff and i just bought one for all those tech cords and paraphenalia and office supplies...if u need a bandaid of any size, a stamp or scissors, i am on it...huge time and frustration saver...l</li>
    <li> OK I admit to watching the Kardashians a couple times and spying this filled with cosmetics in their bathrooms...these go for big bucks at Neiman Marcus...finally I located these on Amazon and I ordered one for cosemetics and another to organize &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; and then I sent one to my mom to organize her medical supplies...very please and these are actually money savers because you can see what you have in cosemetics and save time because you know where things are...</li>
    <li> I really like this thing!  It makes me actually look forward to putting on make-up (sort of).&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen &amp;#34;the cube&amp;#34; made famous by the Kardashians sp? (in person), but this one did NOT disappoint.  Very carefully wrapped for safe shipping, I might add.</li>
    <li> Met expectation. My wife loves it and recommends it for future buyers.  Solidly constructed and elegant at the same time.</li>
    <li> I saw this item offered for less but in reading the dimensions I realized this was the real deal. The Kardashian acrylic organizer. So wonderful! Arrived well packed, not a scratch to the acrylic &amp; can with a one-time use cleaning packet for suggested cleaning. My daughter loves it and can see all her beauty/makeup products. It is made so well that it will last a long, long time. I recommend this seller. Quick ship &amp; like I said....packed sooooo well!!! I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful box.  It arrived well packed and in perfect condition.  Be sure you have room for it in your bathroom as it is very large.  My makeup looks great in it.</li>
    <li> I just got my great makeup organizer. I am loving it but there are so problems. First of all the top lifting section is kind of annoying, I would have preffered it just to be all drawers. Also it would have been nice to be warned that perfume will crack the plexi glass. I got some perfume on it and its cracking where ever the perfume is. So weird. Overall like the organizer and would recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased this makeup organizer.  Now it&#x27;s so much easier for me to get ready, because my makeup is very organized now.  I can see what I have and all of my makeup is right at my finger tips.  I only wished that the manufacturer would have sent more drawer inserts, so that I could divide the drawers into various sections.</li>
    <li> Love it, perfectly packed , good quality. Worth the price. Its expensive but it is of a good quality. I paid but I received what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks. . Definetely would buy from you again.</li>
    <li> I love my make up organizer. As soon as  i got it I went straight to organizing my make up! Item was just as described although I wish it had more dividers.</li>
    <li> This makeup organizer is very high quality and worth the money. Drawers slide perfectly, acrylic is in perfect condition - there is nothing cheap about this beautiful organizer. The drawers are deep - make sure to look at the measurements when deciding which brand is right for you! I would have liked one additional divider (H shape). so, I bought another companies divider for $15 and improvised.</li>
