### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>results of this product are totally awesome.</li>
      <li>The delivery time was very good.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to work this great.  </li>
      <li>I have researched and reviewed loads of great stuff regarding this product.</li>
      <li>I have always had a problem getting in great shape on my stomach area.</li>
      <li>I began applying it before my spinning (with neoprene slimming belt) and aerobic sessions and the results have been great.</li>
      <li>That was 11 days ago, I have since replace Nivea Good Bye Cellulite with Celluthin.</li>
      <li>The price was good.</li>
      <li>A month before using Celluthin, I applied Nivea Good Bye Cellulite, start taking multi-vitamins, flaxseed oil and a vinegar based supplements, change my intake of food to olive oil, fish, brown rice, vegetables and oat.</li>
      <li>but i am very glad i tried it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>i love this product and the people who make it !</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own?</li>
      <li>Nice minty smell and not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>The results have been spectacular</li>

      <li>At 140 lbs, my weight is ok.</li>
      <li>I feel that the area appears to be more toned.</li>
      <li>With Celluthin, I can see a more defined waistline with flatter tummy.</li>
      <li>hope others have better luck with this product than I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
      <li>Since using celluthin, my problem area has most definately improved.</li>
      <li>It seems to cause me to sweat more in the areas to which I have applied it.</li>
      <li>I am happy with celluthin and really recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love everything about this product.</li>
      <li>After applying it twice a day for 3 weeks, I can claim that my thighs never looked better.</li>
      <li>:) &lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Well, I was very excited to use this after reading some of the reviews.</li>
      <li>I first used the product as a stand alone application, and the results were good, then going off of a review that was posted here</li>
      <li>Overall, I rate it very good.</li>
      <li>The smell is clean and refreshing and it goes on like a light lotion.</li>
      <li>The cellulite is not %100 gone, but there is a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>but it does leave my skin feeling smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>But as far as the cream is concerned it goes on easily and smells nice.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Fully clothed I felt pretty confident with my body image however put me in a swimsuit</li>
      <li>I have not noticed a significant decrease in the appearance of cellulite on the front of my thighs.</li>
      <li>After only 1 bottle of the Cellumin, I do not see a remarkable change in the firmness of my arms</li>
      <li>The cellulite ripples were significantly smoothed.</li>
      <li>I like the consistency of it and it has a really light, sweet, non-offensive smell to it.  </li>
      <li>It goes on more like a gel and is not sticky, and has a pleasant (although a little strong) minty smell.</li>
      <li>Or if you are not a heavy person and have cellulite it could be effective for you as well.</li>
      <li>It is probably a good indication that it&#x27;s transdermal and working it way deep into the skin.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of Celluthin, although the gel applied smoothly.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth another try.  </li>
      <li>The product is good but leaves a little residue on top (does not rub in completely).  </li>
      <li>Using just a marble size of the gel, I can feel a slight warmth which I did not feel when using Nivea Good Bye Cellulite.</li>
      <li>Since I have started using Celluthin I can see that it is starting to appear more toned.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t smoke/drink, I work out regularly and have a healthy diet, so I didn&#x27;t have to change my life style when I was using the cream.</li>
      <li>some \\&quot;hot moms\\&quot; at the gym that recommended Celluthin</li>
      <li>First and foremost: the results I have achieved in my problem areas.</li>
      <li>would have given this a higher rating but the bottle came damaged.</li>
      <li>My stomach and thighs have become tighter and more toned in only 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>, I REALLY wonder about all these positive postings....  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve a straight body type and always have quite a bit of tummy fat (no cellulite, just fats) even since I was a child.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful when I ordered Celluthin, but I wanted to give it a try based on the reviews.  </li>
      <li>The area is so much smoother and tighter now.</li>
      <li>I was very dimply when I moved here to Florida from NJ.</li>
      <li>As much as I worked out it was just a matter of time before it creeped up on me.</li>
      <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I also lost a significant amount of weight which left me with lose skin.</li>
      <li>The top doesn&#x27;t allow you to press down on it to dispense the cream.</li>
      <li>I have this little pooch that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of (not that I&#x27;ve really really tried besides like inconsistent situps alone.</li>
      <li>I have been using celluthin for a few weeks, and I really like it better that fat girl slim by Bliss, which was too greasy.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t have THAT much on me in the first place, but enough to make me do something about it immmediately.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it to others with my issue.</li>
      <li>I rub it on and the energy (and improved mood and outlook) come right back!</li>
      <li>Just live with it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have very far to go just tightening up on my tummy.</li>
      <li>I have seen somewhat diminishing of the cellulite on my backside however but that was only when I was dieting and exercising consistently.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about two weeks now, but I really do notice a difference!</li>
      <li>I am totally doing everything I humanly possibly can to get into tip top physical shaped.</li>
      <li>I always have worked out religiously and was very upset to see what I discovered in the mirror just recently...cellulite!</li>
      <li>cellulite at 25 years old is UNACCEPTABLE in my book!</li>
      <li>I also started a diet around the same time I&#x27;ve tried diet and exercise alone before and didn&#x27;t exactly lose inches on my hips and thighs.</li>
      <li>I just want to get rid of the flab in the middle without loosing too much weight.     </li>
      <li>So far it has not stained or caused any problems, though.  </li>
      <li>I would not waste your money on this product.  </li>
      <li>I have placed 1 order so far and will be ordering again.</li>
      <li>It is even more obvious as my hips are quite narrow.</li>
      <li>The high carb diet has created quite a bit of bloating especially during PMS.</li>
      <li>After all I live in Southern California....</li>
      <li>I was VERY good about using it two times daily :(</li>
      <li>I went as far as using a personal trainer.</li>
      <li>I can barely see the cellulite....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a solid \\&quot;six pack\\&quot; or anything near close to one.</li>
      <li>can honestly say that I see an improvement on my troubled areas.</li>
      <li>At first i was a little hesitant using a product like this</li>

<li> I have been using the cream for several weeks and even if it was not much what I wanted to lose, I believe there&#x27;s been some fat reduction in the abdominal area, I might use it again.</li>
<li> So you don&#x27;t need to use long term.</li>
<li> The ONLY difference I saw was somewhat, and I mean only somewhat smoothing of the skin directly upon applying.  </li>
<li> I have been usingit everyday for the last month and let me tell you, I see a big diffeence on my fanny.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am totally doing everything I humanly possibly can to get into tip top physical shaped. (like I used to be before the birth of my daughter) &lt;br /&gt;I not only started a strict diet and exercise plan but also started using celluthin as a topical fat burner. I can&#x27;t say I owe these dramatic results to just one of the weight loss factors I have started but whatever the case may be I am seeing serious results as far as the cellulite is concerned. I believe in the whole topical fat burning theory because exercise alone won&#x27;t get to the fat that is just beneath the skin if you are a heavy person. Or if you are not a heavy person and have cellulite it could be effective for you as well. I am happy with celluthin and really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve a straight body type and always have quite a bit of tummy fat (no cellulite, just fats) even since I was a child. It is even more obvious as my hips are quite narrow. At 140 lbs, my weight is ok. I just want to get rid of the flab in the middle without loosing too much weight.     Previously before using Celluthin, my diet consisted mainly of white rice, bread and stirfry vegetables and fruits. The high carb diet has created quite a bit of bloating especially during PMS. A month before using Celluthin, I applied Nivea Good Bye Cellulite, start taking multi-vitamins, flaxseed oil and a vinegar based supplements, change my intake of food to olive oil, fish, brown rice, vegetables and oat. After 4 weeks, my bloating reduced but the waist lost was about 1 inch. That was 11 days ago, I have since replace Nivea Good Bye Cellulite with Celluthin. With Celluthin, I can see a more defined waistline with flatter tummy. I have lost a further 1.5 inches and that area has become quite firm and toned with just 11 days!    I only apply both gels on the tummy area which was loose and flabby before. I also note that the instruction says apply on one problem area at a time and no more than twice within 24 hours, which I did. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of Celluthin, although the gel applied smoothly. Using just a marble size of the gel, I can feel a slight warmth which I did not feel when using Nivea Good Bye Cellulite. It is probably a good indication that it&#x27;s transdermal and working it way deep into the skin.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a significant decrease in the appearance of cellulite on the front of my thighs. I only purhcased the product for that reason and I&#x27;ve been using it for approx a month and the bottle is almost empty and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth another try.  I&#x27;ll stick to the less expensive Nivea shaping cream!</li>
    <li> I am one of those skinny women with a bad case of cellulite (See Mischa Barton). I tried some other creams (like Nivea) but nothing worked for me. I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful when I ordered Celluthin, but I wanted to give it a try based on the reviews.  I don&#x27;t smoke/drink, I work out regularly and have a healthy diet, so I didn&#x27;t have to change my life style when I was using the cream. After applying it twice a day for 3 weeks, I can claim that my thighs never looked better. The cellulite is not %100 gone, but there is a huge improvement. I can see the orange peel look only when I squeeze the skin now (and yes, that is an improvement in my case).</li>
    <li> I have started using this cream back in January. I also started a diet around the same time I&#x27;ve tried diet and exercise alone before and didn&#x27;t exactly lose inches on my hips and thighs. Genetically I have the tendancy for heavy thighs and hips.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I see an improvement on my troubled areas.</li>
    <li> I have had a heck of a time toning up for summer this year. I went as far as using a personal trainer. Fully clothed I felt pretty confident with my body image however put me in a swimsuit and I would have just about died. Celluthin has definately helped with the dimply stuff on my derrier. &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to others with my issue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am a skinny person. I only weight 100 lbs, yet I have some cellulite on the back of my thighs. I also have some on my buttocks (when I squeeze them).  I&#x27;ve been using Celluthin for over a month now and I havent noticed any changes.  I am very dissapointed. :(</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. First and foremost: the results I have achieved in my problem areas. The smell is clean and refreshing and it goes on like a light lotion. &lt;br /&gt;I see a big difference in my stomach and thighs. This was my 4th order</li>
    <li> When I am dieting and start to get restless and weak, it is almost always because it has been a few hours since I put on my Celluthin.  I rub it on and the energy (and improved mood and outlook) come right back!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my tummy, hips and butt, and I do see a difference in the texture of my skin.  The dimples have diminished quite a lot. My skin feels silky and smooth now and the minty scent is pleasant. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using celluthin for a few weeks, and I really like it better that fat girl slim by Bliss, which was too greasy.</li>
    <li> The delivery time was very good. The price was good. The product is good but leaves a little residue on top (does not rub in completely).  So far it has not stained or caused any problems, though.  Overall, I rate it very good.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;The product goes on easily and smells really good. I&#x27;ve been applying it according to the instructions and I feel that the area appears to be more toned. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a higher rating but the bottle came damaged. The top doesn&#x27;t allow you to press down on it to dispense the cream.</li>
    <li> For the last few years i have noticed alot of cellulite forming on my abdomin and around my buttocks. Since using this product the cellulite has been reduced to nothing. i now have a toned stomach and buttocks.If you have the same problem i recomend using CELLUTHIN</li>
    <li> I have researched and reviewed loads of great stuff regarding this product. I have seen somewhat diminishing of the cellulite on my backside however but that was only when I was dieting and exercising consistently. Does anyone know if It will work on it&#x27;s own?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to work this great.  &lt;br /&gt;I have started developing cellulite just in the last year. I always have worked out religiously and was very upset to see what I discovered in the mirror just recently...cellulite! As much as I worked out it was just a matter of time before it creeped up on me. &lt;br /&gt;The results of this product are totally awesome. I can barely see the cellulite....you like have to squeeze my thighs to see it. I really didn&#x27;t have THAT much on me in the first place, but enough to make me do something about it immmediately. After all I live in Southern California....cellulite at 25 years old is UNACCEPTABLE in my book!</li>
    <li> At first i was a little hesitant using a product like this but i am very glad i tried it. The results have been spectacular ive noticed my waist line has slimed down alot. The back of my thighs look alot smaller and there are no more nasty wrinkley skin. i love this product and the people who make it !</li>
    <li> I have cellulite on my backside and thighs, granted...I have 2 small children, so that&#x27;s my excuse :) &lt;br /&gt;I some \\&quot;hot moms\\&quot; at the gym that recommended Celluthin so I figured I try it. I definatey see a difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Since using celluthin, my problem area has most definately improved. I didn&#x27;t have very far to go just tightening up on my tummy. I have this little pooch that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of (not that I&#x27;ve really really tried besides like inconsistent situps alone. I&#x27;ve never had a solid \\&quot;six pack\\&quot; or anything near close to one. But that&#x27;s okay I just want a flat toned stomach.</li>
    <li> I am experiencing drastic results with this cream. It is helping me get my body back in shape after having my twin boys. I highly recommend this for ladies having trouble getting toned again.</li>
    <li> Nice minty smell and not greasy at all.  i saw results in 2 days when i used it and then put neoprene shorts on over my thighs.  The cellulite ripples were significantly smoothed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have been usingit everyday for the last month and let me tell you, I see a big diffeence on my fanny. I recommend it to anyone who has the discipline to use this every day RELIGIOUSLY. It does work!</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to work. I am very thin but have a little pooch after having two kids and I could not see a difference after 30 days. I was VERY good about using it two times daily :(</li>
    <li> Well, I was very excited to use this after reading some of the reviews. I thought it was going to be a miracle cream. I was wrong. Some people said that you can feel it working when you put it on. Well, I didnt feel it working at all. I used it for a month and no huge sign of improvement. It may tighten you up a little, but not near enough to really make a difference. So, save your money. Nothing can \\&quot;cure\\&quot; cellulite anyway.</li>
    <li> I first used the product as a stand alone application, and the results were good, then going off of a review that was posted here I began applying it before my spinning (with neoprene slimming belt) and aerobic sessions and the results have been great. It seems to cause me to sweat more in the areas to which I have applied it. My stomach and thighs have become tighter and more toned in only 2 weeks. I have placed 1 order so far and will be ordering again. I gave it four stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> I was highly disappointed in this product.  The ONLY difference I saw was somewhat, and I mean only somewhat smoothing of the skin directly upon applying.  Even this result was temporary.  I would not waste your money on this product.  I will not be buying it again, and I would not recommend it to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> I WOULDNT USE ANYTHING ELSE! It works and I have no more cellulite! That&#x27;s why I keep buying it. Only while I&#x27;m lowering weight still do I need it die to cellulite changes as anyone loses weight. Especially me. So you don&#x27;t need to use long term.</li>
    <li> I have a gross amount of cellulite on my thighs and buttocks. Although I have been applying this cream as recommended, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working or not. I also lost a significant amount of weight which left me with lose skin. I don&#x27;t think anything but plastic surgery will help with that. But as far as the cream is concerned it goes on easily and smells nice. The only area I can see any sort of difference is my buttocks. They look smoother. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with Celluthin. I like the consistency of it and it has a really light, sweet, non-offensive smell to it.  &lt;br /&gt;I see definate results on my thighs and buttocks. I will keep using this.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem getting in great shape on my stomach area. I have always had somewhat of a tummy...never cellulite or anything just a pooch. Since having children I have had a heck of a time getting it back to JUST a pooch. Since I have started using Celluthin I can see that it is starting to appear more toned. This is my 2nd order I&#x27;m placing. &lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use celluthin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for several weeks and even if it was not much what I wanted to lose, I believe there&#x27;s been some fat reduction in the abdominal area, I might use it again. Of course exercising is a must, if you do nothing but using the cream do not expect miracles... you need to burn some fats doing something!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000BYAHGC Celluthin (8oz) #1 Topical Cellulite Reducing Cream with 2% Aminophylline]]After reading all the raves I was so excited to try this product.  Sadly, after 30 days of using it religously and even stepping up my diet and walking program.  I walk 3 miles at least 5 times a week.  I stepped that up to 5 miles 3 times a week 3 miles the other 2 days.  I also, started using the eliptical rider.  And I dieted.  I used this product in the mornings and evenings.  No change what so ever in appearance and in inches.  And I ordered 2 bottles, overly optimisticly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I REALLY wonder about all these positive postings....  I will continue on with the second bottle since I bought it...  But I doubt another months will make a difference. It probably was a waste of $100 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope others have better luck with this product than I&#x27;ve had.  I am 49, 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and weigh 120.  But I do have heavy thighs for my frame - my problem area and have had horrible celulite since I hit puberty.  Arggh!! I guess I will do what I have always done.  Just live with it.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about two weeks now, but I really do notice a difference! It goes on more like a gel and is not sticky, and has a pleasant (although a little strong) minty smell. You can feel it working after you put it on. After the birth of my child, I started accumulating cellulite on my butt and thighs. The area is so much smoother and tighter now. I really recommend this product. I tried Nivea and didn&#x27;t notice any change. On Celluthin&#x27;s website they claim that results last and you don&#x27;t have to keep using the product, but I haven&#x27;t tested that yet. Has anyone else? I will re-post after using it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I see a big improvement on my thighs and buttocks. I was very dimply when I moved here to Florida from NJ. Thank goodness for this product, I am no longer embarassed to be in a swimsuit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks. Started using just a sample packet, then decided to buy. I am thin but still have cellulite on backs of thighs that won&#x27;t go away with exercise- and I work out 45 minutes to 1 hour every day. After 2 weeks I can see a difference in the dimpled skin. When I put it on I can feel the area get a bit warmer. I use it 2 times a day. The only complaints I have is that it keeps me awake at night if I use it too late (the active ingredient was originally used to treat asthma and can have an effect on adrenal function) and it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I switched from using an Avon product to using this product, to see if there was a difference.  There was:  this product made my skin look worse, and was not worth the money.  Also seemed to leave little silicone-like flakes on my skin.  I went back to Avon.</li>
    <li> After only 1 bottle of the Cellumin, I do not see a remarkable change in the firmness of my arms but it does leave my skin feeling smooth and silky.  The unpleasant smell does not linger.</li>
