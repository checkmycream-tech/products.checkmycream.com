      <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s okay, but I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by it.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff....</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>when I found it was glad that it was still able to be gotten just wish we could still get it in the stores</li>
      <li>Great reminds me of my high school days thanks.my wife loves it too.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to see that Amazon was now handling these products, making it easy for me to purchase more when I need it.</li>
      <li>The sense of smell is often thought to be our best long term memory, and I do remember what the original Jade East smelled like,</li>
      <li>When I did a search for it, and was able to order it, I was delighted and he was surprised.  </li>
      <li>Also the smell isn&#x27;t as strong</li>
      <li>so use another kink but desided that they were to strong of a smell so desided to see it if I could l find  jade east on line.</li>
      <li>A fabulous scent that is thankfully still available after all these years.</li>
      <li>Different bottle and color..same great scent..</li>
      <li>I am thankful that Jade East is still available.</li>
      <li>Or is it a cheap counterfeit that they sent me?</li>
      <li>cheap mock up of the original Jade East.</li>
      <li>I use both the aftershave and cologne because I enjoy their unique scents.</li>
      <li>But the latter?I feel they&#x27;re people that came across this cologne truly for the first time and were expecting more from it.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it to give to him for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I want all to know that this cologne DOES NOT smell nothing like the original Jade East by Songo and Swank.</li>
      <li>Save your money, this is not the original scent.  </li>
      <li>Jade East has been my favorite since I first tried it in Guam in 1969.</li>
      <li>This is a great classic smell for men - spicy and masculine - just as I remembered it from my college days!</li>
      <li>Very close to the original scent but too many years to notice any difference.  </li>
      <li>so it triggers some really special memories.</li>
      <li>It made a great gift for my brother who remembers my Dad splashing it on his face when he was small. :)</li>
      <li>Brought back good memories.</li>
      <li>This is not the same Jade East Cologne that I loved.  </li>
      <li>I always loved Jade east back in the day.</li>
      <li>Not unpleasant, just was not what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It was sweet, masculine, and sexy.</li>
      <li>The real Jade East you could apply in morning and still enjoy the scent for hours after.</li>
      <li>This sure seems like the one I used in the sixties as a young Marine.  </li>
      <li>Same great smell as I remember from my college days in the US, early seventies.</li>
      <li>worth trying...</li>
      <li>And yes, they are much closer to the original formula.</li>
      <li>I am happy to say that whatever scent it really is wore off in about a half hour.</li>
      <li>just fine like old days</li>
      <li>but this is the same scent my grand father wore</li>
      <li>Brings back many memories.</li>
      <li>this was a favorite  by the guys back in the 60s</li>
      <li>If you like an inexpensive cologne with a similar fragrance, I suggest trying Brut, which is much more concentrated and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Seems to be exactly as we wanted.</li>
      <li>I plan on ordering more when this bottle runs low.</li>
      <li>Love the memories this cologne brings back for me.</li>
      <li>When I first met my good-looking, soon-to-be husband 43 years ago his cologne was Jade East.  </li>
      <li>The product is excellent, and (for us at least) a romantic remembrance.</li>
      <li>My wife cannot stand those really strong smelling colognes they actually make her want to vomit.</li>
      <li>Jade East forever, alluring fragrance that brought back great memories from times way past, in a younger, more gentle Jamaica.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend jade east very highly</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, he still really enjoys it.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for having this product.</li>
      <li>my whole life and</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>Was a real babe magnet in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>thanks for the memories</li>
      <li>My favorite is still Chaps, but it is no longer made and this is a reasonable (although certainly not identical) substitute.</li>
      <li>I would pay a good dollar for a bottle of the original cologne.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, you can buy some other vintage colognes e.g. Canoe, British Sterling, English Leather, etc.</li>
      <li>Through the reformulation I can&#x27;t stand it now.mostly lemon and anise and a tiny splash of lilac to make it a little familiar but it just reminds me too much of a better version of brut and that&#x27;s it&lt;</li>
      <li>Now that I am a grampa, I hope it has the same effect on my grand daughter in the future.</li>
      <li>It is as I remember in my High School and College days.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cologne for everyone.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended cologne though and</li>
      <li>This is hard to find anymore,, Still popular though</li>
      <li>I sat in a quiet place, opened the bottle and sniffed one fresh scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love the smell of Jade East.  used it back in my college days.  women loved it.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful scent to remember my father and uncles by... this was truly a military man&#x27;s weekend special. Different bottle and color..same great scent..thanks for the memories</li>
    <li> Love this product, not to overpowering.</li>
    <li> Used to use this stuff in the old days. Was a real babe magnet in the 60&#x27;s. Now who cares. Smells a little differently than I recall but hey my eyesight and hearing are going, why not the sense of smell. Anyway, maybe I&#x27;ll go out tonight and hit on a few senior citizens to see if I and Jade East still have it. Then I&#x27;ll have to remember what to do with it.</li>
    <li> To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. The items that I ordered and were pictured, on the order page, were by Songo not Regency. This not the same product I have used for years. To further complicate this issue, there is no return on the deliverd Regency items and the return label had been removed from the delivery package.</li>
    <li> When I first met my good-looking, soon-to-be husband 43 years ago his cologne was Jade East.  The fragrance stayed with him all day and in my dreams all night.  After a few years we couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores so he switched fragrances, but his Jade East lingered on my mind.  When I did a search for it, and was able to order it, I was delighted and he was surprised.  The product is excellent, and (for us at least) a romantic remembrance.</li>
    <li> Give credit to this company for supplying a hard to locate item but it isn&#x27;t working anymore and this will be the last bottle I purchase of Jade East.  Will be looking for cologne that is newer and fresher.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my father for Christmas. He used to wear this when he was younger. He told me the scent is a little off, which I assume means it is not the same formula( as that may have been proprietary blend?). Nevertheless, he still really enjoys it. Said it brings back a nostalgic feeling.</li>
    <li> Save your money, this is not the original scent.  Just got it, smelled it and for a second I detected traces of the orginal then it drifted away to something else. Not unpleasant, just was not what I wanted. Well you,win some and you lose some. At least the delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> Great reminds me of my high school days thanks.my wife loves it too.Glad I found it have been looking for it for years.</li>
    <li> I have used Jade East since I was a teenager (many years ago) but have had trouble finding it in recent years. I was pleased to see that Amazon was now handling these products, making it easy for me to purchase more when I need it.</li>
    <li> I love it. I wear it daily. I didn&#x27;t know until I got it but this is the same scent my grand father wore so it triggers some really special memories. Now that I am a grampa, I hope it has the same effect on my grand daughter in the future. As a mid-mod geek it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Jade East has been my favorite since I first tried it in Guam in 1969. I use both the aftershave and cologne because I enjoy their unique scents. I did note that this advertisement says made by Songo, but the bottles clearly say made by Regency. Do not worry.... either is great with me. I am thankful that Jade East is still available.</li>
    <li> Have been using this since the 60s good product. Would recommend this to everyonel lasts all day and nicely scented .</li>
    <li> Love the product. It is as I remember in my High School and College days. It fits right in to a collection of English Leather, Old Spice, Canoe, and Bay Rhum.</li>
    <li> My wife says this cologne is the BEST.</li>
    <li> My husband has annually asked for Jade East for Christmas--a fragrance he wore in his younger years.  I thought years ago it was sold at drug stores, but I never could find it locally.  I finally checked on Amazon, and there it was!  I surprised him with both the cologne and after shave.  He&#x27;s extremely pleased!</li>
    <li> Used this back in the 60s. It dosen&#x27;t seem to smell quite the same as I remember. Also the smell isn&#x27;t as strong</li>
    <li> I always loved Jade east back in the day. It&#x27;s a light, summery fragrance that is perfect in hot weather...I&#x27;m a woman and I love it.</li>
    <li> Good seller, quality product.  have been giving this as a gift for 47 years and will continue as long as they sell it.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I used it when I was in the Navy about 44 years ago and it just the same now as it was then. I plan on ordering more when this bottle runs low.</li>
    <li> Same great smell as I remember from my college days in the US, early seventies.</li>
    <li> I normally buy the Cologne from the round bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has a different scent.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the round bottle become available again.</li>
    <li> As a teenager I used Jade East Cologne exclusively and loved it.  Then it disappeared, until this product re-emerged. This is not the same Jade East Cologne that I loved.  It is mostly alcohol and the fragrance is very weak and does not last long. If you like an inexpensive cologne with a similar fragrance, I suggest trying Brut, which is much more concentrated and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles of Jade East cologne from Songo so that I could share the memories of my oldest brother who passed away a few weeks ago, with my surviving siblings. The package was a day late, but still came in time to dispense it in the sample cologne spray containers to give out at his memorial service. My brother wore this fragrance in the late 60s and early 70s. It was a smell we would never forget because it smelt so great. The Jade East I just received is the exact same smell as I remember back then. Everyone really enjoyed their gifts. They can now remember our oldest brother just by the smell of Jade East and the memories we have in our hearts. Thanks Amazon for having this product. And thanks to Regency Cosmetics for continually producing this great smelling cologne that I am now wearing.</li>
    <li> I use to use jade east back n the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s then could not find it in the stores anymore so use another kink but desided that they were to strong of a smell so desided to see it if I could l find  jade east on line. when I found it was glad that it was still able to be gotten just wish we could still get it in the stores and I would recommend jade east very highly</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;is not&amp;#34; the Jade East that I bought a few as three years ago. The bottle is totally different that the bottle pictured on the Amazon website and the fragrance has a sour smell to it. I regret, I repeat, I REGRET buying this from Amazon and will post my displeasure at other Review Sites. The policy of NOT RETURNABLE for perfumes and colognes because they are a &amp;#34;Hazardess&amp;#34; [product is absolutely stupid. They can send me &amp;#34;hazzardess &amp;#34; liquids but I cannot send them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy colognes/perfumes from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I have used this off and on since the 60‘s. Brings back many memories.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; has only the slightest hint of the original, and overall, it literally stinks, does not have a nice odor at all, just an odor.  The sense of smell is often thought to be our best long term memory, and I do remember what the original Jade East smelled like, It was sweet, masculine, and sexy. This smells like it&#x27;s generic name tends to bring to mind \\&quot;toilet water\\&quot;, as if it was dipped out of one.  AND, it stinks in more ways that one.  The estimated delivery date was Wednesday the 18th, I waited till Saturday, the 21st to take care of returning it, and Amazon had it listed as return window closed on the 20th, only 2 days after the estimated delivery date, True, it did show up a couple days before the 18th, but \\&quot;give me a break\\&quot;, I can&#x27;t even make it to the weekend to set up a return?  I purchased both the after shave and cologne, hoping at least one of them would have the correct aroma, they both smell exactly alike, both bad, neither what I expected and neither worth sell at all well for a buck in a dollar store.</li>
    <li> this was a favorite  by the guys back in the 60s and it still smells better than the ones out today</li>
    <li> Not what we thought it was.</li>
    <li> Same ole Jade East....Love the stuff....Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my dad.  He was very pleased to receive this as a gift.  He has used this product for many years.</li>
    <li> Very close to the original scent but too many years to notice any difference.  Seems to be exactly as we wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Jade East. My wife cannot stand those really strong smelling colognes they actually make her want to vomit. The Jade East is mild yet makes me smell good, but not overpowering like many others today. I highly recommend this cologne for everyone.</li>
    <li> Bought as a chotchkie.. reminder of my Dad, PERFECT!</li>
    <li> Watered down import that is little akin to the bit of original Jade East I have from 1969.</li>
    <li> I just wish they still used the bottle they did in 1965.</li>
    <li> Old school.  I&#x27;m old school so I like this cologne.  I&#x27;ll buy more when I run out.  Don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> Not the least bit like the original Jade East---just a cheap, watered-down imitation. It&#x27;s weak, doesn&#x27;t smell that great and doesn&#x27;t last at all. My husband wears it and you can&#x27;t even tell. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;ve ever had the real thing.</li>
    <li> Not sure it is exact formula from the 60&#x27;s but close enough. Arrived on time as advertised. Completely satifactory</li>
    <li> Brought back good memories.</li>
    <li> just fine like old days</li>
    <li> Received the Jade East 4 ounce splash on. I sat in a quiet place, opened the bottle and sniffed one fresh scent. I am in my m 60&#x27;s and do not expect a cologne that I wore 45 years ago to smell the same to me today as I remembered then. Given that, there is enough of a scent from this product to remind me of that scent  in the 1960&#x27;s. As i get older, I cherish the memories of things that I had and did in the past. I give the product 5 stars as well as the vendor. The price is excellent, shipping time was excellent and well worth the walk for me down memory lane.</li>
    <li> OMG this crap is awful. I trouble washing it off my hand. It has a sour smell in it that is no where near real Jade East. Save your money. I threw this mess into the trash one minute after opening the bottle. It was utterly unusable. What gives? Did the change the formula to save money? Or is it a cheap counterfeit that they sent me? I used to wear:-)nothing but Jade East in the 60&#x27;s and baby tis ain&#x27;t Jade East.</li>
    <li> Love the memories this cologne brings back for me. It made a great gift for my brother who remembers my Dad splashing it on his face when he was small. :)</li>
    <li> A fabulous scent that is thankfully still available after all these years.</li>
    <li> A total rip off even in how it is advertised. Description says by Songo/Swank. That was the originial manufacturer and there is no comparison between the dark (sea water) color of the original and its strengthand what Regency is selling. It is very weak, even the color is a light yellowish green. I believe that they are betting on customers nostalgia in smelling something faintly familiar when they open the bottle - but don&#x27;t be fooled it is only feintly the cologne. I would pay a good dollar for a bottle of the original cologne.&lt;br /&gt;FYI, you can buy some other vintage colognes e.g. Canoe, British Sterling, English Leather, etc. at of all places Sears. And yes, they are much closer to the original formula.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product in antipation of bringing back memories of long ago. Upon opening of the bottle, I reccognized the scent I used as a teenager for about five seconds. The familiar scent faded quickly and was replaced with something indescribably awful. This is a poor imitation of the original Jade East Cologne and I suggest that no one waste their money on it. I am happy to say that whatever scent it really is wore off in about a half hour. Just to be sure, I took a quick shower to get this disgusting stuff off of me. I would be embarrassed to leave my house while wearing it. It&#x27;s that bad!</li>
    <li> I want all to know that this cologne DOES NOT smell nothing like the original Jade East by Songo and Swank. It is mostly alcohol and some kind of awful scent that comes nowhere near what old school Jade East smelled like. I have worn Jade East my whole life and this is stuff is not Jade East, no matter what they try to fool people into believing. The real Jade East you could apply in morning and still enjoy the scent for hours after.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s produced by a different company now but seems to have the same formula.  It was for my son on a pleasure cruise.  He loves dancing.  Jade East puts the fun back in dancing...</li>
    <li> Hard to find item .He loves it !!!</li>
    <li> My husband used this cologne when we were dating, over 40 years ago, loved it then, still love it</li>
    <li> I was amazed to see that I actually recognized the smell after the 40 years since high school when I last smelled it. When I first put it on I thought that either I didn&#x27;t recall the smell or that it had changed, but after a few minutes it settled into the exact scent I recall. It is inexpensive and the scent lasts for hours so I consider it a very good deal. My favorite is still Chaps, but it is no longer made and this is a reasonable (although certainly not identical) substitute.</li>
    <li> ...but my bottle of Jade East is great! It reminds me of colognes from the 60&#x27;s. Very nice stuff esp. for baby boomers and for fans of the 1960&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few bottles of Jade East under it&#x27;s second hand of ownership known as Songo.Around very late 90&#x27;s it was acquired by Regency and aside from the bottle shape being a square and fluid changing from green to yellow the scent never changed until a few years ago along with artwork change.Jade East had a barbershop and spicy quality to it-lilac,talc,lime,and anise.Not the finest cologne ever made but as an inexpensive cologne I liked it alot.Through the reformulation I can&#x27;t stand it now.mostly lemon and anise and a tiny splash of lilac to make it a little familiar but it just reminds me too much of a better version of brut and that&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;A cheap mock up of the original Jade East.People new to this scent may like it but the old formula is a different and better world.viewers missing the presentation nostalgia of this cologne and sadly it has changed.But the latter?I feel they&#x27;re people that came across this cologne truly for the first time and were expecting more from it.Alot of younger people today used to the modern/evolving scents of today can&#x27;t grasp that the classics weren&#x27;t dimensional smelling colognes.    Conclusion:  There is one last detail about Regency&#x27;s change that I did like and that was the smaller white plastic opening on the splash spicket.It&#x27;s easier to shake the controlled amount of cologne in your hand without spilling everywhere.No more cupping your hand securely over the spicket and turning the bottle up and down several times.Highly recommended cologne though and worth trying...5-stars!</li>
    <li> This sure seems like the one I used in the sixties as a young Marine.  The ladies in Asia fell head over heels over it as does my lovely wife of 43 years.  While I can&#x27;t say that the ladies will react the same, who can tell.</li>
    <li> This is a great classic smell for men - spicy and masculine - just as I remembered it from my college days!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; who said he used it &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34; and said he couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I was so excited to find it to give to him for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is hard to find anymore,, Still popular though</li>
    <li> I took a trip down memory lane when I ordered this.  Either my memory is off, or this formula is.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as I remember.  It&#x27;s okay.  The other problem is the scent wears off fast.  Like I said, it&#x27;s okay, but I wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by it.</li>
    <li> Jade East forever, alluring fragrance that brought back great memories from times way past, in a younger, more gentle Jamaica.</li>
    <li> Came as described but I wish it was a spray bottle. Other than that...I like the cologne. I&#x27;ll be buying others I&#x27;m sure..Thanks</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and when I was a 16 year old boy cruising in my 65 Falcon Futura with the flipper hubcaps and split manifold on my 6 cylinder ride in Muscle Shoals,Alabama. This Cologne was the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; all the rage of the young people then. I saw this on Amazon and could not order it fast enough so I could relive in memory those days again.</li>
