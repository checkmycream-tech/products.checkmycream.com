      <li>I am satisfied and recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Lately, most of it&#x27;s \\&quot;shaving\\</li>
      <li>, I have had this raxor for many years.</li>
      <li>if you have a razor that has two connection divisions on each drive, this should be OK.</li>
      <li>&quot; was more of a \\&quot;yank it out by the roots\\&quot; type of thing.</li>
      <li>am now pleased that these heads are now available again.</li>
      <li>A great product with a LOW retail price.  </li>
      <li>The ad stated that the shaver heads fit Norelco shavers, but it did not.  </li>
      <li>My shaver is a genuine Norelco and these blades are supposed to fit it</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s to review, I ordered a set of shaver heads for an razor, they fit, they work what else needs to be said.</li>
      <li>These were supposed to fit my norelco shaver but didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Was not disappointed at all.</li>
      <li>I bought them to replace the original shaver heads.</li>
      <li>This is my own fault for not asking - I assumed these were more universal.</li>
      <li>Makes his old favorite as good as new.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find the heads, and the price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Quality overall looks good, so</li>
      <li>Great price on these replacement heads, to make your old Norelco work like new.  </li>
      <li>So easy to replace, and so inexpensive compared to buying the whole head!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because they arrived quickly, neatly packed, and look like quality pieces.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the picture to notice the difference, so definitely my own</li>
      <li>And the New shave, I get with the new Blades is amazing.</li>
      <li>These blades appear to be pretty good quality but the center hole is different than what is on my shaver and they just don&#x27;t fit and can&#x27;t be modified to make them fit.</li>
      <li>Yup just what I needed to bring back my 30 year old razor to almost new, the shave is great for what it cost in getting this fix.</li>
      <li>The heads were exactly as stated.</li>
      <li>Exact replacement fit right in getting a closer shave than when new I would highly recommend this to anyone</li>
      <li>It was very easy to replace the old ones (which were visibly corroded) and took perhaps 5 minutes total.</li>
      <li>So much cheaper than the brand name ones.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks to replacement shaver heads like these.</li>
      <li>everything about this order was very good\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice to have a sharp shaver for just a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Beats buying the whole piece for more than 3 times the price.</li>
      <li>This costs only a fraction of the original factory (OEM) product.  </li>
      <li>Shaves and cuts just like new!</li>
      <li>Particularly obnoxious on the neck.</li>
      <li>Maybe the motor will hold out another few years, which will be good enough.</li>
      <li>Shaves like new again.</li>
      <li>So I would have new replacements.</li>
      <li>The new heads seem to be lower quality than the originals -</li>
      <li>So I was going to get a new Norelco.</li>
      <li>Took the new Nerelco &amp; pitched it.</li>
      <li>cheaper then buying a new one.</li>
      <li>but these will make it like new again.</li>
      <li>I have never replaced the heads, nor done more for cleaning than to blow a lung full of stale air at the interior of the heads on occasion.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it necessary to have to buy the complete head which costs too much money.  </li>
      <li>My old Norelco was purchased at a PX in Stuttgart, Germany about 45 years ago.</li>
      <li>The blades are what you need , not the complete head</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I received this product.  </li>
      <li>I use the razor every day and the shaver is 27+ years old.  </li>
      <li>Looked on Amazon, found replacement blades for the old nit (after looking at a bunch of stores without luck).</li>
      <li>Rotary blades in my old Nelreco finally crapped out &amp; I couldn&#x27;t find new blades.</li>
      <li>They should make it clear that not ALL Norelco shavers use the same heads.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought I would give this a try, as I was looking for a replacement blade set for my Norelco shaver.  These units have a seat for the drive element from the shaver that has two divisions, and the HQ56 uses elements with three divisions.  So they don&#x27;t work.  However, that was my error (or choice to try and see if they would), so I don&#x27;t fault the seller.  Quality overall looks good, so if you have a razor that has two connection divisions on each drive, this should be OK.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco was purchased at a PX in Stuttgart, Germany about 45 years ago. I have never replaced the heads, nor done more for cleaning than to blow a lung full of stale air at the interior of the heads on occasion. Lately, most of it&#x27;s \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; was more of a \\&quot;yank it out by the roots\\&quot; type of thing. Particularly obnoxious on the neck. So I was going to get a new Norelco. Sticker shock. Then found these heads. It was very easy to replace the old ones (which were visibly corroded) and took perhaps 5 minutes total. The \\&quot;new\\&quot; shave is 100% better. Maybe the motor will hold out another few years, which will be good enough. The new heads seem to be lower quality than the originals - but, then again - they don&#x27;t have to last nearly as long.</li>
    <li> This is my own fault for not asking - I assumed these were more universal. The shaver heads I needed have three holes for the drivers to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34;. These only had two, so sadly they would not work. I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention to the picture to notice the difference, so definitely my own hiccup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it three stars because they arrived quickly, neatly packed, and look like quality pieces.</li>
    <li> My Norelco electric razor just keeps on &#x27;ticking&#x27;... thanks to replacement shaver heads like these. I hope to wear out several sets of these.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the quick and easy transaction!!  I thought that I would have to get rid of my brother&#x27;s shaver....but these will make it like new again.</li>
    <li> These were exactly as described, a perfect replacement for my 20-uear-old Norelco speedshaver. Shaves like new again. 5 minutes to replace the heads.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find the heads, and the price was reasonable. You have to be careful when ordering, not all models interchange, even though they look alike.</li>
    <li> The heads did not fit. The plastic inserts were two pronged and my shaver has 3. The heads will not turn. But it is too expensive to send back. TY John</li>
    <li> These blades appear to be pretty good quality but the center hole is different than what is on my shaver and they just don&#x27;t fit and can&#x27;t be modified to make them fit. My shaver is a genuine Norelco and these blades are supposed to fit it but they don&#x27;t. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item fits the shaver as described. My only disappointment was the trouble I had installing them once the original assembly fell apart, but I finally got it together.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these heads from this company sone time ago and found them equal to the quality of the Norelco heads.&lt;br /&gt;I am now pleased that these heads are now available again.</li>
    <li> Not what I order. Did not work on the shaver I have.</li>
    <li> Second time buying blades on-line.  They hold up well.  I use the razor every day and the shaver is 27+ years old.  I can&#x27;t find the blades locally.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a sharp shaver for just a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Beats buying the whole piece for more than 3 times the price.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. My husband said the razor dragged.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t have them in correctly.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Worked well!</li>
    <li> not REQUIRED! 18 WORG MINIMUM---YOU MUST BE NUTS  YOU WILL NOT PLACE MINIMUMS ON MY COMMENTZ!  THIS IZ bs will be rememered aqs such.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. Makes his old favorite as good as new. Great product. I was happy when I found These.</li>
    <li> Item fir perfectly into my old razor and works well.  Very easy to change out. cheaper then buying a new one.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to review, I ordered a set of shaver heads for an razor, they fit, they work what else needs to be said.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement fit right in getting a closer shave than when new I would highly recommend this to anyone, I have had this raxor for many years. also have the cordless however not quite the shave it states</li>
    <li> This is how they should sell these replacements.  I don&#x27;t think it necessary to have to buy the complete head which costs too much money.  The blades are what you need , not the complete head</li>
    <li> The reason I bought these, I needed replacement Blades for the the Norelco 105DB. Was not disappointed at all. They are a perfect fit. And the New shave, I get with the new Blades is amazing. Just on the chance that these would work, I bought 6 Blades. So I would have new replacements.</li>
    <li> The ad stated that the shaver heads fit Norelco shavers, but it did not.  They should make it clear that not ALL Norelco shavers use the same heads.  I took quite awhile for the product to be shipped.  At least the seller accepted the return.</li>
    <li> Rotary blades in my old Nelreco finally crapped out &amp; I couldn&#x27;t find new blades. Bought a new Nerelco &amp; was not happy with its performance. Looked on Amazon, found replacement blades for the old nit (after looking at a bunch of stores without luck). Took the new Nerelco &amp; pitched it. Happy shaver now.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received this product.  It worked perfectly.  I was able to easily replace my shaver heads and got a good shave.  will definitely purchase this product again when my current heads wear out.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads were exactly like the original ones,  they fit perfectly, and were shipped promptly. I would purchase this product again, great price!</li>
    <li> I did not know that the heads I ordered would not fit my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;my fault , need to have the correct ones</li>
    <li> The heads were exactly as stated. My husband put them in his shaver and they worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so everything about this order was very good\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> A great product with a LOW retail price.  This costs only a fraction of the original factory (OEM) product.  There&#x27;s no need to spend extra money purchasing the factory item.  Shaves and cuts just like new!</li>
    <li> Great price on these replacement heads, to make your old Norelco work like new.  So much cheaper than the brand name ones. Work great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! So easy to replace, and so inexpensive compared to buying the whole head! And the company is outstanding also&lt;br /&gt; Would by from them EVERYtime!</li>
    <li> These were supposed to fit my norelco shaver but didn&#x27;t. I tried to save money by buying off brand but just threw away money.</li>
    <li> I bought them to replace the original shaver heads. They fitted the Philips shaver and have met my expectation. I am satisfied and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Yup just what I needed to bring back my 30 year old razor to almost new, the shave is great for what it cost in getting this fix.</li>
