### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is excellent for a deodorant soap.</li>
      <li>Perfect gift.</li>
      <li>I bought this produce because I heard it smelled wonderful, and it did.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is a great product, but I gave it 4 stars because it is over priced.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT HAS A PLEASANT FRAGRANCE BUT IS NOT</li>
      <li>Great product, really enjoying it on my vacation.</li>
      <li>GOOD, WISH I HAD MORE</li>
      <li>Gets the wife nice and close.  </li>
      <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>and I totally love using it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the feel.  </li>
      <li>What more can I say about Bvlgari that it doesn&#x27;t already say for itself.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.</li>
      <li>I ordered two more just to be sure we don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
      <li>and we both love it.  </li>
      <li>shower gel was good,  however; when the gel is used to 3/4 of the bottle, it is very dificult to reach the rest of it.</li>
      <li>A very distinctive, floral aroma (make sure you know you already like it!).</li>
      <li>Nice, not as strong as the other, good tobacco tones.  </li>
      <li>This stuff smells fantastic.  </li>
      <li>wow, the scent is soooo sexy!  </li>
      <li>Pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
      <li>For the price that I paid I should have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I rarely buy it because of the price and use it sparingly.</li>
      <li>The only way to get out the remaining amount is to drive a pin (or a nail) through the top of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Extra shampoo solution***&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Anyway this product totally gets rid of my hair oil for the full day</li>
      <li>/&gt;Three months later I have refilled my order for this fine product and Amazon is STILL SHIPPING OLD PRODUCT from their warehouse!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just received my second order of this fine product in August of 2013, but in the old brown packaging.</li>
      <li>the way, when this product gets near the bottom of the bottle, there is a significant amount that will not come out due to a tall lip on the inside of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Difficult to get a good lather.  </li>
      <li>However, I purchased two bottles, one was fine, but the other one was totally cracked in the sealed package.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I should stop complaining, because maybe the formula is different in the new packaging.</li>
      <li>it is now February 5, 2014, and I guess I must be the only person who buys this product from Amazon, or else Amazon bought the entire 2012 Bulgari inventory because AMAZON IS STILL SELLING THE OLD PRODUCT IN THE OLD PACKAGING!!</li>
      <li>I know you get what you pay for, but you really have to use this product carefully</li>

<li> too late then, so money down the drain and a little damage to the dresser.</li>
<li> I try not to sweat the small stuff.</li>
<li> I usually use Bulgari Pour Hommes Aqva but this was all they had</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t know this until at least a week after my purchase when I realized the expensive shower gel had leaked through the sealed box onto my son&#x27;s wooden dresser.  </li>
<li> Not good for the dresser, and a waste of money for me.  </li>
<li> It is too bad it is so expensive.  </li>
<li> Expensive!</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> Love the smell and the feel.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Check Bulgari&#x27;s website and you will see the current packaging. I just received my second order of this fine product in August of 2013, but in the old brown packaging. I posted a picture of the out of date brown packaging, and I wonder how long my product has been sitting on a shelf in Amazon&#x27;s warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a great product, but I gave it 4 stars because it is over priced. I know you get what you pay for, but you really have to use this product carefully and sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***November 21 2013****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later I have refilled my order for this fine product and Amazon is STILL SHIPPING OLD PRODUCT from their warehouse!&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when this product gets near the bottom of the bottle, there is a significant amount that will not come out due to a tall lip on the inside of the bottle. The only way to get out the remaining amount is to drive a pin (or a nail) through the top of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Extra shampoo solution***&lt;br /&gt;The middle lid pops off which helps you get some the last ounces of the product out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***February 5, 2014***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is now February 5, 2014, and I guess I must be the only person who buys this product from Amazon, or else Amazon bought the entire 2012 Bulgari inventory because AMAZON IS STILL SELLING THE OLD PRODUCT IN THE OLD PACKAGING!! Maybe I should stop complaining, because maybe the formula is different in the new packaging. Who knows? Anyway this product totally gets rid of my hair oil for the full day and I totally love using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Would definitely purchase this item over and over. When you shower with this product, you don&#x27;t need to even use cologne.</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; smell.  Gets the wife nice and close.  Will get the cologne as well.  Need to try other scents.</li>
    <li> Great product, really enjoying it on my vacation. Perfect gift.</li>
    <li> This is a reorder for me.  I bought one for my husband and we both love it.  I ordered two more just to be sure we don&#x27;t run out.  Pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> years ago I bought Bulgari cologne for a Christmas gift. When I saw this product for sale, I bought it to go with the cologne. It&#x27;s a winner! Love the scent.</li>
    <li> wow, the scent is soooo sexy!  It is excellent for a deodorant soap.</li>
    <li> GOOD, WISH I HAD MORE</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic.  The scent stays with you for quite awhile.  It is too bad it is so expensive.  I rarely buy it because of the price and use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS A PLEASANT FRAGRANCE BUT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED.  I WILL USE IT BUT WON&#x27;T BUY AGAIN.  I STILL PREFER OBSESSION.</li>
    <li> but I assume this is close ... I had to burn the wash cloth and scrub down the shower to remove the ... &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> What more can I say about Bvlgari that it doesn&#x27;t already say for itself. I don&#x27;t thik I&#x27;ve ever found anything that&#x27;s quite like it. Keep making it and I will surley keep trying to use it. Everybody should smell this way. Thank you. Joe Wilson</li>
    <li> shower gel was good,  however; when the gel is used to 3/4 of the bottle, it is very dificult to reach the rest of it. Had to throw it away. That was a lost of shower gel.)0: For the price that I paid I should have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> My husband smells like Ranger.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/body gel replaces somewhat different versions of separate products (it also comes in a sleeker, darker plastic dispenser). A very distinctive, floral aroma (make sure you know you already like it!). Expensive!</li>
    <li> Has no lingering smell on body or hair. Difficult to get a good lather.  Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I usually use Bulgari Pour Hommes Aqva but this was all they had so I tried it.  Nice, not as strong as the other, good tobacco tones.  Like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I bought this produce because I heard it smelled wonderful, and it did.  However, I purchased two bottles, one was fine, but the other one was totally cracked in the sealed package.  I didn&#x27;t know this until at least a week after my purchase when I realized the expensive shower gel had leaked through the sealed box onto my son&#x27;s wooden dresser.  Not good for the dresser, and a waste of money for me.  I didn&#x27;t return it... just opened the box to look at the contents and threw it away.  I didn&#x27;t think about returning it until after I threw it away...too late then, so money down the drain and a little damage to the dresser. I try not to sweat the small stuff.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
