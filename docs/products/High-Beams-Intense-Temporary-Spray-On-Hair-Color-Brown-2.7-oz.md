<li> Would give four stars if it tasted better and weighed a little less.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also on the heavy side, and if your hands have a water-based lubricant all over them, this is heavy enough to slip through drop right on your toes.  </li>
<li> Gross, dry, and</li>
<li> This is only a minor criticism because you have to get extremely close to even notice this...most people aren&#x27;t even going to see it.</li>
<li> It was just dry and sticky in my hair.</li>
<li> My hair felt like straw, it was very dry and crunchy not soft at all.</li>
<li> It never really dries.</li>
<li> Comes off on your fingers or other people&#x27;s shirts when you hug them.</li>
<li> It might work for other people but didn&#x27;t work on my dark brown hair.</li>
<li> My hair is dark brown and this color did not match at all.  </li>
<li> Down side is it does rub off.  </li>
<li> the #31 Brown is a bit dark!</li>
<li> Did the job, even covering my son&#x27;s very dark hair to make it look brown.</li>
<li> Very dark brown that smears to all over your face .</li>
<li> The only negative is that it is dull...</li>
<li> Washes of and out with plain water.  </li>
<li> Not easy to use to get in the part area without getting a wider area</li>
<li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t exactly taste BAD, but takes some getting used to.  </li>
<li> This product is sticky and heavy to the hair!</li>
<li> This product was also very messy, even after it was sprayed the color would run if you touched it.</li>
<li> I ended up throwing it out since it was going to be too messy to use for any sort of serious cosplay.</li>
<li> Hair felt gritty and dirty</li>
<li> The color looks fake and does not match my hair.  </li>
<li> The product was very disappointing to me.</li>
<li> I was planning to change my hair color, but the result was simply awful!</li>

    <li> Ah never thought it would work on her hair but it did and it did cover all the grays until she got to the beauty parlor.</li>
    <li> It never really dries. Comes off on your fingers or other people&#x27;s shirts when you hug them.</li>
    <li> Works nicely on mustache.  Only giving three stars because of taste and weight.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t exactly taste BAD, but takes some getting used to.  Also color washes off mustache in soup, so keep that in mind.  It&#x27;s also on the heavy side, and if your hands have a water-based lubricant all over them, this is heavy enough to slip through drop right on your toes.  Honestly it was not the best experience, needing to touch up the &#x27;stache in the middle of dinner and then dropping this thing right on my toe in the process.  Perhaps they could add a handle or grip to the side of the can? Would give four stars if it tasted better and weighed a little less.</li>
    <li> This spray does work, but warning - it comes off very easily on your clothes and on towels. I ended up throwing it out since it was going to be too messy to use for any sort of serious cosplay.</li>
    <li> My hair is dark brown and this color did not match at all.  It  came out looking like it was red.  I had to wash it out.  It might work for other people but didn&#x27;t work on my dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> This product was okay the color came out as expected however, I did not like how it made my hair feel. My hair felt like straw, it was very dry and crunchy not soft at all. This product was also very messy, even after it was sprayed the color would run if you touched it. Also I am someone with a lot of hair, I used the whole bottle so if your looking for multiple uses and have a lot of hair you might want to get more then one. Over all it was fun to use but I probably won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how quick it covered my gray roots.</li>
    <li> Very dark brown that smears to all over your face . Any time you touch your hair, your hand turns brown. More liquid consistency than spray.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use to get in the part area without getting a wider area</li>
    <li> This product is great and easy to clean up!  Washes of and out with plain water.  Just one thing ...  the #31 Brown is a bit dark!</li>
    <li> Excellent temporary coverage!! Perfect for those days when you cannot be bothered to dye your greys!</li>
    <li> The product was very disappointing to me. I was planning to change my hair color, but the result was simply awful!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on darker colored hair yet, but works perfectly on blonde! Totally covered my previous hair color and washed right out with no hassle or lingering color after a good shampooing.</li>
    <li> Very good temporary color.</li>
    <li> Works great in between coloring.</li>
    <li> Did the job, even covering my son&#x27;s very dark hair to make it look brown.</li>
    <li> It matches my hair very good, you can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s spray or not.  If you have stubborn grey hair that&#x27;s hard to dye,  this product will work great.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I use it all the time</li>
    <li> I used this to cover my wildly colored streaks for a professional meeting with people who know me well. With a bit of practice, and a good brush, no one was the wiser!  Great product.</li>
    <li> This washed out same night after trickortreating was complete ~ PERFECT for a child !</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for the product. However, it might be good for other customers. Hope its good for them.</li>
    <li> This product works really well! I&#x27;ve used it on my part to cover my gray outgrowth for a week or so before I get my hair colored. It helps to extend the time between root touch-ups. The only negative is that it is dull...no sparkle. This is only a minor criticism because you have to get extremely close to even notice this...most people aren&#x27;t even going to see it. The important thing is that IT COVERS THE GRAY</li>
    <li> Gross, dry, and the color was lighten than shown. Thought it would be a cute temporary color. It was just dry and sticky in my hair. I would not purchase this stuff again.</li>
    <li> The color looks fake and does not match my hair.  Also it does not stay on AT ALL</li>
    <li> Covers hairline. Be sure to rub it in after spraying it in your hair. Did leave brown on my hands. Didn&#x27;t not rub off on my white pillow. Hair felt gritty and dirty but I liked the texture for body.</li>
    <li> covered my bald spot.  I had no trouble applying.  Down side is it does rub off.  I would have preferred that it didn&#x27;t come off so easily.</li>
    <li> Used Chromotone before. This product is sticky and heavy to the hair! Will not purchase this again and will buy the more expensive item.</li>
