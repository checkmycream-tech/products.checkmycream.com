      <li>I think this nail polish isn&#x27;t made to last to much in your nails, but as it dries very quick, it doesn&#x27;t matter that you take it of at the third day and re-apply it again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s similar to OPI&#x27;s Pompeii Purple (maybe a tad more purple), and compliments just about any skin tone (including my super pale skin).</li>
      <li>These insta-dri really do dry quickly and last pretty well.</li>
      <li>bad because it has a nice brush which applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>yes it did dry fast but chipped within 2 days.  </li>
      <li>So the fact that it dried quickly didn&#x27;t matter since I have to paint them all again!&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>

<li> The brush is larger than your standard nail polish brush, so you have to be extra careful when painting your nails, but the quick dry is extremely convenient for those of us who have a bad habit of getting distracted while our nails are drying and accidentally messing up a new paint job.</li>
<li> but I do use a sticky base coat and clear top coat.</li>
<li> I use a coat of the crinkly black Instadri polish so that its harder to tell its not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> do mean after like 2  hours its chipping not good</li>
<li> I have to use a lot or its so thin</li>
<li> Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m doing wrong, but even the base coat is good quality base (Opi Base Coat).</li>
<li> Hard to muss up!!</li>

    <li> These insta-dri really do dry quickly and last pretty well. The best part...if it doesn&#x27;t last, it&#x27;s easy and quick to repair! Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand I&#x27;ll use when it comes to my pedicure</li>
    <li> great color my favorite.</li>
    <li> Perfect for emergencies when you don&#x27;t have enough time to do your nails because you&#x27;re going out and in a hurry.</li>

    <li> This product amazes me. It makes it possible to get my nails painted before the kids need me. Also great for painting squirmy little baby toes that don&#x27;t hold still. BUT, the coats aren&#x27;t great. I have to use a lot or its so thin you can see ghrough it spots. The. Is looks gloopy by my cuticle. My solution? I use a coat of the crinkly black Instadri polish so that its harder to tell its not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;Would I pick this over everything else? No, but it helps me from having only one hand painted and helps with painting kiddo toes.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Sure would, I have a bunch of colors!</li>
    <li> Great color that lasted and dried quickly. It&#x27;s similar to OPI&#x27;s Pompeii Purple (maybe a tad more purple), and compliments just about any skin tone (including my super pale skin). Highly recommended!</li>

    <li> Love the color and price!</li>
    <li> bought it for my sister too I loved it so much. Unbeatable color, stays on well but I do use a sticky base coat and clear top coat. Color is good in one coat.... solid and irridecent with two. Great product and wear for the price.</li>
    <li> nice and fluid easy to apply. love the color, bright same as sample in the ad, the quality is good. it does not need cover nail polish for a shinier look.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t impressed with the long-lasting quality.  yes it did dry fast but chipped within 2 days.  Would probably not get again.  color was pretty.</li>
