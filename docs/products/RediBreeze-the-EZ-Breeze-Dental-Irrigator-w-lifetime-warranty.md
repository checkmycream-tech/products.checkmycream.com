<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product.  It is much easier to use than my old Waterpik.  My husband installed it&lt;br /&gt;and there have been no problems.  Service from the vendor was fast and the product&lt;br /&gt;was delivered in tact.</li>
    <li> I was turned off by the bulk and inconvenience of yet another appliance on my sink and stumbled upon this gem while browsing Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adapter fits most sinks and if your faucet is the rare awkward fit adapters can be found at your hardware store for next to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that it&#x27;s powered by your faucet, you can precisely control the temperature and pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A personal bad habit of mine that I overcame after two messy cases was forgetting the valve was still on as I had turned off the water by closing the faucet only. When I put away the nozzle and turned on the faucet to rinse my toothbrush the water jet right up and splashed all over the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality and fit are excellent and I&#x27;ve had no leaks whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution: Make VERY sure no one is using the water in the house lest you end up with a blast of scalding water in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, waterpiks don&#x27;t replace flossing; flossing and flossing only gets under the gumline. Waterpiks are great at removing the debris and particles flossing pulled out in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and excellent value.</li>
    <li> it works great and easy to install. you just have to get used to controlling the tip unless your bathroom will be sprayed all over.</li>
    <li> I thought this product would really help me stick to a good oral regime that included daily &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a wireless Waterpik but returned it when I found out that the water reservoir needed to be changed in the middle of using it to do your whole mouth causing me to do a rush job and wasting time fumbling with the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then got the standard Waterpik, which worked great...but it was loud, required an electric plug, refilling daily, regularly cleaning, and if you still had water left from earlier, it was ice cold so couldn&#x27;t be used anyways. When I moved into a smaller bathroom, I stopped using it as there was no room for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes RediBreeze, the seeming answer to my prayers: no electricity, temperature and water pressure changing on the fly, always there and ready to remind you to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was a breeze and there was no issue with the standard fitting or any need of tools. I will say that the hose is much longer than shown in the picture, I had to wrap it around the faucet twice to stow it away. Also the tips are much larger than I anticipated...about the size of a finger. Much larger than Waterpik tips for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started experimenting with water pressure, adjusting the lever, adjusting the faucet knob...but I didn&#x27;t seem able to get anything more than a low pressure steady stream and when I adjusted it higher the stream started to spread out. Think of someone putting their thumb over the tip of a garden hose...that&#x27;s what was happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a go on a lower setting and usually my gums bleed if it&#x27;s been a while since flossing and I haven&#x27;t adjusted to gum stimulation, but this did not happen, nor did I feel any sensation of the water getting deep between my gums as I do with the Waterpik. I know the Waterpik features pulsation and this unit doesn&#x27;t but the difference was jarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then cranked up the pressure almost all the way and stillnever felt like it was finding those spaces and pockets, however I did get giant mouthfuls of water, almost gagging, and ticking the front of my mouth so much I almost spit the water all over due to laughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll experiment some more, but as of right now, I&#x27;m not convinced it is actually doing anything beneficial.</li>
    <li> This has a very-very light trickle of water that comes out of  a small (very small) hole on the side of the tip. Hard to aim as it comes out of the side and not the actual front tip, and very little water comes out. For $15.00; I would skip it, and stick with the regular Oral Breeze.</li>
    <li> Like a shower for your mouth. Oh! So clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite purchase from Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;Because it attaches to the faucet I use it all the time, therefore cleaner healthier gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My oral problems stem from brushing my teeth too hard. So much so that I brushed the gums away from the teeth causing significant bone loss. Because of this gum and bone loss there are open pockets where bacteria builds up. I have noticed significantly less tartar buildup using the oral breeze. With the continued use of oral breeze my gum loss has slowed down tremendously.  I adjust the water temperature to what&#x27;s comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;I found the water reservoir of the water pik to not be enough the oral breeze attaches to the faucet so I use it for a longer period of time and am more thorough with cleaning my gums.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> No moving parts to wear out, and should last forever. Goodbye to complex and prone to failure motor-drive devices. Fit our Moen bathroom faucet without issue.</li>
    <li> I use to have the Waterpik way back when it was a new concept.  To me anything with a chamber that has to fill limits you to how long and how much water you can use until you have to refill it again.  Besides who has that much room on a sink/vanity counter for the darn thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this and was thrilled.  It was compact and I could water jet my gums and teeth for as long as my little heart desired. It came in the mail and I ran to the bathroom to attach this to my faucet.  OH NOOOOOOO ......... the metal adapter was much to big.  Tried the included assorted plastic ones and if you have ever worked with those YOU KNOW how easy it is to destroy the plastic threads when connecting them to metal.  After 45 minutes of frustration it was NOT working.  I called the Oral Breeze helpline and left a message.  We played phone tag and finally emailed them along with some pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like my faucet was from the OLD dime size and it would have to be converted to the NEWER nickel size. The smallest adapter they had was still to large.  So translated that means the dime size was 13/16-27 and I needed to convert that to 15/16-27 or to some it would be 55/64-27. Found some on Amazon for to much money.  I tried my local Home Depot and hit the jackpot!  It&#x27;s metal, fit like a glove and it is working perfectly with NO leaks, all for $4.20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the RediBreeze model.  It just seemed to me that it would be much easier to adjust the water temperature,water flow AND then turn the lever to start the flow into the appliance and it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful hints:&lt;br /&gt;1&amp;#62; Before you attach this to the adapter that is attached to the faucet. Make sure you can move the lever to the open position.  I found the lever to be very hard to move the first time I tried.  It worked fine after that.&lt;br /&gt;2&amp;#62; Remember to have the pik INSIDE your mouth before turning the lever to start the water and to close the lever before removing it from your mouth! It produces a strong stream with very little water flow needed.  Mine is fine with a medium slow flow.  I don&#x27;t even turn the lever all the way to full. In essence it is only diverting about 1/2 to 3/4 of the stream to the appliance and that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!  I just ordered one for the hubby.  We have double sinks and never the twain shall meet!needed.  Mine is fine with a medium slow flow.  I don&#x27;t even turn the lever all the way to full.

    <li> Easier than flossing, leaves mouth refreshed.. Made in USA a super bonus.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using RediBreeze for years.  We like it a lot better than the alternative.  It made having braces much easier.&lt;br /&gt;One in the house, one in the RV and now a spare for just in case -- although I don&#x27;t know why since the ones we already have have lasted and lasted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other models - they all had their flaws (cable broke, battery died, tank not big enough etc. etc.) This one is is really great! Easy to install, works great. Even IF the cable/pipe might break in the future, it&#x27;s easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. Has one in every bathroom and also in the shower. Must turn down water otherwise too strong could do more damage than good. Love it!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Fast shipping. Very easy installation. Greatly reduced my tooth pockets!!!  Dentist really impressed as was I. This is the best. Wish they had one for travel.</li>
    <li> Janet was fantastic!!  Couldn&#x27;t have had a better purchase experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a last resort to treat my chronic tonsil stone problem. I was ready to schedule an appointment with the ENT to have them removed, but this oral irrigator has so far proved to be a much cheaper and painless solution.  Anyone suffering from tonsil stones will benefit from this device!</li>
    <li> I really like my RediBreeze. It was easy to install. I like that I can control how fast or slow the water shoots out.  One small problem but not a real issue was the very tip of one of the sprayers was chipped off.  Still works great. Otherwise i would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I love that you can control the water pressure! The stream is flat and works great. My whole family loves it! I like that you can adj the water temp to your liking and make it strong or weak according to your pref. Does NOT leak and is a huge asset. Only takes a few seconds after brushing. I also use just the hose part to rinse the sink area. It blasts away well ... anything :)</li>
    <li> works good cleans well</li>
    <li> I was told about this product by my dental hygienist, who thought it would a good investment.  That was the best thing she could have done for me,  the irrigator is wonderful.  It hooks to my faucet and it&#x27;s good to go.  Easy to install, don&#x27;t have to worry about refilling anything because it ran out of water, it comes straight from the tap.  I irrigate several times a day and my mouth loves it.  It&#x27;s not very expensive and we&#x27;ll worth buying if you&#x27;re having issues water picking on a regular basis.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This products was useful for the first few weeks until my deep pockets began to disappear.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, works excelent,  am very content with it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Now on my second RediBreeze oral irrigator. My first one replaced a noisy, inconvenient WaterPik, and I used it for over 10 years with no problems whatsoever. When I got the second one, I had moved to a new home with a different faucet. I experienced problems with leakage while using the new RediBreeze, but the customer service folks at RediBreeze were great about working with me to determine the cause of the leaking and how to resolve it. Turned out that my unit needed an extra washer, which RediBreeze sent to me. Now it works great, just like my old one did.</li>
    <li> Tremendous!!! Works extremely well.  There is a small adjustment period, as with any new device- you need to remember to move the lever on the adapter to the closed position when you are finished using the irrigator as well as discerning the level of water pressure that is right for you- but very easy to install, needed no tools and worked great from the get go. The bottom line?  My gums and mouth feel and look better.  The improvement was noticeable from the first week.  My mouth just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean or good without using the RediBreeze and the really good thing...It is easily removed and transportable.  I take it with me when I travel and with the adapter that came with it, there hasn&#x27;t been a faucet that I couldn&#x27;t attach it to with ease.  The product is American made by US military Veterans, easy to use, of high quality,well made and as such, I am happy to endorse it.</li>
    <li> Delivered EXACTLY as noted, FAST! Love this item, one of my best investments. So easy to install, makes my teeth feel super clean! UPDATE: I recently went on vacation, 5 days without hydrosflossing (hydrflossing about 1 month now). Even with brushing twice daily, still felt &amp;#34;film of yuck&amp;#34;. Couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and &amp;#34;power wash&amp;#34; my teeth and gums, lol! Teeth feel stronger, gums are healthier. And...significant, noticeable decrease in &amp;#34;mornining breath&amp;#34;! I opted for this system over the other units you have to fill with water. Oral breeze system allows me to use whatever pressure and temperature is comfortable for me. I won&#x27;t ever be without my Oral Breeze :-)</li>
    <li> The attachment separated from the hose when I first used it.  I have to hold onto it and the hose when I use it.  Otherwise, water will spray out when the attachment separates from the hose.  Also, the hose is relatively short, so it hurts my back bending down to the sink.  I&#x27;ve tried contacting the company twice using their on-line support response section, but I&#x27;ve gotten no response in 5 years.  Also, the instructions (when I read it a few years ago) says you still need to floss and also need to use an oral rinse.  Therefore, this product does not save anytime.</li>
    <li> The power it produces is much less than my old waterpik. Installation was easy and travel would be convenient so it&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t pulsate the way waterpik does, but I have gotten used to it.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> This product not only meet but exceeded my expectation!  My wife and I agree this&lt;br /&gt;product makes your mouth feel like a recent visit to the dentist.</li>
    <li> I used the standard water pik for years, but after 4 years the motor would go and it would need to be replaced, so I bought the oral breeze, liked it, and now I have the one, that I do not have to detach each time, I would recommend this one, over the detachable one</li>
    <li> The adapter works far better than a water pik; really cleans and stimulates gums.&lt;br /&gt;I had to subtract 1 star because I have a Moen faucet. Moens are made in Canada and use an off size&lt;br /&gt;thread and size. Moen does this on purpose so no devices can hang off their faucets.&lt;br /&gt;RediBreeze customer support sent me all the adapters and no dice. I use mine on the laundry sink.&lt;br /&gt;Beware- The Moen faucets will not work with Redi-Breeze unless something changes in the future</li>
    <li> Had used something similar over 20 years ago when travelling (another company).  Easy to connect and use.  Like having lever to go from flossing to handwashing without taking off the adapter.  Also like the idea of using some warm water added&lt;br /&gt;to the mix.  As I have used countertop flosser for years, gums and teeth felt much cleaner as I could use a stronger force of water.  Lever was hard to open on first use (have arthritis in my hands) but with use is now fine.  Make sure sink is deep enough for the attachment and/or faucet is high enough to leave room for hands under the adapter when using for handwashing, etc.  Did not need the additional connectors for various size faucet threads but certainly had enough supplied if I had needed.</li>
    <li> I found an adapter to fit the faucet on my utility sink.  The sink has a standard male garden hose thread.  The entire system is easy to screw on  and off (just like a garden hose), or if I choose, leave connected and wrap the irrigator hose around the sink spout.  This is my second Oral Breeze device.  So far the have held up well, and seem to be quality built.  The basic system is the same for all Oral Breeze Products.  The system is simple and functional.  If set up in the correct location (one in the shower , one in the utility sink) there is never any mess or splatter to clean up, saving much time.  Someone should have thought of this long ago, all other systems are now obsolete.</li>
    <li> The RediBreeze was easy to install and works well.  Takes some  practice so water will not get everywhere, but that is a personal problem.  Oh, don&#x27;t forget to shut the valve off - At least it is only water!!!</li>
    <li> I have one of these and love, love, love it!  I find it much preferable to the electronic or battery operated water piks that I have had.  This one with the valve looks even easier than mine which has to be clicked on to the faucet, but removed to get normal water flow.</li>
    <li> As the title states. Works great, easily installed, great pressure. There was one tooth that hurt when I directed the blast onto it, so I guess I must have a cavity.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fairly easy to install even though I had to use a part of pliers which they tell you not to use in the instructions. I only have 2 issues with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t pulsate like the tank filled oral irrigators.&lt;br /&gt;2. My sink now makes a high pitched humming sound when I put it on the highest power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall positive experience. Would highly recommend especially for the price.</li>
    <li> My family and I used 3 other products prior to purchasing the Redibreeze. I love the fact that my young sons can easily use this product without my assistance and without my worrying about water being spilled everywhere. I was skeptical that the Redibreeze would not have enough power to floss effectively. However, we cannot turn the faucet on full strength because it is just that powerful! A third to a half open faucet is plenty.  Because of this, I don&#x27;t even mind that I can no longer mix mouthwash in the well of the flosser. I simply use my mouthwash afterwards. The cost is affordable enough that it allowed us to put a Redibreeze in each bathroom. In addition, the varied-colored tips make it easy to avoid using someone else&#x27;s tip (we purchased the blue and red tips so that we each have one)...a problem that we always encountered with the previous flossers. Lastly, the hose hook and tip holder are great ways for storage once you are finished flossing.</li>
    <li> I was a bit irritated to find that this wouldn&#x27;t work well (without odd adapters that WERE&#x27;NT included) with a couple of my sorta&#x27; upscale Kohler gooseneck and regular faucets, but once I found it would work with my powder room faucet, I am more than pleased. Unlike some of the popular tooth sprayer devices we have had this one really belts out a blast of water (don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s adjustable). I&#x27;m always amazed at how much crud this thing dislodges! And there are no cords or rechargeable batteries to go bad. I wish their little holder clip were a bit better selected, it&#x27;s barely usable, but I won&#x27;t hold that against this company...  One year later I  still get a kick out of this thing. It&#x27;s uses have extended to blasting hair out of brushes, cleaning clogged razors, de-clogging the drain of hair, cleaning the lavatory basin itself, cleaning under finger nails; you name it. The valve diverter still works like new and is of good quality.  This will do the job better than any other similar device in my opinion.  A year later: I&#x27;m convinced this is a superior replacement for most pulse type flossers. The uses are endless: 1. Clean hair out of hair brushes and combs. 2. Clean residue out of shavers. 3. Blast hair out of sink drains. 4. Small parts cleaner. 5. Flush crud off vanity bowl.  And I repeat: This thing gets crud out of teeth so effectively, I have to imagine I&#x27;ve been going around my whole life with food particles. Pulse machines never left so much garbage in the vanity sink. Just be a bit careful about the force if you are at all sensitive (I am not).  The bayonet attachment has come undone a few times under pressure, just handle (the jet tip) without torking it one way or the other.</li>
    <li> Works great, glad I bought it.  There is a learning curve as far as using it without spraying down the entire bathroom, but it does just what I wanted.  Nothing sitting on the counter needing an electrical outlet, I can use it for as long as I want because you don&#x27;t run out of water, you can set the water temperature - cold water is painful.</li>
    <li> Love this water pick and it&#x27;s improvements.</li>
    <li> Great product. Installation was momentarily challenging, but manufacturer was very responsive. Super easy to use. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! I have had braces for 5 weeks and I got this item yesterday.  I had no problems attaching it to my faucet and using it. My teeth have not felt this clean since the day before i got my braces.  I wish I had gotten this sooner, it was worth every penny, and then some.</li>
    <li> Having used the Redibreeze for over a year now now and after several dental check-ups, I have to say this this is great. Before, when I would go to the dentist, I would get chastised about flossing. Now they just say keep up what your doing. The ability to adjust pressure and temperature make it more refreshing and the feeling is addicting. Not having to fill up a reservoir, and just turning on the water and adjusting then using, is a joy. It is like a tiny pressure washer for your teeth and gums. I am amazed, when standing over my white sink ,at the debris I see come out, after brushing and rinsing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the few who has a weird tap so it didn&#x27;t fit properly with the pieces provided.  I did finally manage to get it attached to the faucet and it works pretty well.  It has a stronger spray the more you turn the faucet on, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is that when you unsnap the irrigator from the tubing you get water everywhere.  It also makes me uncomfortable that the water stays in the tubing and never really dries out, so whenever I use it I always run it for a few seconds before actually using it.  If I don&#x27;t the water I get in my mouth is cold and gross tasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I like that it came with two nozzles so you can share it, and it&#x27;s easy to control water pressure.</li>
    <li> Love this. Easy to install. Pressure controlled by water flow on faucet. No ports to fill, no cord to plug in, no batteries to recharge or replace! Works great!</li>
    <li> This is the second irrigator I have purchased, excellent product that provide excellent results. My dental checkups have improved and the dentist has commented on how little plaque I have and how healthy the gums are. This is directly due to the irrigator.</li>
    <li> After carefully evaluation the various oral irrigation options and based on the initial investment I decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was a breeze and was able to figure out how to use it on the first try.  I was comfortable with its use after two to three uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There should be no complaints regarding temperature and pressure.  Both are fully adjustable via the faucet controls and the switch valve.  The switch valve is not an ON/OFF valve, you can adjust gradually to generate a corresponding irrigation pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue that I have had (and previously reported) is that the irrigator tips do not securely lock-on to the tubing.  The solution should be a simple re-engineering fix.  In any case when using, turn the irrigator tip only clockwise.  That should keep the tip fully locked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated this product five star were it not for the aforementioned issue.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works easily.  The only drawback on our sink is that we don&#x27;t have a faucet as shown in the description, so the nozzle holder won&#x27;t work as shown, so we adjusted to fit our faucet.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this.  Great value and doesn&#x27;t take up precious counter space.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended an oral irrigator and my husband and I have used your product for over a year.  We find it convenient, effecient and easy to use. We are both avid users.  Our granddaughter is getting braces and her orthodontist also recommended oral irrigation, so we have bought one for her as well.</li>
    <li> Very easy to hook up and use.  It is so quiet, unlike my old water pick.  I will never go back.</li>
    <li> Comes with attachments for diff faucet types.  I needed nothing more to install.  Very easily installed with pliers.  The force is adjustable with the amount of water pressure used so can be great for many people&#x27;s needs.  Much btr than spending a lot more money on a water pick that holds the water.  Ewwww!! My 11 yr old son uSes this daily with his braces.. The sink is still usable for any other needs too.</li>
    <li> Worth every $.  Great irrigator.</li>
    <li> Love this! No problems hooking it up to a Moen faucet. Very convenient because you can just leave it hooked up to faucet all the time; there is a small lever on the side to switch between the irrigator and regular sink use. Doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space like a water pic, and also no noisy &amp;#34;pumping&amp;#34; sounds like a water pic. Remember to use on very low pressure to avoid gum damage.</li>
    <li> A really nice alternative to the big clunky unit that most are familiar with, you know, the one that sits next to the sink. Installs in a snap, but the upside is you can adjust both temperature and pressure with the faucet handles. Because of this flexibility, it does a better job (In my opinion), since you have more control over flow and water temperature. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take up a boatload of space in the bathroom either. I wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> works as discribed easy to install</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the Oral Breeze to help treat my periodontal pockets and gingivitis, but I procrastinated. Big mistake on my part. Using this and a Sonicare toothbrush (also dentist recommended) the condition of my gums improved within 2 weeks. Only time will tell how big an effect they have on the pocket depth, but there&#x27;s no doubt it&#x27;s helped reverse the gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist actually suggested the version for the shower since patients complained about the mess from oral irrigation. I&#x27;m not a fan of having things hanging out in a damp shower so I  opted for this model.  I&#x27;m glad I did. Yes, there is a learning curve in controlling the flow and not covering the sink area and mirror with water. My solution: keep one hand on the valve control while using and my mouth as closed a possible. Short, controlled jets then a quick spit before continuing worked the best for me. Finding the  correct amount of pressure took a couple of days of practice.  The detachable model, while convenient for maintaining a clutter free sink, does NOT have a valve control. As my hot and cold water controls are separate nobs, controlling the flow with them and maintaining constant water temperature while adjusting pressure would be nearly impossible. If you have a single faucet nob like the one pictured then you might like the detachable model best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apartment bathroom is tiny,  so the fact the Redibreeze doesn&#x27;t take up precious counter space like a Waterpik is an enormous plus.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of oral irrigators and I found this one to be the best for me. It is easy to install, easy to use, and you can adjust the pressure you need for cleanliness. Perfects. I have bought 2nd one. Just take off time to time and clean in hot water and let hot water run thru it.</li>
    <li> My third one, but this one looks like a winner.  The other 2, I had to take it on and off and that wore them out prematurely.  This one has the shut-off valve so its stays on the facet, so I expect even more years out of this one!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to install. I put mine in the laundry room because the faucet end in my bathroom is impossible to remove. It will work fine there too. The spray seems a bit light but I&#x27;m sure it will get the job done.</li>
    <li> Negatives on this product:  First off, the negatives are far outweighed by the benefit of the product.  Combine this with teeth brushing and your teeth will feel incredibly clean.  As for using it, you&#x27;ll go through a few days of errors and mishaps and a general learning curve.  First one is, it&#x27;s easy to leave the switch in the on position which means the following time you use the faucet it will spray everywhere or even you as I got it right in the forehead.  Also, it takes some getting used to using properly.  Like I said, there&#x27;s a learning curve.  The first day I found it hard to keep from swallowing water, water filling my mouth too fast, and it caused the roof of my mouth to tickle.  Now it&#x27;s truly a breeze.  Just finished using and my mouth feels clean as ever.  Use it to rinse after brushing is the best time to use it.  And while you&#x27;re rinsing use it on your teeth and gum line.</li>
    <li> use everyday, easy to install</li>
    <li> Fits onto my faucet.  Works great.  Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted!  I decided to order this irrigator because my big clunky one made too much noise if I was the last one to bed, was too big on the countertop, and was too much trouble to drag out to use on a regular basis, so it sat unused.  The RediBreeze solved all of those problems as it&#x27;s always ready to go and near silent.  Installation took about 30 seconds and I was ready to go.  I did install it a little bit differently, putting the valve in the front, which made the hose routing a little better, but that&#x27;s a matter of preference.  The suction cup for holding the hose was tweaked and wouldn&#x27;t stick to anything.  I sent a note to the vendor through the Amazon contact link and they sent out new cups right away, which was very good service.  Cons: * You, obviously, cannot add mouth wash to the rinse water, but I can do that periodically with my electric irrigator. * The entire &amp;#34;contraption&amp;#34; of valve/aerator/etc sticks rather far down into the sink.  A taller faucet would make this better. * I would have liked if it came with a flow limiting plate to reduce the flow rate through the final aerator.  I will probably replace the aerator that it came with with a water saving one or try to find a flow limiter that fits under the washer.   Update:  After a few months I find it significantly more comfortable to use and at my most recent cleaning appointment I had no bleeding and significantly reduced pocket depths!  I&#x27;m very happy with the results from the fact that it&#x27;s much more convenient to do the irrigation, so I actually do it more often!</li>
    <li> Three good things I&#x27;ve bought in my life:  Oral Breeze, a one way ticket to NYC and my Bible.</li>
    <li> This is the second RB irrigator I&#x27;ve purchased. It is the perfect tool for getting food out from between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;1. I use it after brushing and am forever amazed at what was a jet stream of water finds. Flossing can&#x27;t compare, especially if you have older crowns like I do. With this irrigator, you get two modes of adjusting the water pressure--by turning the knob on the device or turning your own faucet up or down.&lt;br /&gt;2. It takes up virtually no space. Not for a motor. Not for a tank full of water. Not for a stand. Just a little extension at the tip of the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s durable. Practically no moving parts. I only needed to replace the little white hose on the first one I bought--once. Best of all, NO RUST (after years of service).&lt;br /&gt;4. It was easy to install. I used a pair of pliers to remove the original aerator from my faucet and then screw the new one on. It&#x27;s not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;OK, OK, there IS a learning curve. You (or more likely your significant others) need practice leaving the valve in the OFF position when you are done. Which can lead to &amp;#34;amusing&amp;#34; experiences if not done properly.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 1.5 years.  But then, the tip started flying off of the hose when under pressure, spraying water all over the bathroom and up my nose!  The tips and the hose fitting for them are plastic and I believe they have worn down enough over the 1.5 years to be strong enough to attach, but not strong enough to stay attached under pressure.  I would give it 5 stars for the first 1.5 years, but must now give it a 0, as it is unusable without replacing parts.  That averages the rating to 3 stars for me.</li>
    <li> It may be a bit early for a complete review, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed. Good engineering, well made, and does the job. I had no problem attaching the irrigator to the faucet.    It came with some plastic parts that don&#x27;t seem to have any purpose since they were left after everything was up and running. Oh well, I&#x27;ll contact the vendor.    This irrigater appears much more likely to last than a similar irrigator I purchased from another vendor which kept falling apart after a brief period of time.  This device has a great return policy and replacement warrantee.</li>
    <li> Love it! Never looked back! My teeth feel fresh and clean. Easy to install, pressure and temperatures are at your control and it takes up minimal space.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these  one for myself and another for my husband. When it works, it will blast out any debris. For months now, the tubing has been popping off. This was supposed to have a lifetime guarantee when I purchased it. Numerous emails later, I have still not received the replacement tubing and cannot use the device! It couldn&#x27;t possibly cost them more than a few cents to replace this, so I don&#x27;t get it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. the side lever that allows you to control the pressure of the water through the nozzle is TERRIFIC. However, when Im using the mechanism, water continues to run through the sink spout. Meaning, using the lever does not shut down the water.That is an Enormous waste of water!!! Another thing, the round clear attachment hanger to hook the cord to, does not adhere to my stone tile. A minor inconvenience, but still a great product. I used to own the sink and handheld products. Will never go back again.</li>
    <li> Installed in less than 5 minuets.&lt;br /&gt;Finally an irrigator you don&#x27;t have to plug into anything.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for daily use without taking up a bunch of space on your sink.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to turn the lever to off once you done, or you will get a nice water snake show&lt;br /&gt;and shower. (kinda fun the first time)&lt;br /&gt;This unit is ALWAYS available, so you have a tendency to use an irrigator every time you brush.</li>
    <li> Works very well, I used to have a regular WaterPik, the advantage of RediBreeze is that you don&#x27;t need to have a power outlet nearby and there are less parts to clean. The finishing could be better, although the switch valve is quite good, the tips are a little rough and the tips ranger are poor.</li>
    <li> I had an old redi breeze that went kaput after several years of use.  I bought a waterpik to replace it and while I do like the ability to add saline or other cleaners to the reservoir, I find that I don&#x27;t do it daily becasue of  the hassle. I still do use my waterpik on occassion but I love the ability to just use this so easily and as long as I want without running out of water and having to refill.  I am not getting rid of my water pik as I will use it to get that extra oomph you can get from added products, but this is my number one go to &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> Affordable for what it does. I have it hooked up but barely use it now. I should, though. Small package. I was a little confused by installation (how to remove something on my sink - couldnt unscrew easily) but my partner took over and it was all fine. The power of the stream through the hose is amazingly fast. Better to put stick in mouth then gradually turn water on at faucet level (not contraption&#x27;s) because I feel theres more control. Shut the water off or turn down so you can open mouth and spit out fastly collected water. ... The adhesive strip for the wall mount doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
    <li> I love it for my teeth and my boyfriend loves to blast dishes clean with it. We always get a good laugh when one of us forgets to turn the valve back to faucet and later, when we go to use the sink, the ceiling gets blasted and it rains on us. So if you are absentminded AND your day is easily ruined I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> As with anything I purchase on Amazon I go over each review and try not to let the excessively negative ones influence my decision. Some reviews are clearly disgruntled or written by someone without the ability to follow instructions or contact a seller with questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the RediBreeze because of its ability to shift water from the pick to the aerator. I wanted to test the pressure before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product pumps out a lot of water pressure with only a little bit of water flow from the faucet. I&#x27;ve never used any of the competing brands but I cannot imagine this not having enough pressure to do what it&#x27;s designed for unless your house has zero water pressure. It does tickle a bit but per the instructions that is to be expected. And if it&#x27;s too uncomfortable just lower the pressure a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also takes up very little space in comparison to those that use reservoirs and is totally quiet. I&#x27;ll admit I have sprayed myself and some of the bathroom, but that&#x27;s more of a coordination thing and getting used to using a waterpick for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seems solid. Metal fitting and attachment. Rubber-like hose. I have not had a pick attachment come off while using the product. When attaching the pick make sure to twist it into the locked position. Pretty simple to set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very responsive, helpful, and courteous with a question I sent them thru Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the RediBreeze if you&#x27;re shopping for a waterpick. But don&#x27;t take anyone&#x27;s word for it. Check it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the seller, I&#x27;d recommend combining the levered RediBreeze with the quick disconnect QuickBreeze.</li>
    <li> Would like this irrigator much more if you could quickly attach and detach from faucet. It is ugly to say the least and I doubt most people would like the looks of it hanging from their faucet. I would love to be able to detach and put in drawer when not using it. Its stream of water is less forceful than my &amp;#34;shower floss&amp;#34; and if I need to get a deeply embedded piece of food out, I fire up the shower floss but the redi floss is OK for general gum irrigation. It would be nice if they included a smaller diameter flosser for more force when needed and developed some kind of click on and off attachment end.</li>
    <li> First, the assembly is easy and it fits great on my New York City apartment faucet. However, Even though I desperately needed this to be a remedy for my gum disease I found this product to be disappointing. Even after learning to use it like it properly, I can&#x27;t say it cleans better or get additional results to regular brushing-flossing-rinsing. I found it to be another procedure added to the brushing ritual that eventually seems useless (and so I rarely use it nowadays).</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the actual project as I was not able to hook up to my sink. My super was not able to either. Took my sink&#x27;s adapter to hardware store and his directions didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
    <li> Perfect and easy for my 12 year old who just got braces put on.  Uses it before brushing.  Easy installation. Just remember to turn the irrigator valve off after using so that faucet turns back on normally.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Easy to use anywhere, even abroad. Plus: Customer Services was very helpful when I needed additional parts. Love it!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite amazon purchases of all time. Had an amazing dentist appointment. Said my teeth/gums had no room for improvement :)</li>
    <li> This works great and is super quiet, exactly what I needed when others are sleeping. Came with two colors that are easy to switch.  Also has switchable water stream - either normal faucet or through the irrigator, much better than Oral Breeze&#x27;s less expensive QuickBreeze product that you have to take off the faucet to use the normal water stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Waterpik product better because the stream is smaller, can be more intense, is totally adjustable so it would prevent too hard or soft, but it is noisy and not suitable when others are sleeping.  I also use my RediBreeze to fill up my Waterpik water chamber when it runs low so I don&#x27;t have to disassemble the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great combo - Waterpik when I&#x27;m really serious about cleaning my teeth - with the pulsing toothbrush and irrigator exactly set to what I want; and RediBreeze to fill the WaterPik reservoir and for times when I need to be quiet not to wake others.</li>
    <li> I bought this so many years ago (2007) and still going strong.  Recently, I&#x27;ve needed a connector when it broke off.  The customer service is amazing!!  They sent me connector and extra orings right away.  I replaced the connector, works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many companies so you know offer this kind of support after all these years?  Its a good product and shows in my dental checkups.</li>
    <li> This product is great! It works well and doesn&#x27;t take up room like a Water Pic would. And there is no electricity involved. Easy to use too.</li>
    <li> No more pain filling the unit and plugging it in. Bedroom bathroom so it doesn&#x27;t matter if it is always hooked up, in a common bath it may be a little much. Pressure adj. with control handle and temp is what you set the faucet at and consistent. Only con is no control near the tip you have to reach to the faucet to pause.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.Easy to install. Leaves teeth cleaner than ever.  All the kids love it.</li>
    <li> I would like for this to have more pressure but it was easy to install and if I can remember to keep my mouth shut when using it, all will be good.</li>
    <li> Simple and reliable. Takes up very little room. Does what it should and will last much longer than those other brands</li>
    <li> Works better than stand alone irrigators (which cost a lot more). However, none of the adapters provided would fit my faucet. I called the manufacturer, and they were unable to recommend an adapter that would work. I finally replaced my faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a faucet that uses an internal thread aerator that recesses into the faucet housing, you may want to look for an alternative irrigator.</li>
    <li> I received the product in a reasonable time. It was as described. Installed it and love it&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to everyone I know</li>
    <li> I have been using the Woog system irrigating machine. They went out of business. 2 yrs ago I started using the WaterPik water floss dental irrigator. Both systems worked well and had a 2yr lifespan. They were both pricey at over $100 each though. That&#x27;s why I started looking for something more reliable. If simple means reliable, this RediBreeze should win hands down!  After receiving the Irrigator, I removed the existing faucet aerator, screwed the RediBreeze on lightly, and it leaked. I did not follow the included instructions nor view the on line instructions. Instead I tightened everything with my fingers fairly tightly. Not sure if I did it correctly but, it stopped leaking. Overall install time was less than it took to open the RediBreeze package. Fast and easy.  After I got the temperature to a comfortable level and brushing my teeth, I tried the new irrigator. It was easy to adjust the water strength with the knob and the water flow was smooth. The tips have a larger opening that the WaterPik and I find the larger tip more effective. It quickly removed the little particles hidden in my gum-line with no pain. I think the pulsation of the WaterPik was harsher on my gums that the Redibreeze.  The material is a heavy weight/solid brass, chrome plated metal. The knob requires a little force so someone with arthritis may have difficulty turning it but my 10 yr old has no problem with it. Since there are no moving parts other than the knob, I expect the only item that may need replacement in time is the hose.  I&#x27;ve used the RediBreeze Oral Irrigator for about 1 week and I am very happy with it. If it develops any issues, I will update this review. But right now I am sitting here vividly aware of how good my gums feel and how clean my teeth are!  Update 8/14/15- I&#x27;ve been using the RediBreeze for over 1 yr now. No problems with it. I found myself using it more frequently than the other electronic irrigators because there is no tank to fill, no maximum or minimum amount of water/time consequently, my gums are in better shape than they were when using other irrigators.  Initially the RediBreeze hose had a plastic, chemical odor that filled the bathroom. After 2 weeks it was barely noticeable. After 1 month, there was no odor at all. Origianlly, the hose was very flexible like a Doctors stethoscope hose. After about 6 months it became a little stiffer but still flexible. I&#x27;m even happier with my purchase after 1 yr. Even bought one for a friend!</li>
    <li> I like that it cleans really well. A tooth brush won&#x27;t do that by it&#x27;s self. It is eazy to use and convenent. I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long, long time. I have probably been using this for at least 15 years. It is a great product and I want to use it after every meal. I used to use the quickbreeze version of this product at work. I installed it in the bathroom and no one was the wiser. I work from home now so it is not necessary. The valve began to drip recently and so I have ordered a replacement and a spare. It does not owe me anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great feature is the ability to set the temperature of the water quickly and easily before using it. SO if you have sensitive teeth, or perhaps a sensitive filling, you get all the control you need over the water temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another excellent experience for me is that the price has stayed very very reasonable after all these years.</li>
    <li> My dentist referred me to an oral surgeon - supposedly a painful process with no guarantees that the bleeding will  stop. I bought this and use it daily - very effective, no bleeding in the last one year.</li>
    <li> Wow, it came so quickly and does attach easily! Makes my gums feel great!</li>
    <li> Great product - good quality. Love the fact you can still use the faucet with the flow switch addition.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, our first &amp;#34;water pik&amp;#34; type device and the kids like it so far</li>
    <li> Messy, can&#x27;t seem to contain all the water, but it beats flossing hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great service.</li>
    <li> I was already a believer in using an oral irrigator.  I have the beginnings of gum disease, and a brush and floss just weren&#x27;t enough.  So I began using a Waterpik at the suggestion of my dentist.  The difference after using it was night and day, and my dentist really noticed.  Bleeding stopped, and the pocket depth actually began to improve.  The problem is, Waterpiks are very poorly made.  You would think that for what you pay for a Waterpik, they would be built well.  I have had two fail in the last year - just quit working.  That&#x27;s a lot of money to throw away every year.  I was about to go buy a third one, but Walmart stopped carrying them in my town.  So I got on Amazon, and started to order one, when I began to see the Oral Breeze products mentioned in some of the Waterpik reviews.  I liked what I read, and ordered one.  Let me tell you, the build quality is top notch, and its simple!  There&#x27;s no delicate switches to fall apart, no capacitors, to quit working, etc.  This thing is well made, and does just as good of a job as the high priced junk you can buy to set on top of your sink and take up space.  After using a Waterpik for several years, the Redibreeze does just as good of a job, without all the high price and unreliability of the electronic whiz machines.  Get yourself one.  You will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Easy to attach to a standard faucet.  Doesn&#x27;t require a lot of water pressure in the faucet to provide plenty of pressure out of the jets.  Makes no noise for those of us who live in light sleepers or in condos.  Solid construction for years of use.  Company is very customer friendly, too.</li>
    <li> I have used a cordless one and the water pressure was not optimal so I thought this will allow me to change the water pressure. Which it does. But the problem w this product is it feel of its water pressure. It tickles and uncomfortably so. I lowered the pressure but whatever I did, it was still very uncomfortable. The positive was that the assembly was easy. But I discontinued using it after a week.</li>
    <li> I bought both the Redi and the Shower items for different bathrooms. Plus these were reasonably priced and can be moved easily - win win!  The company kept me informed and the products were delivered quickly. Today I had the chance to install both and try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, it was apparent how they were to be installed and I didn&#x27;t have to check the video (although I probably will later).  Both were simple and had all the right parts!  Neither one leaked and both felt like quality materials were used used because the metal items were sturdy. The ShowerBreeze even has pipe tape included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out each one (and my plastic shower mirror :), I did not have the water pressure way up, appreciated the warm temperature and my mouth feels very clean!  I look forward to adding these devices to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the company for making what appears to be a very good product and for being considerate of installation needs!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, my teeth and gums have never felt so clean and it&#x27;s so easy to use, I just love it! And super fast deliver, excellent service.</li>
    <li> The Oral breeze does not clean as well as the electric water irrigator, the heads do come off while using the Oral Breeze and water goes all over. Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever invested in. I use this after each meal if possible. My teeth and gum tissue feel better and look better. You will not go wrong by or ordering  this produc. I even have one in my shower, don&#x27;t have the worry of splashing water all over you . My dentist cannot  believe how clean my teeth are and my gum tissue so healthy. Purchase this product you will not be dissapointed . Good luck !</li>
    <li> Was what I expected but doesn&#x27;t have the right extention faucet hook up</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE this! so simple, and gets my teeth very clean. use it 3 times each day. one of the best tooth products ever.</li>
    <li> Sensible engineering makes this product good for a small bathroom without any countertop.  Too early to asses durability but without  any bells and whistles and only one moving part it should be trouble free.</li>
    <li> What a great way to really get clean teeth and gums.  It was very easy to connect up to the faucet.  The instructions are easy to understand.  It takes a little getting used to without spraying all over. (Maybe I&#x27;m just a little clumsy).  After a couple of times, I was able to increase the water pressure a little bit and I can really feel the difference.  I like this so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this superior to a stand-alone water pick for most cases.  The &amp;#34;never run out of water&amp;#34; is a big plus in my book.  My water pressure doesn&#x27;t quite seem to be able to give it the power of a stand alone unit, but I almost never used one of those at full pressure anyway. Because.. ouch.  It looks a little funky on my faucet, which was already pretty low in the sink, but this is in a back bathroom that nobody sees anyway, so I don&#x27;t really consider that a factor.  Unexpected benefit is that it&#x27;s really handy for spraying out the sink after I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convenience factor makes me use it about 1000% more often than I would use a water pick unit.  They also score major points for having a flexible supple pressure tube instead of the stiff coiled plastic you tend to find on other products.  It&#x27;s just a nicer implementation in general.  The only reason this missed 5 stars for me is because I feel the tips provided with the kit needed a little better quality.  The holes are a little irregular and could use a smaller, smoother aperture.  Out of the box, mine tended to fan the water out a little bit instead of providing a more solid stream.  This can be mostly remedied with a little careful application of a toothpick or similar object to smooth out the hole.  I would also like just a little bit more power,  I&#x27;m considering trying to remedy this by feeding more water pressure to my faucet.</li>
    <li> I had 2 of these products years ago. I just add 2.  One is for my parents, other for my brother. My first was great. I had to call RediBreeze for replacement a loosing know, which was had a bad screw at begining. They exchanged it without hesitate. A product last for a longer than other brand. Cleaning and maintenance my gum and teeth aren&#x27;t any less nor inconvenience as other expensive battery operated. Perhap, it is even better in aspect of reliable issue,  not to mention it is so quiet when in operated. A cost is less than any battery operated brand. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  My Dentist recommended this for my oral health.  It was an easy installation and works great.</li>
    <li> I really like the RediBreeze, and bought a second one since the cat chewed holes in the tubing of the first.  Installation is easy, with clear directions, and the irrigation has helped my gums.  This was delivered even sooner that promised.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t fit my faucet as there is no adapter included that will fit after removing the aerator.  I&#x27;m looking at the hardware store for a fitting, but not having any luck.  Comes with only a male fitting, and I need a female fitting.  Should come with one of each.</li>
