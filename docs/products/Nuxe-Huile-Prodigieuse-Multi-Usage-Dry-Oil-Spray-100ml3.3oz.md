      <li>I bought this for my hair and read a review that said it&#x27;s not oily and is good for fine hair.</li>
      <li>A nice change of pace from day to day moisturizer, but still use sunscreen on top of it.</li>
      <li>However it&#x27;s perfect for summer because it&#x27;s not too greasy or heavy, and has a beautiful floral scent.  </li>
      <li>Pleasantly scented, makes skin feel luxurious all day, and spray makes it quick to apply.</li>
      <li>The smell is very light and goes away about an hour or so.  </li>
      <li>Great for moisturizing the skin after being out in the sun, great for giving shine and moisture to dry hair.</li>

      <li>buy it again for sure</li>
      <li>Hands Are looking better as each day passes.</li>

      <li>but I do appreciate some of her finds :-)</li>
      <li>One of the podcasters mentioned it as a product they love.  </li>
      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This is the brand of choice for French women and one of their oldest and best sellers.</li>
      <li>Enjoy it!</li>
      <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
      <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
      <li>I came across a discussion of this online, and thought it sounded like a lovely treat for summer.  </li>
      <li>This dry oil is wonderful!</li>
      <li>To be honest, I am fond of Nuxe, great products, especially for the face and eye countour.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m running out more quickly than I would like for the price, but STILL well worth it!!</li>
      <li>It is very light, so if you&#x27;re looking for something super moisturizing, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
      <li>Has a slight smell that is beautiful too!</li>
      <li>but it is a good moisturizing oil that soaks  in without being greasy and has a light soft sent.</li>
      <li>Goes on great and no greasy feeling left on your hands afterwards.  </li>
      <li>amazing, I am absolutely enamoured by this product.</li>
      <li>It goes on really easy and quickly and dries in seconds.</li>
      <li>and I love any kind of body oil, especially in the winter.  </li>
      <li>Like others have said, this is a great dry oil and dries into your skin quickly.</li>
      <li>I love that it really is \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly, and does not wipe off onto my pillow 2.</li>
      <li>This little glass bottle (nice, not plastic) holds a lovely scented and light oil.  </li>
      <li>This product is by far one of the best skin oils I&#x27;ve ever used that makes your face feel so much smoother and even younger looking.  </li>
      <li>super good for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and eczema, and I barely need to use any of this to make my skin feel hydrated and awesome.</li>
      <li>Smell is a bit strong , but its goes away very soon.</li>
      <li>Overall a lovely product!</li>
      <li>Have used several products from this manufacturer, and love them all!  </li>
      <li>use it right after I shower.  </li>
      <li>I went on vacation and didn&#x27;t try the product right away.  </li>
      <li>Or if you do, try it &amp; return right away</li>
      <li>I spray it all over right after my shower and my skin feels so silky.  </li>
      <li>The smell of paradise, white flowers, memories of sun and beautiful landscape, all in a tiny bottle of \\&quot; huile prodigieuse\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The oil smells good, but I did not find a great difference from cheaper oils (almond and other) that I used in the past.</li>
      <li>The smell is way too sweet for me and it goes on very greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it clashes with some of my favorite perfumes, and it&#x27;s fairly strong.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I am glad I tried, but not something I would spend my money on in the future.</li>
      <li>product does have &amp;#34;frangrence&amp;#34; smell to it, one I didn&#x27;t like at first but have grown accustomed to it.</li>
      <li>Only problem is, I love using it all over my body all the time</li>
      <li>does exactly what it says it does</li>
      <li>First time using this product.</li>
      <li>It leaves a pretty sheen on my skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I never go without this product! It makes your skin so soft, and glowy. Definitely better than lotion which is heavy and thick. Has a slight smell that is beautiful too! Feels good for your body putting it on, will always buy this!</li>
    <li> I saw this on one of my GOOP emails.  Amazon had it for the best price and I decided to take a chance and try it.  Soooo happy I did - this stuff is AMAZING!!!  I spray it all over right after my shower and my skin feels so silky.  Not greasy at all.  The smell is very light and goes away about an hour or so.  I can&#x27;t get over how lovely this oil is.  If you are on the fence - go for it - you will not be disappointed.  As for the price, compared to the other items listed in the GOOP email this is very affordable.  I may not want to be stuck in a room with Gwenyth - but I do appreciate some of her finds :-)</li>
    <li> I came across a discussion of this online, and thought it sounded like a lovely treat for summer.  It really is a lovely, decadent product!  It doesn&#x27;t contain silicones; some reviews I came across said that it did, and it appears as if older formulations of this do, but the bottle I just ordered from Amazon does not. It is composed of six essential oils, plus other nourishing ingredients like Vitamin E.  The scent is like white flowers, but it also reminds me of lazy days at the beach.  It imparts a nice, subtle sheen to the skin, and can also be used on the hair, face, and cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle also has a spray that makes it easy to apply, and, since you only need a little bit, I can see this lasting a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips for applying it, taken from the Nuxe website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Apply this Dry Oil to your face, body and hair all year round, in summer and in winter.&lt;br /&gt; Mix a drop of Huile Prodigieuse with your usual foundation for easier glide-on application with no sticky effect.&lt;br /&gt;Spray a little Dry Oil into the palm of your hand then gently tousle your hair for a natural result.&lt;br /&gt;Sprinkle a few drops of Huile Prodigieuse into your bath for a truly relaxing experience.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Enough said. This oil is the best. I did a lot of research and decided on this and a couple others to try - and this is the best. Only problem is, I love using it all over my body all the time so I&#x27;m running out more quickly than I would like for the price, but STILL well worth it!! Makes your skin feel like silk and I have chronically dry skin :)</li>
    <li> This product is by far one of the best skin oils I&#x27;ve ever used that makes your face feel so much smoother and even younger looking.  Applied to the neck, face, forehead and even your hair, gives a soft, silky feel that I apply under my regular foundation.  All it takes is three sprays in the palm of your hands rubbed in and you will notice fine-lines even improve. Bottle lasts for a long time...about 10 months!  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic for anyone who has dry skin or would just like to soften up a little!. It goes on really easy and quickly and dries in seconds. You can literally put on clothes immediatley after using this and it won&#x27;t leave any marks on your clothes. It also smells divine! I bought some for my bridesmaids and later for my mother and all are hooked!</li>
    <li> It is good item. I like this item and I &#x27;m satisfied. I will recommend this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried many other oil sprays, dry oil sprays, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried things made especially for the body, especially for dry skin, especially for hair — none work as well as this multi-usage dry oil. Really. I have been repurchasing this for a while, and this is amazing. I have very dry skin and eczema, and I barely need to use any of this to make my skin feel hydrated and awesome. I really like it. I also use it on my hair; however, I&#x27;d recommend using it on very dry hair that needs a boost, or on your hair when it&#x27;s wet/damp, after a shower — that way, your hair won&#x27;t be terribly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing, I am absolutely enamoured by this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great transaction too!&lt;br /&gt;I am a novice with respect to skin care.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is good for me, and that matters the most.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a recommendation.  I am a beauty junkie and I love any kind of body oil, especially in the winter.  This is a dry oil so it&#x27;s a little lighter but I still feel like it does a great job moisturizing.  It has a very pleasant smell, nothing too overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars simply because of the packaging.  The bottle is somewhat awkward to hold on to and it&#x27;s glass.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent and it leaves skin silky without visible oil (unlike baby oil). I used it in my hair and it is just a bit too oily for hair. I definitely recommend it to replace all moisturizers. I do not use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years now.  It is perfect. In the summer I use it alone, and in the winter I put it under a heavier cream, but I dont leave the house without this on my face.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly scented, makes skin feel luxurious all day, and spray makes it quick to apply. I need about 3 pumps per leg and distribute all over, it&#x27;s lasting decently.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair and read a review that said it&#x27;s not oily and is good for fine hair. Well...no. I have thick fine hair that&#x27;s colored and thirsty. This is like a grease slick on my hair and I didn&#x27;t use much. Very disappointing. Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It is very nice oil.Smell is a bit strong , but its goes away very soon.I use it on body and hair.I will not recommend it for face.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful.  It is very light, so if you&#x27;re looking for something super moisturizing, this isn&#x27;t it.  However it&#x27;s perfect for summer because it&#x27;s not too greasy or heavy, and has a beautiful floral scent.  My only complaint is that the bottle does leak a bit.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I use it when I travel for hair, face &amp; body. Will buy again for sure. Soaks in very well.</li>
    <li> super good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This will be something I buy for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Face: This has 6+ oils in in, so I would recommend looking at the ingredient list or patch testing before putting it on your face. I use this as my night-time moisturizer for a number of reasons: 1. It dries quickly, and does not wipe off onto my pillow 2. It hydrates my skin from the inside out. What I mean is that a lot of moisturizers only prevent moisture from leaving the skin, however, this puts moisture back in. My acne scarring has reduced and my skin texture has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Body: Like others have said, this is a great dry oil and dries into your skin quickly. I spray this on after a shower and am good to change immediately afterwards. It&#x27;s not a deep moisturizer, but it&#x27;s good for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Hair: I have a dry scalp and find this oil helps reduce any flakes I may have. I spray this on my scalp before I wash my hair about once a week. I also put this on the tips of my hair to reduce the appearance of split ends. My hair is fine, so I have to be careful and have a light touch with the oil to prevent a greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have &amp;#34;frangrence&amp;#34; smell to it, one I didn&#x27;t like at first but have grown accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> Drys immediately, makes my skin look great?  Works well on dry heels also.Hands Are looking better as each day passes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture and smell.  Goes on great and no greasy feeling left on your hands afterwards.  One of my must have beauty products.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for my hair - and I can find it nowhere else!  Thank you Amazon for a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this dry oil.  It leaves your skin hydrated and not oily.  I do not have overly dry skin.  If I did, I would probably lather a lotion over it.  A little goes a long way.  The fragrance is not offensive.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy because it is a bit pricy but it is a good moisturizing oil that soaks  in without being greasy and has a light soft sent. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> great product came in great condition, very well liked by many in my surroundings.  does exactly what it says it does</li>
    <li> I love this dry oil spray. The smell is fantastic and I have had no issues using it on my sensitive skin. The bottle lasts a long time as 1 or 2 sprays goes a long way. Any left over on hands, I just run through my hair and nothing goes to waste. It does leave my skin oily at all, but just provides the perfect amount of moisture under makeup or on its own. Love!</li>
    <li> Please include fact that this is like a perfume in description.......I thought it was neutral oil. So understanding what you&#x27;re buying</li>
    <li> I use this on skin, hair- as a moisturizer and as scent. Delicious. This stuff is the best consistency and it smells divine.</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing the skin after being out in the sun, great for giving shine and moisture to dry hair. This is my 5th bottle over the course of 2 years. The stuff is worth the money and lasts several months.</li>
    <li> A great skin and hair moisturizing spray that is not too oily and is very light! Have used several products from this manufacturer, and love them all!  Because it is a french product, English is not a priority on their instructions and packaging, but it is  easy to use and makes the skin smell sweet and feel great, especially for those of us who live in very dry climates!!</li>
    <li> I received this, sniffed it and returned it immediately. From all I&#x27;ve heard and read, it is a wonderful product that works well and is versatile - but I could not get past the very strong and sweet floral scent. Instant headache. I wish they had an unscented version - or maybe they do - will research. If you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, this product is not for you!</li>
    <li> this dry oil smells really good, but only things stop me to using it all the time is the oil not absorb very well after use which cause a little bit oily. i will not use it before make up, but i am using it at night.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical for sure, but I really do notice a difference with my skin.  It&#x27;s softer and I personally love  the smell.  I put it on at least an hour before bedtime so that it gives it time to absorb into my skin.  It goes on slightly greasy but is absorbed almost 100%&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> This dry oil is wonderful! It works wonders for dry skin, hair, etc. I use it in the morning and it dries up really fast, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my work clothes all grease and gross. And it smells absolutely amazing! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have learned that oil is the purest and best product for skin care. I have tried almost every version out there and finally learned about Nuxe. This is the brand of choice for French women and one of their oldest and best sellers. Now there are lots of new and expensive French dry oils coming out, but don&#x27;t bother. This is the best product, use it on your face, hair, cuticles....and it will give you amazing results. All in one product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I came across this product via a podcast.  One of the podcasters mentioned it as a product they love.  I decided to go out on a limb and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  It is fantastic!  Previously, I&#x27;d been wearing the same perfume since 1996 - religiously!  This has pretty much replaced that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it right after I shower.  It has cleared up my ridiculously dry elbows and has helped make some slight scarring on my shoulders less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Based on the other reviews, I expected this product to be great but was not impressed.  The smell is way too sweet for me and it goes on very greasy.  I went on vacation and didn&#x27;t try the product right away.  Then when I did use it and realized I really didn&#x27;t like it, I was 5 days past the return date and the company wouldn&#x27;t take it back.  I realize that&#x27;s my fault but wish I would have tried this sooner.  If you are picky about your scents like me and do not like a greasy feeling on your skin - don&#x27;t get this.  Or if you do, try it &amp; return right away if you&#x27;re not pleased - don&#x27;t make the mistake of waiting too ling like I did.  I think I trusted the raving reviews loving this a little too much.  I do like that they seem to use natural oils in their ingredients but this was just not for me.</li>
    <li> This little glass bottle (nice, not plastic) holds a lovely scented and light oil.  I use on face, body, leftover I run through my hair.  It leaves a pretty sheen on my skin.  A nice change of pace from day to day moisturizer, but still use sunscreen on top of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil after reading the reviews that indicated it could be used to make the hair shiny as well.. It certainly did not work for me for that purpose, because it just makes my hair look extremely greasy and unattractive.. To be honest, I am fond of Nuxe, great products, especially for the face and eye countour. The oil smells good, but I did not find a great difference from cheaper oils (almond and other) that I used in the past. I am glad I tried, but not something I would spend my money on in the future.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift. I know it will be well received since it was a gift request. Speedy service so I&#x27;m very pleased with that.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I also use the Leonor Greyl Palm oil and this reminds me a lot of that.  The smell is just wonderful!  I reminds me of being on vacay in the Caribbean, jasmine, tiara flower...  I can see where a person that does not like the scent of flowers would not like this as it can be quite intoxicating.  I, however, do, as well as the other oils previously mentioned.  Best of all…it works!  If you use this (the smallest amount for fine hair like mine and mostly on the ends) all winter long, your hair will not be damaged or dry, guaranteed!  This is 100% in my book!</li>
    <li> THERE&#x27;S NO OTHER PRODUCT OUT THERE THAT DOES WHAT THIS DOES - IT IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANYONE&lt;br /&gt;WITH A FACE!</li>
    <li> It is like little ball-bearings of oil over my face.  And I love it for my hair when it feels dry.</li>
    <li> I got this product after running out of a safflower-based after shower oil, and reading a lot of good reviews about this one. So far (3 uses) it does a wonderful job. I love that it really is \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily. Unfortunately, it has a weird sweet-floral scent to it that I wasn&#x27;t expecting. It&#x27;s nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it clashes with some of my favorite perfumes, and it&#x27;s fairly strong. Overall a lovely product!</li>
    <li> First time using this product. Excellent brand !!! I will definitely buy more. Met completely my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;My hair loved it.</li>
    <li> I use it after a warm shower and go to bed to relax to the wonderful woody scent of this oil. It&#x27;s not cheap! Enjoy it!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite oil for all my body parts, i love the aroma.... very happy</li>
    <li> Love, love this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful--no oily, greasy finish on the skin.  It&#x27;s great on my elbows and feet, and I love the smell. It satisfies my cost conscious self..it cost half the price at Amazon, than where I first bought it.</li>
    <li> Very good but dont like the smell.</li>
    <li> The smell of paradise, white flowers, memories of sun and beautiful landscape, all in a tiny bottle of \\&quot; huile prodigieuse\\&quot;.You can definitely do everything with it, form your hair to your skin in and aura of \\&quot;merveille\\&quot; !</li>
