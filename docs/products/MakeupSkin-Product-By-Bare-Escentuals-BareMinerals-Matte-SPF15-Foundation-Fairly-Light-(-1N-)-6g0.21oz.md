      <li>This product actually is good for your skin.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t look good at all.  </li>
      <li>I found that you need a really good brush to apply it</li>
      <li>Great product and stays on nicely all day.</li>
      <li>I thought the foundation was a good Christmas for my granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 60s and find it to be an excellent light but covering foundation.</li>
      <li>its nice, but not as flawless as they make it sound.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation!</li>
      <li>Idk how they do it, but this product is amazing for me.</li>
      <li>Also, the skin tone matches mine perfect, This is something important to keep in mind if you are trying this product for the first time.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals is perfect for someone like me who has breakouts.</li>
      <li>Bare Minerals is the best product out there for your face in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I love this foundation because it goes on smoothly and is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The Matte foundation is such a wonderful product!</li>
      <li>I went and priced this at a makeup store and it was almost 15 dollars more.</li>
      <li>My face glows and looks healthy again.</li>
      <li>Love this foundation.</li>
      <li>Love ordering it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I always use bareminerals and love the way it makes my skin feel and look</li>
      <li>I love ordering almost everything on Amazon, but this is an exception.</li>
      <li>It offers great coverage.</li>
      <li>like the powder, easy on, easy to clean at the end of the day!</li>
      <li>This matte finish gives good coverage without the shine that the original bare minerals has, which is great for older skin.  </li>
      <li>fairly light is darker than I wanted</li>
      <li>I got hooked on BareMinerals a couple of years ago and it has been fantastic since it lets my skin breath while I am wearing it.</li>
      <li>it is so light but covers well.  </li>
      <li>The package arrived pretty quickly so that was nice.</li>
      <li>Since she picked it out by brand name, I know she was excited to receive it and will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the original foundation.</li>
      <li>I ordered from here fairly light makeup, and when the package was received, they had covered the actual shade with tape and it was fairly medium.</li>
      <li>I normally use the original and love it.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look flawless and even covers very bad acne scars and even acne flare ups incredibly well.</li>
      <li>I love the new packaging.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didnt think the price could be true but this is the real deal stuff!</li>
      <li>I did, however, use the product, and it seemed to be bare minerals, so in the end it worked out okay.</li>
      <li>I believe that choosing the right shade is very important for this make-up to work for you properly.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I wanted with the convenience of being shipped right to my house.</li>
      <li>It goes on so easily and makes my skin look fresh and smooth rather than chalky as I&#x27;ve found some other mineral makeups do.</li>
      <li>Large container, came right away,</li>
      <li>I love the light coverage and how it doesnt clog my pores or feel heavy.</li>
      <li>It goes on light and you can barely tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>Mine is very acne prone.</li>
      <li>It did not make me break out at all and really helped control blemishes.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really have any quality makeup stores around me</li>
      <li>The wrong color was sent, fairly medium instead of fairly light.</li>
      <li>I have been an avid user of BareMinerals Foundation for the past 5 years and can honestly say that I don&#x27;t plan on changing that any time soon.</li>
      <li>They also got clever and replaced the shade sticker on the bottom of the makeup.</li>
      <li>However I usually apply this first, then use a little of the original foundation on top.</li>
      <li>Arrived brand new just as stated.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to try a bunch of different shades until you&#x27;ve found the perfect one.</li>
      <li>The whole experience was just a bit sketchy though, so I have resumed buying my bare minerals at the brick and mortar makeup stores.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working well so far.</li>
      <li>Your skin can breathe and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>and she has been having no trouble.</li>
      <li>I really can use this and not have to touch up for several hours.</li>
      <li>Lightening fast shipping, product was exactly what I expected big fan of BareMinerals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for years and was sent Matte by mistake</li>
      <li>I am a natural red-head and it is really hard to find complimentary make-up for my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>but since it wasn&#x27;t a super saver shipper item the price was about the same (I&#x27;m not sure if Sephora charges for shipping).</li>
      <li>I only recently broke out when I started using a revlon concealer underneath bare minerals.</li>

<li> It is way to dark and I am unable to use it</li>
<li> I was hopeful that this makeup would be the same as I bought in store, but I was sorely disappointed.  </li>
<li> Definitely a fake.  </li>
<li> BAD CHOICE.</li>

    <li> I love the light coverage and how it doesnt clog my pores or feel heavy.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals is the best product out there for your face in my opinion.  My face glows and looks healthy again.</li>
    <li> Arrived brand new just as stated. I love this foundation because it goes on smoothly and is perfect for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for 2 years now with no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I went and priced this at a makeup store and it was almost 15 dollars more. This is the same thing for a lot less. It looks great and comes pre packaged.</li>
    <li> This matte finish gives good coverage without the shine that the original bare minerals has, which is great for older skin.  I would order again.</li>

    <li> Love this foundation. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to liquid foundation. Love ordering it from Amazon. It saves me from going to the mall.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried other brands of mineral foundations, I keep coming back to BareMinerals.  I especially like it since they now have the matte selections.  I&#x27;m in my 60s and find it to be an excellent light but covering foundation.</li>
    <li> The Matte foundation is such a wonderful product! The coverage is great without feeling caked on. I didnt think the price could be true but this is the real deal stuff!</li>

    <li> I was hopeful that this makeup would be the same as I bought in store, but I was sorely disappointed.  You definitely get what you pay for.  It was basically a translucent powder and provided zero coverage.  Definitely a fake.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> They scammed me and I wouldn&#x27;t trust them. I ordered from here fairly light makeup, and when the package was received, they had covered the actual shade with tape and it was fairly medium. They also got clever and replaced the shade sticker on the bottom of the makeup. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM.</li>
    <li> Lightening fast shipping, product was exactly what I expected big fan of BareMinerals.</li>

Great product and stays on nicely all day.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted with the convenience of being shipped right to my house.</li>
    <li> This is great foundation- it is so light but covers well.  Your skin can breathe and looks natural.  I have used BareMinerals and people ask me about my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of BareMinerals Foundation for the past 5 years and can honestly say that I don&#x27;t plan on changing that any time soon.

    <li> Seems to be working well so far. My wife uses it several times a week and she has been having no trouble.</li>
    <li> I love the new packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that people have a love/hate relationship with this product. I happen to be one who loves it. It makes my skin look flawless and even covers very bad acne scars and even acne flare ups incredibly well. It&#x27;s so natural-looking and the texture is so creamy and perfect. Idk how they do it, but this product is amazing for me. It&#x27;s one of my staple items in my make-up bag.  Also, the skin tone matches mine perfect, This is something important to keep in mind if you are trying this product for the first time. I believe that choosing the right shade is very important for this make-up to work for you properly. I would suggest that if you don&#x27;t feel you know your shade, have someone at Sephora help you out before purchasing it online. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try a bunch of different shades until you&#x27;ve found the perfect one.</li>
    <li> fairly light is darker than I wanted but I like the product.  I just have to find a lighter color.</li>
