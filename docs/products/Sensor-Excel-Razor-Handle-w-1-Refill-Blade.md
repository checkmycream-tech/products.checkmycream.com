      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love this razor.  </li>
      <li>Great to find resource for replacement handle and blades for classic 2 blade Gillette system.</li>
      <li>Good product, fast delivery!</li>
      <li>The classic is really the best!</li>
      <li>Product was fine, ships from India which takes abut a month.</li>
      <li>The handle was fine.</li>
      <li>The product is fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they still sell them in China, and that&#x27;s where they seem to come from, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>I really like the Sensor razor  and wanted to stay with the Sensor razor blades (I don&#x27;t need 5 blades on my razor!!!).</li>
      <li>Packaging is original Gillette branding from India.</li>
      <li>Much poorer quality than the original Excel I&#x27;ve had for many year--possibly a counterfeit?</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m using my favorite classic twin blades again!</li>
      <li>Just as good as Harry&#x27;s and the blades are cheaper and last longer</li>
      <li>More plastic parts than the original - which was more solid and metal.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick as promised and razor is one that my husband loves.</li>
      <li>Ordered this and it arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>completely adequate.</li>
      <li>Received it quickly and as advertised.</li>
      <li>Received quickly</li>
      <li>Was having trouble finding it in retail stores and was really happy that it was available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I had this razor when I was young and liked it very much.</li>
      <li>Find it much better than all the new &amp;#34;upgrades&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Thanks !!</li>
      <li>Item Exactly as Described!</li>
      <li>the sensor and sensor excel work far better than any of the 3, 4 or 5 blade razors out there</li>
      <li>I had a Sensor razor for years and liked it but finally had to throw it out.</li>
      <li>Its simply the best for beard shaping the wider multiple blade offerings are just too wide to do fine cutout work and detailing.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>exactly what I needed, could not find the item in the stores.</li>
      <li>Hard to find item at good price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on the three and five blade razors but this one works better.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes it</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Thanks, it was just what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny how the handles aren&#x27;t available, but the blades are in stores, because I think it shows how they&#x27;d like shavers to upgrade to more expensive models, but can&#x27;t deny blade sales from its loyal users.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find the right razor for left over blades i found from long ago.</li>
      <li>Clean shaves with the longest lasting razors ever made.</li>
      <li>They only sell the bigger ones with tons of blades that don&#x27;t work any better.</li>
      <li>am looking for an older model I guess.</li>
      <li>My dad ordered this to fit the endless amount of sensor blade refills he had.</li>
      <li>Product came exactly as promised and was exactly what I had expected.</li>
      <li>Awsome the only razor i use thanks.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t good, without packing and look like a fake one</li>
      <li>So far, I can still find the blades locally, and when i can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll start ordering those from China too!</li>

<li> It&#x27;s so hard to find these in stores today.  </li>
<li> from India.. ridiculous...</li>
<li> I had no idea it would be SO hard to find another one!</li>

    <li> 1st Rate Transaction! Prompt Delivery! Item Exactly as Described! Thanks !!</li>
    <li> Hard to find item at good price.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations and was sent to me in the time line issued by the seller.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have about 15 cartridges and this is a good find.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as good now as it was when it first came out years ago!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with my razor.</li>
    <li> So glad they had it! I had like 50 refills cartridges and no handle.. Problem solved!</li>
    <li> from India.. ridiculous...but could  not find a Sensor razor locally for any amount.</li>
    <li> still one of the best razors for close shaves.  good price</li>
    <li> Arrived on/before advertised time. Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Still the best razors.</li>
    <li> the sensor and sensor excel work far better than any of the 3, 4 or 5 blade razors out there, its a shame they took the handles off shelf sales and only have online availability. Its simply the best for beard shaping the wider multiple blade offerings are just too wide to do fine cutout work and detailing.</li>
    <li> Nice razor. Have others, I like the way I shave with it.</li>
    <li> Exactley as described, great product hate shipping costs period.</li>
    <li> Product was fine, ships from India which takes abut a month.</li>
    <li> The classic is really the best! Thank the maker they could be found for less price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> The product is fine. Just not what I was looking for. Was looking for a solid lock and not a sliding head.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for an older model I guess.</li>
    <li> Product came exactly as promised and was exactly what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t good, without packing and look like a fake one</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick as promised and razor is one that my husband loves.</li>
    <li> Excellent razors.  Was expecting plastic from some reviews, but these were all quality metal just like originals.</li>
    <li> Flimsy feel compared to other Gillette products.  Ribbing on handle for grip are in the wrong locations.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> The handle was fine. The refill blade was awful. It was dull, certainly not made by Schick. I cut myself three times, tossed it and put in one of mine so now all is well. The package came from India so no doubt a knock off.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I had a Sensor razor for years and liked it but finally had to throw it out. I had no idea it would be SO hard to find another one! I really like the Sensor razor  and wanted to stay with the Sensor razor blades (I don&#x27;t need 5 blades on my razor!!!). What I found surprising was that this Sensor razor came from India and I had to sign for the package!</li>
    <li> Much poorer quality than the original Excel I&#x27;ve had for many year--possibly a counterfeit? Blade does not connect snuggly and wobbles while shaving.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed, could not find the item in the stores.</li>
    <li> Item just as described and arrived sooner than stated.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and I get good clean shave.</li>
    <li> I used to use this kind but haven&#x27;t seen it in stores for years.  They only sell the bigger ones with tons of blades that don&#x27;t work any better. Received it quickly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Product is good. More plastic parts than the original - which was more solid and metal. However, the product still handles the need.</li>
    <li> Great product !! Love it</li>
    <li> Just as good as Harry&#x27;s and the blades are cheaper and last longer</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> My dad ordered this to fit the endless amount of sensor blade refills he had. Works as intended</li>
    <li> had one in years gone by. completely adequate.</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  Find it much better than all the new &amp;#34;upgrades&amp;#34;.  Was having trouble finding it in retail stores and was really happy that it was available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This razor is  very easy to use</li>
    <li> I found this to be an excellent product and value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m stuck on the Excel razor and I refuse to buy one of those 4, 5 or 6 blade razors.  This one is still small enough to work around the nose, ears and mustache.  I&#x27;m glad they still sell them in China, and that&#x27;s where they seem to come from, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.  So far, I can still find the blades locally, and when i can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll start ordering those from China too!</li>
    <li> Perfect, just as described .</li>
    <li> This is my third Gillette Sensor. I love them. I&#x27;ve tried others but keep coming back.  Closest shave and best control. Hope Gillette never quits making them.</li>
    <li> package description said there were one extra razor refill. when the package arrives there was nothing in the package other than the one razor and handle. If the description was flawed, then it was miss leading. otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> Great to find resource for replacement handle and blades for classic 2 blade Gillette system. Shipping from India is slow, but for value worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Thanks, it was just what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> It was a great price and works fantastic !!!!!!</li>
    <li> A good razor with a fine handle.</li>
    <li> I switched from the three blade (Mach 3 I think it is).  This does a better job, smoother.  Now I can use up all the blades I had but I will probably stick with this instead of going back to the three blade.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Packaging is original Gillette branding from India. I guess they&#x27;re still popular over there.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  My husband really likes it and he said cartridges for it are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> Item shipped as registered mail from an individual in India. I find that a little odd. Seemed to take 3 weeks. No plastic holder but over-all pleased</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement handle for my razor I keep in the shower. Ordered this and it arrived quickly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works well, bought to house the blades I purchased from SAMs club</li>
    <li> Just what the husband wanted.  Arrived quickly and price was good.</li>
    <li> I had this razor when I was young and liked it very much. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on the three and five blade razors but this one works better.</li>
    <li> Went back to this old school razor as the newer ones are ridiculously expensive. These have little or no decrease in the quality of my shave. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Received quickly</li>
    <li> Used this product for decades. Always worked great.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...</li>
    <li> Awsome the only razor i use thanks.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. I was glad to find the right razor for left over blades i found from long ago. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had bought a twenty pack of blades for this razor years ago at sams club. I moved shortly after, and lost track of the handle, but hung on to the twenty pack of blades. You can&#x27;t get these handles anymore at the store. I was happy to find them still available on amazon. Now I&#x27;m using my favorite classic twin blades again! I&#x27;ve tried all the rest, and this is still the best. Any more than two blades is just a gimmick. Clean shaves with the longest lasting razors ever made. It&#x27;s funny how the handles aren&#x27;t available, but the blades are in stores, because I think it shows how they&#x27;d like shavers to upgrade to more expensive models, but can&#x27;t deny blade sales from its loyal users.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find these in stores today.  I can only shave with 2 blades and disposable is god awful.  Great price and fast shipping.  Works great!</li>
    <li> It works well. It just took a long time for delivery from India.</li>
    <li> Had this before and lost it checked on Amazon.com to see if they had it. Found out they did and had to order it! By far the best shave ever and I&#x27;ve tried other razors too. Who needs 3razors.</li>
