<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with my hair hair type ,I have fine thin white girl hair , i have bleached hair however I have about aN inch of regrowth and I found the shampoo and conditioner works great on natural hair not chemically processed hair, the bottom felt like straw and was awful and literally broke my hair off , on another note I have the pimento oil and castor oil and love it , I put some in my detangler and it made my hair so shiny also it helped thicken it , I do like this product but will warn you that it should only be used on natural hair, I will keep the shampoo and conditioner for when this color is completely out of my hair and will continue the use of the oils .</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my grandmother and she loves it. She says it leaves her hair soft. I will be purchasing some for myself.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get my hair very clean. Left a lot build up and the smell wasn&#x27;t very pleasing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair moisturized and not stripped. It makes my hair super soft and will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> used it on my daughter, keeps her hair clean and doesn&#x27;t strip it. Also use the castor oil and hair food from JBCO.  Works wonders and keeps the scalp and hair very healthy.  A healthy scalp means beautiful hair, my hair grows even more faster now.</li>
    <li> I was just ok.  It made my hair feel a little sticky after washing which I&#x27;m not used to.  But my hair wasn&#x27;t dry at all which is good.  I will continue to use the rest of it, but will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say I LOVE Jamaican Black Castor Oil, so needless to say I was excited when I saw a shampoo and conditioner. I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural and have been for about 3 months. After first use, my hair felt so sticky and dry and just plain gross. I didn&#x27;t understand why, and me being the frugal person I am mixed it with another shampoo and conditioner I was using. But even that didn&#x27;t work. My recommendation, just stay with the oil it is fantastic, but the shampoo and conditioner are horrid.</li>
    <li> This is very good shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t break me out and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair or scalp. My hair never feels dry after washing it with this shampoo. It is feels nice, soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great product. My hair was brittle, breaking off etc. I grease my scalp and put the castor oil on all of my hair as well. I massage my scalp. Through the week I put my hair in a pony tail. When I flat iron my hair the oil protects my hair and straightens it really well.  It makes my scalp itch a little after I put it on, other than that like it.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is the best for natural afro texture hair it makes my hair soft like cotton even before i condition it so i love this product</li>
    <li> I really really like this product.  It made my hair soft and healthy after the first use.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it again on my next wash day.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell...I suggest using a another product with it as well because the smell is awful lol.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It produces the right amount of lather and is delicate on the hair. My hair is a lot healthier since I started using this line of products. And the ingredients are natural.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic shampoo for my daughter who has stopped relaxing her hair and gone natural. Concerned about breakage I decided to try this shampoo based on the reviews. So far it lives up to my expectations. Her hair fells very soft. She still has some breakage but not as much as before. I use this along with the Black Castor Oil. Recommend this to anyone going from relaxed to natural. Wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
    <li> I, too thought this would be a great product based on the reviews.  However, the experience (more than once, on more than one person) was quite disappointing.  The shampoo left hair extremely coarse. Tried it twice on two different people with texturized/relaxed hair, one with soft thin texture, the other, thick hair.  The results were the same-extremely, extremely coarse. Hair had to be deep conditioned with heat, twice.  I will not finish the bottles, since it was such a negative experience.  Very, very disappointed. Would not use again.</li>
    <li> I finally got my order of this JBCO shampoo &amp; conditioner and leave in..its NOT greasy and NOT tacky feel to my hair..the shampoo rinses clean..moisturizer gave me slip and i used the leave in...and my hair loves it..Now to find a cheappper seller for this products...hard to find cheaper shipping too!!</li>
    <li> I used this to wash my natural (kinky) hair yesterday and I lovveeed it! I didn&#x27;t even have to do a hot oil treatment or deep condition afterwards because my hair was left sooo moisturized from all the oils! Buy this!!</li>
    <li> I have used relaxers on my hair for years which caused it to become very dry. I have been looking for a product that will \\&quot;tame\\&quot; the dryness, and make my hair more manageable. I used this product immediately after removing a quick weave (for those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s a glued in hair weave). To my surprise, my hair was soft &amp; silky, &amp; tangle free immediately after I rinsed it. My hair also feels and looks very clean and healthy, and is not dry. I recommend this product for anyone who has a hard time managing their hair for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> I am out I need more.. the product cleans very well... I wish it came in much larger bottle. I am currently on my last drop. I am off to place an order for more.. Excllnt ship time .. Seller outstanding.. thank you, again.</li>
    <li> I use it on my kids hair I feel that it washes the hair without stripping it of its natural oils. it do smells a bit like green grass but after apply conditioner and moisturizer it smells no more. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo with high hopes.  What a disappointment.  At first I thought WOW when I used it on my hair, it felt great.  But when I went to rince the shampoo out my hair became extremely sticky.  I did a re-shampoo with my faithfull WEN product (I know, it&#x27;s not actual shampoo) but not even WEN could save me this time.  Drying my hair was a mess, I couldn&#x27;t get a drying brush or comb through the sticky mass.  I gave up and put 2 braids in my hair (something I haven &#x27;t done in years!) in hopes that my hair could avoid more tangles before I could re-use my WEN product the next day, which with this second use took care of my hair.  I know, it sounds like I&#x27;m giving a good review for WEN Hair Care and a bad one for the Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo..that&#x27;s about the size of it.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars only because I do intend to use it up...washing my feet.  After all, the shampoo is full of good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEN girl forever.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, very mild and leave my transition hair very soft.I use this line of product.Great!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will coat your hair as well as clean your hair, this is the one for you.  I like this shampoo because I have thin hair and need a heavier product to coat my limp strands but if I had thicker hair I would opt for a more lightweight shampoo.  However, smells great and feels good after I&#x27;m done and ready for my conditioner.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for more than two years now and have been completly satisfied. Just a little produces a sudsy foam that cleans and conditions (i don&#x27;t use conditioner). It has a great smell, not perfumey, not medicinal,  but earthy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this product.</li>
    <li> 3.5 stars, If I could.  I want to love this stuff.  I know if does nice things for my hair, and my hair can tell the difference when I&#x27;ve used this...but man!  It is so bleeping hard to get all of this washed out well.  It feels like I&#x27;m washing my hair with honey.  It&#x27;s not sudsy, which is fine, but it causes the wet strands to stick together in large clumps while washing and makes thorough rinsing pretty difficult.  I&#x27;ve had more success with this when I use a comb or toothy brush to separate the hair and let water do its thing, but not to be done in a hurry or you  may find a chunk of hair that just never quite rinsed out - and that is never a good surprise.</li>
    <li> THIS product was purchased for my hair and it i great. When it is being washed, it cleans great.  Yes I do recommend</li>
    <li> Fantastic luxurious lather. Great clean and my scalp and hair are wonderful. I have very sensitive skin and this stuff feels awesome. Smells kinda like gin to me .</li>
    <li> I brought this product because there were a lot of good reviews.  I was excited to receive it.  After applied to my hair, the first thing I noticed was it didn&#x27;t produce any bubbles.  I applied it one more time and it was the same.  Also it took me long time to rines off since the smell was strong.  The worst part was it didn&#x27;t feel clean at all.  I am not sure whether it will get better after a couple of time uses or it is not a good product at all but it is sure very expensive!</li>
    <li> Great for my natural hair not a lot of suds but my hair felt very clean! Use a couple a times per week</li>
    <li> This shampoo is impressive. 100% natural with no harmful chemicals. Afrter washing my hair it instantly felt stronger and it left my hair very soft and manageable, I also used this in partner with the jbco protein conditioning treatment and my hair is gorgeous. I ve never had a shampoo define my curls so well!!! with that being said i will be purchasing 2 more bottles because the only downside to this shampoo is the size : (</li>
    <li> I suppose it works, but it left my hair looking oily. I have fine blond hair, so take that for what its worth.</li>
    <li> Now, I wanna start this off by saying I am not the hippie type of natural girl, but I don&#x27;t use heat and I try to use the best products and ingredients.  That being said, THIS SHAMPOO IS THAT DEAL!!! I won&#x27;t lie, it will definitely make your bathroom smell like what my friends and I call \\&quot;Muslim Oils\\&quot; (think spicy, earthy, herbal) but its definitely pleasant; somewhat reminiscent of Argan oil. I normally have to load my thick, low/medium porosity 4a/c hair down with product but I poured about a palmful and it was almost too much!!! Rich, conditioning lather that left my hair so soft, I almost thought it might come apart in my hands!! LOVE LOVE LOVE and its definitely my staple and ONLY holy grail shampoo!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been trying Castor Oil because I heard it helps keeps strands healthy and minimizes hair loss, so far I don&#x27;t see this happening. What I do like is that when the hair is wet my hair feels moisturized and I like the way my natural curls style, but when the hair dries it can be left feeling stringy. I will continue to use this product until I find something better.</li>
    <li> Lather  up good and my hair is so clean</li>
    <li> I AM TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOR, AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO TWIST MY ARM TO LEAVE A COMMENT!!!! :(</li>
    <li> For those of you that have issues with chemicals, this is a great alternative.  All natural ingredients and the rest of the product line is pretty darn good too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for anyone who is natural or stretches their relaxer. This shampoo leaves a protective coat on the hair that at first seems to thick but once you follow up with your conditioner your hair is left buttery soft. This is also a staple product for me. I love this company</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair and scalp felt when I used this shampoo.  Not only did it feel clean, but it invigorated my scalp.  I only wished I had purchased the conditioner, next on my list, because even without it my hair was more manageable and had great body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Nigerian and unfortunately have been using hair foods and shampoos that all have caused clogged pores, gradual hair loss, itchiness, and nappines lol. Before I bought this product my scalp would itch, even more with a hat on . In addition, my hair would be falling out from unknown reasons and it would always seem dry. Ever since I&#x27;ve used Jamaican caster oil, the shampoo, hair food, and oil, my hair has seen a relief it has waited for lol. The shampoo may be small, but the application of just a little can clean your hair, make it smell good, and keep it soft and pleasant the ENTIRE DAY. The smell may throw you off at first (maybe), but you will love it on your hair. The scent stays even until the end of the day. The shampoo makes my hair easy to comb through and gives me barely any itchiness (barely), even with a hat or covering on. By the way, this was all on the first day. Continued use will help your hair for sure. Lastly, this shampoo in addition to the hair food is awesome. I see myself falling in love with this product if I haven&#x27;t already. I recommend this to anyone, especially for Africans.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I loved the tingle and it started to make my hair thicker (something that i wanted). Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle i THOUGHT i would not order it again as my hair was severely damaged and now recovered so i was going to try just a store bought brand BUT it did NOT make my hair feel anywhere NEAR as moisturized as with this shampoo i LOVE this stuff not sure if i will ever stop using it.. its GREAT!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for African American hair! This product gives the hair lots of moisture and leaves it nice and soft! Also a great product for tangled hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing on many levels.  One, being it doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates or alcohol that be could harmful to your hair.  It very cleansing nor my hair feels stripped, extremely moisturizing.  All the ingredients involved are excellent for all natural hair types.  I simply love it, please don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever. Makes your hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Thought I would have been alot better, it had a very strong smell to it.didn&#x27;t really clean my hair</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO  HAD a safe wrap on the bottle, I LIKE THAT   I HAVE VERY VERY THICK HAIR. I GIVE THIS SHAMPOO AN  A+   FOR MAKING MY HAIR SOFT ....I WISH THE AMOUNT WAS LARGER.  I LIKE THE WAY THE SHAMPOO SMELLS.WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Received product on time.   Used this shampoo on daughter&#x27;s hair and saw a wonderful results. The shampoo is a thick consistency.  It made the hair so MANAGEABLE!   Will be ordering more!!!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a product to strip your hair of all the oils, this is your product.  It lathers well</li>
    <li> I use this along with Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor oil, and the conditioner. I see new hair growth and less breakage. I highly recommend for African American women.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I have tried everything known to be natural for my hair and I have done nothing but waste hundreds of dollars, if you want something to work the first time, and you want to save your hair and money? get this!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Does not lather - which is fine with me.  But hair does not feel any more moisturized than using regular conditioner.  I hope this is still working. It has to be good for the hair.</li>
    <li> Great....Lathers great, and only need a little bit to fully clean the hair.  No smell!</li>
    <li> just started using it so far, so good, i will keep you posted, okay</li>
    <li> All natural girls I know have at least 30 bottles of various shampoos, conditioners and oils under their sinks, in their closets and any other place we can find room to stash them. I tried this on a lark because I&#x27;m a fan of their black castor oil (I use it in my Kimmaytube leave in conditioner mix). As soon as you start shampooing, you know something is different. It left my hair so soft, not stripped, and there was that slight tingle that lets your scalp know there&#x27;s a new sheriff in town - LOL. It took me forever to find the perfect conditioners (Tresemme Naturals Nourishing Moisturizing or John Frieda Frizz Ease Curl Around) and now I have my perfect shampoo. It has a nice clean rosemary smell but you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re coming out of a garden when you&#x27;re done. Another plus is that you don&#x27;t need to use much. Massage it mostly on your scalp, duck your head under the shower for a second and let the suds do their work. Truly a phenomenal product to gals seeking moisture. I use As I Am Cleansing Conditioner (kinda like a cheaper version of Wen) for my weekly co wash but when I need to get rid of build up, this is the shampoo I&#x27;ll be using from now on. Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I had hopes for this product but was disappointed.  I have 4c and beyond type of hair and was in the market for a natural, moisturizing shampoo.  Once I came across this product, I was super excited and couldn&#x27;t wait for my order to arrive. Upon applying the product, my hair immediately locked up and became tangled (i.e. couldn&#x27;t easily move my fingers from roots to ends). Given my hair type, I look forward to shampoo/conditiong time becaus it&#x27;s the only time that I am able to manipulate my hair with hassle due to the water and conditioning agents.  After washing, I immediately applied a deep conditioner to counteract the effects of the shampoo.   I am giving the product two stars based soley on the ingredient list.  On the front of the bottle it indicates that Shea Butter is an ingredient.  However, on the ingredient list Shea Butter is not mentioned. So, not sure if Shea Butter is an ingredient or not.    This product didn&#x27;t work for me, but it seems to work for others. The search for a natural, moisturing shampoo continues...</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves an oily film on relaxed hair, but is great for natural hair.  I couldn&#x27;t use it because my hair is relaxed (for now), but it left my sons&#x27; hair really soft and did a great job of moisterizing their little scalps.</li>
    <li> Love this. Castor oil products have been making my hair grow. Will keep ordering this.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for natural hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo is excellent.  It feels so good on the hair and scalp.  It cleans and does not leave the hair dry.  It conditions very well.</li>
    <li> Well, it certainly doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out, but I can&#x27;t say it cleans it all that much, either.  If you have any kind of oil or other buildup on your hair, this won&#x27;t cut it.  For naturally kinky hair, the gummy feel you get during the rinse-out it isn&#x27;t going to help you with combing or sorting (I stopped combing a few months ago, I just sort my hair out with my fingers now).  But I love the natural ingredients, and a little goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t believe I would buy this again because I like a little bit more of a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feel than this offers.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair, but was looking for a sulphate-free shampoo with castor oil etc to condition my hair. Initially I was disappointed as it left my hair a little tangled. A tiny application of argan oil and a large tooth comb, and all was well again with the world. At that point, I was ready to give the product 3 stars. However, it was the blow-dry experience that pushed it back to 5 stars. My hair felt incredibly smooth, looked shiny and felt so moisturised. Wow. This is my new staple.</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use the leave-in conditioner and detangler yet, but the other products are very good. I will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I saw the ratings n read the reviews n decided to give it a try. I found the odor to be unbelievably strong and bad. but still gave it a try to see the effects on my hair. for my coarse thick long hair, i noticed a reverse effect unlike the most of review here.  it made my hair too dry, strawlike. I hated it so much that i had to return it. not so sure why people liked it and rated it so high here. perhaps, they have a different hair type or live in a different climate.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only washed my hair once with this product once, but it made my hair feel good, and i would recommend it to African Americans.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fabulous! Do not buy if you want squeaky clean hair but if you want to impart oil to condition and for manageability- this is your new best friend.  The smell fades.</li>
    <li> great product every time</li>
    <li> It works like i thought my wife loves it it makes her her really soft. i wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> Left a nice tingle to my head hair was clean but didn&#x27;t like that it kept my hair dry but its a good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!! It smells great and you only need a little, which is a big deal for me. I have really thick hair, so I normally use a lot of product. This shampoo leaves my have squeaky clean without drying it or using half the bottle. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> Not for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product after reading about it on Hairlista.com. I recently big chopped my hair on 2/5/12, and wanted to begin using natural products during my natural hair journey. This is one of my staple products being that it is sulfate and paraben free. It gives a nice lather and doesnt leave my hair feeling stripped. The smell isnt great, but it isnt awful either. I use this in conjuction with Jamaican Black Castor Oil on my scalp nightly, and it has worked wonders for my hair. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> THE SHAMPOO DOES WORK WELL BUT NOT FOR MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo for dry curly hair like mine. It did not strip my hair. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but I would buy it again because of all the good ingredients and the quality of this line.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo.  Keep her dandruff under control and her hair softer. Good product overall. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product.  I will not purchse it again. I have found less expensive products for my hair locally.  There is absolutely no reason to purchase this.  You can get anynumber of castor oil shampoos at anyof your local beauty supplies, walmart, walgreens or CVS stores. I cannot recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Hair feels a little strange once you rinse the shampoo out. But, after you use your conditioner and rinse, your hair will feel so silky. I use this whenever I shampoo my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and would not be without it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo ingredients feel potent, it&#x27;s very cleansing, and a small amount is needed to do the job..my husband is very picky of the products I chose for him to purchase and their prices, however,  because he likes this shampoo so much, he didn&#x27;t say a word about spending the 11$, and I have allot of hair (dreadLocs) and our daughter, so we buy product often. My only wish is that the product came in Larger sizes...Also, a great company to purchase from, great with customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and took the leap of faith. OMG...THIS product is incredible.  I have natural hair which has the tendency to get super dry.  Since I have been using this shampoo and the leave in conditioner, my hair feels soft like flannel!  I keep touching it to see if it is attached to my head.  I am sold on this forever.  GREAT</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love all of these products.  Would highly recommend to everyone and if you are not having issues with your hair you never will after using these products.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine and severely thinning hair. Over the years I&#x27;ve used the JASON brand of biotin hair care products, with varying success. When that ran out, however, I figured I would try the route of going natural. I had spoken with a doctor some years ago and she suggested chemical-free olive oil products. After reading some reviews about castor oil and how it helps hair growth, I went with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed are all natural. No nasty whatchacallits in it. All herbs and oils in it. This was important for me to prevent further stress on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the lack of artificial ingredients, I was skeptical if this shampoo would compare to standard shampoos. On top of needing natural ingredients to protect my fragile hair, I also have very oily skin and hair, and must have a shampoo that can deal with that and yet be used frequently. Well, it did. It lathers fairly nicely, isn&#x27;t thick or heavy. It also washes out oils and leaves my hair literally squeaking clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is something some people might have to get used to. It&#x27;s not Herbal Essences. Don&#x27;t pop open the lid thinking you&#x27;re going to smell Thai dragonfruit or something. It smells more to me like a pantry where all the herbs were left open. It can be overpowering, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I accidentally ordered some castor oil from Amazon, thinking it was shampoo. However, because of the drying effect it had on my hair, I started to do a half/half with this shampoo and the castor oil. The combination can be hard to nail at first with the oil leaving the hair too greasy, but I&#x27;ve found the combo has worked well to clean my hair and yet combat the drying effect by leaving it soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 months. I don&#x27;t expect a magical regrowth of my hair, but it&#x27;s done well to clean it and hopefully help protect it against further loss and damage.</li>
    <li> Dont buy from seller Ox fake not real!</li>
    <li> Simply amazing stuff!!! Specially if u have thin hair. It gives volume, clean really good. It looked weird when i just bought it, but now I got used to it and don&#x27;t wanna change my shampoo for now! It&#x27;s organic and only natural ingredients, very good stuff!</li>
    <li> love it only need a little and hair was clean after one lather and my scalp feel so much better and dont have the iitiching scalp any more.</li>
    <li> Ok this shampoo can do no wrongs. You have a good amount of slip, it smells lovely and it don&#x27;t leave your hair dry. I would definitely buy again as a matter of fact this is the only shampoo I used.</li>
    <li> I could tell right away that this was some good shampoo for my natural hair.  It hydrated my natural locks thoroughly. I followed up with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves my hair feeling super conditioned and soft.  My hair feels like I let it soak in oil with out the greasy feeling.  My only problem is the slot where the shampoo comes out of gets clogged with the shampoo...it gets hardens there so I have to unscrew the lid... NOT A PROBLEM cause this shampoo is GREAT! and it is lasting my good.  I&#x27;ve washed my hair at least 5 times and still have a little more than half.  I only wash my hair once.  great product.  DON&#x27;T change the formulaaaa pleaaasseee</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo to go with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and used them together. The first thing I noticed is how much softer my hair is. My hair is very dry and wiry, so keeping my hair moisturized is a challenge. After the first shampoo I could tell the difference, not only was my hair softer, it was shinier. It is not as sudsy as other shampoos, but that is fine by me, since I am more concerned about effectiveness not frothiness. It has an earthy, woody smell, but it dissipates quickly. I love it!</li>
    <li> :( maybe i expected too much.... I dont like the smell</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.....lathers beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so soft, full of curls  and manageable after use.  Doesn&#x27;t feel stripped and dry. I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this shampoo.  It helps keep her ends healthy.  I love the length this shampoo gives her natural hair.</li>
    <li> Its alright. I thought it was going to be much better. For many people in my family who tried it they felt like it weighed their hair down without moisturizing it. I expected much more. When I used it I noticed that a little goes a long way and I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got hit by a car a month ago, and had an ugly scar on the back of my head. This lead to a lot of hair loss in that area, which took place over a period of two weeks. I read the hair-growth benefits of castor oil, but I was turned off by the painstaking and meticulous process one had to do in order to get the oil in your hair. Hence, I wanted to see if there was a shampoo made of it. Lo and behold, I stumbled upon this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perhaps the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair. Not only did my hair grow back in that area, but using the shampoo has led my hair to adopt a very healthy texture. Every single time I get out of the shower, my hair feels rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only turn off for this product is that the bottle is small (8 oz.) for a relatively expensive price of $11.95. So for somebody with long hair who washes it everyday, consistent use of this shampoo might be a bit too expensive. Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The ingredients consist of: Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Pimento Oil, Aloe Vera, Lavender, Rosemay Extract, Shea Butter, Organic Saponified Oils of Coconut, Olive, Jojoba, Vegetable Gum, Glycerine Extract. Seeing that JBCO is the first ingredient I was afraid it would make my hair ultra greasy and not leave it feeling clean. This shampoo lathered well for me. They suggest you don&#x27;t wash and repeat more than once. My hair felt cleaned and super soft after I rinsed the product out. My hair seems sufficiently moistened. I love that it consists of natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo I use. Takes more to make a lather but it does a great job for hair health and growth. Also try the conditioner by the same maker.</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time on Sunday, (2 days ago).  It lathers nicely, smells awesome, and my hair came out beautiful and soft and moisturized and not greasy, even before I used my deep conditioner or my leave in.  Small bottle, wish it were bigger, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.  if your hair is good, who cares?  It&#x27;s a KEEPER.  My hair is behaving totally differently.  I am a once a week hairwasher. If you have dry hair, natural hair, relaxed hair, or none of theabove, this is still a shampoo I would say you should try.  Seriously.</li>
