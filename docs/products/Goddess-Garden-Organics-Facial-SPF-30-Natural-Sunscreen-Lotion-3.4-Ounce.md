      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to see a formula that applies better!</li>

      <li>and the sun was really strong!  </li>
      <li>It was an appropriate texture, applied easily, and was quite effective.</li>
      <li>The product is lovely.  </li>

      <li>They are safe and organic, and a family run business.</li>
      <li>I was in the beach and the jungle and your sunscreen kept my face (and body) safe from the sun.</li>
      <li>but I like the consistency of my Alba much better.</li>
      <li>I use it most days now for a skin moisturizer and because I am in the sun a lot.  </li>
      <li>I love knowing that it&#x27;s safe to put on my kids</li>
      <li>After researching many sunscreens for my face, I had read about this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I threw out all of my sunscreen and bought suncreens without oxybenzone after reading the Environmental Working Group warning about many sunscreens in the supermarkets.  </li>
      <li>Love the lavender scent and the idea that the immortelle oil helps with those pesky wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>and I love Goddess Garden sun products...</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this sunscreen to try and I wish I liked it.</li>
      <li>their 100% Happy Customer policy &amp; she offered to send me a new tube of sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I loved the part that it contained the 2 main ingredients to protect me from harmful UVA/UVB rays, Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t over apply and rub it in well, it absorbs fine.  </li>
      <li>I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
      <li>more fresh botanical.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread on smooth and even.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy all of the products made by this company.</li>
      <li>According to the product description, the ingredients are (copied and pasted from the Important Information section):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some burns after using Coola and The Honest Company (I am very fair-skinned), and no burns using this product.  </li>
      <li>I am usually cheap and power through stuff I don&#x27;t like, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to with this stuff.</li>
      <li>: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.</li>
      <li>She said it did sound like the one I had gotten separated.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>I live in a hot, sunny climate and enjoy being outdoors, so I need a good sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock was recommended to me as a non-toxic option that absorbs better than most natural sunscreens.</li>
      <li>Smells nice but not heavily perfumed.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so convenient to put it on and be able to go straight in the pool.  </li>
      <li>Very important for those of us living in the high desert.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rarely in the sun because I am fair-skinned.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about the texture.</li>
      <li>so I could find a more natural sunscreen, one formulated specifically for the face.  </li>
      <li>but does eventually get absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I check out products on ewg.org for safety....trying to lessen chemicals absorbed in my body....</li>
      <li>This is my favorite natural sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy, rubs in better than other zinc-based sunscreens, and better protection.  </li>
      <li>Being in a hurry I didn&#x27;t investigate the problem right away.</li>
      <li>I did a lot of careful research (EWG, online reviews, etc) to find a safer sunscreen for my face that has excellent SPF protection that doesn&#x27;t leave a dry, pasty residue.  </li>
      <li>I recommend it also for my patients especially those who are pregnant as a safe</li>
      <li>Also I think there was some defect in the first two batches because both tubes popped open at the top seam</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars, but is very sticky on your face!</li>
      <li>We like it so much that I&#x27;m back to buy more.</li>
      <li>I used your sunscreen in my recent trip to Central America and I loved it.</li>
      <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
      <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
      <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
      <li>Rubs in easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for -- this product certainly cost a lot of money, but I will not buy it ever again.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend reapplying often if you are out in strong sun or very active.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this stuff from Whole Foods and thought it rubbed in well and worked well.</li>
      <li>and it really seems to help with acne/rosacea as well.  </li>
      <li>, I really wanted to like it.</li>
      <li>Find another product with not so much zinc oxide.</li>
      <li>We have never found it watery, in fact I have to watch how much of it my daughters&#x27; put on or else</li>
      <li>Once I do rub it in, it&#x27;s very sticky and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I tried shaking it better the next time and warming it in my hands and it still applied clumpy and would not rub in, I ended up scraping it off my face with a paper towel and using the old reliable banana boat.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This essentially does NOT provide adequate protection, no matter how much I put on.  </li>
      <li>I have been researching safe sunscreens and while this one smelled nice and seemed thin enough to apply liberally, that&#x27;s where the positives ended.</li>
      <li>I ordered two more tubes in February 2012 and used them occasionally over the last six months.</li>
      <li>Even with meticulous application, after walking for only 10 minutes, I sustained a mild sunburn.    </li>
      <li>It stays in white blobs on my face and takes considerable work to smooth it out.  </li>
      <li>I also want it to have the consistency of normal sunscreen.</li>
      <li>than a normal sunscreen</li>
      <li>I tried this sunscreen while outside all day for several days in the strong Colorado sun.  </li>
      <li>Great smell as well as did not cause my skin to break out as other sunscreens had done in the past.</li>
      <li>I have to put little globs of it on my face, then wait for it to warm up enough to rub it in.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and purchased this product based on the list of ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin with allergies which is why I got this</li>
      <li>I was told to take it back to whole foods by a friend</li>
      <li>I was also looking for a product that had natural ingredients and did not feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; on my face.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I wear contacts so my eyes tend to be sensitive too, but the burning was a deal breaker for me.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great sunscreen with no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen didn&#x27;t work at all and I had to end up throwing it away. Money wasted. It wouldn&#x27;t spread and it would form into little chunks when I put it in my palms and spread it to then go and put it on my face. Very annoying and unsatisfying.</li>
    <li> No matter how much I shake it up, there are little white lumps in it.  I am not going to walk around with little white blobs on my skin.  I returned it.  I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the spray version.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of careful research (EWG, online reviews, etc) to find a safer sunscreen for my face that has excellent SPF protection that doesn&#x27;t leave a dry, pasty residue.  Well, Goddess Garden Facial SPF 30 goes on smoothly enough, however it is very liquidy &amp; thin.  This essentially does NOT provide adequate protection, no matter how much I put on.  I&#x27;m rarely in the sun because I am fair-skinned.  Even with meticulous application, after walking for only 10 minutes, I sustained a mild sunburn.    Then there&#x27;s the rash and breakouts all over my face.  I&#x27;ve never had an experience like this before with less natural sunscreens.  So, I am thinking I should just go back to the more \\&quot;standard\\&quot; stuff that may have possible hormone disrupters &amp; carcinogens, but at least prevents sunburn and rashes.    You don&#x27;t always get what you pay for -- this product certainly cost a lot of money, but I will not buy it ever again.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the texture.</li>
    <li> I threw out all of my sunscreen and bought suncreens without oxybenzone after reading the Environmental Working Group warning about many sunscreens in the supermarkets.  I bought this and a few bottles of Alba Mineral Sunscreen.  This brand was significantly more expensive and the texture is really strange.  It is runny and kind of sticky; I am sure it works great but I like the consistency of my Alba much better.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen became moldy after about a month.  It was used once or twice and then not used for awhile and when I opened the flip top today, the sunscreen was moldy.  I purchased about 45 days ago so it is no longer eligible for return.</li>
    <li> Works well, no greasy aftermath.</li>
    <li> the formula separated into a greasy part and a very thick white part</li>
    <li> I used your sunscreen in my recent trip to Central America and I loved it. I was in the beach and the jungle and your sunscreen kept my face (and body) safe from the sun. I didn&#x27;t get sunburned at all and the sun was really strong!  Love the lavender scent and the idea that the immortelle oil helps with those pesky wrinkles.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product in the past, based on it&#x27;s environmentally safe reviews - and rather liked it. Then I purchased my 2nd tube of it. The formula in this 2nd tube was completely different. The consistency is similar to play dough. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t spread at all. At all. We shook it up, and that did nothing. This formula was thick - almost like school paste for kids. Did not spread at all. Very disappointed. I am hoping we can get a refund or something. Something must have happened in manufacturing this time around.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen two or three years ago and was happy with it. It was an appropriate texture, applied easily, and was quite effective. I ordered two more tubes in February 2012 and used them occasionally over the last six months. This batch is horrible and I am getting ready to return it. It is quite lumpy and leaves little white clumps on my face that will not rub in. The tube clogs regularly. The difference between the two purchases was dramatic.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin too white. Find another product with not so much zinc oxide. One of the lotions they sell.</li>
    <li> Very hard to rub into skin. Sounded like a great product.</li>
    <li> The product substance was sub par. It is dried out. I have used this before from different distributor so know what consistency it shod have, disappointed</li>
    <li> After researching many sunscreens for my face, I had read about this sunscreen. I loved the part that it contained the 2 main ingredients to protect me from harmful UVA/UVB rays, Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide. I was also looking for a product that had natural ingredients and did not feel &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; on my face.  I tried this sunscreen and it is amazing!  Great smell as well as did not cause my skin to break out as other sunscreens had done in the past. I currently apply sunscreen up to 5 times daily due to an autoimmune disease I have call Dermatomyositis, which basically the sun harms me. Each time I use this product, I know that I am fully protected from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff from Whole Foods and thought it rubbed in well and worked well. Then yesterday while putting it on the kids I could figured out how it was all over the place. Being in a hurry I didn&#x27;t investigate the problem right away. Then later I found it had busted at the seem of the bottle and was all over the inside of my purse. I was told to take it back to whole foods by a friend but I didn&#x27;t have anything else to put it in to keep from getting on other stuff. I ended up tossing it in the trash.</li>
    <li> This shouldnt even be sold as a finished prooduct.  No matter how well you shake the product prior to using, the ingrediets separate when you attempt to rub the cream into your skin.  Left a clumpy mess that is difficult to rub in.  Then the product is sticky on your skin....even 30 minutes later.  Total waste of money.  I immediately threw it out.</li>
    <li> We bought this last year along with the kids sunscreen.  It is very effective and has a wonderful lavender scent.  We have never found it watery, in fact I have to watch how much of it my daughters&#x27; put on or else they look like they&#x27;re wearing face paint.  If you don&#x27;t over apply and rub it in well, it absorbs fine.  I love knowing that it&#x27;s safe to put on my kids and it&#x27;s so convenient to put it on and be able to go straight in the pool.  We&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn using it, either.   We like it so much that I&#x27;m back to buy more.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t burned yet...used it 3 times so far...</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is all natural but it feels a little gritty. But it&#x27;s worth it to stay away from all the chemicals in other products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised with all the negative reviews.  This is my favorite natural sunscreen.  Not greasy, rubs in better than other zinc-based sunscreens, and better protection.  I&#x27;ve had some burns after using Coola and The Honest Company (I am very fair-skinned), and no burns using this product.  I like the delicate scent (lemongrass?).  Will be purchasing again.  I also have the spray one and have been very happy with that for body.  I recommend it also for my patients especially those who are pregnant as a safe option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> The product is lovely.  Just a little difficult getting to go on smoothly.  But the result is that your skin is glowing with moisture and protected.  Very important for those of us living in the high desert.</li>
    <li> Cannot rate could not use product. When I received merchandise it was to watery to use.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch but this lotion was sticky &amp; goopy, almost like it had separated.  It was very difficult to completely rub it into my skin &amp; took quite awhile to be absorbed.  But what I really hated the most was it is sticky!  As in tacky even after I had completely rubbed in it.  Also, although is specifically says it is for faces, I found that here in AZ working outside when sweat was running into my eyes it BURNED!!  Like hell.  I have very sensitive skin with allergies which is why I got this &amp; I wear contacts so my eyes tend to be sensitive too, but the burning was a deal breaker for me.  I would have put up with the tacky, goopy mess if it hadn&#x27;t burned.  I am giving this 2 stars because it has a very nice smell too it that is not over powering or chemical in anyway, but more fresh botanical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**April 2015** from 2 stars to 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;I was contact by a company rep re:their 100% Happy Customer policy &amp; she offered to send me a new tube of sunscreen.  She said it did sound like the one I had gotten separated.  I am very happy about their customer service, what a great company!  I got my new tube &amp; it is quite different than the 1st one!  First off, it&#x27;s gray in color instead of the typical white sunscreen, which doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.  Plus it does not burn!!  Yeah!  It is still tackier (is that a thing?) than a normal sunscreen but does eventually get absorbed.  It still has a great botanical smell.  Great company customer service, I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviewers on this page, I also took time to do research so I could find a more natural sunscreen, one formulated specifically for the face.  This Sunny Face sunscreen sounded ideal but i am finding the same problem already mentioned - it is very difficult to rub in.  It stays in white blobs on my face and takes considerable work to smooth it out.  I have tried applying it while my face is still damp or wet too but that makes no difference.  However, I&#x27;m willing to put up with the difficulty of applying it because I definitely don&#x27;t want the chemical-laden products which are so common.  I do like the delicate fragrance, and Sunny Face appears to work just fine when I&#x27;m outside in the sun.  I just wish it were a bit easier to apply.  (I purchased it from Well.ca)</li>
    <li> Very hard to apply.  When you try to apply, it just stayed in globs on your skin, could not rub in at all.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product. It doesn&#x27;t spread on smooth and even. And it kind of has a manure smell. Plus I got a sunburn:(</li>
    <li> Well worth the price!  Keeps my fair children protected from sunburns without using harmful chemicals!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Oily and hard to put on. Clumps up and the baby. I prefer Think baby sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is Kindle Addict&#x27;s wife - we use the same Amazon account. this stuff was so awful. runny, it went on gloopy, and then left residue. I was so bummed I didn&#x27;t even want to get my money back. ugh. I am usually cheap and power through stuff I don&#x27;t like, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to with this stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is unsuable... it seperates, isn&#x27;t spreadable and leaves a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this sunscreen to try and I wish I liked it. It smells amazing but it was horrible to apply, it was gloppy and did not rub in. I tried shaking it better the next time and warming it in my hands and it still applied clumpy and would not rub in, I ended up scraping it off my face with a paper towel and using the old reliable banana boat.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to see a formula that applies better!</li>
    <li> I check out products on ewg.org for safety....trying to lessen chemicals absorbed in my body....and I love Goddess Garden sun products...</li>
    <li> This stuff is useless. When you try to rub it on, it coagulates (balls up/ globs up) and will not spread on your skin at all. I almost never write reviews on Amazon but this stuff is not at all usable. I bought 4 tubes because I needed to use up some HSA money by March so when I tried it out in June (too late to return) I realized how awful it is. All 4 tubes did the same thing so it&#x27;s not an issue with a bad tube or anything like that. Do not waste your money on this. I&#x27;m just frustrated by Amazon&#x27;s return policy here. They should make exceptions for products this poor.</li>
    <li> I want a sunscreen without toxic chemicals. I also want it to have the consistency of normal sunscreen. The search continues... This product works well but is thick and grainy going on your face. I continued to use it over the summer, as it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Gives great sun protection.  I would give it 5 stars, but is very sticky on your face!</li>
    <li> The product that I received contains a very different mix of ingredients than what was described in this product&#x27;s description.  According to the product description, the ingredients are (copied and pasted from the Important Information section):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 6.4%, Zinc Oxide 6% Inactive Ingredients: Aloe Vera, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Seed Oil, Gluconolactone, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Ionicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Extract, Ionicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Populus Tremuloides (Aspen) Bark Extract, Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Stearic A.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the ingredients of the product that I received are&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredient: 19% zinc oxide, Inactive ingredients: Aloe Vera, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Seed Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Glycine soja, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Oil, Helychrysum Italicum (Immortalle) Oil, Iron Oxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Radish root ferment Filtrate, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Xanthan Gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19% zinc oxide vs. 6% zinc oxide is a very big difference, as is the lack of titanium dioxide, and the addition of iron oxide and several chemicals.  I have very sensitive skin, and purchased this product based on the list of ingredients.  Receiving a different product than what I purchased is very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I have been researching safe sunscreens and while this one smelled nice and seemed thin enough to apply liberally, that&#x27;s where the positives ended. I&#x27;ve been through three tubes of this stuff and I don&#x27;t know why I wasted so much money, I really wanted to like it. It&#x27;s very sticky and hard to rub in without looking like a ghost. Also I think there was some defect in the first two batches because both tubes popped open at the top seam and I had sticky goo all over my car and bag. That aside, I was not happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy all of the products made by this company. They are safe and organic, and a family run business. I like this sunscreen because it does not contain harmful chemicals. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Either very bad or very old.&lt;br /&gt;Not useable.&lt;br /&gt;Feels and acts like Elmers Glue.</li>
    <li> This stuff was bad, went on like Elmer&#x27;s glue and after washing my face 3 times to get this stuff off...I was still sticky! Returning it.</li>
    <li> I tried this sunscreen while outside all day for several days in the strong Colorado sun.  It wasn&#x27;t thick like some of the other mineral sunscreens I use and felt good to put on.  I have very sensitive skin and it really seems to help with acne/rosacea as well.  I use it most days now for a skin moisturizer and because I am in the sun a lot.  I would definitely recommend reapplying often if you are out in strong sun or very active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low-value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> I have brown skin. This sunblock was recommended to me as a non-toxic option that absorbs better than most natural sunscreens. However, it did not work for me. Upon initial application, my skin appeared slightly dull but not so gray that I would be embarrassed to leave the house. However, the sunblock responded to the warming of my face and slight dampness from sweat around my temples by turning into chalky white streaks around my face.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Rubs in easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.  Smells nice but not heavily perfumed.</li>
    <li> I live in a hot, sunny climate and enjoy being outdoors, so I need a good sunscreen.  I have been searching for sunscreen and trying out different brands since forever.  I bought this one at Whole Foods, and it is one of the worst ones I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ridiculously difficult to rub in.  I have to put little globs of it on my face, then wait for it to warm up enough to rub it in.  You HAVE to wait.  It is literally impossible to rub it in as soon as you put it on.  It&#x27;s weird.  Once I do rub it in, it&#x27;s very sticky and shiny.  It&#x27;s really hard to apply makeup over this, too.  I wish I still had the receipt because this was a total waste of money.</li>
