      <li>Be sure to moisturize after using it.</li>
      <li>My Mother suggested I try using her Dr. Brandt Microdermabrasion Exfoliating face cream, and I am certainly glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit with cream since it came out and haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try a couple more products of this type before I settle on one, but I do like the results I get with dr. brandt.</li>
      <li>I was getting more liquid that</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it for cystic or severe acne, it might be too abrasive and cause more breakouts.  </li>

      <li>but, gosh I love this product.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for over a year and love the feeling of my face after using.  </li>

      <li>Very happy overall with this.</li>
      <li>Will repurchase :)</li>
      <li>I had to buy it once I ran out, I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and does exactly what it supposed to.</li>
      <li>I do recommend getting a really good, soothing oil free moisturizer after use and SPF in the day because of course in all microdermabrasions, new skin is exposed and are more susceptible to damage from the sun.</li>
      <li>Excellent like the other  one hundred or over skin exfoliant !</li>
      <li>This a great skin product, doesn&#x27;t irritate, makes your face feel smooth and looks younger</li>
      <li>This was nice but VERY overpriced for what you get.</li>
      <li>Made my skin feel smooth and exfoliated.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so smooth and refines my pores.</li>
      <li>It makes you skin feel refreshed and smooth.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product plus smells like you&#x27;re in a lemon grove.  </li>
      <li>Right after I used it, my skin looked and felt smoother, and my complexion was much more even than before.</li>
      <li>Right now, my skin is so smooth!</li>
      <li>After 2 minutes of scrubbing my skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now trying Derma e microdermabrasion scrub, it&#x27;s closer to the original Dr. Brandts</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super fine</li>
      <li>Skin feels refreshed and clean.  </li>
      <li>This is a good facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>I really have enjoyed the brandt microdermabrasion skin exfoliant.  </li>
      <li>and I like the fresh, lightly lemony scent.  </li>
      <li>It does have a smell, but the smell is fresh and clean to me.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than most things you can pick up at the local store, but it&#x27;s overpriced.  </li>
      <li>My skin was fresh, clean, and glowing after using this just the first time!</li>
      <li>The texture is very fine and my skin feels incredibly soft after using it.</li>
      <li>only my spa staff knows for sure!</li>
      <li>I really like how fine the grains are.</li>
      <li>For an exfoliant this product works very well and leave the skin smooth and polished.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan, and my face is so much smoother for it.</li>
      <li>Many cream available in Walmart or target for 5-10 bucks does the same job like this one.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Although, it may just be my skin type (regular skin), it kind of dries me out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you could find another microdermabrasion for less money, but I want to know that I am putting a reputable brand on my face.</li>
      <li>If I go without it, my skin isn&#x27;t so clear and smooth.</li>
      <li>I look 10 years younger :)</li>
      <li>My skin felt SO soft and smooth after using this.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>However, I made the mistake of not doing a test patch first and</li>
      <li>about ten minutes after I washed this stuff off, my skin was bright red.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ve convinced 2 people to try it and they have seen positive results.</li>
      <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase it again because of the price, and because I can&#x27;t help but think that there are other products out there that would do as good or a better job for less money.</li>
      <li>However, this made my skin feel fresh and new without the drying and eventual flaking</li>
      <li>Bye the way I used this whole bottle and going to go with Walmart stuff .</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>word of warning: be GENTLE when rubbing this in.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Really did like the product.  </li>
      <li>It has exfoliating crystals and you can remove too much of the outer layer of your skin if you press too</li>
      <li>Considering how much it costs, I really wish it was mind-blowing.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and was worried about trying a new product, but I had no issues.</li>
      <li>You only need a small amount and it does a great job of cleaning and exfoliating skin.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t ever had professional microdermabrasion done; this is my first attempt at using a product like this.  </li>
      <li>I actually keep mine in the shower and use it for full body use.</li>
      <li>It is a lovely scrub but it is harsh to my skin, i get breakouts every time i use it</li>
      <li>I ran into a lot of people who&#x27;d seen me a few months before and received compliment after compliment on how stunning my skin was.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
      <li>When I purchased this I thought I was buying a newly packaged of Dr Brandts microdermabrasion which came in a glass container.  </li>
      <li>Right around the holidays last year, I was very stressed and had some sort of hormonal imbalance that caused tiny bumps all over my face.</li>
      <li>The odd thing about it was that from far away, it looked normal and blemish free until you get to speaking distance from me.</li>
      <li>Not too rough - fine enough scrub to really work on your face - especially if you use it twice a week.  </li>
      <li>and I think that using this helped to clear that up.  </li>
      <li>and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
      <li>How young I looked.  </li>
      <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no issues with irritation.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin so soft and clear.</li>
      <li>I recommend getting it at Cistco for $30- much cheaper for the same product.</li>

    <li> Right around the holidays last year, I was very stressed and had some sort of hormonal imbalance that caused tiny bumps all over my face. It didn&#x27;t really look like a breakout I&#x27;ve had before, they usually were big, red, and painful. But this looked like an allergic reaction that turned into tiny blackheads on every surface of my face, resulting in my skin having the consistency of sandpaper. The odd thing about it was that from far away, it looked normal and blemish free until you get to speaking distance from me. It was really depressing... So the only solution was to look up ways to get rid of blackheads and I turned to microdermabrasion.  I have to say, Within a week or 2, I saw results. Blackheads would magically fall off when I washed my face maybe a day after the treatment. Right now, my skin is so smooth! Like I never had that sand paper face. People at work would go up to me all the time asking me what I did to it or what I used. I think I&#x27;ve convinced 2 people to try it and they have seen positive results. I do recommend getting a really good, soothing oil free moisturizer after use and SPF in the day because of course in all microdermabrasions, new skin is exposed and are more susceptible to damage from the sun. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it for cystic or severe acne, it might be too abrasive and cause more breakouts.  I know this tiny jar is a whopping $75 but, I bought this in December, use it religiously, and still have plenty left!  Sorry this review is so long but, gosh I love this product. It saved my confidence!</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my skin feel and look. Only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> My Mother suggested I try using her Dr. Brandt Microdermabrasion Exfoliating face cream, and I am certainly glad I did.  I will not use any other product for exfoliating.  My husband and I both use this product weekly, and we can both see a definite difference in our faces.    Thank you to My Mother and Dr. Brandt.</li>
    <li> My face definitely feels cleaner after using this product,but I&#x27;m not \\&quot;WOWED\\&quot; by the effects. I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. Considering how much it costs, I really wish it was mind-blowing. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> The best for oil skin, i had try different Microdermabrasion brands, this is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! I look 10 years younger :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go with out using this about 2-3 times a week. If I go without it, my skin isn&#x27;t so clear and smooth. It is the best exfoliate I have tried. Be sure to moisturize after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews and have been disappointed. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Microdermabrasion kit with cream since it came out and haven&#x27;t found anything that works better for my skin. This was nice but VERY overpriced for what you get.</li>
    <li> Many cream available in Walmart or target for 5-10 bucks does the same job like this one.&lt;br /&gt;For mental satisfaction you can buy if you have extra money. Bye the way I used this whole bottle and going to go with Walmart stuff .</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  My skin is dry and sensitive so I usually avoid scrubs and stick to chemical exfoliators.  However, this made my skin feel fresh and new without the drying and eventual flaking I get after a facial.  My skin wasn&#x27;t even red after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big disappointment came when I went to buy a full sized tube and found out that it was practically $80.  Yikes!  There&#x27;s got to be an alternative.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it...I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 9 yrs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve this product before. I really like how fine the grains are. For an exfoliant this product works very well and leave the skin smooth and polished. Very happy overall with this.</li>
    <li> Great product and came quickly!</li>
    <li> After using this product for 3 weeks I can noticeably see a difference in the appearance and size of my pores/the smoothness of my skin.  Its expensive, but I would recommend trying a bottle out.  After 2 minutes of scrubbing my skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> Pricey? Yes. But it works! My skin was fresh, clean, and glowing after using this just the first time! I&#x27;m a huge fan, and my face is so much smoother for it. I have super sensitive skin and was worried about trying a new product, but I had no issues. Definitely will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I used this from a sample at my sister&#x27;s house while visiting.  I DID use it almost every day I was there (a week), so I&#x27;m not sure if you are supposed to use it that often or not, BUT...I ran into a lot of people who&#x27;d seen me a few months before and received compliment after compliment on how stunning my skin was.  How young I looked.  How beautiful my skin looked.  It&#x27;s on my wish list because of the $78 price tag, but it will be very worth it when I finally throw that $ down for this product.  I freaking loved it.</li>
    <li> I like the product. I am disappointed because the tube was only half full at best.</li>
    <li> I got this in a subscription box and have been using it a couple of times a week.  I usually wash my face first and remove any makeup that I might have had on.  Then, with my face still wet, I apply a little of this (it doesn&#x27;t take much) and gently rub it into my skin for a couple of minutes, then splash water on my face to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some dry skin and this helped flake it off.  Also, I had recently had a breakout and I think that using this helped to clear that up.  (At any rate, red marks from the breakout seemed to fade faster when I used this.)  I haven&#x27;t ever had professional microdermabrasion done; this is my first attempt at using a product like this.  I&#x27;m really starting to like the feel of my skin after exfoliation with this, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this irritating, even though my skin is usually pretty sensitive.  It does have a smell, but the smell is fresh and clean to me.  (I won&#x27;t discuss the ingredients in detail but if you want to see them, they&#x27;re in one of the product images that&#x27;s currently posted.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning: be GENTLE when rubbing this in.  It has exfoliating crystals and you can remove too much of the outer layer of your skin if you press too hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try a couple more products of this type before I settle on one, but I do like the results I get with dr. brandt.</li>
    <li> best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used! I use it daily!</li>
    <li> This a great skin product, doesn&#x27;t irritate, makes your face feel smooth and looks younger</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff! It smells so yummy, works amazingly, especially at fighting the deeper, cystic acne I get, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. However, I found mine at The Beauty Place (online store) for $42.00, significantly less than through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t overpay for department store exfoliants.  Love the particle size and the way my skin feels after using it!  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Received a .25 ounce from Birchbox in February 2014.  Fantastic product plus smells like you&#x27;re in a lemon grove.  Skin feels refreshed and clean.  Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t cheap.  For 2 oz, $80 is a lot.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending the bank, a solid choice for skin exfoliant but you can find products of a similar ilk for half the price.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product, and I&#x27;m seriously considering purchasing it. Right after I used it, my skin looked and felt smoother, and my complexion was much more even than before. My skin looked brighter, and younger.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s super fine and I like the fresh, lightly lemony scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering at all.  I have fairly sensitive skin and have had no issues with irritation. I am left with very soft skin and little redness.</li>
    <li> It is a lovely scrub but it is harsh to my skin, i get breakouts every time i use it</li>
    <li> I got a sample in my Ipsy bag a few month ago. I had to buy it once I ran out, I love this product.  It makes my skin so soft and clear. Will repurchase :)</li>
    <li> Excellent like the other  one hundred or over skin exfoliant !</li>
    <li> I like the exfoliation properties of this product, but I wish they still made it in the jar.  It&#x27;s really hard to squeeze every last bit of the product out of this tube ...</li>
    <li> Would not buy again. Homemade microdermabrasion works better and cheaper.  Sugar, Olive oil and Baking powdered worked better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for over a year and love the feeling of my face after using.  You only need a small amount and it does a great job of cleaning and exfoliating skin.  I keep it in the shower and use it while conditioning my hair.  I only use 2-3 times a week though…not every day as my skin is somewhat sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered my second tube.  It&#x27;s the best micro dermabrasion  product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years and think that it is great. As you only need a minimum amount it lasts me about a year.</li>
    <li> Excellent exfoliator. It leaves my skin so smooth and refines my pores. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this microderm. I actually keep mine in the shower and use it for full body use. It works extremely well. Although, it may just be my skin type (regular skin), it kind of dries me out. Therefore I only use it a couple of times a month for my face. I always use it on my legs!! It really soothes and softens thick skin. I always come out feeling refreshed after using it. I&#x27;m sort of addicted and will keep it as a shower staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the bottle is tiny - but I&#x27;ve had mine for forever now and one of my friends has had hers for over two years. So the price is justified for beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> My skin felt SO soft and smooth after using this. However, I made the mistake of not doing a test patch first and about ten minutes after I washed this stuff off, my skin was bright red. The redness lasted through an afternoon and evening and was gone by the next day. My skin did look better but I&#x27;m obviously too sensitive or allergic to something in this product.</li>
    <li> Magic stuff!  Not too rough - fine enough scrub to really work on your face - especially if you use it twice a week.  Dramatic difference - only my spa staff knows for sure!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scrub/exfoliant. The texture is very fine and my skin feels incredibly soft after using it. It also smells wonderful, but I&#x27;m docking it a star because I think the price is borderline insulting. I doubt I&#x27;ll purchase it again because of the price, and because I can&#x27;t help but think that there are other products out there that would do as good or a better job for less money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. It also helps with dark spots from acne. I recommend getting it at Cistco for $30- much cheaper for the same product.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I thought I was buying a newly packaged of Dr Brandts microdermabrasion which came in a glass container.  It is not the same.  It started out thick and about 3/4 through I was getting more liquid that the abrasion particles.  It lasted much less time than the glass. I&#x27;m now trying Derma e microdermabrasion scrub, it&#x27;s closer to the original Dr. Brandts and it works better than the tube</li>
    <li> This is a good facial scrub.  I did notice smaller pores after using is several times.  It&#x27;s better than most things you can pick up at the local store, but it&#x27;s overpriced.  You can use less to make the product stretch for a longer period of time and it still works well.  I would recommend it, but for someone on a tight budget, don&#x27;t let the pricey tag fool you into thinking it&#x27;ll completely transform your skin.  It is a good product.</li>
    <li> Really did like the product.  Made my skin feel smooth and exfoliated.  Problem is the cost.  If used according to directions, it lasts only a weeks.  If money is no object, go for it.  It does work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure you could find another microdermabrasion for less money, but I want to know that I am putting a reputable brand on my face. Smells good and does exactly what it supposed to. I began using this product in 2014 and I will never switch to anything else. It is expensive, but you do not use that much at all.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products!!</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed the brandt microdermabrasion skin exfoliant.  It makes you skin feel refreshed and smooth.</li>
