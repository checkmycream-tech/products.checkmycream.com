      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great format for the perfume, which, since it&#x27;s oil based, really loves to come into contact with your skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite part of Amber oil aside from the smell of course is that there is no alcohol.</li>
      <li>But I still Love it</li>
      <li>Still smells unreal, though :-).</li>
      <li>I always get SO many compliments when I wear this</li>
      <li>So, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again, but chances are you will be pleased if you buy it.</li>
      <li>loved the first batch I bought.</li>
      <li>Smells very good but does not last.</li>
      <li>The smell is so beautiful and it last all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this since I was in high school (like 18 years ago), and love that it comes in a roll-on, for warm up scenting on the go.</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean scent!</li>
      <li>It is so unique and the scent stays with me all day.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick and I got some free samples along with it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product, originally, from a local retailer and loved it.</li>
      <li>I ordered it right away!  </li>
      <li>When I wear this I actually have strangers comment on how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>Fresh, clean, but still earthy.</li>
      <li>Some days i don&#x27;t seem to be able to get enough oil on my skin to be able to smell it.  </li>
      <li>the only thing is that the roller doesnt really dist as much oil as I want at a time, but this could also be a good thing</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find one that smelled exactly like it until now.</li>
      <li>It smells exactly as I remember it.</li>
      <li>The scent is very similar to Kuumba Made Persian Garden and Auric Blends&#x27; Love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a lovely scent, only made better by putting it on.</li>
      <li>The real deal!</li>
      <li>Glad they offer this size because I was going through the smaller size way too fast.</li>
      <li>Item came fast and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is a soft, warm amber scent, not too spicy or musky, very feminine and plays really well with female pheromones.</li>
      <li>I was introduced to this amazing little guy when I was an intern at a retail store.</li>
      <li>The shipping was extremely fast thanks to Prime.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming yet the scent lingers all day, and doesn&#x27;t ware off after an hour like some other oils.</li>
      <li>cute little bag too.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and alcohol products will break me out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I love it because no one else usually wears it and it smells divine.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know whether or not I should recommend it because I have to roll on and on and on before I can get enough oil on my skin.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way and it lasts when many other scents fade on me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t like to write bad reviews, so this one will be neutral.  I really don&#x27;t know whether or not I should recommend it because I have to roll on and on and on before I can get enough oil on my skin.  Then, and only then can I smell it.  And it does smell good indeed.  But it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  Some days i don&#x27;t seem to be able to get enough oil on my skin to be able to smell it.  So, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again, but chances are you will be pleased if you buy it.</li>
    <li> The scent was slightly weaker than It has been in the past when Ive purchased the oil from other sellers. But I still Love it</li>
    <li> this perfume is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of Amber oil aside from the smell of course is that there is no alcohol. I have very sensitive skin and alcohol products will break me out.&lt;br /&gt;This is Nemat&#x27;s most popular fragrance because is smells AWESOME! People stop me all the time to ask what fragrance I am wearing. It costs about the same online as going into WholeFoods.</li>
    <li> I always get SO many compliments when I wear this and it&#x27;s fitting because my name is Amber :D</li>
    <li> cute little bag too. great great price. the only thing is that the roller doesnt really dist as much oil as I want at a time, but this could also be a good thing</li>
    <li> The Amber White Oil is wonderful.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming yet the scent lingers all day, and doesn&#x27;t ware off after an hour like some other oils. It is a soft, warm amber scent, not too spicy or musky, very feminine and plays really well with female pheromones. When I wear this I actually have strangers comment on how good I smell.  I love it. Best reasonably-priced amber oil on the market, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since I was in high school (like 18 years ago), and love that it comes in a roll-on, for warm up scenting on the go. I keep this one in my purse. I also bought one for my friend, who loves the fragrance as well and travels all the time. It&#x27;s a great format for the perfume, which, since it&#x27;s oil based, really loves to come into contact with your skin.</li>
    <li> I had been at a restaurant and our server was wearing this...it smelled so good I had to ask her what she was wearing.  I ordered it right away!  Smells great!  Fresh and clean scent!</li>
    <li> It smells exactly as I remember it. I discover this holy scent 10 years ago and I can&#x27;t live without it. The shipping was extremely fast thanks to Prime. I just want to point out, this 10ml does not come with the red pouch as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> Item came fast and was exactly as described. Overall, I do prefer the regular bottled oil over the roll-on, as I think the scent lasts longer that way. Still smells unreal, though :-).</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this amazing little guy when I was an intern at a retail store. I could smell my boss from a mile away and her scent always lingered. I asked her what perfume she used and she showed me this amazing oil. I love it. I freaking love it! The smell is so beautiful and it last all day. It&#x27;s the best and I will keep purchasing this product over and over again. The shipping was fast. I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! Smells terrible.  People hate it.  You won&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this oil I get compliments.  Love it.  Glad they offer this size because I was going through the smaller size way too fast.</li>
    <li> I smelled this scent on someone and just had to have it. It&#x27;s such a lovely scent, only made better by putting it on. Shipping was quick and I got some free samples along with it. Defiantly will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love this scent!! My friend wears this and I had to find out what it was. Now I&#x27;m wearing it and loving it. A little goes a long way and it lasts when many other scents fade on me. Fresh, clean, but still earthy. Like another reviewer said, a paradox in a bottle. Try this!</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail scent. It is so unique and the scent stays with me all day. I love it because no one else usually wears it and it smells divine.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent! I get compliments all the time. Strangers stop me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, originally, from a local retailer and loved it. This batch that I bought doesn&#x27;t seem to be a fragrant. Might just be the batch made, rather than the product in general.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the first batch I bought. Will try again.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent for any weather.</li>
    <li> The real deal! This is my favorite scent! I&#x27;m about to order another bottle just to make sure I&#x27;m stacked up! I found it! &amp;#60;3 I couldn&#x27;t find one that smelled exactly like it until now.</li>
    <li> Smells very good but does not last. The scent is very similar to Kuumba Made Persian Garden and Auric Blends&#x27; Love.</li>
    <li> My fiancee has been looking every where for this oil for over a year and was very pleased that I found this for her</li>
