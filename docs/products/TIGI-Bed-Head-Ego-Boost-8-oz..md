      <li>it&#x27;s thicker if u want a light leave in conditioner try this</li>
      <li>The shipping took a bit longer than I am accustomed to, but it was free, so I won&#x27;t complain.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s adding strength and nourishment to my hair in addition to being fantastic smelling.</li>
      <li>Keeps it smooth and gives it some protection against humidity.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and while I have tried TGI Catwalk leave in for my hair type, this is by far the best product.</li>
      <li>I find it best used when hair is first cleaned and wet.</li>

      <li>Really clean but not overpowering neutral smell.</li>
      <li>this is a fantastic product to help with frizzy hair; keeps calm and relaxed curls.  </li>

      <li>This is the first bed head product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I was really hyped about it because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about the brand.</li>

      <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I use a couple different Bed Head products but this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I used this product sometime back and wanted to use it again because its awesome, but its expensive other places so found a great deal here</li>
      <li>I like this product but found that a deep conditioner and the Bain De Terre recovery complex serum work best for me.  </li>
      <li>This cream is thick with a pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>It does a decent job of smoothing fly aways, but I have other, cheaper products that provide the same effect.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and will frizz easily, especially with color.</li>

      <li>My hair has been bleached a lot and it needed a little bit of tender loving care.  </li>

      <li>and it makes their fur so very soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used TIGI Head Ego Boost for five plus years. Would not consider switching when the best&lt;br /&gt;works for me. It leaves my hair without tangles, soft and manageable. With summertime on the horizon&lt;br /&gt;Bed Head Ego Boost is great to use after swimming and exposure to the sun. I have recommended this product&lt;br /&gt;to my daughters and friends and they love it.</li>
    <li> Best product for dry hair. I use it everyday. I lightly spray my hair with water and then apply this. My hair looks soft and shiny, and my curls are revived. I love it!</li>
    <li> I did not like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> works awesome,  wife&#x27;s been using it for years</li>
    <li> This is similar to the shine so bright balm from lush except it&#x27;s 1000x better&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s such a good purchase and great quantity for the price!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this for curly hair and is one of the best products I have ever used in the last 30 years. It leaves hair soft, and maintains curls. I find it best used when hair is first cleaned and wet. Curls are tight but soft. My hair is fine and will frizz easily, especially with color. Using temporary color helped, but nothing gave me the soft spiral curl I now have along with an attractive wave in the layers. I was getting the product from a hairdresser but found it on Amazon for half price and am ecstatic.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. It is very moisturizing. I don&#x27;t use it as a conditioner when washing my hair but I use it when my hair is dry. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that closes up the hair shafts and keeps hair smooth. It also adds body. I have curly hair and use it when I blow my hair straight. Keeps it smooth and gives it some protection against humidity.</li>
    <li> Another product that didn&#x27;t do absolutely nothing for my hair, but just make it dryer. It also has a somewhat stickyness that it leaves on your hands.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright but nexxus pro mend works better b.c it&#x27;s thicker if u want a light leave in conditioner try this it&#x27;s watery ...</li>
    <li> I love to use it makes my hair look better i Been buying it somewhere else but here it Was chepper</li>
    <li> I like this product it makes your hair look shine and wet and it stays like that all day long. Even if your hair is getting a little tangled it is still worth it. Have ben unsting his product for years and have not found any product that works as well as this one</li>
    <li> I love this very much! It gives my hair great volume and nice texture.</li>
    <li> Great leave-in conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 years and I love it. The price was right and I&#x27;m happy with it. The shipping took a bit longer than I am accustomed to, but it was free, so I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> It has not really done much for my hair yet that I can notice in the slight. I do still use it every time I leave the shower, though, and it keeps it from being a rats next the next morning I wake up, which is great.</li>
    <li> I used this product sometime back and wanted to use it again because its awesome, but its expensive other places so found a great deal here</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and while I have tried TGI Catwalk leave in for my hair type, this is by far the best product. It really helps keep the ends conditioned.</li>
    <li> Love this goop..  Have been using it for many, many years.  Thousands of new products have been rolled out since, but nothing better has come along.</li>
    <li> I like TIGI products so its no surprise that I like this one as well. I like the smell of it and it does actually seem to be helping with my split ends.  My hair has been bleached a lot and it needed a little bit of tender loving care.  I put it in my hair before blowing drying it and always make sure to rub a little extra on to my ends. Using this in combination with a moisturizing shampoo from Bed Head have helped my hair make its way back to feeling silky and soft.</li>
    <li> This item is really great  It made hair soft and the ends aren&#x27;t dried out.  I think it did a good job.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and service.A++++</li>
    <li> Too sticky and it didn&#x27;t heal my split ends. It seems like everytime I used this my hair got greasier a lot faster than before, and there was little to no improvement on my split ends, even after using as directed for 2 months. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of sticky imo. And I haven&#x27;t noticed that it really does anything. Not sure if I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am a runner who recently grew out my hair.  I would have a huge ball of knotted hair at the end of my runs.  This product was recommended by a friend and it works just as well as she promised.  I use it daily now.</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product to help with frizzy hair; keeps calm and relaxed curls.  Great product to buy online.</li>
    <li> I love this hair styling product.  It has a good smell to it, not strong, but a clean smell.  I was unable to use mine, but I will still give it a 5 star for knowing how good it is already.  My packaging of my bottle was poorly done, and Amazon made it right with me, as they always do, should there be a problem with anything.  I do appreciate their services.  I still would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product works well on all hair types. I use it every day on wet hair and it not only hidrates it, but does not leave an conditioner aspect. Hair looks absolutely natural.</li>
    <li> I like this product but found that a deep conditioner and the Bain De Terre recovery complex serum work best for me.  I have been using this on my dogs after they get done swimming and it makes their fur so very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product I&#x27;ve used it for years and like it. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product helps with split ends. Helps keep your hair conditioned  during the harsh winters months.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on that.</li>
    <li> I just cut off 8 inches of split ends and dull hair...I used this product a while ago for about 6 months and loved it, could kick myself for stopping! My hair is fine but curly and very dry so this helps a ton! Smells good, and feels good in your hair, def doesn&#x27;t weigh it down!</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT like grape candy and the 90s. Heaven! It&#x27;s adding strength and nourishment to my hair in addition to being fantastic smelling.</li>
    <li> I bought it and my hair has gotten a lot stronger. My hair is wavy, however I always straighten it so it became very brittle in the ends and I had to cut it so often. My hair feels amazing now ! I don&#x27;t write reviews at all but I had to share this experience for other people to try this out. I hope you find this review helpful.</li>
    <li> This is the first bed head product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I was really hyped about it because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about the brand. After a couple of weeks of use my reaction to it now is...meh. It&#x27;s not bad by any means, it&#x27;s just not that great either. Maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough but I haven&#x27;t noticed any great changes in my hair after I use it. One thing that bothers me is that if I apply a little too much of it in any area of my hair it hardens the strands and gives it that unpleasant &amp;#34;80&#x27;s hairspray&amp;#34; feel. It does a decent job of smoothing fly aways, but I have other, cheaper products that provide the same effect. As for the split ends, like I said, maybe I just haven&#x27;t been using it long enough, but I still notice split ends in my hair, and though I can&#x27;t be sure (I can&#x27;t exactly count them) I don&#x27;t notice a lessening of the amount of split ends. I&#x27;m still gonna keep using it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll bother with the Ego boost again, I&#x27;ll probably try something like the After Party, which sounds a bit more interesting, and if that doesn&#x27;t impress me I&#x27;ll give up on Bed head altogether.</li>
    <li> TIGI Bed Head is the best used after washing/conditioning your hair just before drying your hair.  It helps the frizzies.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> My best friend introduced this product to me about a year ago. It&#x27;s like somebody bottled fairy magic and made a hair-rejuvenation potion out of it. It smells delicious, doesn&#x27;t make my hair gross, and the bottle has that twist-lock feature that makes it easy to travel with. I&#x27;m proud to own this product, and my friend is happy that he no longer has to share his bottle.</li>
    <li> I have fine burgundy hair that once was bleach blonde. Very little damage now. Ive tried all kinds of leave ins and never was satisfied. always wanted to try this and one day I found it at a discount store and had to get it! I apply it after I towel dry my hair. I can pack it on my hair and it never weighs my hair down or makes it greasy. It conditions my hair wonderfuly and makes brushing easy if you have tangles. Ive applied this and blowed dryed or let it air dry. Both times the results were the same, EXTREMELY soft hair! Ive never experienced stiffness like other reviews claim, and like I said ive packed it on my hair before. I have not noticed a build up either like other leave ins.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! You wont regret it :)</li>
    <li> Holds my hair nicely. Doesn&#x27;t make it oily, but does not totally get rid of my frizz.</li>
    <li> The best gel ever for maintaining shiny, bouncy curls without being sticky or greasy. It&#x27;s been my favorite for a number of years.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair from split ends</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! FIVE GOLD STAR FOR THIS PRODUCT... ...I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 18years DAILY, that&#x27;s is right, daily. I wet my hair every morning and I use it... Every night after shower and I use it.  I always order 4-6 at a time.  ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this conditioner for about  a week and I&#x27;m already in love with it! Really clean but not overpowering neutral smell. I can use a fair amount and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy or clumpy (I have thin fine hair and have always had that problem). All around very happy with this product and will buy more bed head products:)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;She&amp;#34; likes me to goober my hair so it doesn&#x27;t fly all over the place.  So sometimes I do, but just a tiny bit.  We call it &amp;#34;Something About Mary&amp;#34;.  Works fine, and she likes it more than I do.</li>
    <li> Strong and smooth hair!</li>
    <li> Great product! Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product for fine, thin, frizzy hair. No added weight. It seems to double the apparent thickness of my hair. It was originally recommended to me by a hair dresser, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.</li>
    <li> I have super coarse curly hair and this product always helps to tame the frizz.</li>
    <li> It is a good product  but dont impressed  me</li>
    <li> It does not work like the salon works but it may be how I am applying. I still would recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to tame my curls and light enough to not notice anything is applied to my hair.  This manufacturer sent quickly with good wrapping.  Everything was intact!! Thank you!  I have ordered from others before with damaged or leaking product by the time I have gotten it.</li>
    <li> This cream is thick with a pleasant smell.  I do not blow dry my hair, and I have noticed a reduction in frizz, split ends, and an increase in softness.</li>
    <li> I use a couple different Bed Head products but this one is my favorite. It isn&#x27;t greasy and leaves my hair feeling a little bit fresher than usual.</li>
    <li> I liked the product! It is exactly as described. And smells very good</li>
    <li> I love all TIGI  Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and this was not different&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dries fast and leaves my hair strong and healthy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delicous smell also</li>
