      <li>the color variety alone is worth it.</li>

      <li>This a great set to play around with color, but each is a very small sample, so it might not last very long if you find a couple of favorite colors.</li>
      <li>I figured it would be a decent way to test out some of the colors that I was going to get in hotspots for a cheaper price..</li>
      <li>Each color is pretty small, but that is fine for me since I am just experimenting.</li>
      <li>i might need a new one soon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love love love love it. it&#x27;s my favorite palette right now. i might need a new one soon. great product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice to have such a big variety of colors but I would not recommend this pallette for darker skin complexions. The pigments are not concentrated so you have to work extra hard just to get them to show up.</li>
    <li> the three stages are the best, love the colors, easy to use,you have many options to choose thank you !</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. Love the variety of colors to choose from.  I am beginning to experiment with wearing brighter colors so this is what I need to help me down that path. If you are a beginner like me then you feel like a kid in the candy store.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the largest budget for purchasing makeup so decided to purchase these so I&#x27;d have a large range of colours to spruce up my makeup routine.  I don&#x27;t exactly splurge, but these are some of the best eye shadows I&#x27;ve ever used.  Without even using an eye primer, the colours transfer well on my eyes and stay there without even creasing from morning to evening... even after I work out!  I love the range of colours - both the matte and satin finishes.</li>
    <li> I love eyeshadows and make-up, so I was thrilled to get this.  Most of the colors are very bright and highly pigmented.  Would recommend for anyone who likes to shake up their make-up.</li>
    <li> I really love the color variety these palettes offer, the pots weren&#x27;t as big as i thought they were going to be, but it is what is is. the color variety alone is worth it. Definitely need to use a primer under these eyeshadows but they are still good shadows. I love the case it comes in, keeps my palettes safe and organized.</li>
    <li> It came in the eyeshadows are a bit small so not for alot of use on each, but also 2 of the colors had broken during shipping. :(</li>
    <li> THESE ARE SMALLER THAN I EXPECTED BUT I LOVE THE PIGMENTATION .. 252 EYESHADOWS FOR THIS PRICE IS AWESOMEEEE! IVE HAD THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND IM STILL INLOVE ! &amp;#60;3 DEF RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> My sister loves her birthday gift and the makeup looks beautiful on her!! Buy It!! Buy It! Buy It! Please!</li>
    <li> i give this product five stars because it is amazing i love it it doesnt fade make up looks fresh through out the night. Reasonable price worth what you pay for and i would most defiantly recommend it to my family and friends!!!</li>
    <li> I got this because I am a beginner with makeup and wanted a color palette that would allow me to see which colors would work with my complexion. This palette was perfect. I have not even begun to use all of these colors and I know that no matter the occasion I have a color that will fit the bill. The price is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. That must mean something because she&#x27;s going to school for cosmetology</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this. The colors are nice and very pigmented. I would say that they are comparable to some of my other, pricier pallets.</li>
    <li> About almost 4 years ago I heard of Coastal Scents and I bought an 88 palette from them. I loved it. LET me tell you that lasted me to this day. I still have quite a few colors left in it as well...and some are done cause I used them a lot more the past 4 years. Sooo when I saw this pallette I knew I had to upgrade. the colors are amazing and very vibrant on your eyes. I&#x27;m a fan of coastal scents eyesshadow and i recommend this pallette!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!, IT IS FAST THE SHIPPED AND ATTENTION, THE COLOR IT IS NICE, I AM GRATEFUL, IT IS PERFECT</li>
    <li> i use it for every occasions, the colors on this resembles to may MAC products, i use it to copy many makeup artist on youtube</li>
    <li> The colors are very bright and is able to be seen. But like others have said they are very little in each color.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND GOT THIS FOR ME AS A GIFT. I LOVE IT THE SHADES ARE VERY PIGMENTED THE PALETTES ARE SMALL BUT</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s nice cute small eye shadows for every skin tone and eye shape. You people out there need to buy this now. Cheap and works so excellent</li>
    <li> The only complaint i have is that it could be a letter bigger but i love it. every color you can think of.</li>
    <li> I fell as soon a my brush touched one if the shadow that are so pigmented. Every girl needs one!</li>
    <li> I just love this palette, offers lots of colors, good storage size. I would recommend this for beginners as well, As I was one myself.</li>
    <li> To be clear, I ordered this product directly from coastal scents website, when it was at twenty nine and change. It shipped through Fed Ex and came relatively quickly in comparison with Haulerdeals, which I&#x27;m still waiting on.&lt;br /&gt; But anyway, I was super excited for it, and the color payoff is quite good for a pretty inexpensive product. The only reason I four starred is because the wells are very small, about dime sized. So there isn&#x27;t a TON of product, but for the color selection you get, it&#x27;s worth it. I figured it would be a decent way to test out some of the colors that I was going to get in hotspots for a cheaper price.. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. I did a very basic smokey eye today for work with silver on the lid and black in the corner and it blended exceptionally well into the crease, and didn&#x27;t fade by the end of the day. With a primer and white base, I had NO creasing either. I love the product and highly recommend it! :D</li>
    <li> This palette has so many colors I&#x27;m completely in love I can&#x27;t wait to get more palettes from them the only complaint I have is the shadows crumble easily when I used brushes to apply so it kinda felt like I was wasting more than I was using but u just can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> The coastal scents pallete was a great purchase! I did my homework on it and when I got it I was thrilled to see it met all expectations! The selection of colors is great but more than that the quality is wonderful as well. It&#x27;s going to last me for a long time definitely a great bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> This has to be my favorite makeup purchase that I&#x27;ve made. The pigmentation is incredible in each individual eyeshadow pot. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this is the best set of eye makeup that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye shadow palette. You can find shadows for every skin tone and eye shape. It&#x27;s not an expensible product but works excellent. The wells are small but cute. The delivery was on time. What are you waiting to buy yours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me gustó mucho esta paleta de sombras. Se pueden encontrar sombras para cada tono de piel y tipo de ojo. No es un producto costoso pero funciona excelente. Los pozos de las sombras son pequeños pero coquetos. La entrega se hizo a tiempo. Que esperas para comprar tu paleta?</li>
    <li> The great color selection was just as good in picture as in reality. This a great set to play around with color, but each is a very small sample, so it might not last very long if you find a couple of favorite colors.</li>
    <li> I love it and have so many color and want more thank u so much let me know of any new coastal awesome I just cant stop using it !!!!!!!!!!!!! anging thanks</li>
    <li> Pigmint is good, easy to travel with, don&#x27;t be affraid by the dime size palet. Willd definitly order again. Awesome</li>
    <li> This is a great product and i love the amount of colors you get however i had quiet a few colors broken when i go this in the mail, also the colors are only about the size of a dime but you dont need much the colors does go a long way. I go the product for cosmetology school and, now i am going to have to buy some cheap product because i have 7 colors broke and i cant have the falling out everywhere in class!</li>
    <li> very useful as a makeup artist and fits well in the zuca , and doesnt take a lot of space .</li>
    <li> I am definitely a beginner when it comes to trying out all kinds of different colors and combinations so this is the product for me! It has so much to choose from. Each color is pretty small, but that is fine for me since I am just experimenting. They are very saturated so you don&#x27;t need much for the color to be seen. The product came well packaged. I am very happy</li>
    <li> I love this makeup ,I love every color I will order this again and imma order more, its good makeup you would not waste your money trust me...love it...</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I don&#x27;t  wear make up everyday  so this will  product will last for a while. My order shipped fast and I loved the tracking options.</li>
    <li> Got it for someone for Christmas, and they loved it!!!!!! They like all the colors and I liked the price!</li>
    <li> Every conceivable brilliant color. Can blend and make custom colors. Stays on all day. Be using for a month and the colors are great for the older age bracket.</li>
    <li> ok, im not a big fan for eye shadows until the last 2 months, i am 38, and i try some new, make me a new look, but i don&#x27;t want to waste my money, i learn for some videos on  youtube about the make up, this women say expensive brand it doesn&#x27;t mean good product, she got some eye shadow from the dollar store and look amaizing,  if you are a begginer  try with less expensive first, soooooo i look this palette and i love it, i received today and what a surprise is really nice and beautiful colors, good  quality</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B008E78YM2 Coastal Scents 252 Ultimate Eye Shadow Palette]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ok so I haven&#x27;t ordered this product yet but the reviews look really helpful so I probably will get it. the on thing I did not see mentioned was if it was tested on animals or not. if anyone is very familiar with costal cents (sorry if I spelled that wrong) or if you are a no cruelty makeup user/artist then please comment on this ant tell me. I do not want to use a product that was tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  Christine</li>
    <li> Arrived one day after I ordered it in perfect condition. I jumped right in and did my makeup. The colors are very pigmented. The first look I did, I got a lot of compliments. This is will be great for my vacation I&#x27;m taking next month, easy to pack.</li>
    <li> In love with the pigments of the colors so far. Just used it for a photo shoot yesterday and had me and all the girl looking real model ish and stuff. I love CoastalScent products they have yet to fail me.</li>
