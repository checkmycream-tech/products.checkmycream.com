<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> How can this set be rated so high and is such poor quality?? I removed the first brush from its plastic sleeve and stroked the bristles. At least 10 fibers sprang forward and fell into my lap. I placed the brush back into its plastic sleeve and immediately requested a return / refund. Surely I cannot be the Only one this has happened to... Read between the lies, I meant lines.</li>
    <li> This is a great value set! The brushes are high quality, with soft bristles and the right amount of denseness! The bristles are not too dense that they tend to drag on the skin and blend poorly, yet not loose or floppy either. Both the flat top kabuki and the angled one work great for liquid foundations. The angled kabuki also works great for blush! Love the powder brush for applying loose powder. The eye brushes work well too. The brush holder / container is a great bonus - so convenient for traveling. I have a lot of makeup brushes, and am loving this addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing. so soft, blend like a dream. I&#x27;ve boughten some pretty terrible brushes before but these are the best ones so far</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! so soft and easy to hold. I haven&#x27;t started using them but nevertheless love them :)</li>
    <li> Great brush set!! Very soft and appears it is going to hold up through time.</li>
    <li> This brush set is wonderful! Service was great, my order came within 24 hours. This set has fewer brushes than most sets I&#x27;ve seen but the brushes it does have are of great quality and are the brushes I actually use. Because you don&#x27;t pay for a bunch of superfluous brushes the quality of the ones you get is far better than I would expect at this price point. The brushes are well made, with sturdy handles and well attached bristles; after taking them out of the packaging and shaking off a few loose hairs the bristles have remained intact over the last two weeks of daily use. The brushes are also extremely soft, which makes my morning routine a delight. The brushes are easily cleaned with warm water and a drop of shampoo. The container they come with is wonderful, simple and sleek, I keep it on my vanity. Overall definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I am so surprised to get such a great value for such a high quality product. I have used several kinds of brushes and these are up their with brushes from high end retailers. I am going to purchase more of these. Also, they got to me in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Nice high quality brush set. They are very soft and do not shed, even while washing. They maintain shape after washing too which is a huge plus. I have many different brushes ranging from $1 each to $50 each and I love finding new brushes to use. These ones were perfect. The flat kabuki is perfect for applying liquid and cream foundation. I love the angled blush brush. My absolutely favorite is the blending brush. It&#x27;s perfect for adding the precise amount of shadow to my crease. It blends perfectly. This set picks up product beautifully and doesn&#x27;t waste product like some brushes do. I also love that they come in an easy to travel with brush cup that snaps to close. It keeps all the brushes together and easy to find. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> Quality leather tube for storage and travel.  Brushes are excellent quality and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> The brushes seem like a good quality. I bought them for my 15 year-old. She seems to like them.</li>
    <li> I got this set as a Christmas gift for my sister - it arrived promptly and in perfect condition. She loved the brushes and nice carrying case. Only suggestion would be to include care instructions and description of brushes. Overall great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping submittal of this review will mean I stop being asked to provide a review. I&#x27;ve probably gotten 10 emails so far from this seller asking me to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing these and leaving them to air dry, we found the handles had cracked. We&#x27;ve returned them for a refund.</li>
    <li> I received my set not too long ago, my second lamora brush set. I was looking forward to a new face brush set, my first impression was that it is in the cutest most convenient packaging. And then I open it and I see the most beautiful pearly white brushes with very soft bristles!</li>
    <li> Third set of Lamora bushes and satisfied, yet again!  This set is perfect for my gym bag and traveling. It&#x27;s exactly all I need and I love that I don&#x27;t have to constantly move my home set around. These are silky on the skin, easy to clean and quick to dry. I have yet to have a complaint with Lamora products. Satisfaction with out drama down the road! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the quality of these brushes. Super soft!! The powder brush has become my everyday powder brush, it picks up the product well, and applies it flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I loved it. amazing set.</li>
    <li> amazing, great product! thank you!</li>
    <li> The brushes are incredibly soft and I love the thickness of the powder and blush brushes. I haven&#x27;t used the one that is flat on top to blend liquids as I usually just use some beauty balm then powder. The eye brushes work great as well. The case appears very sturdy but I have not traveled with it yet.</li>
    <li> Ate então excelentes pinceis. Já usei 3 ou 4 vezes e limpei com produtos específicos duas vezes e continuam os mesmos. São muito macios e no tamanho certo. Acreditava que o kabuki era um pouco mais durinho, mas nada que seja um problema :) ate então vale o dinheiro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far excelents brushes. I already used them 3/4 times, cleaned them twice with specific products and they still the same.Very soft and in the right size. I believed that the kabuki brush for foundations was not so soft but it is not a big deal. :) so, the price is fair.</li>
    <li> I love love love Lamora Brushes 😊 They are well made, very good quality and affordable!&lt;br /&gt;I owned all the Lamora brushes, they definitely don&#x27;t shed easy to clean so if you&#x27;re thinking about getting it you should!&lt;br /&gt;I compare these to 10 piece brush set ; these are softer and don&#x27;t have the names on the brushes.</li>
    <li> Wow!! This set has a very expensive feel to it!! The case the brushes comes in is beautiful. I love that it is big enough to contain all of my daily use brushes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the brushes state on the brush what it is ment to be used for, but because they are synthetic they can be used anyway you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was able to use all of the brushes in the kit to complete an entire makeup look making them perfect for a grab and go travel set. They are such a nice set of brushes that I could see me using them daily in my make up routine.</li>
    <li> I own just about all Lamora brushes. I own other brand like Morphe MAC Sigma and Sephora brands. I was end up reaching and using only my Lamora brushes. They are amazing great quality. They feel soft they dont absorb product. They feel soft and blend very well. If your on a budget there is you dont have to lose quality just to save. These brushes for their prices are AMAZING</li>
    <li> Exceptional quality!  Definitely going to use this for traveling! Very soft! Makes my make-up flawless! I have received so many compliments on how nice my make-up looks! Thanks Lamora for these amazing brushes.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  Best purchase I have ever made from Amazon.  I typically buy high end brushes from Estee Lauder and Chanel.  I did not want to spend alot because it was Xmas and I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on myself.  So I went with this set!  Wow.....the are soft and perfect.  I will order more for sure..</li>
    <li> They are soft and stylish. I love how if applies the make up- Sastified customer!</li>
    <li> This is the first time i  order from Amazon..and i must admitt...its not the last.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with my new brush set it&#x27;s very soft and not expensive and very high quality ..also i&#x27;m in love with the container it&#x27;s really fancy and bigger than it looks in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to order it&lt;br /&gt;I give it 10 stars :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but after opening the package they are amazingly soft!! There was no shedding and I LOVE the little storage box for them! So cute and stylish! I&#x27;m definitely excited about using them! Will update after I try them out!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift.  They loved them.</li>
    <li> ok at first these brushes are soft but then they fall apart and the hair keeps coming off. aka they suck dont buy ok</li>
    <li> 5/5 Stars Wow, I am really impressed.. fluffy soft brushes..my favorite is flat top kabuki, total game changer makes my skin looks airbrushed and flawless even when I use my cheap  Flower BB cream from Walmart (great product btw). I would totally repurchase if I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW 1/13/16: I now need to change my review to 3/5..I have washed these numerous times and even though they did not shed bristles yet some of handles have popped off due to the glue getting weak somehow. I treat my brushes gently and make sure no water gets on the handle or any area that has glue so I am not sure how this happened. They are cheap brushes and they served their purpose for a while but I decided to bite the bullet and gradually upgrade and replace them with high-end brushes even if I can only afford one at a time. No more experimenting with cheap brushes for me even though I am a broke college student.. You really get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Brushes and container are fabulous . Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Due to severe winter weather it took 2 weeks for these to arrive! (No ones fault.)  It was worth the wait. High quality naturel fibers as advertised, along with handy travel holder and a great price make this a deal you shouldn&#x27;t pass up.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes, comparable to department store ones (I have Bobbie Brown brushes and bought these for my daughter, and they are almost as good).  Wish there were indications of what each brush was for, for example Bronzer or Concealer, etc.  It&#x27;s helpful for someone who&#x27;s not very familiar.</li>
    <li> All I can say about this brush set is that when the recipient of the gift opened it, she squealed with delight at having it.  It obviously is something she will enjoy for months to come.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, they are the best I have ever used and I have been in the fashion business for more than 45 years&lt;br /&gt;LOVE them!! Renate Sieg Elwell</li>
    <li> The Mrs. LOVES these!&lt;br /&gt;Got them for her as a gift, and WOW! I have it on good authority that the blush is of particularly nice shape and quality.&lt;br /&gt;These were a GREAT hit!</li>
    <li> Really good!! Soft i loved</li>
    <li> While the bristles are nice and soft and the density is good, i do see shedding unlike what other reviews say. Also, one of the brush&#x27;s handle came loose on 2nd use! That is bad quality. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat kabuki brush when I came across this set. It was such a great deal I was skeptical. I read almost every review and everyone seemed to be positive. I decided to try it out because if I  hated them I wouldn&#x27;t be out that much money and I&#x27;m sure I could find use for them or give them away. But oh my... These were fantastic!!! I absolutely love them and they are great brushes!! They are soft, well made and I&#x27;ve used them everyday since I got them a week ago plus washed them and not a single one has shed a thing. If you are even hesitant the slightest, just buy them!! Great brushes for a great deal. Now that I like them so much I will be purchasing the bigger brush collection when I need it!</li>
    <li> The best brushes I have ever had!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality! So soft, not even Lancôme brushes are that soft. Pleased with my purchase. I will buy more from this brand.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a MAC 109, because my old 109 was shedding.  The new 109 even sheds!  So, instead of messing up my makeup removing hairs, I ordered the Lamora Beauty Brush Set.  The set is soft, not super expensive and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful!!! I have bought crappy brushes from Amazon before so I was very hesitant but I am very happy with these.</li>
    <li> To put it simply, this brush set is the best I have ever used. I own every kind of makeup brush imaginable from a various amount of makeup brands, but this one stands out amongst the masses, alone and victorious. These brushes are luxuriously soft, dense, and odorless. My makeup application has greatly facilitated itself due to these magnificent brushes, therefore giving me flawless results as my makeup is now thoroughly blended and perfected. They come in a very handy container that is made up of 2 pieces, which gives me extra storage power. For a mere 25 dollars, you will obtain the best of the best. I reccomend this set to both makeup novices and masters! You will not be disappointed. Thank you so much Lamora Beauty and congratulations on a job beautifully done!</li>
    <li> The face brushes! Even as amazing as the eye brush set! Well worth the money! Great for liquid foundations and blending...&lt;br /&gt;The angle brush worked great on my contouring!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> I was super excited for these brushes when I ordered them and they were brilliant when they first arrived. They are soft, full, and do a wonderful job. My only complaint is that the head has come dislodged from the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; portion and I am required to hold near the base so they don&#x27;t disconnect. This happened a mere three days into use. :(</li>
    <li> This makeup set works really well with my BareMinerals powder foundation and with my loose powder eye shadows as well. Definitely a good purchase!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes. Nice heavy weight, wonderful hair. Comparable to Eco and Mac brushes!</li>
    <li> First I will start with this is my first makeup brush set that I buy. I am very happy I made the decision to purchase this set. I love that even though the hairs are synthetic which for me is a bonus because it means cruelty free! they are soft and not scratchy. My makeup goes on smoothly with no streaks and my skin looks flawless! I own a makeup brush from another brand and it is a very known brand but it tends to shed and  leave hairs on my face. I am delighted that I have not had the same issue with this Lamora makeup brush set. I love the case makes it easy to keep my brushes organized plus I can easily take them with me when traveling. I am impressed with the quality and best of all I received them sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> Excellent product... super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are Amazing!! Lamora has great customer service and they are very prompt about shipping the items out and following up with you. I got them earlier than the expected date, washed the brushes that night and used them the next day. These brushes do multiple things, picks up the product very well, very soft, and very durable.  There is no fall out what so ever with these brushes when washing them or using them.  I highly recommend these brushes to anyone who is looking for a high quality makeup brushes without the really expensive price.  These brushes are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> REALLY beautiful product!</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes for the eyes. It was time for me to replace my brushes, so this was a nice alternative getting them in one set.</li>
    <li> These brushes work beautifully, the best that I have ever used. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like my brush  because my skin  feel so soft</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush set. Have used them for one week, hope they last a very long time.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loved these brushed. When I saw them I wanted to keep them. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The brushes are amazing!  They are allowing me to learn this new stippling technique so much easier.  I am glad I decided to purchase good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent. I was not expecting such quality from such inexpensive brushes,  but I guess I should not have been surprised. All of these brushes are extremely dence and soft. I really appreciated that this set included brishes for the face and for eyes, it really is a great variety.  The angled contouring brush is much thicker bristle wise than any others that I own, but I found that it made blending my powderd contour much easier. The only brush I do not 100% love is the small angled eye brush. I find that it is too thick to use with pomades or gel eyeliners to get that super percise look. The fluffy blending eye bursh works like a dream as well. It is the closest to the sigma e40 I have found so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wasted money, &amp;#34;in my day&amp;#34;, on a lot of brushes. These, however, are great brushes. Very soft! The flat headed foundation brush allows almost effortless blending by spreading a minimal amount of product for premium finish. I&#x27;ve started using the flat rounded eye brush to even out my application of pencil eyeliner and it makes a softer, defined line much better result than using my pinky. I like all the other brushed too, it&#x27;s just that the two I mentioned have made the most improvement in my finished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wash them before use, as recommended, and there wasn&#x27;t, nor has been, any shedding. I have not detected any odor from these brushes, even before I washed them.</li>
    <li> These are ok. Not that dense in my opinion these would work great for a lightweight foundation but something as thick as kat von d lock it foundation i cant see any of these brushes blending it out. They are incredibly soft. I mean super soft</li>
    <li> Not as thick as I thought they would be. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> Love!  Brushes are super soft, dense and well made.  The flat top brush blends out my foundation like a dream.  I love the dome brush for shading the crease.  I use them all!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect set! I am happy with the size and quality of these brushes!! Great for mineral makeup applications, and super soft!! I will buy again...even thinking of a few gifts now too!</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived quickly and on time. The softness of the brushes are superior to other brushes I have used. I&#x27;m able to apply my make up and it looks flawless. The bristles do not fall out which was a major problem I had with another high end brush. Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and incredible. I found them worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes!  I was at my sisters and we were doing our makeup.  She used one of these brushes on me and it felt like it was giving my face a gentle massage.  I asked where she got them from and she said Amazon so when I got home I ordered the set.  I&#x27;ve been using for a week now and they&#x27;re wonderful.</li>
    <li> The brushes were everything I thought they would be and I love using them! So soft and the bristles don&#x27;t come out.</li>
    <li> I got the lamora brush 3 days ago and I just use it today the face brushes it&#x27;s really so soft the kabuki one for foundation it&#x27;s look like airbrush finish, one of my favorite now I&#x27;m loving the brush. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes, they make putting my makeup on so much easier. I love the little holder, too.  Keeps them nice and tidy on the counter.  Love this product, for a great price, too!</li>
    <li> Great quality, super soft! Love these brushes!</li>
    <li> Very soft to the touch but does the job great!</li>
    <li> Really nice set of brushes, very soft and blends so well. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They make applying makeup so easy! I&#x27;m able to effortlessly apply my makeup with complete coverage and even application of my liquid foundation and powders. I also really enjoy the storage case they came with. It helps me keep my makeup brushes clean and my makeup station nice and tidy. I really enjoy using these brushes!</li>
    <li> Item delivered quickly as promised. They are beautiful brushes. Very soft. I love the leather case too!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> amazing brushes for the price. quality similar to high end brushes like chanel ones. these brushes are also a complete set of basic makeup. i just wished it came with net guards but for the price, there&#x27;s no complaints at all. very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are Awesome! Not only is there every brush you should need, but they come with this beautiful leather case. I use them and then put them back in the case. Keeps everything in order in my bathroom. Love these...</li>
    <li> So soft and amazing!  Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This brush set is excellent!  You have every brush you need for a flawless face every day. The brushes are so soft and they give an airbrush finish. This a perfect gift for yourself or someone special. They are perfect for travel because they come with an awesome black case to protect your brushes.</li>
    <li> GREAT brushes. I use mineral make-up and love how the brushes help me apply evenly. I watched the short tutorial on the Lamora website to see which brush was the best to use, very helpful. The carrying case is also very nice, I keep the brushes covered to keep them cleaner and plan to wash them weekly as recommended.</li>
    <li> I honestly love those brushes they are extremely soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. makeup goes on super easily when using them. i would highly recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good brush set</li>
    <li> These brushes are really good quality for such a good price. They are so soft and they blend my makeup really well. I prefer these brushes over my higher end brushes (MAC, Sephora, etc.). The case is excellent for traveling with.</li>
    <li> Gf is happy with it...</li>
    <li> Love the brushes  so much so I ordered a set for my daughter.</li>
    <li> If anyone is looking for amazing set of brushed - stop looking, this is it! I will pick up these over Sigma and Mac any day! So super soft, great quality and not too dense, perfect for blending.&lt;br /&gt; 3 smaller blending eye brushes are amazing as well, larger one fits in my crease perfectly. I don&#x27;t have huge eyes so some of the blending brushes are too large and fluffy for me. This size is perfect, does all the wonders blending yet stays put in places I need. Smaller blending brush I use to make moe detailed contour in my crease and corner, just amazing quality!!! I use them every day. I can not image not having this set, highly recommended, get it, best price ever!!! Watch YouTube reviews, amazing feedback</li>
    <li> Great product,  good price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set and could not be more pleased.  The brushes are so powdery soft that right out of the packaging I just want to keep running my hands over them! I have used each brush several times now and my makeup applies flawlessly! In order to put them to the real test I also washed them all and when they were done drying they actually still look as though I have not used them yet.  The other thing I absolutely love about these is the holder.  Since it is cylindrical and sturdy I keep my brushes in one half and my eyeliners in the other on my vanity.  The case is perfect for travel to ensure that the brushes aren&#x27;t crushed or creased in a standard makeup bag.  I definitely recommend that you buy yourself a set of these, and while you&#x27;re at it grab a set for a gift for your girlfriend, sister, mom or aunt because you will be told you that you gave her the best gift ever! I received these at a discount for purposes of personally testing the set and providing my honest opinion of the brushes.</li>
    <li> My friend is the one who told me about Lamora Brush products, she has bother the eye brushes and the 10 piece face brushes, so I decided to give it a try too. And I am so happy I did! These brushes are so soft! Usually with certain brushes when you rub them on your face, they prick you, but not these. There are superb. they make my makeup look flawless! They are also very sturdy, I had bought a previous brush set on amazon and the brushes were very wobbley. Also these brushes come in the container that is shown so you can&#x27;t misplace them or even get them dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am VERY satisfied with my purchase and I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!! They are great!!!! Perfect set of must have brushes for a good price and quality.</li>
    <li> These were some of the most amazing makeup brushes I&amp;#34;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve never felt such soft brushes. They apply beautifully! I love the sturdy, handy case they came in as well. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and love Lamora Beauty. The brand strives to make sure their customers have quality, effective products.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft and they look so professional. I also love the case that they come in. It makes them easy to travel with. I also love being able to display them in the case on my vanity. These are very nice. I&#x27;m happy that I got them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by the quality of these brushes.  They are super soft, have virtually no fall out after washing and are fluffy and smooth on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that they are extremely versatile and that there&#x27;s a nice variety of brushes with this set.  You have several options with this set and it would really make a great starter set for someone just getting used to using different brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the blush brush!  It really works well and is pretty precise when using.  The shadow brushes are also great for applying eyeshadow.  I also like that the holder is a dark black, I have similar holders but they are white and tend to grab any nearby dirt / dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a really nice set for the beauty / brush addict.  They compare with similar higher end brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Received a Intro Discount</li>
    <li> The brush set arrived quickly and for the low price I was not sure what to expect. To my surprise the brushes were of very good quality and comparable to much more expensive brushes I have previously purchased. My belief that cost and name brand were important has now been quashed. Really glad I got these and would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! So smooth and feel like they&#x27;re high quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, I have tried many diff brands at all price ranges. These far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> What can I say, this is my second set of lamora brushes and I love them. They blend so well and don&#x27;t shed at all!! The softest brushes I have ever had. I loved  the white color of brushes and the container they come in is very handy. The only suggestion I would give is to label these brushes like the 10 piece set are labeled.</li>
    <li> I received my set promptly and was so pleased as to how soft the bristles where and no shedding. The brushes apply my make up effortlessly..</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome. It&#x27;s only been a few days but I have quickly fallen in love with them (so hopefully they hold up!!!). The foundation brush works perfectly. I am a beginner at applying foundation using a brush (I&#x27;ve used my hands to apply for years) and I had no trouble at all with this brush. I have experienced some very minimal shedding, but that&#x27;s normal. The powder brush and the blush brush are great as well, and nice and soft. I&#x27;ve only used the largest of eye brushes so I can&#x27;t comment much on them, but I can tell you that this set is worth every penny. Love love love!</li>
    <li> Great brushes !!! Super soft !!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good set of brushes and glad I found this one.  They&#x27;re super soft and I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out yet. They come in a really nice case that you can seal up and put away, or leave on your counter. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and am grateful for the chance to try these out.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant.  I&#x27;m an established make up artist who has worked on Film and TV and these brushes are LOVELY.  Soft and delicious and the case is durable and super useful.  No weird smells, no shedding - just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I was planning on getting one of those Makeup Forever brush pouches which was $31 (without any brushes) and was so happy to find this.  What a steal!  Super happy with my purchase I&#x27;ll probably get more of these brushes (and cases too)</li>
    <li> Every single one of these brushes has become loose and whatever holds the metal and wood together no longer holds. They have become two pieces. Useless. And I hope I hear back from someone about this bc I did a lot of research before buying these and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that after 3 months of use they have become useless.</li>
    <li> The brushes are better than I expected.  I will be using this for travel.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft...they don&#x27;t shed even after multiple wash...very easy to work with...and for the price...they are comparable to any high end brand...great job lamora...will definitely repurchase again...</li>
    <li> Really great brushes for a really great price.</li>
    <li> Love them! The brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t make the makeup look so fake it really helps blend the makeup. LOVE THEM, and are my everyday makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are SO GREAT. Perfect dupes for Sigma or Mac brushes. Little to no shedding, even on the first few times using them. Super SUPER soft bristles. Applies makeup (both liquid, powder, and mineral) way better than I ever expected. And the on-the-go carrier is really cute. Definitely buy these if you&#x27;re looking for Sigmas but not the Sigma price tag :P</li>
    <li> Once again, Lamora Beauty comes through. I love these brushes so much, I&#x27;ve given away all of my other brands. I was looking forward to purchasing Sigma and Mac brushes before. Then I saw a review of the Lamora Beauty brushes, and I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since. My makeup applies flawlessly. No shedding! And the packaging is wonderful!! My only Con: the white handle brushes do not have the brush type listed like the black handle brushes do. However, I was able to obtain the description of the brushes from the Amazon posting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Your set will include: Powder Brush, Flat Top Kabuki Brush, Blush Brush, Angled Detailer Brush, Blending Brush, Small Eyeshadow Brush along with an elegant brush cup holder.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what level of makeup you are at, from novice to expert MUA, you should definitely consider Lamora Beauty brushes for your makeup kit! And check out their website at lamorabeauty.com for more information!</li>
    <li> The softest brushes I have ever used. They don&#x27;t shed. They are great!</li>
    <li> Great product just as the other brushes they have! The case is very convenient for traveling and it&#x27;s precisely the brushes that are mainly used. The only difference that I notice from my other brushes is that the brushes don&#x27;t have the label name for each one. Would be great if they did. Other than that it&#x27;s the same outstanding quality.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes today and they are super soft. In my opinion they are great for powders because they are not dense enough for liquids. I like that the handles are big, so that makes them easy to grip. I look forward to testing them soon!</li>
    <li> What a nice Brush set!!!&lt;br /&gt;Today is my lucky day.... This brush set is so soft and feels really good and good quality brushes , also case is so cute and can carry to travel , good for make up counter,, good for draw... You name it!!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy for this brush set!&lt;br /&gt;Also it is use gor face and eye!!! What else we need more???</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! Great buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just an everyday girl trying to get better at doing her make-up, so no professional review here. These brushes are amazing so far, though. I&#x27;ve used crap drugstore brushes to BareMinerals brushes to Sephora professionals brushes, and these are great quality, soft  bristles that feel great on my face and apply make-up evenly and easily (and the bristles are not breaking at the tips like how my BareMinerals brushes did). Would buy more of these brushes, but I already have all the other kinds I need!</li>
    <li> Brushes work great.  Incredibly soft.  Make up goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful,love them....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love all of Lamora&#x27;s brushes. They&#x27;re all really soft and dense, making it easy to pick up products and easy to blend with them. Fallout is minimal as well. I love that this set is perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> Omg! I love this product. Both the box the brush. I will definitely buy one more and keep incase I don&#x27;t find it again. The color too looks cute. I will highly recommend it. So happy with this purchase and it came on time.</li>
    <li> Love the brush set, they are so soft and the application is great!  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very efficient for applying loose makeup and blush.  They feel nice on my face.</li>
    <li> Great brush set at a great value</li>
    <li> As soon as I recived these brushes I tried them out and I am very impressed! There isn&#x27;t fall out from the bristles on any of the brushes, they are super plush they feel like high quality brushes. Makeup applies like a dream, so far I really do love these brushes. On Amazon many times the description of an item doesn&#x27;t match the item itself when it arrives on my door step which is annoying but that isn&#x27;t the case with these particular brushes. Each brush works amazingly and as for the price ... it&#x27;s a great deal! If you&#x27;re thinking of trying these out you should.</li>
    <li> Love this set! Great for a beginner or for travel. :)</li>
    <li> I have been looking at a lot of different brands for a good quality brush set. Lamora brushes are the one. They are very soft on the skin, durable, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is seriously one of the BEST brush sets I have EVER used. I wanted to wait a week or so after I got them to tell you an honest review after using them more than just once. I can honestly say that after more than 1 week of usage, I have NO fall out. The brushes are so soft, and so effective. My makeup has never applied to smoothly and effortlessly. I am probably the biggest fan of Lamora Beauty and want to make sure everyone knows how extremely good quality and effective these brushes really are. It&#x27;s hard to impress me with beauty products, and I am overly impressed with this set.</li>
    <li> This will be my Lamora travel set....&lt;br /&gt;I love these brushes. They are so soft and stylish...&lt;br /&gt;And the case is so jazzy I will be so proud to pull this out and use it anywhere&lt;br /&gt;And the brushes are Awesome. I&#x27;m gonna order to more for my coworkers for Christmas gifts!&lt;br /&gt;Ladies don&#x27;t wait a second more get yours before they all run out!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and the eyeliner one is exactly what  was looking for.  I have bought at lease 5 to replace my old one and none were exactly what I was looking for until I ordered these.  I also ordered an eye brush kit which I also love and has the same eyeliner brush - only in black - so now I have two to last me.  Very happy after searching for at least a year!</li>
    <li> These are very soft brushes. There were a few uneven bristles that were easily trimmed with scissors. I&#x27;ve noticed no shed bristles so far. When washing, use way less soap than you might for other brushes - they get very sudsy.</li>
    <li> This brush set just arrived........... amazing! Packed in a beautiful black leather box holder with the white brush holder somehow remind me to the classic 60s. Gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;The brush hair is very soft and convenient to the skin. Now the brushes smell little bit due to the packaging, will let it air flow for a few day. Now can&#x27;t wait to use them. So excited!</li>
    <li> So amazed by Lamora and their brushes!! They are super soft, durable, don&#x27;t shed, work great for blending and applying makeup. They are my go to brush and this set is no difference. I would highly recommend to anyone!! Fantastic brush set for an amazing price!</li>
    <li> As expected, this is another great Lamora product!! High quality and sturdy case for an affordable price!! I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with them :D At first I was thinking on giving them as a gift but I will keep them and buy anothe brush set :) If you have any doubt on purchasing them think about this is a really good product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this brush set!  The softness of the face brushes places my makeup flawlessly on my face quickly and easily, especially in areas around my nose.  The firmness of the Kabuki brush helps me with the areas that need specific attention.  The different sizes, angles and detailing capabilities give you all the tools you find necessary for a quick morning to get your day going!  I absolutely love the container these brushes came in.  I place the Face brushes on one half and the Eye brushes on the other for easy usage.  When I need to travel, I just close the case up and pack it in my suit case for easy and safe traveling.  I would recommend this brush set as a very nice gift for anyone.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this brushes set. They are very soft and bueatiful.</li>
    <li> A good brush set for the money.</li>
    <li> In love in love in love..........super soft brushes the  hairs do not fall off......the brush case a super plus.......i just cant go anywhere without them......by far best brushes ever purchased!!</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied. Exactly as described. Will definitely be purchasing others</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these Brushes. I am a beginner makeup user and I just love how these brushes blend my makeup perfectly. Also, they are very soft and gentle on my skin; which is important to me because Ive very sensitive skin. Love the fact that they are easy to clean and DONT lose the fabric. I have been used them for a week now and I am ready to get few more! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes seem like very good quality for the price.  They are extremely soft, well made and the case was nicer then expected based on the picture.</li>
    <li> good quality product. inexpensive. work great.</li>
    <li> I love this kit!!! The holder is the perfect size for keeping the brushes on my counter or traveling. The brushes are absolutely the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt. I LOVE the angled kabuki for blending out bronzer or blush and the domed brush for setting my foundation with powder. This brushes are different from their other set of kabuki brushes - they move more and aren&#x27;t as densely packed so in my opinion they&#x27;re more suitable for powder makeup rather than liquid unless you want a very sheer foundation application. This kit is everything you need in a beginners set! You won&#x27;t regret purchasing even if you just want extra brushes!</li>
    <li> I love this lamora brushes they are really good....</li>
    <li> This 6 piece set of brushes is a great product for someone that wants just enough brushes to have a basic everyday look or for someone that is new to makeup. I purchased the 10 piece brush set by lamora for my best friend that loves to do her makeup. She has not stopped raving about what a great gift it was. Since we travel a lot the black case it comes with it is AMAZING! It ensures that our brushes are not ruined when traveling. I have already cleaned my brushes several times and they do not shed and they kept their shape. My only comment which is not a negative one is that when you first get them they will have a brand new smell but when you clean them its not really an issue. I will definitely continue to buy Lamora products. The price and quality are right! You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply amazing. Airbrush finish.</li>
    <li> The brush is soft and nice. I received the Lamora Beauty really quick. It is worth the money to buy these brushes. Good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, need to learn how to use</li>
    <li> These were a gift for our newly teenage Granddaughter. last Christmas!  They are very good quality and the case keeps them organized, clean and ready for travel.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!  So soft! Seriously, so so soft.  I did like they suggested and washed the brushes right away after receiving and even during the rinsing and squeezing the water out, none of the fibers came out at all.  Lamora really made a well constructed brush.  They go on feather lite and there is no scratchy feeling like you get with some other brushes.  Honestly it feels like a pillow on your face. Also, the travel cup that comes with this set is top quality.  It is PERFECT because I hate digging in a bag looking for the brush I want.  This stays upright holding all your brushes and when I travel (which I do for a living) I put the lid on and toss it in my suitcase. They did not skimp on quality where any of this set is concerned.  I like that all the essential brushes you really need come in this set. Loose powder/blush/bronzer or finishing powder and the eye brushes with a shader, blender and detailer. These brushes are not labeled but I bought the set of 7 Eye Brushes by Lamora (in addition to this set) and THOSE were labeled, however at this point in my makeup life I know which brush I use for each thing so I didn&#x27;t need that really. All of the brushes I purchased including the 7piece set by Lamora are amazing.  This particular set is worth far more than they are charging. (Around $35 at the time of this review) You can&#x27;t even get 2 single top quality brushes for that price with other brands.  I did a ton of research and reading of reviews before deciding on this set.  I wanted a set with the MOST ESSENTIAL brushes AND I wanted that travel cup. After all the research I kept coming back to these, because for the price and quality you cannot beat this set.  Don&#x27;t even waste your time.  Just buy this set now.  You will not be sorry! *Note, I am a professional entertainer by trade (singer) and I always wear makeup! I have used cheap to very pricey brushes in my life and I promise you, these are top of the line!</li>
    <li> Love them very soft ...used it everyday .</li>
    <li> I really wanted sigma brushes, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend that much money for brushes I&#x27;ll only use once or twice a week. So I spent weeks researching the perfect sigma dupe. Lamora was no doubt the best choice and their customer service seems to be incredible. The brushes are so amazing I&#x27;ve decided to order the eye shadow brushes too.</li>
    <li> One of the BEST sets of brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I was thrilled when I found out I had the oppertunity to try these brushes at a special intro price. I honestly would&#x27;ve been happy to purchase these anyway because of the amazing quality. they are insanely soft, bristles stay firmly in place time after time, and The case they come with just makes these all the more worth the purchase! I even have room for more brushes or other cosmetic pieces in this case! The small tools have perfect precision and makes a makeup novice goober like me look like i actually know what Im doing! lol</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the brushes!! I was a little skeptical when I ordered them because they were so nicely priced, but they are amazing. My makeup goes on so nicely and no hairs left on my face. I highly recommend these brushes to anyone and would definitely order them again. They came packaged in a great carry case and we&#x27;re delivered on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore my brushes. They are soft and dense, but not so dense that they are hard to wash. They apply makeup seamlessly and have an overall luxury feel. I highly recommend these brushes to anyone looking for quality brushes without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, I love the flat kabuki brush for my foundation application.</li>
    <li> Super soft brush set! Really nice quality! No strays, no shedding. Comes in a really nice embossed case. I love brush sets that come in a stand up case instead of the fold up sleeves. It just makes them so much more convenient. These allowed for flawless application. I recommend. *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> I love the quality of this set - and the incredible customer service that accompanied it.  As a busy mom who likes to travel, having the carrying case is a total bonus, as well.  VERY excited to have these brushes in my collection.</li>
    <li> This set is great! The brushes are soft and do a wonderful job ... I can never go back to sephora for brushes again! Arrived fast, beautiful brushes with a very nice case. These would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> This 6 piece brush set is beautiful and well made!  I washed the brushes as soon as I received them and have used the angled brush and powder brushes over and over with ZERO shedding - I hate shedding, so this is a big deal for me.  My bronzer, blushes and face powder go on evenly. The brushes do a great job of applying product just right.  My skin and make-up looks flattering and flawless.  I have not used the smaller brushes because I only wear eye make-up once or twice a year and I typically just slap lip balm on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Great value!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazingly soft...love love them</li>
    <li> I liked the brush set I got for myself that I bought another set for my cousin for Christmas - I think she&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
    <li> These are the softest brushes! And the case is wonderful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a five because I have all the Beauty Brushes from Lamora. I just got out of the hospital from back surgery therefore I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this set. But as soon as I do I will come back and leave my full review on this particular set. I&#x27;m sure it will still be a five star because I just love the other Lamar brushes that I have. I have now had a chance to try my new Lamora Brush set. It is just as I expected with my first purchase of my Lamora brushes. They are very elegant and oh so very soft. I use the round flat top to apply my foundation powder and it goes on so smoothly never leaving any streaks or uneven powder. The angled blush brush is also a fabulous brush as is the beautiful soft and fluffy powder brush, they just feel so good on your skin. I now have all of the Lamora makeup brushes and am extremely pleased with everyone of them. This is the best set of brushes I have ever had and would definitely recommend them to anyone from a beginner to a professional. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. They&#x27;re just GREAT!</li>
    <li> I looked for weeks before buying these I am very impressed with the quality Thanks Amazon you Rock!!</li>
    <li> Very nice!  Soft bristles.  Non-irritating to my skin.  Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these...thank you</li>
    <li> Soft and worth the price.</li>
    <li> I really liked the brushes, however I already had to glue one back together. It fell apart the first time I used it.  The brushes are soft though and I have liked them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say first that I really like the brushes. Since using Lamora brushes, I&#x27;ve received compliments that \\&quot;I&#x27;m glowing\\&quot;, or \\&quot;there&#x27;s something different about you that I can&#x27;t put my finger on, but you look nice...\\&quot;. Perhaps you can understand my utter disappointment when I received this set &amp; washed for the first time before use; the large round brush completely dismounted from the handle! So I&#x27;ve been forced to substitute this brush with the black handled round brush, which IMO is not as large or dense as the essential one. For the price (although deeply discounted), shouldn&#x27;t one expect ALL of the items to be of good quality &amp; value? My heart breaks every time I look at the incomplete essential set. I read another buyer had this problem &amp; glued her brush back together. But since I am extremely sensitive to chemicals &amp; even chemical smells, this is not even an option for me. Very disappointed...  ***UPDATE***  Within one of week of receiving my order &amp; posting review, I was contacted by a customer service rep advising me a complete replacement was sent out. I have since received my replacement order &amp; am more than pleased. More than before, I love this product. I am thoroughly satisfied with my experience with this company.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really soft and I haven&#x27;t experience any shedding. Great quailty brushes for a reasonable price!!</li>
    <li> Great price, great product! Very good quality! So glad that I bought them!</li>
    <li> honestly these brushes have really held up more than what I thought the first week one of the handles came a little bit loose and I emailed the company and the immediately sent me on a brand new set great customer service and I really love these brushes they compare to the higher end ones that I bought in the past if not even better</li>
    <li> High quality brushes for a fantastic price. The case is convenient because I am always on the go and I can throw it easily in any of my bags! It&#x27;s also a perfect set for regular daily make up application. Has every type of brush you&#x27;d need.</li>
    <li> Well I am no professional but these brushes are great. I have had them for like two weeks now and have already washed them and used them several times, and they have kept their shape and are very very soft and pleasant to the skin. Also the handles are nice and thick so they are easy to hold. If I had to say something bad, I would only say that I wish their liner brush was actually not too soft because I think a harder brush is better to do liner, but thats just personal preference, and regardless I like it to fill in my eyebrows. Also it would be nice if they added an additional thicker rounded brush for shadow, but regardless this set is great and I highly recommend it. As far as the case, it is very nice looking and great to use on the go. I would, however, prefer if it actually opened like a book rather than having to attach it because sometimes I worry the bristles on the brush can pull back. If you put the brush side in first its fine but its just a suggestion for future products.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Packaged really well. The brushes are amazing quality. VERY SOFT. They are dense enough, but not too dense like the sigma brushes which makes it WAY easier to clean. Will repurchase more from this seller :)</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set a few months ago and they still work great. I do not regret buying them. I actually have a sephora brush that cost me as much as this brush set, one brush, and I use that brush hardly ever after having used the Lemora Brush set.  My previous review below👇 They work great and were really affordable. I love the angled blush brush. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I do like the brushes they are very soft.  I bought this set Dec 2014.  I was disappointed this morning when I was using them and the large face brush came unglued breaking loose where the white and metal parts meet on the handle.  I can easily glue it back but I feel this is a quality problem.  Time will tell if I do order more of this product?  It&#x27;s only been a month.  The case is really nice.  They wash very well.  Best to keep them clean as they seem to hold the makeup after sometime.  They don&#x27;t shed, but I notice they are fuller with some outer bristles that don&#x27;t stay tightly uniformed like new since washing.  I do like the brushes I almost wish they were just a little stiffer.  But they do the job and they feel really &amp;#34;nice and soft&amp;#34;.  If..the price stays affordable, then I feel they are worth it.</li>
    <li> I have had these for a couple of weeks now and have used them several times. I LOVE them and have worked wonderfully so far. The only thing I haven&#x27;t done yet is clean them (they&#x27;ve only been used 3x) so I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on their amazingness!</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE Lamora&#x27;s brushes. I have another set from them I seriously can&#x27;t live without so when I saw these I snatched them up! They are amazing quality brushes at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and the price point is excellent for the quality for these brushes so if someone is looking for a high-end quality brush set for the low then this one is it!</li>
    <li> The set was of good quality and the case was large enough for full brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft and good quality..i would appreciate the powder brush to be bigger...other than that i like this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice feeling brushes. Soft and Do not shed. Cup is nice also, firm and  built to last.&lt;br /&gt;The brush set is great for beginners and experts. They offer everything you need to do an entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The three face brushes work well with foundation and blush. The eye brushes are a nice size for an every day eye look.&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be my travel go to brushes.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush set.  They are very soft and feel good on my skin.</li>
    <li> He&#x27;s worked pretty well for a fordable brushes.  To this day I still use the brushes for everything and I have cleaned them multiple times.  I tell all my friends to buy them!</li>
    <li> This is a great little set of brushes and just the perfect ones for daily use.  They washed easily, dried very fast and are soft and thick on your skin.  I especially like two of the eye brushes, which pickup and distribute your makeup without a lot of waste.  I have at least 40 brushes and these standup in quality to any of them.  I still prefer my other angled blush brush, but these brushes are great and I would recommend to anyone.  Comes in a nice size brush holder that is compact enough for travel.</li>
    <li> so soft! great quality on the brushes and case.</li>
    <li> The brushes have been really great. Soft enough to feel nice on your skin, while still firm enough to get the job done effectively. I haven&#x27;t used the case to travel yet but I love that it came with it and for now, I use both ends as cups for the brushes as well as my eyeliner, primer, cheek stain and lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I mainly got this for the case. I love having a cylinder brush case and my old one wore out on me after 6 years! So, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the brushes as well as the sturdiness of the case! The brushes are incredibly soft and apply make up almost like an air brush. I really love them and would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> Absolutely brush set. My former &amp;#34;high end &amp;#34; brush set felt like I  was applying my makeup with a wispy pumice stone. NOW my routine is shorter, my face looks flawless, my skin feels happier, and (most of all) I didn&#x27;t have to buy a more expensive product just to get an airbrushed high definition face.&lt;br /&gt;Look, if you&#x27;re still reading reviews because you&#x27;re unsure, let me help you decide. Order the brushes...fall in love with the brushes AND the black leather double caddy, keep the set, brag to your friends, and thank me later. OR get the set, try them out, decide you&#x27;d rather pay 4x the price for half the quality (but an elite name), notify Amazon of your meh makeup experience and they&#x27;ll refund you your hard earned cash that you may now spend at the triple letter- basic black beauty brand behemoth. Either way...you&#x27;re happy.</li>
    <li> High quality brushes! Love them!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never leave a review before but these brushes deserved it. They&#x27;re very soft brushes, they passed the washing  test they didn&#x27;t shed they look like the expensive ones highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These brushes are by far the best ones I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon. They look classy and the bristles are very soft. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for affordable good quality brushes. I washed them before the first use and they did not shed bristles. I keep them in the brush cup holder they came in to keep dust from falling into them.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of Lamora brushes in the future.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these brushes! They are so soft! High end brushes quality without going broke! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality product!&lt;br /&gt;Especially, someone who are allergic to real hair.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are so soft yet have enough power to hold foundation and powder.&lt;br /&gt;The black case is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> They are ok..brushes looked nicer online..</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b85146c2614c8a70d9df6eb71bca7e05]]These makeup brushes are extremely soft to touch For a moment I had to check the package to see if they were human hair makeup brushes. When I removed the brushes from their holder and plastic sheets there were no stray brush hairs. I also rand my fingers through the brushes several times to check for loose attachment to the base of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the brushes are the headliners then the travel case that also doubles as a cup holder is the opening act. The case looks like fine leather and has snap closure on either side in order to secure the brushes. This only increases the quality of the overall product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is vegan friendly and cruelty free. It also comes with a money back guarantee which tells me the company really believes in the product--as they should. These are really great brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent for purposes of review</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft and they look so professional. I also love the case that they come in. It makes them easy to travel with. I also love being able to display them in the case on my vanity. These are very nice. I&#x27;m happy that I got them</li>
    <li> I loved them. They were so soft and got here so fast. The case is very convenient. Even my boyfriend was playing with them on his face haha</li>
    <li> These are so soft and I love them! They work amazingly!</li>
    <li> I purchase a foundation brush for about the same price as this entire set of brushes. The quality is very similar and I have been very happy with these brushes. There has been absolutely no shedding and they are very soft and apply very evenly.</li>
    <li> I own high end and low end brushes these are the best so far. Got them last week, used them twice and I absolutely love them. Such a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I received this product for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This 6 piece brush set feels like the high end brushes without the high end price.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are dense but super soft.&lt;br /&gt;They apply makeup flawlessly and they pack on the colors wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;The white handles are long and the logo Lamora is etched on each brush handle.&lt;br /&gt;I experienced no shedding with these and no scratchy feel either.&lt;br /&gt;This set has all you need to create a beautiful makeup look regardless if you are using liquid or powders because these brushes can be used with these types of formulations.&lt;br /&gt;I used the flat top kabuki face brush for my liquid BB Cream and stippled it on my face, then I used a liquid concealer with the same brush.&lt;br /&gt;For my mineral powder foundation I used the bigger fluffy face brush.&lt;br /&gt;For my cheeks I used the blush face brush and then used the same brush for my highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;Now when I used the shadow brush included, I noticed it was not a big brush but a small one that can also be used for detailing but it worked well packing applying the color on my lids.&lt;br /&gt;The fluffy blending brush was soft and it did a nice job of blending and for adding my browbone color.&lt;br /&gt;The liner brush in this set can also be used for the brows but I chose to use it for my purple liner and the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this set and happy that it comes with a carrying case for storage or travel. I definitely give the Lamora Beauty 5 Stars. Here are some pictures below...</li>
    <li> these brushes are as lush as 300.00 brushes,and no shedding!</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom and after she opened I had to check them out for myself. Soft bristles, nice and full. I have a sigma set but am looking at adding other brushes so for the price and quality, I&#x27;m definitely order a set for myself.</li>
    <li> Soft and makes my makeup go on effortlessly!</li>
    <li> Just as nice as the 10 piece set I purchased--soft, high quality bristles that distribute make up evenly.  I do wish they were labled like my other set.  Other than that, they are perfect!</li>
    <li> The brushes are awesome! They blend amazingly. They are soft and pick up lots of colors! They look nice and are a great collection to have!! They are a must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> The brush set has all the essential brushes needed to apply foundation, blush, blending, and three brushes to apply eye shadow to the crease, lids and blending. They are very soft and application of makeup is smooth. Cleaning the brushes with warm water and a bit of soap works well. They are light weight. The case is a big plus for traveling and/or storage. The case provides protection when brushes aren&#x27;t being used. For a beginner, a description of what brush should be used for what application would be helpful.  I would recommend this set</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a brush set with both face and eye brushes in one.  With this set, you can do most basic makeup looks.  It would be ideal for traveling so that you only have to carry a few brushes with you and the hard case will keep them protected.  There is also room to add additional brushes in the case if desired.  The bristles of these brushes are super soft with the exception of the flat eyeshadow brush, which you would want to be harder anyway so that you can pack shadow onto the lid.  This set would definitely make a great, very affordable holiday gift!</li>
    <li> They are really soft but the brushes are way to firm &amp; the bristles are not dense but flimsy, unlike a Kabuki Flat top brush should be. I finally went and purchased some where I could feel the texture. I would have liked to have returned them but they come from the US and I live in Egypt. More and above when i opened the package I found that the head is not attached with the brush holder. I am really disappointed :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I work as a makeup artist for movies and let me tell you. Lamora has to be the best brand of makeup brushes I have ever used. That is right ladies, M.A.C has another thing coming! Not only are these brushes incredibly soft but they hold up like a champ. I will give you a small example of what I put my makeup brushes through. I have to powdered and apply makeup to 15 extras that are waiting on set. So I whip out my lamora large round powder brush and go to work. There is NO shedding, pulling, or scratchy bristles. I put these to the test, since I had so many people to powder the brushes needed to be cleaned and ASAP. The fibers hold up extremely well with loose powder, packed powder and everything inbetween.Person after person they got glammed up for their close up and was so happy to have this set with me. You can try the others like Sigma, M.A.C or even  Makeup for ever brushes but you are only paying for the name. These are top notch and I recommend this for anyone who is wanting to pump up their kit and not have to spend a wild amount of money to do so.</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW!  The brushes are fabulous.  They are extremely soft, do not shed at all, and pick up a good amount of product, and apply it evenly.  I am now a customer for life.  Thank you and your team for such a wonderful, quality line of brushes, at such an affordable price point.  If I could give these a 10 star rating, I would do it!</li>
    <li> NO good look at reviews carefully</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my brothers girlfriend for Christmas. She is very happy! I then received an offer from the company to try the flat kabuki brush, and I have to say that I am in love! I have only ever used the flat (paintbrush) kind of foundation brush in the past, but this little kabuki brush is amazing! My makeup goes on quickly and evenly, and I don&#x27;t feel like my arm is going to fall off trying to blend it all in. As this is the first brush like this Inhave used I can&#x27;t really compare it to other kabuki brushes, but as far as other foundation brushes, I can honestly say that I will never go back! Lamora has an amazing product! Plus the value you get makes this a no-brainer! Try this! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Nice brush set.  Fast shipping. No problems.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the 6 pieces makeup brush set, the quality is very good; some brushes are nice and  soft and others firm according to what you need them for. I love the nice case too, a little big for traveling, but perfect on top of my dresser to keep the brushes ready for use or dry after I clean them.</li>
    <li> Works awesome, they are soft and they clean well.</li>
    <li> Very decent set for the price.</li>
