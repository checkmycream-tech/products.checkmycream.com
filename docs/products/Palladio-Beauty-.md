### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Would be an excellent primer for those without oily skin.</li>
      <li>This was the best price I found for this primer and believe me</li>
      <li>and it makes for a flawless finish.</li>
      <li>I found this primer to be wonderful for my face.  </li>
      <li>, it is not the best primer I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that perfect airbrushed look, because I don&#x27;t have perfect skin ..</li>
      <li>This product leaves my skin feeling like silk, anchors my foundation perfectly all day, and a pea-sized amount works wonders on aging skin to fill in lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Lol!</li>
      <li>This best purchase.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>I foundation looks flawless with it.</li>

      <li>Great buy.</li>
      <li>But still a great primer</li>
      <li>Wears great over moisturizer and under foundation.</li>
      <li>Finally, I&#x27;ve found that the primers containing silica prepare the skin the very best for any foundation, which this one does perfectly, keeping the foundation perfect all day.</li>

      <li>and I would recommend you using it with and good moisturizer for your skin type.</li>

      <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
      <li>I love love love this primer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It reminds me a lot of the smashbox primers, but I like this one better.</li>
      <li>I also like knowing that it&#x27;s way better for my skin than all the others.</li>
      <li>But I do believe this primer has helped me achieved the best, possible look out of my foundation,</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Is great i use it everytime i wear makeup and my skin turn soft.</li>
      <li>Still haven&#x27;t found a good one that&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>No color, easy to apply and use under foundation.</li>
      <li>Great product, my favorite primer and the price is terrific.</li>
      <li>Does the job fine, feels a bit greasy, and it could just be my skin, but I broke out a lot</li>
      <li>It makes so much of a huge difference with my fondation.</li>
      <li>Did not irritate my acne-prone skin at all, which is huge.  </li>
      <li>Almost powdery smooth.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly light and works well</li>
      <li>on smooth</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth it goes on.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>The silica also leaves an incredibly silky smooth, baby soft skin surface, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you have dry skin, this is a great option for you.</li>
      <li>My foundation looks so much better and lasts so much longer when using this.</li>
      <li>But overall a good product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s similar but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is as good.</li>
      <li>However i am almost out and love this product so much that i have cut the end of the tube off</li>
      <li>at a very reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all (which I do easily) and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>to, however overall I am very pleased with the purchase and the price is much better than most other primers I have&lt;br /&gt;seen or tried.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends unless you absolutely needed one and you needed it cheap.</li>
      <li>However didn&#x27;t prevent foundation from settling into my smile lines.</li>
      <li>My powder based make-up looks freshly applied all day.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s well worth its value.</li>
      <li>I love how soft his makes my face feel.</li>
      <li>I love this primer so much I recommend it for long wear of make up foundation and concealer! :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and it does really help keep my make up on all day with less shine.</li>
      <li>It lays down a good primer for foundation.</li>
      <li>This product was rated very highly on the make up geek site!</li>
      <li>This was my first experience with a makeup primer</li>
      <li>I enjoy that this is a clear colored product and doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely clear and goes on smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a couple of years now, and would not put makeup on without applying this product first.</li>
      <li>but i have been very suprised!</li>
      <li>This does the job exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>This primer works pretty well</li>
      <li>Love it and cannot recommend it enough.</li>
      <li>Better price, but not equal.</li>
      <li>It goes on soft and smooth, and drys fast.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and drys quickly</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty good, it does sting a little bit tho, especially if you&#x27;re applying it to an extremely clean face.</li>
      <li>It feels almost exactly like Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, but it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I normally go for Bareminerals or smashbox primer, but for the price-it was worth the amount.</li>
      <li>Okay, let me just say that I have combination skin; I have an oily t-zone and EXTREMELY DRY cheeks.</li>
      <li>This stuff is like pure silk on your face and lasts forever.  </li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need but a dot to cover a large area.</li>
      <li>If you have combination skin like me, this will work wonders on the dry spots, but it&#x27;s a good idea to use a different primer for your oily areas.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was the best price I found for this primer and believe me I shop everything!  Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This product was referred to me by my sister-in-law, so I looked it up on Amazon and bought it.  It&#x27;s a great product with a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have oily skin like the other reviewer; my skin is combination with some areas prone to oily and other areas prone to dry.  I found this primer to be wonderful for my face.  Makeup would go on smoopthly and I loved it.  the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that you don&#x27;t get a lot for your money, but compaired to other primers, its probably not pricey.</li>
    <li> It balls up as soon as you apply it. Should have returned it.</li>
    <li> It was Ok but not great</li>
    <li> First time tried, not nearly as good as Bare Minerals primer, also sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the scent of the feel of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for more than a year and it is just running out.  This best purchase. It works so well and keeps my skin from looking oily.</li>
    <li> I like this product and liked how it made my skin feel. It lays down a good primer for foundation. The only problem is, there&#x27;s something in it I must be allergic too. After three days my skin got all red and irritated. I stopped using this product -- continued using all my usual stuff, including the foundation -- and the redness went away. Unfortunately because of this it was a waste of money for me. But, for the three days I could use it, it did what it said it would do. I wish my skin weren&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was told it was great for oily t zone areas.  I usually have to blot my makeup every 2 to 3 hours. I still have to and I have been using this product for 3 days now. It does have a nice silky feeling to it though.  Just didnt work out for me :( Can anyone recommend any type of primer for oily skin???</li>
    <li> No color, easy to apply and use under foundation. I use it shortly after washing and moisturizing my face. Apply and wait about 5 minutes to apply any foundation or concealer. Nice product but beware for oily or dry skin sufferers, it can be overly shiny or emphasize dry patches. I loved Hourglass from Sephora, so I though i&#x27;d try this. It&#x27;s similar but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is as good. Better price, but not equal.</li>
    <li> First time I use this product, I Love it is cool and light on the face and smells nice and the best part are the ingredients and the price :)</li>
    <li> I love love love this primer. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth it goes on. It&#x27;s a staple in my makeup kit. I foundation looks flawless with it. It lasts all day. I will say that if you have oily skin you may not want to get this. But still a great primer and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot at all. Great buy. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Super small size, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  I prefer Sephora&#x27;s Primer better.  It&#x27;s silkier to go on, glides across your skin, it&#x27;s a larger pump bottle and it&#x27;s less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Sephora Store I go.  Plus you get points there too for purchases.  I&#x27;ll keep this Palladio one for traveling.</li>
    <li> The primer that i love love love from avon has been discontiuned! This was a trial by error kinda purchase but i have been very suprised! I have tried other low priced primers with much disappointment. However i am almost out and love this product so much that i have cut the end of the tube off so i can get the last little bit of primer out;) i&#x27;m purchasing my second tube now. Enjoy! You&#x27;ll look maahvelous...i swear to God!</li>
    <li> I love this primer so much I recommend it for long wear of make up foundation and concealer! :) nice</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but compared to other its alright, I&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t buy it again I&#x27;ll just stay with E.L.F</li>
    <li> This comment is for the ones that are thinking this product is friendly and low on toxins....that is not true!!&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Palladio website and found the complete list of ingredients. I was willing to put up with some but the fact that they use 3 different parabens is just too much toxic! unnecessary and deceiving by the name of this product and the list of ingredients in Amazon. There are other options out there. Even if you don&#x27;t change your whole make up, at least primer and foundation should be low on toxins... your skin is absorbing everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Clyclomethicone, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Chamomila Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Safflower (Carthamus Tinctorius) Oil, Isopropylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Butylparaben, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Grape (Vitis Vinifera) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Ginseng (Panax Ginseng) Extract</li>
    <li> Very good primer. Was always on the lookout for a primer like smash box but not as expensive and this one is a very close match.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a makeup primer and I really like it.  Makes the makeup go on smoother, I use less and it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Is great i use it everytime i wear makeup and my skin turn soft. The price is great im so going to buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now, and would not put makeup on without applying this product first. It feels like silk going on, and is not heavy. My foundation looks so much better and lasts so much longer when using this. I don&#x27;t plan on ever changing.</li>
    <li> I used to use Tarte&#x27;s Poreless primer before I found this and I am totally sold. It&#x27;s cheaper, goes on just as well, and has the same effect. I use it under all of my heavier makeup looks and I almost don&#x27;t even need foundation with it as it makes my pores vanish along with some finishing powder.</li>
    <li> But the tube is smaller than expected. Can&#x27;t say that I noticed a difference between this and other primers. I definitely was looking for a primer that reduces the look of my pores and would keep my make-up on all day. Guess you can&#x27;t expect miracles. Don&#x27;t think I get it again.</li>
    <li> Great product, my favorite primer and the price is terrific.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a long time and it hasn&#x27;t run out. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all (which I do easily) and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
    <li> This does the job exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I normally go for Bareminerals or smashbox primer, but for the price-it was worth the amount. It makes my skin feel good and the best part is that the ingredients are all natural.</li>
    <li> I read on some reviews that this reduces the visibility of pores, and that is not true. It makes my face more oily but other primers make my face too dry. Still haven&#x27;t found a good one that&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This product was rated very highly on the make up geek site! My skin is very sensitive and drys quickly but this product feels like silk when i put it on and the makeup lasts until the next day (I know this by accident)! Lol! All the women in my family has purchased this!</li>
    <li> I first heard of this product on one of those beauty tips segments for a local talk show. I love my previous Lancome primer but this product is very close giving me the same silky smooth non oil feel of La Base.  I have used it for several weeks now and really like it.  Plus it is not as pricey. I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> Wears great over moisturizer and under foundation. Keeps my makeup less shiny and pores appear smaller. Can get this from Sally Beauty too</li>
    <li> I like this primer you only need a very small amount and it makes your face silky soft when applying your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a 4 because I am not sure after using about a week if it fills in my large pores as much as I would like&lt;br /&gt;it to, however overall I am very pleased with the purchase and the price is much better than most other primers I have&lt;br /&gt;seen or tried.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My skin tends to be dry. Even still, I only need about a pea size amount. If to much is used, it balls up and falls off.   It goes on soft and smooth, and drys fast.  My powder based make-up looks freshly applied all day.</li>
    <li> Amazingly light and works well</li>
    <li> Love it! Feels just like those pricey primers at sephora! I also like knowing that it&#x27;s way better for my skin than all the others. The only con, is that it comes in a pretty small tube. Make a larger dispenser!</li>
    <li> The primer is really good. It makes so much of a huge difference with my fondation. I don&#x27;t have to use as much fondation now that I have the primer and it goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable face primer and it was incredibly hard to find.  I was worried that when I got this primer that I&#x27;d be really disappointed in the quality, but it was the opposite.  This stuff is like pure silk on your face and lasts forever.  It is my go-to primer now!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now. It feels almost exactly like Smashbox Photo Finish Primer, but it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Have to use tiny amounts or it gets clumpy. But overall a good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good, it does sting a little bit tho, especially if you&#x27;re applying it to an extremely clean face.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It helps my make up last all day with no touch up, except lipstick. It helps the application glide on smoother. I would tell friends and family to use this. The price is also reasonable. I enjoy that this is a clear colored product and doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that this isn&#x27;t a very good primer if you have oily skin.  I get oily around my t zone and this made it worse. Would be an excellent primer for those without oily skin. A little bit goes a long way and the price isn&#x27;t too bad!</li>
    <li> Did not irritate my acne-prone skin at all, which is huge.  However didn&#x27;t prevent foundation from settling into my smile lines.</li>
    <li> This product is so great. It is so smooth and leaves a silky base for liquid make-up and powder. You don&#x27;t need but a dot to cover a large area.</li>
    <li> I tried about 6 different primers from here on Amazon, and this is one of my favorites. I like it because I have sensitive and acne prone skin, and this is very calming. I also like that it does a better job of making pores invisible than any of the other clear primers. Finally, I&#x27;ve found that the primers containing silica prepare the skin the very best for any foundation, which this one does perfectly, keeping the foundation perfect all day. The silica also leaves an incredibly silky smooth, baby soft skin surface, which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found that the herbs are very calming for redness and acne. I was worried it would exacerbate the acne, but it actually seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want a primer to wear alone (without makeup), this is the one I reach for. You only need a tiny amount, and it keeps your skin poreless, moisturized, and silk soft all day. I love it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. I like this primer alot. It&#x27;s makes my liquid foundation last all day. I would buy again and I would reccommend it!</li>
    <li> I love how soft his makes my face feel. I wish the tube would be a little bigger but for the price, I cant complain. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I just ran out and need to order more.  It&#x27;s completely clear and goes on smooth.  Almost powdery smooth.  It&#x27;s a great product and it does really help keep my make up on all day with less shine. which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> Okay, let me just say that I have combination skin; I have an oily t-zone and EXTREMELY DRY cheeks. So I ONLY USE THIS PRODUCT everywhere except my nose and sometimes chin and forehead, depending on the weather (Winter-it&#x27;s going on everywhere, Summer-NOT SO MUCH). I&#x27;ve always suffered from that darn \\&quot;cake-fake\\&quot; look when it comes to makeup, UNLESS I use this primer. It smoothed out my rough, dry skin, filled in my pores and made my makeup last for hours on end. NOW...I don&#x27;t have that perfect airbrushed look, because I don&#x27;t have perfect skin .. FAR FROM IT. But I do believe this primer has helped me achieved the best, possible look out of my foundation, that I myself (with my problematic skin) could achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me a lot of the smashbox primers, but I like this one better. Plus you can&#x27;t beat that price. If you have dry skin, this is a great option for you. If you have combination skin like me, this will work wonders on the dry spots, but it&#x27;s a good idea to use a different primer for your oily areas. (I use the Bare Minerals Prime Time Primer)</li>
    <li> I really like the primer and how its leaves my face feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> This primer works pretty well, it is not the best primer I&#x27;ve used but it is not as pricey so it&#x27;s well worth its value.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where everyone is complaining about the smell; I haven&#x27;t smelled anything since opening. Just wish you got a little more, very small bottle.</li>
    <li> Great to mix with your liquid foundation, I mix this with my MAC Matchmaker and photo smart fix foundation and it makes for a flawless finish. It&#x27;s long lasting and goes on light with no heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> This primer goes on like silk and makes your skin feel the same!  It is luxurious.....at a very reasonable price!  I feel pampered every time I put it on and it works really well as the foundation for all your makeup.  I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It is and good product and I would recommend you using it with and good moisturizer for your skin type.</li>
    <li> Does the job fine, feels a bit greasy, and it could just be my skin, but I broke out a lot a couple days after using it (only new product i&#x27;ve incorporated into my makeup routine), but it does keep the face smooth for makeup application!</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth and it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t bad but there are definitely some other primers out there that work a bit better. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends unless you absolutely needed one and you needed it cheap.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin feeling like silk, anchors my foundation perfectly all day, and a pea-sized amount works wonders on aging skin to fill in lines and wrinkles. Love it and cannot recommend it enough. If you have mature, dry skin, this is for you!</li>
