      <li>This product works great on synthetic or human hair.  </li>
      <li>As you spray one light squeeze, sweep your hand with bottle across the wig so that the spray droplets can be dispersed evenly across the wig.  </li>

      <li>Just make sure to spray very sparingly and from a distance</li>
      <li>A full squeeze made my wig look quite oily.  </li>
      <li>Roll let dry u will have nice body curls :)</li>
      <li>I was able to keep some of my older wigs too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it much, but when we travel it&#x27;s easy.</li>
      <li>It says that it&#x27;s oil free, but I tested it on my arm when I first got it...and it feels very much</li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>It is light with a sheen, not heavy and greasy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly non-oily and like the fine print says, you can use it daily.</li>
      <li>so much so that I also use it on my real hair.</li>
      <li>just as someone told me just don&#x27;t put to much on .  </li>
      <li>It really does the trick .</li>
      <li>I really like the shine</li>
      <li>It worked real well on real hair better than some other shine I had.</li>
      <li>It looks like a brand new wig!</li>
      <li>Used this on my older wig and it does give it new luster.</li>
      <li>and now the wig looks brand new.</li>
      <li>has given it a totally new life, and I am in no hurry to switch to my new one.</li>
      <li>Works great to put in that extra sheen on your hair with the heaviness and fake look to the hair</li>
      <li>This stuff really brings a wig back to life.</li>
      <li>So far I see that I will have to use the product to keep that shiny look about every 3 to 4 days...</li>
      <li>I was very surprised at how instant the shine was ..</li>
      <li>I was trying to get a little more use out of my old wig before starting with my new one, so I sprayed a little of this stuff on it and was totally blown away by the result.</li>
      <li>But you have to be careful not to spray too much or your hair will feel oily.</li>
      <li>I have to disagree with previous reviewers; the scent of this oil really bothered me.</li>

<li> I have to disagree with previous reviewers; the scent of this oil really bothered me.</li>
<li> It had gotten very dull and dry looking with so many washings, sprayings, and general hard use, but this Wig Shine spray</li>
<li> It does shine up my wigs without making them look fake, which is really important to me.</li>
<li> Wish I had this long ago.  </li>
<li> On new hair, very little</li>
<li> Just a lil goes a long way!  </li>
<li> This product will last you a long time since a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> So I mixed half water with it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like a dry oil bout a wet one.</li>
<li> Just remember to use sparingly, as a little spray goes a long way.</li>
<li> After wearing a wig for a few weeks and I wear mine daily , they tend to get that dull dry look but this spray takes care of that.</li>
<li> After several washings (with wig shampoo) my wig got dull looking.</li>
<li> They become dull and sometimes a bit frizzy around the hairline after several months of wear.  </li>
<li> Even though it says it&#x27;s oil-free, it leaves an odd weighted-down feel to my hair.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;I have purchase other products in the past to give my hair shine but it was always oily and weighed my hair down.</li>
<li> Just a little adds shine, detangles and lays hair.  </li>
<li> Just use a little</li>
<li> As soon as my wig or hair starts to look dull, I use this product, and it brings life and shine back to dull looking hair without the oily buildup.  </li>
<li> It won&#x27;t weigh your curls down, just spritz and scrunch the hair and WA-LA!</li>
<li> I am an everyday wig wearer.  </li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t get a heavy coat on it.</li>
<li> but my whole family thought it was abhorrent</li>
<li> It turned dull hair to shiny ..</li>
<li> Smells heavenly and impacts shine to a dull looking or frizzy look.</li>
<li> Go slowly so that you don&#x27;t over apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I am Very disappointed in the product and very surprised based on the other reviews.</li>
<li> That was an expensive mistake!</li>
<li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <li> This stuff really brings a wig back to life. After wearing a wig for a few weeks and I wear mine daily , they tend to get that dull dry look but this spray takes care of that. The spray revitalizes the look and curl of the wig without leaving a greasy feel (it actually is a non greasy formula). I bought the large bottle and will return for more when this runs out. It really does the trick .</li>
    <li> I dont use it, cant stand the smell.</li>
    <li> It worked real well on real hair better than some other shine I had. I was able to keep some of my older wigs too.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly and impacts shine to a dull looking or frizzy look. Just a lil goes a long way!  I use it on my hair as well as on my weaves.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a week now.. I was very surprised at how instant the shine was .. It turned dull hair to shiny .. It look oily but it was not . The best part is it leaves your hair smelling good and soft. I would recommend this product to friends . I am pleased with my purchase...&lt;br /&gt;I have purchase other products in the past to give my hair shine but it was always oily and weighed my hair down. So far I see that I will have to use the product to keep that shiny look about every 3 to 4 days...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Smells great and keeps wigs soft and shiny. I only have synthetic wigs, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on human hair, but am keeping this as a staple in my wig care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I purchased 2 more bottles for some friends</li>
    <li> This product has an incredibly strong scent.  The best I can describe it is that is smells like bubblegum.  After I used it the bathroom reeked.  I know scent is subjective but my whole family thought it was abhorrent and I ended up rewashing the wig to get the smell out.  That was an expensive mistake!</li>
    <li> This spray is great I put it on a wig I had for a while and now the wig looks brand new. This spray is a must have if you wear wigs.</li>
    <li> It is not oil free. It left an oily film on hair piece. There was no shine. Sprayed on my hand to test and had oil all over my palms.</li>
    <li> This product will last you a long time since a little goes a long way. Detangles synthetic wigs and gives them shine without being greasy. Fine spray mist. Good deal.</li>
    <li> This product works great on synthetic or human hair.  As soon as my wig or hair starts to look dull, I use this product, and it brings life and shine back to dull looking hair without the oily buildup.  I would definitely keep stock of this product and would recommend it to family and friends!</li>
    <li> Braid wearers, don&#x27;t be fooled by the name and think this spray is only for wigs! This the BEST spray for synthetic braids, especially the shorter, curly styles. It&#x27;s truly non-oily and like the fine print says, you can use it daily. It won&#x27;t weigh your curls down, just spritz and scrunch the hair and WA-LA! Beautiful results with a nice soft scent. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I am an everyday wig wearer.  They become dull and sometimes a bit frizzy around the hairline after several months of wear.  I have been looking for a product to extend the life of my wigs and this is it.  It not only returns the shine but conditions as well.  Last in the wig for several days.  I will rebuy this product.</li>
    <li> Even though it says it&#x27;s oil-free, it leaves an odd weighted-down feel to my hair. Just make sure to spray very sparingly and from a distance so it doesn&#x27;t get a heavy coat on it.</li>
    <li> Over product review it does shine well easy to use I am not a fan of the smell goes on well</li>
    <li> Wish I had this long ago.  Works great.  For &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair, have to use quite a bit to regularly revive and detangle.  On new hair, very little and it keeps it looking great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a dry oil bout a wet one. That&#x27;s what makes it so great for wigs. Shipping and service was awesome</li>
    <li> This is good stuff! Just a little does magical things to my wigs when they start to look a little rough! I will definitely keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> I have to disagree with previous reviewers; the scent of this oil really bothered me. Like bubblegum or drugstore perfume for teenagers. The oil is ok if used very sparingly, but rubs off on clothes easily, so beware.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best spraying wig shine available....so much so that I also use it on my real hair. It does shine up my wigs without making them look fake, which is really important to me. Shines up my own hair as well. I won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
    <li> Item is not oily to the wig. Works great to put in that extra sheen on your hair with the heaviness and fake look to the hair</li>
    <li> Great product for all wigs! This product makes the wigs or hairpieces last longer. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> works well, smells good.</li>
    <li> I used this on some hair that I had made a wig out of, and I also used it on my own hair. It says that it&#x27;s oil free, but I tested it on my arm when I first got it...and it feels very much like it&#x27;s oiled-base. Other than that it works good on my own hair and synthetic hair as well.</li>
    <li> it works well for me and i&#x27;m glad i bought it . just as someone told me just don&#x27;t put to much on .  I might buy another one!!!!</li>
    <li> Just a little adds shine, detangles and lays hair.  Great stuff for synthetic braids too!  Not greasy-no residue.</li>
    <li> Used this on my older wig and it does give it new luster. Just don&#x27;t overspray or it will look oily.</li>
    <li> This is a great product makes my hair smell wonderful. It help stimulate growth also. I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waaaaaay too greasy! Do not buy. The best one is by Envy. I am Very disappointed in the product and very surprised based on the other reviews.</li>
    <li> This stuff is totally amazing! I was trying to get a little more use out of my old wig before starting with my new one, so I sprayed a little of this stuff on it and was totally blown away by the result. It looks like a brand new wig! It had gotten very dull and dry looking with so many washings, sprayings, and general hard use, but this Wig Shine spray has given it a totally new life, and I am in no hurry to switch to my new one. This definitely puts the shine back into a wig, instantly. Just remember to use sparingly, as a little spray goes a long way. Hats off to whoever invented it!</li>
    <li> This product may be oil free but be sure and apply it sparingly.  A full squeeze made my wig look quite oily.  As you spray one light squeeze, sweep your hand with bottle across the wig so that the spray droplets can be dispersed evenly across the wig.  Go slowly so that you don&#x27;t over apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work.  It has a strong smell which is pleasant to me but may not be to others.</li>
    <li> I bought my wig a couple years ago. I don&#x27;t wear it much, but when we travel it&#x27;s easy. After several washings (with wig shampoo) my wig got dull looking. I bought this product and with a couple spritzes... my wig looks good as new!!</li>
    <li> It is light with a sheen, not heavy and greasy. I have just begun to use it, time will tell.</li>
    <li> This will make your wig SHINE... Just use a little and  you will see the difference...</li>
    <li> Works great on synthetic hair! I was hasten to put on my expenses human wigs. So I mixed half water with it. Works great for fly away hair &amp; roller sets. Roll let dry u will have nice body curls :)</li>
    <li> I really like the shine this product gives my hair.  But you have to be careful not to spray too much or your hair will feel oily.</li>
