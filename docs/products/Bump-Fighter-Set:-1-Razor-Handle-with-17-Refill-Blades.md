<li> This product provides a high quality shave for me (a black male with smooth skin) by cutting the facial hairs close without causing bumps.  </li>
<li> only reason why I purchased these BF razors was to experiment because I have heard they are supposedly designed specifically for Black facial hair.</li>
<li> With this razor and the recommended shave gel, I have more ingrown hairs and a bad shave; it&#x27;s like having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow after just shaving.</li>
<li> But once that blade dulls, it causes irritation and hair get stuck it in after they&#x27;re cut off which add to the irritation caused by repeated strokes.</li>
<li> I used these razors for the first time this week, and needless to say...</li>
<li> This product is made for black men&#x27;s skin type.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s hard rubber handle and the changing the cartridge</li>
<li> Prior to using this I had to deal with horrible in grown hairs caused by razors with multiple blades.</li>
<li> Razors with multiple blades are the worst for African America men.</li>
<li> I was not impressed.</li>
<li> I figure you can get 4-5 shaves out of one blade, which isn&#x27;t bad I suppose.</li>
<li> The aftershave is legit, but the razors are crap.</li>
<li> They were terrible, no where close to the quality of the disposable Bump Fighters.</li>

    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Thanks to whoever invented this razor for black men or any man&lt;br /&gt;who suffer from ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I got a excellent deal from amazon,product is good for ingrown hair</li>
    <li> Helps with not getting razor burn</li>
    <li> Before this razor, I suffered some ingrown hairs and decided to give this a try. With this razor and the recommended shave gel, I have more ingrown hairs and a bad shave; it&#x27;s like having a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow after just shaving.</li>
    <li> They were terrible, no where close to the quality of the disposable Bump Fighters. I thought these would have been the better ones. So, I ordered 12 packs of the disposable ones, which I&#x27;d give 5 stars</li>
    <li> This product is made for black men&#x27;s skin type.  My husband loves it so I make sure he stays stocked..</li>
    <li> I love these.  They really help those who get razor bumps when using normal razor blades! This is all I use.  I sure hope they never go out of business! (But I&#x27;m still waiting for these to arrive in the mail)</li>
    <li> Thanks for the quick shipping, it was part of a Father&#x27;s day gift and my Husband was really surprised that I found these, they are not sold in any stores, would recommend</li>
    <li> Great price. Awesome product for black man shaving his face who has issues with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> great... love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Meets my needs &amp; helps to keep me from bumping up while still giving a close shave.</li>
    <li> Great for African American men.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razors since I was 15 years old when my grandmother bought me my first. Prior to using this I had to deal with horrible in grown hairs caused by razors with multiple blades. Razors with multiple blades are the worst for African America men. The first blade not only cut hair, but it tugs on it, the second blade cuts the hair again and pulls on the hair some more. The process is repeated by razor heads with multiple blades until the last blade makes it way through. The shave is closer than needed because the hair stub then recedes back under the skins surface. If you have curly facial hair then once it states growing that hair is going to curl under your skin. This is the cause of in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY product I trust to prevent me from getting ingrown hairs. The one thing I will say though is depending on how much you shave the blades may not last that long. When I first started shaving I only needed to shave once every other week. The razors lasted a couple months or more each. Now almost 10 years later, I&#x27;&#x27;m shaving once or twice a week so they only last a month. I figure you can get 4-5 shaves out of one blade, which isn&#x27;t bad I suppose. But once that blade dulls, it causes irritation and hair get stuck it in after they&#x27;re cut off which add to the irritation caused by repeated strokes.</li>
    <li> This product provides a high quality shave for me (a black male with smooth skin) by cutting the facial hairs close without causing bumps.  Bumps are unsightly and can lead to bleeding which causes shirt collars to stain.  I find the product easy to hold with it&#x27;s hard rubber handle and the changing the cartridge is easy.  I prefer this shaver over others, but find that many stores do not carry it in their inventory.</li>
    <li> I used these razors for the first time this week, and needless to say...I was not impressed. Though I didn&#x27;t get any razor bumps from these Bump Fighter razors, it was a crappy shave. I needed to actually shave ATG just to get a close one when using them. If you&#x27;re a Black man who wants a close shave without getting the bumps, I would suggest using Schick Hydro instead. When I have used those razors (along with SH shaving cream and finishing with Bump Fighter aftershave), I never get any razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I purchased these BF razors was to experiment because I have heard they are supposedly designed specifically for Black facial hair. The aftershave is legit, but the razors are crap.</li>
    <li> For more than what I paid for. I would probably buy from them again when I run out of razors again.</li>
    <li> My husband did not like the shave.</li>
    <li> Good smooth shave without the irritation!</li>
