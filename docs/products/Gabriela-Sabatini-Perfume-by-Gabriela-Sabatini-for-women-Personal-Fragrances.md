      <li>so I can keep enjoying it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells like vanilla and flowers :)</li>
      <li>Love this perfume and have been wearing it for over 20 years...</li>
      <li>I was without it for so many years.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this eau de toilette.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for more than 15 years..</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>Well I am trilled to have found it here and still LOVE it , my youngest daughter smelt me and said she remembers when I used to smell like that.</li>
      <li>I love this essence...</li>
      <li>love the smell of this perfume:  </li>
      <li>Will buy more when it runs out.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It smells new and good</li>
      <li>It is a light, flowery smell.  </li>
      <li>I caught a glimpse of the wearer and was surprised and thrilled to see her again when it turned out</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT, ITS SMELLS GREAT AND LAST FOR A LONG TIME</li>
      <li>With this purchase, no matter how much I spray, the scent just doesn&#x27;t last a good hour or two.</li>
      <li>my wife very fast shipping</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>had this eau de toilette years ago when Gabriela Sabatini first came out with it... have been looking forever to purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I totally recommend it :)</li>
      <li>I first smelled this perfume in 2003 when I was in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a seminar.  </li>
      <li>I first bought this perfume in Frankfurt Germany when I was a flight attendant and when it finished and we stopped flying to Frankfurt</li>
      <li>This is actually an \\&quot;Eau de Toilette\\&quot; which just means it isn&#x27;t as strong as \\&quot;Perfume\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>will certainly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Gentlemen, if your lady likes a nice, fresh scent you can&#x27;t go wrong getting this for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
      <li>I received only the two first in october 29, but the Gabriela Sabatini Eau De Toilette was never delivered by Sams.</li>
      <li>, after a lot of back and forth we were married and she came to the USA.</li>
      <li>The real one lasts all day (and stays on your clothes even upto the next day).</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve already thrown away the box and was only convinced it&#x27;s not the real deal after two days of use.</li>
      <li>I frequently recognize perfumes on people that come near me.</li>
      <li>She could never find this perfume and I was kind of sad to see the smell go</li>
      <li>What I remember from my mom&#x27;s perfume, the color is a little darker like more concentrated and a little spray goes a long way.</li>

    <li> I frequently recognize perfumes on people that come near me. I have never smelled anyone else but me with this. I don&#x27;t understand why it isn&#x27;t more popular. It is absolutly beautiful and elegant. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it here, I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere in ages. I thought it wasn&#x27;t made anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance! This is a personal assessment but I think for the price it is an excellent buy.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>

    <li> had this eau de toilette years ago when Gabriela Sabatini first came out with it... have been looking forever to purchase it again. What a surprise when I found it here...  Thanks</li>
    <li> I Ordered three products at the same time: Two &amp;#34; Amor Amor &amp;#34; by Chacharel and one &amp;#34;Gabriela Sabatini&amp;#34;. I received only the two first in october 29, but the Gabriela Sabatini Eau De Toilette was never delivered by Sams. I just want to know where&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> This perfum is a replica,  I never buy this again...&lt;br /&gt;I want a return it.</li>
    <li> I first smelled this perfume in 2003 when I was in Dubrovnik, Croatia for a seminar.  I caught a glimpse of the wearer and was surprised and thrilled to see her again when it turned out she was our instructor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a lot of back and forth we were married and she came to the USA. She could never find this perfume and I was kind of sad to see the smell go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found it here on Amazon and once again the wife and I are both happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this perfume:  It is a light, flowery smell.  It is subtle and will make your head turn if you ever get a whiff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen, if your lady likes a nice, fresh scent you can&#x27;t go wrong getting this for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  This is actually an \\&quot;Eau de Toilette\\&quot; which just means it isn&#x27;t as strong as \\&quot;Perfume\\&quot;.
