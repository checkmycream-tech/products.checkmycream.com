      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better experiences with Banana Boat tanning spray.</li>
      <li>The tanning lotion is a bit greasy but most are.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>I love Maui Babe Tanning lotions.  </li>
      <li>Smells like cocoa and coffee, and leaves your skin feeling moisturizer, not oily like many products do.</li>
      <li>and it is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It really gives a great bronzed glow and you don&#x27;t have to spend hours in the sun.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this tanning line products.</li>
      <li>To   top it off my skin</li>
      <li>piece of tape over top to secure - I do for traveling.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this in Hawaii and fell in love.</li>
      <li>It does have a strong coffee scent.</li>
      <li>Started with original from Maui 10 years ago and found and old bottle - bought this new 3 bottle setup and it is perfect - bronze tanned and haven&#x27;t even peeled once.  </li>
      <li>you really turn a nice color of brown with this stuff and the post-sun stuff holds your tan longer than anything i&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
      <li>They ship their product free so after shipping here</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fantastic, but you do have to like the smell of coffee.</li>
      <li>i learned of this product from a friend who took a vacation to hawaii, she came back with a nice golden tan, she offered  for me to try since i have olive skin, tried it loved it and also the lotion it soothes the skin and enhances your tan</li>
      <li>So far I am very pleased with both products.</li>
      <li>the smell is a bit more chocolatie then just pure coffee.</li>
      <li>Tans fast,  If you  like coffee you will love the smell of this.</li>
      <li>Maui Babe Browning Lotion gave me the most beautiful and   long lasting tan in the shortest amount of sun time, that I have ever   had.</li>
      <li>Worth the quick tan excellerator.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first bottle while in Hawaii, and I&#x27;m so grateful that I can now get it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>The oil is brown, so use care if you have a light colored swimsuit or beach towel as it will be very noticeable if it gets on the fabric.</li>
      <li>I got a nice darker shade of me after a very short period of time.  </li>
      <li>but we are planning to do a lot more tanning this summer and will be testing it in Virginia and Jamaica later this year.  </li>
      <li>This was the first summer I have used this product</li>
      <li>You get the best tan, faster than any of the expensive products.</li>
      <li>I was tanned my very time using it!  </li>
      <li>but my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I first used this while vacationing in Hawaii</li>
      <li>I would buy this in Hawaii; love it and it keeps you moisturized and turn brown rather than lobster red.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found it works best on vacation, next to a pool or ocean - at least that&#x27;s what I keep telling my husband.</li>
      <li>That was a positive surprise.  </li>
      <li>I first discovered it in my hotel&#x27;s gift shop in Hawaii, it helps you get tan so much faster.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much....</li>
      <li>so much faster than you could ever imagine.</li>
      <li>would not recommend wearing it with white or light colored suits.  </li>
      <li>It really seems to condition the skin and enhance the tan.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but well worth it !!!</li>
      <li>I have used it in the past and was extremely satisfied!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to everyone, and I   will use it  exclusively from now on.</li>
      <li>I would normally get.  </li>
      <li>Plus its gives me a darker tan faster than the normal.</li>
      <li>With the package came preferred membership which entitles you to buy the product at a discounted price in the future so actually I made out much better chosing a direct buy.  </li>
      <li>My skin turned brownish instead of getting the usal red color right after you spend time in the sun before it turns brown.  </li>
      <li>overall I think it worked pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It gives me a rich dark tan.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used pricey oils and lotions from tanning salons, but they don&#x27;t even come close to the rich, dark color Maui Babe coaxes out of my skin.</li>
      <li>the total cost was less then 50 cents more.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product!  Have bought this pack three times already.  It really seems to condition the skin and enhance the tan.</li>
    <li> The tanning lotion is a bit greasy but most are. It smells amazing and does not stain the skin like some do. I originally bought this in Hawaii and fell in love. Happy to find it to purchase online.</li>
    <li> Just received the 3Pack yesterday bought directly from Maui Babe website.  I have read some reviews here stating that possibly the items were not the real thing and decided it was worth it spending the few extra cents to get it directly from them.  They ship their product free so after shipping here the total cost was less then 50 cents more.  With the package came preferred membership which entitles you to buy the product at a discounted price in the future so actually I made out much better chosing a direct buy.  Now I have only used the tanning lotion once today and only for about an hour so I can not attest on any long term effects but overall I think it worked pretty well.  I got a nice darker shade of me after a very short period of time.  My skin turned brownish instead of getting the usal red color right after you spend time in the sun before it turns brown.  The lotion does have a nice smell to it, I was a bit worried when people said they smell like coffee but to me the smell is a bit more chocolatie then just pure coffee. That was a positive surprise.  I did seem to sweat more in the sun while using the lotion if that makes any difference to anyone.  My wife also usually burns easily in the sun but it seemed as she browned a bit as well this time.  Thus far I can only give it 5 stars but we are planning to do a lot more tanning this summer and will be testing it in Virginia and Jamaica later this year.  I will try to update my review at a later time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this tanning line products. You will find no better anywhere. TRUST ME! It gives me a rich dark tan. That stays longer than when I use other tanning products. Plus its gives me a darker tan faster than the normal. Means less time needed in the sun.</li>
    <li> I would buy this in Hawaii; love it and it keeps you moisturized and turn brown rather than lobster red.  Happy I can get it on Amazon</li>
    <li> Love this. A little pricey but well worth it !!! We get a great tan !!</li>
    <li> One of the 3 bottles had a hole in the bottom and had leaked out. Not happy and didn&#x27;t have time to return and reorder because I was leaving for a trip that I wanted to use this product for. Amazon could not do anything for me</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I first discovered it in my hotel&#x27;s gift shop in Hawaii, it helps you get tan so much faster. It is NOT a self tanner, it does not streak or turn you orange. Just put it on before laying out in the sun (with some sunscreen underneath if you get as pale as me...) and you will get brown (not red!) so much faster than you could ever imagine. And come back from a day in the sun looking like you have been in Hawaii for a week! It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m so glad I found it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Heard about it from a friend so decided to try it and it works wonders.  It really gives a great bronzed glow and you don&#x27;t have to spend hours in the sun.  Disadvantage: it is NOT waterproof like it states and it will come off on any surfaces that you come in contact with ie: raft, towel, etc.</li>
    <li> While my husband and I were in Hawaii a couple of years ago we bought this lotion to use.  I have used nothing since.  I love this lotion.  I not only tan faster but my skin is so soft and smooth.  I love it!!!!!1</li>
    <li> Maui Babe is great for the beach as it keeps your skin hydrated.  Tans fast,  If you  like coffee you will love the smell of this.</li>
    <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Started with original from Maui 10 years ago and found and old bottle - bought this new 3 bottle setup and it is perfect - bronze tanned and haven&#x27;t even peeled once.  Goes on brown - stays brown.  Speaks for itself.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I first used this while vacationing in Hawaii and I am so happy to see that I can purchase it online!!  Must use a sunscreen underneath this product...the maui babe alone does not contain sunscreen.  It does allow you to become a beautiful bronze color and I love the coffee smell of the product!!!  Great way to become a beautiful bronzed color!!!!</li>
    <li> Maui Babe Browning Lotion gave me the most beautiful and   long lasting tan in the shortest amount of sun time, that I have ever   had. I can&#x27;t believe being a natural red head, that I could have a   golden brown tan and not the orange red I would normally get.  To   top it off my skin has remained moist and soft.   This is one   \\&quot;GREAT\\&quot; product..... I highly recommend it to everyone, and I   will use it  exclusively from now on.</li>
    <li> I just looove this stuff.Bought it years ago from Hawaii when we went on our vacation. It works so good. Especially on my legs which don&#x27;t seem to tan as well as the rest of my body. It does have a strong coffee scent. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee you shouldn&#x27;t buy it.I turned all my friends onto this stuff &amp; everyone is using it. Even my bone white friends are getting unbelieveable color after using this product.</li>
    <li> would not recommend wearing it with white or light colored suits.  It does stain.  It&#x27;s the best out there for a great tan!!!  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love it and it works great.  Just need more time to use it!</li>
    <li> Great tan excellerator.  Just apply and wash hands or use hand wipes as it can stain.  Worth the quick tan excellerator.  Smells like coffe but nice.</li>
    <li> I call this my MAGIC POTION LOTION!! And I&#x27;m not just pale, but ghost white!! Maui Babe works! Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I never received this product from the company. I have used it in the past and was extremely satisfied! I am however, very dissapointed that my order was never filled and that I did not receive my purchase before going on vacation.</li>
    <li> When it arrived, one of my bottles was busted and had leaked all over the other bottles. Also, it is extremely oily so if you plan on laying out somewhere I would wait till the last possible second to put it on... And be careful of your clothing because it stained mine!</li>
    <li> This is best tanning lotion I have ever found.  I am a sun worshiper and the after tan lotion really helps out my dry old skin.</li>
    <li> I love Maui Babe Tanning lotions.  My have got my two granddaughter hooked on it also.  Going to Hawaii soon and we will buying and bringing a bunch back with me.  Its cheaper over there!</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with both products. The browning lotion has a definite,different smell but I liked it. You don&#x27;t need much....it feels thick but goes on thin and makes your skin shiny and not greasy. It is very different than Hawaiian Tropic products that I have used for years. The After lotion has a fresh,pleasant smell and makes your skin feel terrific. We have not had the best weather since I received my order....I can&#x27; t wait to use it on my fall vacation.</li>
    <li> I love this product. When used in conjunction with a base SPF lotion, you will achieve the tan faster, safer and your skin stays healthy the whole time.</li>
    <li> Tanned ok but peeled everytime</li>
    <li> though contained in the plastic bag, some leaked out of both bottles.&lt;br /&gt;suggest piece of tape over top to secure - I do for traveling.</li>
    <li> My favorite and a great value</li>
    <li> This was the first summer I have used this product and it is also the tannest I&#x27;ve ever been. LOVE iT!</li>
    <li> We found this product when we were in Hawaii a few years ago. We love it and were happy to find it on Amazon. You get the best tan, faster than any of the expensive products. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Discovered this product while in Hawaii.  Daughter loves it. Make sure you wear sunscreen under the accelerator.  Smells weird, kinda like coffee but is amazing. After tan lotion is wonderful and smells great.</li>
    <li> i learned of this product from a friend who took a vacation to hawaii, she came back with a nice golden tan, she offered  for me to try since i have olive skin, tried it loved it and also the lotion it soothes the skin and enhances your tan i really love it so now i order enough to keep me plenty for the summer months ,</li>
    <li> Ingredients and results</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best.  i bought it and used it on my trip to bear lake this year and it is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after seeing lots of Hawaiian​ beach babes take photos of it on their Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion didn&#x27;t give me a tan at all. I&#x27;ve had better experiences with Banana Boat tanning spray.</li>
    <li> you really turn a nice color of brown with this stuff and the post-sun stuff holds your tan longer than anything i&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I discovered it while on vacation in Maui</li>
    <li> Love this am using while on vacation in Belize....thank you</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I was tanned my very time using it!  But you do need some sunscreen for your face.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! In just one use I get an amazing tan, and no burning!  Smells like cocoa and coffee, and leaves your skin feeling moisturizer, not oily like many products do. Spreads event on the skin-but remember to wipe off your palms!</li>
    <li> This oil is the best ever! I bought my first bottle while in Hawaii, and I&#x27;m so grateful that I can now get it on Amazon! I&#x27;ve used pricey oils and lotions from tanning salons, but they don&#x27;t even come close to the rich, dark color Maui Babe coaxes out of my skin. The fragrance is fantastic, but you do have to like the smell of coffee. The oil is brown, so use care if you have a light colored swimsuit or beach towel as it will be very noticeable if it gets on the fabric. Doesn&#x27;t seem to stain, though. I use it in the sun and the tanning bed. Works great in both. But I&#x27;ve found it works best on vacation, next to a pool or ocean - at least that&#x27;s what I keep telling my husband. &#x3D;D</li>
