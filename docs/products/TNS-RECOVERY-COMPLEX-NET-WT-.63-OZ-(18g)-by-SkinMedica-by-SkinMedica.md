<li> product has really made a difference in my skin, as it is plumper and just plain younger looking.</li>
<li> expensive but worth it!</li>
<li> Just as I expected.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s pricey, but a little goes a long way</li>
<li> The prices on Amazon are $100 less then in my doctors office.</li>
<li> Need something to make your skin feel firm and smoother?  </li>
<li> Wasted money.</li>
<li> It is a dual pump dispenser that delivers a mixture of this product (THS recovery complex) plus APS corrective Complex) in the other chamber, all to rejuvenate the skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using TNS Recovery Complex for over 10 years.</li>
<li> TNS Recovery Complex must be god sent, because it works so well.  </li>
<li> It was thick and didn&#x27;t spread as it should.  </li>
<li> This product is FAKE......</li>
<li> This is FAKE as it has a 3 digit code on the bottom and all TNS By SkinMedica  have a six digit code as I checked with SkinMedica.</li>
<li> So very expensive and dreaded using it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have purchased three times. Honestly, can&#x27;t say that I see any difference at all, in any way. That said, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting my skin, although it does sometimes seem drying.</li>
    <li> The very best anti aging product for my normal skin type.Keeps any corrective skin procedures results lasting longer.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED TNS RECOVERY FOR YEARS AND HAVE FOUND NO OTHER PRODUCT AS GOOD. IF YOU READ THE INGREDIENT LIST YOU CAN SEE WHY. NO WATER AS THE FIRST INGREDIENT AS MANY ARE, NOR FULL OF EMMOLIENTS WHICH YOU CAN GET IN YOUR MOISTURIZER. SOME DO NOT LIKE THE ODOR BUT I CAN EASILY GET OVER THAT FOR THE GREAT SKIN TEXTURE YOU WILL RETAIN OVER TIME. VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product.  After 3 weeks of use, you will see your face lifted.  But, you must wait till the 3rd week to see results.  When I have stopped using the product, my face eventually goes back to normal.  Love, love this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years, and couldn&#x27;t live without it.  Amazon has the best prices on this product!</li>
    <li> It was not the same as Ive had before. It was thick and didn&#x27;t spread as it should.  Ended up throwing 1/2 away</li>
    <li> HAVE USED FOR 2 MONTHS , DID NOT SEE ANY GREAT IMPROVEMENT, NOT WORTH THE PRICE,</li>
    <li> This is FAKE as it has a 3 digit code on the bottom and all TNS By SkinMedica  have a six digit code as I checked with SkinMedica. Was wondering why it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and could definitely see a difference with its use.  I would highly recommend this product for your skin no matter what type of skin you have!    Runner Girl</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and consider it my favorite skincare product. expensive but worth it!</li>
    <li> Skinmedica has some of the best facial products I have seen around in many years. Before trying this I swore by Obagi ( which I still think is great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has really made a difference in my skin, as it is plumper and just plain younger looking. I was so impressed, I went right out and bought their THS Essential Serum from my dermatologist ($250!). It is a dual pump dispenser that delivers a mixture of this product (THS recovery complex) plus APS corrective Complex) in the other chamber, all to rejuvenate the skin. I will have to write back to let you know if it works. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, be sure you get a fresh product by checking the expiration dates, and also be careful not to buy a a knock off.

    <li> have been using it for years would recommend it to my friends&#x27;  First heard of it through my cosmetic skin M.D,</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get pass the smell. So very expensive and dreaded using it. The smell is absolutely a turn off. Still sitting in my cabinet. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and at a huge savings! I am very, very, happy with this purchase! Will definitely purchase again in the near future.</li>
