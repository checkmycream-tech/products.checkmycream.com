      <li>like any bronzer, rub in very nicely.</li>
      <li>the smell is also good, not like burnt skin smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this lotion before and loved it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for both indoor and outdoor.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>and I got so many compliments on my tan, and how good it looked</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this lotion because I thought it would be really great.</li>
      <li>Love it won&#x27;t use nothing but this</li>
      <li>about a month ago I love it</li>
      <li>price since its not a \\&quot;top lotion\\&quot;</li>
      <li>(ive bought top brand</li>
      <li>and I immediately fell in love.</li>
      <li>ive used many many bronzers, this bronzer is most definately up in the top darkest.</li>
      <li>This product is a decent tanning lotion, the price is fair, I would order it again, would hope they do not discontinue</li>
      <li>If you want a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave brown streaks and smells awesome, this is the lotion for you.&lt;br /&gt;The tanning salon in which I tan has little lighting.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product at my local tanning salon and instantly fell in love &lt;3 !</li>
      <li>I went to a special occasion</li>
      <li>A sweet lady at my tanning salon offered me this product</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast too!!</li>
      <li>However I did have, \\&quot;Sun kissed skin.\\&quot; just after my first time!</li>
      <li>I have never tanned so much in my life so quickly!</li>
      <li>Really does make you 5 shades darker!</li>
      <li>I tanned \\&quot;indoors\\&quot; for the first time today in about 10 years.</li>
      <li>and you love instant bronzer</li>
      <li>MUCH cheaper here than in salons!</li>
      <li>I love lotions with a lot of bronzer if your looking to get instant color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a dark bronzer and works really well with my skin even though I have fair skin.</li>
      <li>(tan regularly: 3 or more times a week)</li>
      <li>It has a descent smell and leaves your skin feeling super soft.</li>
      <li>Not excited to own it now that I have tried it</li>
      <li>I use it on my face, and body and get really tan.</li>
      <li>friend of mine paid twice as much for this identical bottle of lotion at her tanning salon as I did.  </li>
      <li>After a few times I was getting that nice tanned look.</li>
      <li>Very professional, fast and caring.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend.</li>
      <li>remember when your using bronzer to rotate with a normal lotion without bronzer.</li>
      <li>or filled this bottle with other lotion?</li>
      <li>my opinion, if a lotion is getting me tan especially as dark as this one makes me, its good enough for me!</li>
      <li>This is the FIRST tanning bed lotion I have ever used that has actually worked for me.</li>
      <li>So I hopped into the tanning bed for my first time, and I instantly saw results.</li>
      <li>This is def the way to go, u save half the price if u order here, and free shipping...</li>
      <li>Looked like he had just gotten some old bottles at a discount?</li>
      <li>also, don&#x27;t shower for at least four hours after when using bronzer or it will wash off your \\&quot;tan.\\&quot; for beginners or advanced tanners, like myself.</li>
      <li>I started using it because its smell isn&#x27;t as terrible as many other tanning bed oils, and I just feel it properly moisturizes my skin while giving great color.  </li>
      <li>the only down fall i have ran into with this product is its very sticky.</li>

<li> the only down fall i have ran into with this product is its very sticky.</li>
<li> It is a low quality, cheap bronzer that stinks and smells like something you would buy at K-Mart next to Emerald Bay.  </li>
<li> I hate using it, and the hue is a bit orangy for me (fair skinmed with freckles, with a  good base tan already)&lt;br</li>
<li> It also works in the sun, I applied it to myself before laying in the sun on the beach and the next day I was extremely dark.</li>
<li> Just be careful buying this from individual sellers at an unbelievable low price-</li>
<li> I purchaced this at my salon, and I spent over 40$ for it there...</li>
<li> me my darkest than any other lotion</li>
<li> Because of them I would buy any other lotion.</li>
<li> The one tube I got from an online purchase smelled terribly, and left yellowy marks on my skin, and I&#x27;m sure if I had let it get on my clothes it would have done the same.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t wait to get dark</li>
<li> This lotion gives you dark color after a couple uses.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s how much I disliked it.</li>
<li> Im insanely pale and was affraid I would turn orange.</li>
<li> I would recommend it to any of my pale skinned friends.</li>
<li> No worries with this lotion, as you won&#x27;t get the uneven streaks other lotions may leave behind.  </li>
<li> I usually burn and peel.</li>
<li> but the lotion in general just stinks</li>
<li> im obsessed!</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t have a bad streaking problem, nor is the ato too bad..</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> I had the worst burnt skin smell after tanning that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
<li> I have the worst time trying to tan.</li>
<li> The smells is horrible</li>

    <li> Really does make you 5 shades darker! I use it on my face, and body and get really tan. I also Follow up with Playboy tan extending daily moisturizer in the 22 oz, im obsessed!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome- I started using it because its smell isn&#x27;t as terrible as many other tanning bed oils, and I just feel it properly moisturizes my skin while giving great color.  The one tube I got from an online purchase smelled terribly, and left yellowy marks on my skin, and I&#x27;m sure if I had let it get on my clothes it would have done the same. Looked like he had just gotten some old bottles at a discount? or filled this bottle with other lotion? Just be careful buying this from individual sellers at an unbelievable low price- you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local tanning salon and instantly fell in love &lt;3 ! Im insanely pale and was affraid I would turn orange. So I hopped into the tanning bed for my first time, and I instantly saw results. I dont know about five shades darker like the bottle says because they would only let me go in the tanning bed for three minutes! However I did have, \\&quot;Sun kissed skin.\\&quot; just after my first time! After a few times I was getting that nice tanned look. However a tip for beginners: rub in a circular motion or else you will get a patch of orange. I went to a special occasion and I got so many compliments on my tan, and how good it looked I was extremely happy. It also works in the sun, I applied it to myself before laying in the sun on the beach and the next day I was extremely dark. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is def the way to go, u save half the price if u order here, and free shipping... So if u want the best tan you have to have this.</li>
    <li> Love the color it gives you!! One of the best lotions I have ever found for color. The scent isnt the best but but for the color you get it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
    <li> Love it won&#x27;t use nothing but this</li>
    <li> Very professional, fast and caring. Because of them I would buy any other lotion. I def recommend doing business with them.</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used yet but my mother has and she has gotten darker in two days than me in a week!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have never tanned so much in my life so quickly! I use this, the blue bottle of Playboy boost face tanning lotion and the Playboy after tan moisturizer in the white bottle. These three combined will give you the best tan you&#x27;ll ever have! The shipping was super fast too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this lotion before and loved it. It&#x27;s a dark bronzer and works really well with my skin even though I have fair skin. I would definitely recommend this lotion</li>
    <li> If you want a tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave brown streaks and smells awesome, this is the lotion for you.&lt;br /&gt;The tanning salon in which I tan has little lighting.  Even if I wanted to take the time to ensure my lotion distribution was even, it&#x27;s not possible.  No worries with this lotion, as you won&#x27;t get the uneven streaks other lotions may leave behind.  The scent is perfect:  it&#x27;s not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine paid twice as much for this identical bottle of lotion at her tanning salon as I did.  Who doesn&#x27;t like a good deal?!</li>
    <li> This lotion gives you dark color after a couple uses. (tan regularly: 3 or more times a week)</li>
    <li> I purchaced this at my salon, and I spent over 40$ for it there... I wouldn&#x27;t even pay Amazon price for it.. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a bad streaking problem, nor is the ato too bad..but the lotion in general just stinks, like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;It has no, fruity or floral scent to cover the \\&quot;Tanner dha\\&quot; smell.. It sorta smells like burnt butter, with a singe of sugar.&lt;br /&gt;Gross. I hate using it, and the hue is a bit orangy for me (fair skinmed with freckles, with a  good base tan already)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a lot of bronzer, use jwoww.. It has a solid BROWN color to it. Or Kardashians. I am not fond of them as people, but great product.&lt;br /&gt;Non bronzing accelerator, my fave is Phoenician, or juicy gossip by designer skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased playboy boost 5 shades darker about a month ago I love it I love lotions with a lot of bronzer if your looking to get instant color and you love instant bronzer this is the lotion for you!! it definitely gets you darker with one tanning session I give playboy boost 4 stars. playboy boost is great it gives you great color!! buy it today don&#x27;t wait to get dark everyone looks good with a nice tan!!</li>
    <li> ive used many many bronzers, this bronzer is most definately up in the top darkest. not orange, brown. the only down fall i have ran into with this product is its very sticky. like any bronzer, rub in very nicely. it&#x27;s good for both indoor and outdoor. remember when your using bronzer to rotate with a normal lotion without bronzer. you don&#x27;t want steaks. the smell is also good, not like burnt skin smell. also, don&#x27;t shower for at least four hours after when using bronzer or it will wash off your \\&quot;tan.\\&quot; for beginners or advanced tanners, like myself. MUCH cheaper here than in salons! i highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I noticed after i got out of my tanning bed i had orange streaks on my arms and i rubbed it in forever. The smells is horrible it smells like the self tanners that you buy from walmart. Never buying again...</li>
    <li> heres the pros and cons when i use this lotion:&lt;br /&gt;cons-&lt;br /&gt;its not the best smelling lotion&lt;br /&gt;kind of slimy&lt;br /&gt;can have some streaking (but comes off)&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;gets me my darkest than any other lotion (ive bought top brand stuff)&lt;br /&gt;color that lasts&lt;br /&gt;great price since its not a \\&quot;top lotion\\&quot; but can still get the results of one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in my opinion, if a lotion is getting me tan especially as dark as this one makes me, its good enough for me!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this lotion because I thought it would be really great. I was very disappointed. You have to spend a ton of time rubbing it in or you will be streaked orange the next day. I had the worst burnt skin smell after tanning that I&#x27;ve ever had. I bought a different lotion after only a week of having this. I&#x27;m not going to finish this one that&#x27;s how much I disliked it.</li>
    <li> This product is a decent tanning lotion, the price is fair, I would order it again, would hope they do not discontinue</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. I tanned \\&quot;indoors\\&quot; for the first time today in about 10 years. I used the super-tanning bed for 12 mintues, and along with this lotion, I am seeing the results now...just three hours later. IMPRESSESED!</li>
    <li> It is a low quality, cheap bronzer that stinks and smells like something you would buy at K-Mart next to Emerald Bay.  It works and I already paid for it so I keep it in the car as a back up.  Not excited to own it now that I have tried it</li>
    <li> I have the worst time trying to tan. I usually burn and peel. A sweet lady at my tanning salon offered me this product and I immediately fell in love. After about a week, I started to see results of my once white skin starting to brown. It has a descent smell and leaves your skin feeling super soft. I have NO complaints about this product. This is the FIRST tanning bed lotion I have ever used that has actually worked for me. I would recommend it to any of my pale skinned friends.</li>
