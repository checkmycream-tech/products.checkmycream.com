<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this! Scrubs all of the dead skin cells from your body in the shower and dries very fast. Lasts for a long time. If I stop using this for a bit and then start again, I can actually see the dry skin on the towel. Skin in super soft and ready for lotion. These are especially good if you self tan also. Scrub your knees, ankles, wrists and your ready to apply. Also good to remove that last little bit of spotty tan areas with some moisturizing body wash, or any boo boos or streaks.</li>
    <li> The cloth is the right texture and is a lot better than the one I bought at the store. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I love these scrubbers ALOT!!!!!! Great sale too!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliating cloth I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin is so soft now.</li>
    <li> I love this bath towel! It is super exfoliating yet gentle and is easy to use. I love that it can be scrunched  up like a bath puff or used open for areas like the back. It washes out super easy  and drains/ dries quickly. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Ok I bought this on a whim and let me tell you......I was and still am shocked as to how great this is. It really isn&#x27;t a towel it&#x27;s more like a scarf but it is the best shower accessory ever! After one use you will feel baby soft.....seriously!!!! I washed mine prior to use and throw it in the washing machine one a week and air dry.  Get this you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought one of these for all the women I know.  It keeps your skin incredibly soft and glowy, evening up skin tone and unclogging pores. I especially like this brand because of the very coarse SUPER HARD weave and the size. They are large enough to exfoliate your back without too much effort.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this washcloth. My skin feels so soft and clean and I have even gotten comments about how it looks from customers at work. The cloth is a little rough but for me it didn&#x27;t really take any getting used to, it just felt like it was exfoliating really well! It also dries out really easily just hanging in the shower so you don&#x27;t get problems with mold or anything. I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and it is just now starting to come apart a bit, just a couple fibers falling out but still very usable. 5 stars, would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use it in shower to rinse off my dead skin to avoid wrinkles and it seems work. My friend told me, as he compared my high school picture and present one (77 years old), that only difference is my bold head and white mustache.</li>
    <li> November 2011 update:   I purchased from Amazon a product called \\&quot;Skin Polishing Exfoliating Bath Towel (12 count/sa23001x12)\\&quot;.  They come 12 to a package and ARE THE SAME THING as the Cure towels for a heck of a lot less money.  Copy/paste \\&quot;  Skin Polishing Exfoliating Bath Towel (12 count/sa23001x12)  \\&quot; into Amazon search to bring them up.  They are great.  They are a tad rougher feeling than the Spa Sister towels but have the exact feeling of the Cure towels (not the dark blue ones).    I purchased 7 (Cure series) from veryasian (some for my family) and 4 Skin Polishing Towels (Spa Sisters) (am buying more for my family) from Ebubbles (See Amazon review for them).    The Spa Sisters skin polishing towels have one exfoliating towel size.  I measured each at (33 3/4\\&quot; long and 10 3/8\\&quot; wide) and one exfoliating coarseness towel level.  They come in 5 PASTEL colors lavender, white, pink, blue and dark blue.  I purchased 2 lavender and 2 light blue.    The Cure series has 2 exfoliating towel sizes (I measured 11\\&quot; wide and 42 7/8\\&quot; long for green and DARK BLUE VERY COURSE 11\\&quot; wide and 4&#x27; long.  Supposedly the Cure Series comes in 3 exfoliating coarseness levels &#x3D; Medium and Hard and Very Hard.  I purchased 2 DARK BLUE VERY HARD.  And I purchased  2 pink and 2 green and have no idea whether they are medium or hard course levels and no other company selling them knew of a difference except Amazon sellers and I spoke with several sellers including veryasian where I eventually purchased them.  The regular blue, pink and green color nylon towels feel the same to me with the VERY DARK blue towel feeling VERY hard.    Recently purchased in my grocery store for two dollars EACH the Cala Spa Body Care Bath towels which come in white, blue and several colors also and are EXACTLY like Cure series.  Again I am sticking to Spa Sisters on my face but these Cala Spa bath towels by Winston-Salem NC industries for the blind are great also.    Buy CURE towels at veryasian on sale $3.99for VERY HARD DARK BLUE  and $3.49 for all others. Shipping was cheaper also.   I like all Spa Sister and Cure Series towels. The nylon weave pattern appears exactly the same on all of them.    The difference in texture between the CURE Series green/pink/regular blue nylon towels and the Spa Sister nylon towels feels the same with maybe the CURE colors being slightly rougher.  The Cure Series has a slightly wider fold (The 2 ends of a nylon towel that are folded over and sewn down) and are longer.  See above measurements.   BUT BUT BUT,  I admit to confusion on how to tell the DIFFERENCE IF there is a difference between the CURE medium coarseness towels versus the CURE hard coarseness towels.  Cure Series clearly points out the DARK BLUE color is VERY HARD coarseness and is a 4&#x27;x 1&#x27; long.  But, CURE Series is very confusing on giving consumers AND their sellers (I called several vendors and no one knew the difference) the information to tell the difference between the medium and hard coarseness levels of the pink, regular blue and green colors.  The packages are written in Japanese-no help there.  No other Cure Series sellers but Amazon distinguish between medium and hard coarseness CURE Series towels and I have no idea which ones I purchased from Very Asia as they feel exactly the same to me except as noted the VERY DARK BLUE is VERY HARD.    Since my facial skin is VERY SENSITIVE, I use the SPA SISTER ebubbles skin polishing towels on my face (not taking any chances) and the VERY DARK HARD CURE on my back and any of the other color CURE Series or Spa Sister towels everywhere else.  All these towels make your skin feel as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.    I unwrapped a truly ancient bar of Ivory soap found in the back of my towel closet which a regular cloth washcloth would not lather up at all.  Both Spa Sister and The Cure lathered up this old Ivory bar into a mass of suds.  THIS WAS SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!!    Bottom line.  I would NOT use The Cure series on my face buton the rest of my body. I would use the Spa Sisters on my face and entire body. Both nylon towels make your skin feel so smooth and clean.    NOTE:  I threw out those nylon balls which completely pale in comparison to the Spa Sisters and Cure Series nylon towels and threw out that mitt on a stick (that kept falling off) so-called back scrubber.</li>
    <li> GREAT! I can really tell the difference after I use this towel. It&#x27;s large and able to get all around my rather large frame. I can&#x27;t wait to get another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old male who was looking for a wash cloth that was both masculine as well as effective. This thing really did the trick! Foams up with minimal bodywash usage and is in no way TOO hard on the skin at all. With that being said, if the only thing preventing you from purchasing this particular coarseness/color is fear of how rough it will be on the skin I assure you, you should have no worries.</li>
    <li> I like to come out of the shower feeling really clean.  This one is too soft and I feel it doesn&#x27;t clean me that well.</li>
    <li> This is the third brand bath cloth I have bought and it&#x27;s exactly what I had been looking for: it&#x27;s rough (but not too rough), and not heavy while using. The green and pink 110cm Cure towels are the leyije length.  I also tried out the blue one which is a little longer, but this is personal preference.  I prefer the blue for normal use and the green / pink length for traveling, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about the other two brands:&lt;br /&gt;- leyijie towels: it&#x27;s like using sandpaper&lt;br /&gt;- aquis: good feel, but the material is too absorbent which makes it too heavy to use comfortably</li>
    <li> excellent exfoliator for the back. It helps you reach hard to reach places !</li>
    <li> I like this product - it works well</li>
    <li> I was looking for a harsh exfoliating towel, and this met the bill! Had this towel for about eight months now and am just looking at getting a new one. My current one still works great, but I need to have a second in stock for when it needs to be replace it!  I should clarify that I do not use this product daily. Just 2-3 times a week. There is some separation in the weaving, but otherwise holding up well.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and love to exploitate BUY this. I have been disappointed before with ones I feel like &amp;#34;conditioned&amp;#34; my skin and did not help take away layers of dry/dead skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bad boy definitely is rough (so don&#x27;t over do it). Works great for me since I&#x27;m extremely active and hate buildup on my skin from sweat and skin lotions like olive oil and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This is the quality one to buy. The others that are priced at something like 2 or 3 for $12 are cheap copies and go soft very quickly. This one stays firm with its texture.</li>
    <li> Every Summer, my back gets a type of rash called &#x27;prickly heat.&#x27; It results in terrible itching and small pimples that are very annoying. This washcloth is the best one I&#x27;ve found for helping relieve this problem. The extra large size is easy to use.</li>
    <li> After reading good reviews on this, I decided to try this towel. I didn&#x27;t realize it would be long (as in long winter scarf dimensions) instead of square like a regular towel. So, for me, in first place it&#x27;s too awkward to use as a towel. Also, for me, the texture feels too uncomfortable to use as a towel. Instead, I use a corner as a face scrub cloth in lieu of a loofah which does pretty good. If these were made the size of a washcloth, I&#x27;d rate it better. Also, not long after I got this, I saw similar ones at the 99 cent store...</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. This works great! The texture is just right, I use it with African Black Soap mostly. But I have used it with other soaps/bodywash it does fine. It does a great job at helping to clear up any bumps: razor, acne, backs of arms, etc. Its not to harsh, not too soft. Its great for scrubbing off the clinical deo that I swear is waterproof these days. I spray tan a lot, and it works nicely to remove that once its fading. Its a huge towel! I plan to cut it and sew it into about 3-4 different pieces ( like washcloth sized). Is about 12&amp;#34; wide by 3ft long. I wash it about once a week. It has held up great! Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Its really nice on your back to get a good scrubbing. My husband enjoys it too. I think it will be even better in summer when skin is oily. I bought this since it was cheap, I was looking at a Turkish bath mitt that was like $20! This works just as well!</li>
    <li> I bought several of these towels.  Never heard of the brand, but I couldn&#x27;t find the kind I was using anywhere.  No matter, I like this one so much better than the brand I have been using for the past five years.  Texture is great, and the best part is the size.  It&#x27;s quite a bit bigger than my old brand.  That might not be important to most folk, but I am a big guy.  The size makes it easy to grab an end with each hand and really scrub my back.  Sweet.</li>
    <li> This cloth is not very coarse and doesn&#x27;t really scrub as well as the one in the other shade of turquoise.  My fault for making the wrong selection.</li>
    <li> I loved this, I was afraid I would get the wrong towel based on some of the reviews, but I was relieved that I acquired exactly what was in the picture. The weave was perfect, and well constructed. I enjoy a rough washcloth that actually exfoliates, and this is great.</li>
    <li> Overall, I highly recommend Japanese exfoliating bath towels. They are easy to use, even easier to keep clean and their portability makes them perfect for weekend hotel stays or camping trips when the standard washcloth just isn&#x27;t up to the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller lists these exfoliating bath towels in three categories: &#x27;Super Hard&#x27; (blue), &#x27;Hard&#x27; (green and pink) and &#x27;Medium&#x27; (yellow and blue). Pay close attention to the kanji symbols on the front of the package. The Japanese description (chou katame) in the supplied photo is correct for &#x27;Super Hard.&#x27; I ordered the &#x27;Super Hard&#x27; weave, however the towel received was labeled &#x27;futsu,&#x27; which means a normal weave grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the item. I contacted the seller to ask if they could ensure shipment of the correct weave but I did not receive a response, so I found another supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with exfoliating bath towels with normal weave grade but once you have tried the &#x27;chou katame&#x27; variety you won&#x27;t return to softer grades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Three stars (two stars deducted for mistaken shipment and lack of customer service).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JULY 2013 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this bath towel a couple more times since the experience detailed above with no problems regarding the weave grade. I raised my review rating from three stars to five stars as a result of these additional (positive) experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially recommend this bath towel for campers and hikers. The towel dries quickly. It is great for cleaning off trail dust and mud with a minimum of soap and water.</li>
    <li> You can find comparable products for around $6, but these are nice. They are extra long, dry very fast, and require very little body wash to produce a good lather. These are a must for any shower.</li>
    <li> She uses these due to exfoliating properties.  It is a bit &#x27;rough,&#x27; so it does the job well.  These also last pretty well, at least a few months apiece before needing replacement with another.  I bought a few packs at a time, so I should be good for a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are pretty large, so you can wash quite a bit of surface area at once, or ball it up a bit.  As far as bath towels go, these are top notch, and hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I got fulfillment from &amp;#34;ZACCA SIZO.&amp;#34;  I someone else complain of incorrect &#x27;hardness of the weave&#x27; - this one seemed to get it right.</li>
    <li> This is being sent to my grandson who took his mom&#x27;s from her Christmas gift package!!!  Who would have thought so many would want the item!!!  Great service.</li>
    <li> There are many of these available now ... but this one is the best.  Strong, durable and a full foot longer than the ones we used to use, which makes the  &amp;#34;cleaning your back&amp;#34; easy.</li>
    <li> This is a thicker gauge than most bathing clothes sold on the internet.  I am very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating bath towel works particularly well after you take a bath but I also use it every day when I take a shower. It does a great job removing dead skin cells but it&#x27;s a little coarse, so I would only recommend it for your body, not your face. I use it with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.</li>
    <li> It is described as having a super hard weave. That&#x27;s not a case at all and after you&#x27;ve been using Salux cloths this one feels too gentle on your skin. I don&#x27;t even like it for my face.</li>
    <li> Obsessed. Keeps my skin smooth and free of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I am in love with it and I can tell it is helping my skin.</li>
    <li> Much prefer Salux. Was looking forward to the &amp;#34;super hard weave&amp;#34; advertised, for those days when I really want a good scratching &amp; exfoliating. However, it was medium soft. Not bad, but not as robust as I had been led to expect by the name.</li>
    <li> This is it. got rid of all my loofa and shower poofs.</li>
    <li> Not really my cup of tea.  I do love the exfoliating/scrubby washcloth mitts, but this thing is an awkward mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to be about 6 feet long, and flooffed out in volume once it was removed from the packaging.  It was OK in the shower - definitely easy to scrub your back - but it was so long that it was a bit dysfunctional otherwise.  It sort of flings soap and water everywhere, and with the length, cold water drips on you from the ends unless you wad it up into a big basketball and scrub with it that way.  The texture was much mushier than a standard exfoliating cloth.  I would call this more of a fluffy loofa than a true exfoliating cloth.  Doesn&#x27;t really dry well unless you string it around the shower, which doesn&#x27;t look very tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away after two uses.</li>
    <li> I love this cloth.  I also bought more for family members.  Does a great job on your back but scrunch it up and use it all over your body and your skin will love it.  I use a good quality body wash &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream!  My skin is soft, smooth, and glowing.  I even used it gently on my face with no issues.  It arrived in 1 day!!!  I will order from you again!  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $50 on another product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, as I&#x27;ve seen these things priced much higher. But it&#x27;s easily worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It&#x27;s texture feels nice, just rough enough to feel pleasant without feeling &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34;. It lathers my soap wonderfully, keeps my skin soft and smooth, and is large enough to make cleaning my back a breeze. It&#x27;s a bit too harsh for use on your face, but keeps the rest of me clean and happy.</li>
    <li> This is just like the towels you get from the korean spa, but bigger!  The longer size makes it easier to scrub your back, as well as get any other harder to reach places.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this towel to replace my poofy and have never looked back.  After a year of use, I am still using the same towel.  I launder it and keep using it.  Either my body is used to the exfoliating action, or it has lost some of it&#x27;s stiffness, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> These Japanese towels are the perfect exfoliating towel used with any body cleanser. It&#x27;s really exfoliating and makes your skin soft and new. The length allows for you to really clean and exfoliate your back...much better than any brush ever has. I will re-order many more!!!! Great price and the perfect size! Love to use with bath gels.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than the shower puff things, because it&#x27;s long enough to easily scrub your back. It&#x27;s pretty scratchy when you first get it, if you&#x27;re not used to using something like this, but then you get used to it, and it works really well. I left mine in a hotel room, and I liked this so much, I had to order a replacement.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about getting the hard weave.  After reading reviews I purchased the hard weave and glad I did.  It is not that hard and after getting it wet and with some body wash it was great. The towel is pretty big about the size of a hand towel but twice as long, so no problem wrapping it around to reach your back.  Skin felt very refreshed and clean afterwards. Body wash rinsed out very quickly and hung it on a hook to dry which did not take very long to dry.</li>
    <li> I love it an use it daily.</li>
    <li> Love this towel drys quickly so no extra laundry and long enough to reach back and light weight , buy now!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, just as described by seller. Item arrived on time, and I am completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Real product from Japan, and not fake imitation.&lt;br /&gt;Taking a Bath with exfoliating towel will never be the same.</li>
    <li> great product - it really does exfoliate and my skin feels so soft afterwards. I would highly recommend. it is long so you can cut in half and have two.</li>
    <li> Good quality exfoliating towel; have used mine every shower and only after a year is it starting to need replacement.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of abrasiveness and it definitely feels cleansing. The blue color fades after awhile but that&#x27;s kind of a given. If you&#x27;re looking at an exfoliating bath towel, look no further as these are the real deal.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an exfoliating towel, and while this particular is quite large, I do like the texture, which is not too soft, but not painful cheese grater hard either. I get the best results using it towards the end of my bath or shower, you get more dead skin that way.</li>
    <li> love this towel.  this is the hard weave i&#x27;ve been looking for.  it&#x27;s a bit long for me, but i fold it in 4 when i use it, til i get my back, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I love it, just what I wanted and needed, the right amount of roughness.  I wish they also had it in different color.</li>
    <li> Great scrubber!  Exfoliates dead skin very well.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed , I thought I was getting something better than the Salux that I have been using over twenty years . The different is , the OHE is longer and to me it&#x27;s softer than the Salux</li>
    <li> Great towel - hope it becomes available in more than cobalt blue, which I must admit, is a lovely color too!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about this towel feeling it through the package. when I took a shower and scrub my skin with this towel I saw all the dead skin wash down the drain. I&#x27;m impressed. And it isn&#x27;t scratchy or painful either</li>
    <li> Everyone is different so you must experiment to find the weave that fits your likes best. The super hard is like a hard loofa in feel sort of. Its rough to get the job done, and will be the desired one for most people. I can see how some would want the lesser weave, and how could it hurt to have more than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very thin but sure is durable. Easy to clean, just rinse out and hang it. Instantly makes your skin feel smoother, who knew.</li>
    <li> I bought this towel mainly out of curiosity than anything else, however after the first time I used it the roughness felt nice like if it scratched an itch and felt relief (I know this sounds weird but I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it). I&#x27;m used to using loofahs but I now prefer these towels. they are pretty long that I use it to scrub my back and it lathers with minimal soap. After use it rinses really easy as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the KP that I have on my arms and legs.  WOW, this bath towel is awesome.  Never had a anything to soften up and exfoliate my skin like this bath towel!  No scrub, loofah or brush has made my dry dehydrated skin feel this good.  I use it morning and night.  Love it!  It also get&#x27;s the blood flowing to the skin, which is nice and healthy.  Will buy one for my daughter who has KP as well.</li>
    <li> These did not come with English instructions, but I read a couple reviews that explained them. They work better than I expected. My first one I cut in half, but that was a mistake. It started to fray. It works better folded over anyway, I think it makes it foam up more. I really like how these remove dead and dry skin. I found these on a Recommended For You list on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It feels good on the skin. Not too hard</li>
    <li> I like this, it&#x27;s really long so you can easily exfoliate your butt and back in the shower. I can see that it&#x27;s making a big different in my skin. Simple and quality.</li>
    <li> Kind of rough on certain parts of soft skin like my tummy, but it makes everything feel EXTREMELY smooth after a shower or bath!&lt;br /&gt;There is enough of the towel to get those hard-to-reach spots on my back, and that&#x27;s AFTER I cut it in half and gave some of the towel to my roommate for her to try too! We both love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is impossible to beat. I am a college student, so price is an extremely large part of the decisions I make when buying something. That being said, I love my exfoliating towel and would buy again in a heartbeat if I had to!</li>
    <li> I was doubtful when buying this product that it would even be decent, but am glad I did as I really like it. I always hate that loofas only last a small period of time and are hard to rinse off so end up getting gross fast (plus I’m a germ freak). This product scrubs well - I actually like it better than a loofa, and is easy to rinse and hang.</li>
    <li> Best one yet to really clean your skin. Makes your shower towel a clean and smooth feeling to your bodys skin. Get one and be happy.</li>
    <li> does not work like described</li>
    <li> What makes this item better than normal puff scrubbers is that when hung up it can dry quickly and that&#x27;s more sanitary.</li>
    <li> Non abrasive and does a good job exfoliation my skin</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I am very glad I purchased it. I would like to buy many of these and give them out as gifts to people I like and care about. I am not sure if they would understand or appreciate it, but I know I do. I use it and my skin is very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like the exfoliating sensation and it makes me feel cleaner rather than using a regular wash cloth. I didnt give it five stars because the product is very thin and lengthy so I have to fold it several times before using it to wash.</li>
    <li> Since I discovered these these a few years ago, it&#x27;s all I have used in my daily shower. I like the dark blue(super hard) towel best. It might be a little rough the first time or two you use it but you quickly get used to the level of &#x27;abrasion&#x27;. I&#x27;m so attached to mine they have become an essential item to take with me when I travel (helps that they pack small &amp; light).</li>
    <li> Great exfoliation, great length, and great durability.  Must&#x27;ve purchased like ten of these for myself and others.  Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> Okay I was a bit afraid of not getting the genuine article but the product is made in Japan and it gives a nice brusque wash (not painful but you know you are scrubbed).  I like the texture and after leaving the shower I feel that I did a decent job of exfoliating. This in combination with a great skin cream will have your summer arms and legs looking silky and without a flake of dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have bought bath towels from Target in the past and they lose the roughness to them within a week. I have had this for almost a year now and it is still just as rough as when I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Best thing EVAAA! It is perfectly rough and long enough to use on your back. After my first use, my skin felt ultra, ULTRA smooth and will continue til I die... You all NEED this in your life!!!</li>
    <li> very good quality. and it is  big I&#x27;m ordering more. but it is a little bit expensive. not very tough like other similer bath towel,</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  Excellent exfoliation all based on how hard you scrub. Way better than a buff puff and appears to be virtually indestructible. Rinses clean unlike buff puffs do.  Item arrived quickly, packaged just as pictured.</li>
    <li> We have used these &amp;#34;body scrubbers&amp;#34; for 25 years.so much better than a wash cloth. That said, I am very picky about the ones I purchase. I bought this in case the ones I found online weren&#x27;t what I like. This one turned out to be so much better than I expected. Very long and nice and rough. Will order more.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Live my skin soft and last for a long time,</li>
    <li> Super Hard weave was only moderately hard weave to me.  Looking for something with even a little more bite to get a good scrub on.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for a good scrub down - I have very resilient, thick(er) skin so this is just the right coarseness to allow for a super clean wash. I landscape and I also work in a night club so the grime can be heavy upon returning home. I WOULD NOT suggest this for use on the face or for those with thin or sensitive skin. I&#x27;m able to use it daily, however. Tip to save water: use a bucket; fill while letting the body get thoroughly wet; apply face wash and allow it to sit; apply body wash to cloth; TURN OFF WATER leaving bucket full while you give yourself a good scrub down; rinse body with bucket water [you won&#x27;t need to really use the bucket water much, more for back-up] and finally one more time with a quick, COLD shower. Cuts down time and saves money! I also buy body wash by the gallon [EO Brand] which saves A LOT of money as it lasts for six months or more.</li>
    <li> Loofahs always get gross over time and it&#x27;s hard to thoroughly clean them. This allows you to ball it up like a loofah but then wash it like a towel and it dries very quickly. Feel more sanitary. Probably not safe for dryer if you need to wash it.</li>
    <li> I have used the light weight versi&amp;oacute;n of these wash cloths for years, and have got 6 months to a year out of them before they started to tear.  These are much more durable, and clean more agressively.....  I had a problem with itchy, alligator skin on my back, a result of cronic sunburn in the tropics.  The dermatalogists wanted to peel the skin with a l&amp;aacute;ser (expensive and painful), but 3 months of hot showers and scrubbing with these heavy duty scrubbers, no more itching, and nice smooth baby skin on my back.  After 6 months the cloth is still like new.....I will be buying more of these.</li>
    <li> 1. no back scrubber needed anymore because it is able to cover a large surface area&lt;br /&gt;2. can fold this towel into approx 12 x 12 washcloth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin exfoliated and smooth</li>
    <li> Love it. Have been using another brand for years. These are better. Longer,thicker and more hygienic.</li>
    <li> This bath scrubber hurts but your skin adapts. I have KP on my arms which results in redness and bumpiness. I use this bath scrubber with essential oils on my arms and scrub a dub away in the shower and my bumps are 90% gone. My arms have never been so smooth!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Perfect for body. Be careful on face, it&#x27;s really exfoliating.</li>
    <li> I had been using a body scrub to exfoliate, but decided to try out one of these scrub towels. This one worked wonderfully and my skin felt so much smoother after using it, more so than after using a scrub. I will continue to use this once a week as I dont wont to over do it.</li>
    <li> EVENTHOUGH this says \\&quot;super hard weave\\&quot;, it was the right texture for me. This exfoliates very well.  Leaves my skin very soft.  Makes my showers very refreshing!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting my whole life for this product. Loofahs are a joke. Buy this thing! Scratches perfectly, doesn&#x27;t hurt. Great product, the best.</li>
    <li> Great product and love the fact you can rinse and re-use.  Had the same one for 3 months now and finally going to pitch and open the next.  Beats having to use and wash a washcloth, and much better than those puff things my wife uses.  Bought her the pink one&#x27;s of these and she&#x27;s a convert too.</li>
    <li> Oh, how good this feels during a long winter with dry skin. Not only is it great for the back, but I now use it on my face to exfoliate. And since it&#x27;s long and not bulky, you can &amp;quot;polish&amp;quot; your legs like a barber with ease!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. As described.</li>
    <li> very rough (in a good way) nylon exfoliating towel for the shower. works as indicated. very large towel. able to scrub entire back nicely, too.</li>
    <li> This is the only way I will wash myself now--I refuse to use a washcloth or a traditional loofah. This works so well and leaves my skin feeling so TIGHT and CLEAN!! It has CURED my skin of annoying bumps on the backs of my legs caused by wearing sweaty, tight workout clothes (I am a college distance runner.) It INCREASES CIRCULATION and speeds healing, while reducing the occurence of ingrown hairs. I use it to massage my tired, sore feet and muscles in the shower after workouts and it makes them RECOVER FASTER and feel better sooner. It also allows me to USE LESS SOAP because, unlike washcloths, the soap does not absorb and disappear into the material. I wash it about once a week to keep it free of bacteria. It is LONG so I can wash my back effortlessly!&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER STOP USING this product!</li>
    <li> WOW, this exfoliating bath towel works very well.  I have tried numerous soap sacks, sisal towels and then just done compare to the Cure series.  It does an excellent job of exfoliating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, you want be disappointment.</li>
    <li> I gifted this to my mom, and she thanked me BIG for giving this to her.  It is such a great towel, keeps my skin the softest.  I had KP on the back of my arms for years and year, never knowing what to do.  I finally was told about glytone scrub and lotion, and needed a great exfoliating pad to use on my arms in the shower.  This has completely taken away all of my bumps and I couldn&#x27;t feel better about it.  I also had a few bumps here and there on my legs, and they are also gone.  Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the whole body!</li>
    <li> Way better than cotton wash cloths</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to always scrubing myself with sugar or apricot scrubs.  But this does the job to and make enought suds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years and my back has been looking it&#x27;s greatest. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this amazing product and at such  good deal.</li>
    <li> Wow. I love this product!  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, so cannot comment on how well it will hold up to use, but I can say that I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensation of scrubbing my own back with this perfectly rough towel is intense - tingly - electric - sparkly - wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel is quite lightweight, dries easily, and is plenty long enough for me to scrub my own back.  I&#x27;m a pretty large person (5&#x27; 8&amp;#34; and over 200 lbs with broad shoulders) and I have no problem grabbing both ends and getting the job done.  And not just on my back, of course - all over.  I can already see that the icky  &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on the backs of my upper arms is being smoothed away.  Terrific buy!</li>
    <li> very good. and nice color. it feels soft.</li>
    <li> its ok does the job but the one I had before was better</li>
    <li> Love this! 1. It&#x27;s huge! 2. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean...I just toss it in my washer once a week. 3. It works!</li>
    <li> This is the best made exfoliating wash cloth that I have found anywhere. The surface is the roughest and longest lasting that I have found after trying several other varieties.  I love the large size of the wash cloth and the fact it stays \\&quot;rough\\&quot; for months.  Easily rinses and stays clean and odor free.  Nothing else comes close to this wash cloth in terms of true exfoliating action and long lasting wear.</li>
    <li> It sounds ridiculous, but I pumped some foaming soap on there, and used it like a wash cloth, and it felt so luxurious. Not hard, (I have the blue one), not scratchy, but I still felt squeaky clean. I. Love it.</li>
    <li> I love this! It has been months, maybe a year? Since I bought this and I have been using it almost weekly (don&#x27;t exfoliate every day) and it works great. If it is your first time using it be prepared to see a lot of nasty stuff come off. Once you use it regularly you obviously won&#x27;t accumulate that much dirt (ugh). I just throw this in my laundry weekly or bi-weekly to wash it and it comes out fine, the edges have unraveled a bit but its super long and still useful! I take this with me on vacations too!. I use it pretty vigorously on my body but I  do have a high pain tolerance! Be more careful on your face, it is pretty harsh and you would probably just want to very lightly use this there. Its the best exfoliater (real word?) that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this exfoliating cloth! Works really well and lasts a long time. Even makes the callouses on elbows smoother</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliator for the body!  It takes only a small amount of body wash to really lather up and get me clean!  My skin craves the scrubbing from this!</li>
    <li> Just love this...it makes my skin feel so nice and pampered! It&#x27;s the perfect texture and super long...at first I thought it was going to be too rough, but once you&#x27;re in the shower and you try it...it&#x27;s just right. It leaves you feeling like you just had a spa treatment! Get it...</li>
    <li> This towel was twice as long as I had expected and wanted, but that was easily remedied by cutting it in half. Now I have a spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the length, I have nothing to complain about this towel. It provides the right amount of abrasion to get a good, clean, scrub!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence about trying out this cloth.  I had been using a different one (the Earth Therapeutics Exfoliating Hydro Cloth) for a while, it was a bit cheaper and was getting the job done just fine.  However, I&#x27;d been hearing all these great things about the various brands of Japanese exfoliating cloths and how they are the best cloths you can get...so I said why not, and splurged on this particular cloth (I wanted the super hard weave, I guess I&#x27;m a bit of a masochist).  Let me tell you, this thing is AMAZING.  My original attitude was \\&quot;come on, how much better or different can one cloth be from another?!\\&quot;  VERY different and WAY better!  First of all, this cloth is huge, which I love.  You will have absolutely no problem reaching any part of your body with this thing, I don&#x27;t even have to open it all the way to wash my back with it.  You only need a small amount of cleanser to get a ton of lather and the cloth rinses clean very easily and it also dries quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about mold/bacteria infesting it.  I love the super hard weave as well- you don&#x27;t need to use a crazy amount of elbow grease and you&#x27;ll still get great, invigorating exfoliation.  And don&#x27;t let the name deter you either- my skin tends to be on the dry sensitive side but I&#x27;ve used this cloth several times already and haven&#x27;t had any issues with redness or irritation from the super hard weave.  My skin has never been softer, smoother, or more glowy and healthy looking from any other exfoliating product I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m hooked for life, this thing is totally worth the cost and I wholeheartedly recommend it!  X-D</li>
    <li> Great, way longer than the one I was replacing.</li>
    <li> i never review anything i buy, but this i must. a little more than a week of use and big acne no longer pops on my face. all with regular once a day use. my face was also pretty battered from compulsive face picking. all marks are now gone or fading away noticeably lighter. one of the best $10 i&#x27;ve spent.</li>
    <li> Great product to have in the shower with you!  Durable and Cleans pores very well and does not irritate skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second nylon bath towel. They are just amazing! They are not only easier to clean and more sanitary than loofahs, they are compact and great for scrubbing your back and other hard to reach areas. When they get dirty you can just throw them in the washing machine! I got the Super Hard Weave which, in my opinion, isn&#x27;t that super hard as I have sensitive skin. I feel more clean than I ever have with a loofah or washcloth and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it! You&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> This bath towel is so sufficient and easy to use in the shower I love it.  The towel is long and I can literally wash and reach every inch of my back with it.  I was weary about the towel being a &amp;#34;Super Hard&amp;#34; weave, but it&#x27;s actually gentle on the skin.  Just need a little cleanser to work up a good lather.  Before using this towel my back had very minor acne and since using the towel it&#x27;s noticeably almost disappeared.  It works really well to remove dead skin.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I originally used the Salux cloths. Those things are amazing! After using them, regular washcloths are no longer sufficient. But these Cure Series cloths are doubly amazing! First of all, they&#x27;re almost twice the size. I pulled it out of the packaging, and it was like a sheet! They&#x27;re longer and wider than Salux. Secondly, they&#x27;re a little more heavy-duty than Salux. Not TOO much, though. But if you&#x27;re using the Salux cloth, you might notice that they feel softer after a while. I guess I was just getting used to them. The Cure Series just seems like a step up on the exfoliating spectrum! LOL! Purchase with confidence, because these things ROCK!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this body scrubber because it is really long and it is easy to scrub my body with ease. My other body scrubber was shorter and it was uncomfortable to scrub behind my back but with this one that I bought it is so much easier and lathers up pretty good. I&#x27;m glad I made a good investment in this and probably won&#x27;t buy another one for a while :)</li>
    <li> I use this every morning with a gentle cleanser and it&#x27;s awesome. It exfoliates dead skin and leaves me feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> These towels are really good. My skin feels smooth after I use them. And I think these clean really well too.</li>
    <li> For over forty years I have been addicted to this nylon wash rag.  After two Asian markets, I went home and found it on Amazon.  These are great!  You use so much less soap and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> This thing has held up for months. It is time for me to purchase again. It has really helped to increase cell turnover all over my body and my skin just feels wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> Perfect texture for me. A little rougher than most I&#x27;ve found. The length is perfect for scrubbing your back. When you are done using this your skin tingles telling you thatit&#x27;s all clean.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to a loofah. Loofah Schmoofah. This is amazing. Soaps lather well - clears off dead skin easily - I feel softer and cleaner. I use this in conjunction with unscented aloe lotion by Avalon botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the desert.. and I don&#x27;t drink enough water..  :) My lower legs were dry and flaky... my thighs constantly itched.. forehead was dry.. This has all but eliminated that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used it with liquid soaps and bar soaps. Its amazing.</li>
    <li> This towel is nice and long, but a bit too rough for my skin, so I exchanged it for the pink version which was much softer, but still long and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Looking for Deep Exfoliation? Need a good Back Scrub but no one free to land a hand? Tired of those old Loofas that just seem to fall apart? Look no further, The Cure is here!</li>
    <li> This is the best addition to a shower routine. My skin hasn never felt so soft. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> perfect for big fat dudes like me</li>
    <li> This is the perfect wash towel.  The nylon dries very quickly and the texture is perfect for exfoliating dry skin that I have b/c of diabetes.  The large size allows me to wash my back perfectly especially considering I have arthritis and sometimes find it hard to reach behind me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just right to give a wonderful tingly feeling that exfoliates greatly. I will buy more for the rest of the family.</li>
    <li> This works, but the weave does not feel as good as the pink and it left my skin a little dry, which does not happen with the pink Salux.  I plan to buy another pink Salux, but would not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> the towel is so thin, which is great for fast drying but i wish it was a little thicker. it&#x27;s nearly see through and feels a bit cheap.</li>
    <li> Love this! Long enough to scrub my back. Not stiff but flexible but has great scrubbing power. Will never go back to using loofahs or anything else!</li>
    <li> This towel is wonderful . it buffed my skin and I was able to reach places I haven&#x27;t been able to in years and I am buying another one!</li>
    <li> Not at rough as what I thought it would be but it&#x27;s still nice. It&#x27;s just right I would say. Not too soft or too rough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update this in a few months to make my final decision, but after using it for the first time this afternoon it seems like a great exfoliating towel.&lt;br /&gt;Having never used any sort of exfoliator on my skin, I will compare this to one of those dish washing sponges with the mesh on the outside, it definitely has a bit of a scratch to it when I used it on my skin, which is what I wanted. It is large, large enough for me to use it on my back easily (again, exactly what I wanted it for), but it is also easy enough to fold it down to whatever size you need to reach and target any part of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few negative reviews criticized the fact that it loses some of its \\&quot;scratchiness\\&quot; in water, which I found to be untrue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for my first exfoliating product, I could not be happier, and definitely like how rough this is on my skin.</li>
    <li> Great rough textured wash cloth. Although 120cm is a little long for me, I recommend this product to anyone who is sick of washing with one of those fluffy loofah ball things. Also more hygenic. Yeah!</li>
    <li> This is the one. I&#x27;ve used these for 30 years. Many other brands have no &#x27;tooth&#x27; to them and are worthless. This one is perfect. My last one of these lasted at least three years of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Who needs a loufa or a brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I need to buy these so infrequently I often wind up purchasing one of the scrubbers that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best of its kind. Never buying any other brand. Wider, longer, harder weave than all other brands. A Virtual Massage. I found it quite by accident, and I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Not only an excellent back scratcher, but big enough for a large man.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews about how awesome this thing was, I had high hopes for it being some kind of miracle exfoliating cloth. When I opened it, I was disappointed. It&#x27;s the same size and texture as the ones they sell at every drug store in America. It&#x27;s not new and improved, it&#x27;s just the same old thing that I&#x27;ve bought and thrown away several times.   After using it for a few weeks, I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s slightly better than the kind they sell at Fred Meyer. No miracle, but not as horrible as it could have been. make sure to order  the ultra stiff variety. It&#x27;s not ultra stiff, it just sucks the least. The softer ones are total junk. if you have never owned one these before you might be more impressesed than I was, but it&#x27;s  nothing new.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Wasn&#x27;t sure about it when I ordered it but its really easy to clean your back with this thing(especially the part berween your shoulders that is impossible to reach). Just the right amount of scratchiness. I was using a back scrubber brush but this is much easier and quicker. I&#x27;ll probably pick up another one when it wears out.</li>
    <li> The weave is rough as promised but it is also thinner than I was hoping. I was expecting a thicker cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will work short term and is very long as I hoped. I wish it were a bit thicker. This is going to fall apart or unravel pretty fast. The weave does not seem as tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to add- The weave became loose after a month of use. It is still useable, but less than when it was tight.</li>
    <li> I am happy to have found this type of bath towel again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Japanese exfoliating towels, but this one seems the best so far. The optimum toughness with massaging effect. Really feels clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> This has replaced my bath loofah, I like how well it exfoliates and makes my skin feel invigorated (it&#x27;s rough enough to make your skin red so you know it&#x27;s really exfoliating well.) I really have trouble reaching my back and the consequence of that is I break out back there and this helps me reach that one area and keep those pores from unnessesary clogging. I really prefer this to a loofah, I haven&#x27;t used one since I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this for about 10 months now and I never use anything else. I even take it with me when I travel. Nearly every week (unless I forget) I throw it in the wash in a delicates bag with my towels just to get it extra clean. Unbelievably it is still in great shape. I did snag it on the hook I was keeping it on bit after losing a few strings it stopped unraveling and still works just fine. I do think it has gotten softer with use though. I keep thinking I should buy another one to replace this but since it is still working great I keep putting it off. These people have a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*pics added to show what 10 months of daily use looks like.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this type of exfoliating wash rag so many years ago in the most pleasant way - by my then Korean girl friend.  Just to see it hanging on the shower now brings back very pleasant memories of oriental baths and showers for two - it almost brings tears to my eyes.  There is nothing like a back scrubber that is alive and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I digress.  Back to the cloth - these exfoliating wash rags are very common in Asia, but often very hard to find locally in the US.  I am glad to see so many offered by Amazon.com.  This one is huge, area wise, and should last a very long time.  While it says \\&quot;super hard weave,\\&quot; when it is wet, I find it just right for me - not to soft, and not to hard.  It is long enough so that you can also easily use it by yourself on your back, and even on the bottom of your feet.  They are perfect for those with flaky, dry skin -- they remove dead skin without harming the live skin underneath - as long as you aren&#x27;t too aggressive with it.  And it is gentle enough to use on your face - but again, don&#x27;t be too aggressive with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents who use these on their children should not use pressure, because used too aggressively can damage a child&#x27;s skin.  It would better to allow the child to wash themselves so they could adjust the pressure to suit themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product, at a good price.  The only thing better would be a beautiful Asian back scrubber to apply it.  I would highly recommend this too my friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after all the good reviews on amazon.  That is why I love amazon I can usually make a very informed choice before I purchase something.  This scrubby towel is great.  Especially if you have ketoris pelosis or however you spell that, little bumps on your arms possibly legs.  My kids and I have it and this really helps scrub it away.  I feel very clean after a shower.</li>
    <li> So I though that \\&quot;Super Hard Weave\\&quot; meant it was going to be like my Italy Towels but maybe a little bigger.... its not. While it is bigger it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate even half as well as their Korean counter part. :( I do like to use it for my back though!!! Haha it is too awks to have someone exfoliating your back at the bathhouses here!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what this thing was I just tried it because it was inexpensive and I love to exfoliate. Well it&#x27;s amazing, I felt so clean after using it. I love it.</li>
    <li> Guys, listen up. You really need to experience this noise. If you&#x27;re just rubbing a bar of soap on your skin, forget it, that&#x27;s doing nothing - except leaving you the same dirty, stinking, emotionally stunted heap of hair and bad manners you were before...only now dripping wet. And isn&#x27;t that attractive?! Oh, and don&#x27;t try something stupid like cutting it in half to get \\&quot;more for less\\&quot; (I know most of you will think about it like I did). Leave it in one piece and finally feel what it&#x27;s like to actually wash your back - whether you look like a lady or Sasquatch back there! Now stop laughing - you know you&#x27;re a Sasquatch anyway - and click to order already! (Written by Music Daddy, not Mommy)</li>
    <li> This is great to exfoliate. The length is very good since it can be used as a backscrubber too. A little soap goes a long way. I have had it several months and it is still in good shape.</li>
    <li> it exfoliates really well. And it lasts.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered the super hard weave. I need a a rough surface for scrubbing my back and legs. The length is great to be able to reach your back.</li>
    <li> I like it better than the green exfoliates because this one makes suds. Great exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This is the best bath towel ever! After a shower, my skin feel softer and smoother. Also, it does wonders for your feet!&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this I didn&#x27;t know it existed. Now I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I think this is a generic. I&#x27;ve purchased others that have buffed much better.</li>
    <li> who would have thought this thing works! I use it with liquid black soap and my skin has never been softer and I have never felt cleaner. I feel invigorated in the morning.</li>
    <li> Really looked forward to this item, but it was actually a bit awkward to use. It probably has more to do with personal preference.  The texture of the material is great.  No mold issues.  Overall good item.</li>
    <li> What can i say ! This towel is so amazing. Easy to use and easy to clean. Also it makes your skin so clean and soft. Throw all your loofa and body brushes and buy this . I will recommend this to my family.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Make sure from Japan not China when purchasing.</li>
    <li> I previously used the stimulite bath mitt for a few years, but just couldn&#x27;t justify a $30 replacement.  So I browsed amazon and figured this was worth a try.  So far, I really like it.  Very invigorating, and my skin feels smoother and cleaner.  The towel is a weird shape though.  I think I will be cutting mine in half.</li>
    <li> Love the texture and how it exfoliates the skin. Husband had never used anything to exfoliate before and his skin looks so much better. I know one review said this towel was not long but I&#x27;m not sure if he was talking about the same product. My husband and I have no problem with the length and are able to get our backs with pulling it back and forth over and under our arms. Great towel and would highly recommend. My exfoliating mesh gloves were pretty dated and thought this would be good for me and it seems to do the same work.</li>
    <li> Love this exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Excellent cloth that really exfoliates my body. I works better than any chemical exfoliant. The cloth is skinny and long, like a scarf. I first found this to be very odd until my friend told me that this allows one to swing the cloth across the back and give a nice clean. No complaints! Definite repurchase!</li>
    <li> This is huge and very nice. Leaves you with a nice clean feeling. Definately rebuy. Worth every penny I spent</li>
    <li> Although the English writing on the front is somewhat iffy and humorous in its nature, this exfoliating bath towel works exceptionally well. It&#x27;s very large length-wise, is in no way too rough on the skin, and dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> I had a similar cloth that my dog took out to the yard and I cannot find it... so I needed another one ASAP.  I picked this one as the replacement because I liked the longer length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cloth makes you feel SO MUCH CLEANER than using a standard cotton washcloth when showering.  It creates quite a rich lather in the cloth (even with regular bar soap), exfoliates your skin and makes your skin squeaky clean (literally) - like it is polishing your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long length allows you to thoroughly wash your own back, which is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the fact that this is a flat cloth, you can easily rinse out the soap and hang it to dry to use over for a few uses, between washes.  These cloths are SO MUCH better than those \\&quot;Poofs\\&quot; that you can buy everywhere... those are great for lathering, but they soon are just icky to use.</li>
    <li> I love these! At first, when I opened it up I thought is was cheap and a waste of money but I decided to give it a try. They are long and thin so you can wad them up like a poof or grab each end and scrub your back. The texture is awesome and my skin was so smooth afterwards. It was wonderful with my soap and made it really lather up. I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
    <li> This is extremely small. Its completely useless</li>
    <li> This Japanese bath towel is an aid in reaching one&#x27;s back, scrubbing the head, or other areas of the body. The slightly abrasive material works wonders that a soft wash cloth fails to do.</li>
    <li> Just like the harsh little green Korean scrubbies I grew up with.  The trick is to soak in extremely hot water for 10 or more minutes before attempting to exfoliate layers of skin.</li>
    <li> good size and perfect texture. I purchased 4 additional ones after receiving the first one. would recommend to anyone who likes this type of wash cloth.</li>
    <li> You can spend $3 at Target for a scrub towel, and you&#x27;ll get $3 worth of use from it.  Spend $8 on this scrub towel and you&#x27;ll get a lot more than just $9 worth of use out of it!  It&#x27;s long and thick, with a good texture for the whole body and for me, great for my face as well.  But if you have sensitive or delicate skin on your face you might want one of the less coarse towels in this line.  In the long run I have no doubt I&#x27;ll be using this scrubby towel a lot longer than the $3 Target one I just tossed out because it was already unraveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy a 3-pack next, then I won&#x27;t need to buy another one for at least a year or so.  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy scrubbing to ya!</li>
    <li> it feels so good on my back.&lt;br /&gt;you know youre getting a good clean when it feels like your getting a good back scratch and youre not even itchy.&lt;br /&gt; it is perfect. and i use very little of my body wash when i use it. double plus</li>
