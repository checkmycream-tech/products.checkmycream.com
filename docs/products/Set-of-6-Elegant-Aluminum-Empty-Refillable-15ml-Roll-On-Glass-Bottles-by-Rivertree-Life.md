      <li>I am using the essential oils that is says it is great for.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to order these</li>

      <li>Pretty bottles and worked well for awhile.</li>
      <li>the light purple will most likely be used with a lavender essential oil, and carrier oil, and the others so on.  </li>
      <li>can easily get the lid off when my arthritis is acting up!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was looking for some little glass bottles with a roller applicator to be able to mix carrier oil with essential oils, and to be able to carry the bottle with me where ever I go.</li>
      <li>The roller ball applicator is NOT plastic, it&#x27;s stainless steel, which is encased in a white plastic insert that snaps into the bottle once it&#x27;s filled .</li>
      <li>Really like these roll ons.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for trying though.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m changing my 5 stars to 4, because I still do love these bottles, and this is the only one out of three that I&#x27;ve used so far to do this...</li>
      <li>I used the green one, with the tree tea oil and grapeseed, so I kind of planned it to color cordinate the bottle to the type of EO I put in it...</li>
      <li>I was excited to have a product to pour my essential oils into, and make blends.  </li>
      <li>I love these roll-on bottles for my personal essential oil blends.  </li>
      <li>The essential oils just ate right through the adhesive holding everything together.</li>
      <li>a quick strip on our son&#x27;s feet (he&#x27;s 5) takes longer than it does for me to grab each individual bottle and do separate drops on each foot because I can&#x27;t get the roller to work properly.</li>
      <li>They make using essential oils discreet as they look like a tube of lipstick or a large pen in your bag .  </li>
      <li>Cannot use certain essential oils with this product.</li>
      <li>These bottles are fantastically made, they are a clear glass with a colored aluminum outer shell.</li>
      <li>The bottles are very nice looking, but I have used 3 so far and two of them have had the ball fall out while using it and my expensive oil spilled all over my chair once and all over my child the second time.</li>
      <li>I would recommend these highly, and I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second set...</li>
      <li>and I could actually see how much oil I had left in the container.  </li>
      <li>When I examined it, it appears that somehow my oil leaked down from the top where it rolls out, down into the aluminum cover</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of them so far.</li>
      <li>I have only had the chance to use one of them so far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using 3 of these little bottles, and I do love them, however on one of them (red one), after a week and a half of using it with carrier oil/essential oil blend, I was using it last night and somehow the bottom part or the Red Aluminum outer shell came unglued</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these roll-on bottles for my personal essential oil blends.  They are a great size &amp; the colors are beautiful.  The metal balls for the roll-on application work well.  I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some little glass bottles with a roller applicator to be able to mix carrier oil with essential oils, and to be able to carry the bottle with me where ever I go. These are perfect..  I ordered this pack of six and they have superseded my expectations. These bottles are fantastically made, they are a clear glass with a colored aluminum outer shell. The roller ball applicator is NOT plastic, it&#x27;s stainless steel, which is encased in a white plastic insert that snaps into the bottle once it&#x27;s filled . I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the applicator, it rolls across my skin dispensing the oils just fine.  How I used it was I dropped about 12 drops of my tea tree oil into the bottle then I filled it up with 15ml of grape-seed carrier oil, using a 3.0ml pipette, it took 5 fills to fill it. At first the insert holding the roller ball was a little hard to push inside the bottle, but I realized I had to turn it as I pushed down, and it went right in...the matching aluminum lid screwed right on like a charm...I love these bottles, even tho I&#x27;ve only used one of them so far. I used the green one, with the tree tea oil and grapeseed, so I kind of planned it to color cordinate the bottle to the type of EO I put in it...the light purple will most likely be used with a lavender essential oil, and carrier oil, and the others so on.  I chose these bottles because of their color, the design of the aluminum OVER glass, the metal roller ball, and because I could get six different colored ones in one order...I would recommend these highly, and I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second set...LOVE THEM!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update and Edit, March 27, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve been using 3 of these little bottles, and I do love them, however on one of them (red one), after a week and a half of using it with carrier oil/essential oil blend, I was using it last night and somehow the bottom part or the Red Aluminum outer shell came unglued, it actually came off in my hand exposing the glass bottle and I could actually see how much oil I had left in the container.  Also when the bottom came off, the silver middle piece did too, and all I had was the glass bottle with the white metal ball insert still intact.  When I examined it, it appears that somehow my oil leaked down from the top where it rolls out, down into the aluminum cover and I guess it was enough to make it unglued, there was sticky glue residue around the bottle where those two pieces were placed.  So I&#x27;m changing my 5 stars to 4, because I still do love these bottles, and this is the only one out of three that I&#x27;ve used so far to do this...</li>
    <li> Great bottles. I had one that came out of the case but just needs to be glued back. Perfect for essential oils</li>
    <li> Ball fell out of one about 2 weeks after I started using it. They will leak so keep them upright.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order these so I could color code my essential oil blends and use the handy roll on applicator with stainless steel (better for essential oils) roller balls.  The bottles are very nice looking, but I have used 3 so far and two of them have had the ball fall out while using it and my expensive oil spilled all over my chair once and all over my child the second time. I would not buy these again, nor recommend them.</li>
    <li> After using these for several weeks, I found that they leak and the essential oil blends caused the glue to separate the bottle and cover. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Really like these roll ons.  They make using essential oils discreet as they look like a tube of lipstick or a large pen in your bag .  My son takes one to school with him that has his anti anxiety blend and he can apply as needed.  He thinks it looks cool in his favorite color red.  My only complaint is that one of the metal outer casings came loose and I had to reglue it to the glass inner tube.  Not a huge problem, but a little disappointing.  Did not effect the utility of the roll ons..they have never leaked.</li>
    <li> I have only had the chance to use one of them so far.  After using it for 2 weeks, the cap is hard to screw off.  It stays attached to the inside bottle and it leaks.  I am using the essential oils that is says it is great for.</li>
    <li> These are terrible! One came broken and all but one of them has fallen apart. Either the roller ball won&#x27;t stay in or the tube has separated from the glass. I even avoided citrus oils in them so I would not recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I love the look and size, but I have 2 which leak... for no apparent reason  :(</li>
    <li> Pretty bottles and worked well for awhile. The aluminum outside now slides off the glass bottles. The lids do the same. Its impossible to get the lids to come off sometimes since the aluminum tops just slide around. Bottles leak now and not able to keep in my purse, which was the purpose. I understand the concept of these and really enjoyed them while they worked and they are very pretty, but ultimately now useless. The essential oils just ate right through the adhesive holding everything together. Thanks for trying though.</li>
    <li> Nothing but problems - Leak - fall apart......  Cool idea but product was a disappointment and an expense as I lost expense oils from leaking out of these containers.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these! I color coded the blends so mine is the purple, my son has the blue one and my husband got the silver one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine for about two months and have not had any issues with roller balls falling out or leakage.&lt;br /&gt;I can easily get the lid off when my arthritis is acting up!&lt;br /&gt;I need another set!</li>
    <li> I like the metal rollers but the container shape is a little hmmmm &amp;#34;awkward&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought these with the intent of being able to have 2 roller bottles per person (family of 3) and we could each pick our colors, making it easier to remember which bottle belonged to which person. LOVE the colors but that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple roller bottles that I ordered that came premixed in the roller bottle....those work great! Unfortunately with these I have to force the ball to get it rolling.....a quick strip on our son&#x27;s feet (he&#x27;s 5) takes longer than it does for me to grab each individual bottle and do separate drops on each foot because I can&#x27;t get the roller to work properly.</li>
    <li> These bottles are beautiful.  I was excited to have a product to pour my essential oils into, and make blends.  Loved the idea of simply rolling the oil onto the area of body needed... but I was horrified the *first time* the roller ball fell out of the bottle... thus causing ALL of my oil to spill out of the bottle and onto me!  This has happened numerous times.  Oils are NOT cheap, so I was rather upset to find 10-15 ml of oils go to waste!  I now find myself frustrated having wasted more oils, than the cost of these bottles.  I would search elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 of these bottles roller ball fall out and one of the bottles leaked oils. I had originally got these so my daughter could take it to school and use her oils during the day if needed for focusing. These bottles will not work. They are ok if you just have them sitting on a counter but can not be put in a bag or be laying on there sides.</li>
    <li> Plastic lined. Cannot use certain essential oils with this product.</li>
    <li> So pretty and so useful. I am enjoying them as much as my clients. Very pretty and handy as well as easy to use and reuse</li>
    <li> I like the colors and the rollers work just fine my only concern has been that they leak when laid on there side so you can&#x27;t just toss them in your purse and go. They must stay upright at all times unless you want beautiful smells in anything they lay on.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT roller bottle! I have had it on its side over a week to test it and NO leaking!! Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Would love to try theses, have heard great things.</li>
