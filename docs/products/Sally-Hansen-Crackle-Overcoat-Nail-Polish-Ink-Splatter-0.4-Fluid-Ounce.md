      <li>I have used it over the Avon colour sunshine and it  gives me a nice cheetah mosaic look.</li>
      <li>I am super HAPPY.</li>
      <li>and all I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
      <li>and there will be too many crackles</li>
      <li>the more it cracks.</li>
      <li>and I totally love it.</li>
      <li>I BOUGHT THREE MORE COLORS.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works much better than the blue we have, and crackles perfectly.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>However, I didn&#x27;t use a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like this one better than</li>
      <li>HANSEN&#x27;S IS FAR BETTER!!</li>
      <li>Got it super quick use it all the time!!</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t make mistakes, and if you do, you have to clean off all nail polish and start again.</li>
      <li>Dries quick too.</li>
      <li>Personally I like the look of large crackles better, since it is more noticeable.  </li>

      <li>Exactly as expected, looks great with red background.</li>
      <li>I have very shakey hands</li>
      <li>It was delivered MUCH sooner than my confirmation email stated.</li>
      <li>I really like this polish..</li>
      <li>Work fast</li>
      <li>It is very sticky and lumpy.</li>
      <li>It takes some practice to get the right amount on - and you only have one shot before it starts to crackle.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, worth the buy!</li>
      <li>I simply cannot live without it!</li>
      <li>Once dry, the black appears matte so definitely use a shiny top coat.</li>
      <li>Was skeptical about any other crackle besides Opi, but this is a good replacement.</li>
      <li>and you will only get a few large crackles.  </li>

<li> MY OPI NAIL POLISH WAS VERY THICK AND GOOPED UP VERY FAST</li>
<li> It&#x27;s jet black, it&#x27;s not grey.</li>
<li> I am kind of diapointed. :(</li>
<li> My only complaint is that you have to put it on in one coat.</li>

<li> Lots of little cracks.</li>
<li> I had to be careful not to put a coat that was to thick on, but it did what it was supposed to.</li>
<li> IT COMPLETELY DRIED</li>
<li> I bought this at Target a few days ago.</li>
<li> I watched a few video&#x27;s on Youtube to decide which I wanted to try.</li>
<li> It works OK, but it is really disgusting to use it sometimes.</li>
<li> One bottle was dried out no good</li>
<li> Too thick of a coat</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t seem too thick until I reached my pinkie.</li>
<li> Too thin of a coat</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work over glitter polish and now my toes just look like they&#x27;re moldy.</li>

    <li> I bought this product in the store and I totally love it. I have used it over the Avon colour sunshine and it  gives me a nice cheetah mosaic look.</li>
    <li> I have very shakey hands so if I take too long doing my nails I notice that the polish gets a bit thick and sticky, but otherwise the end results are great. Was skeptical about any other crackle besides Opi, but this is a good replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target a few days ago. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work over glitter polish and now my toes just look like they&#x27;re moldy.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED BOTH SALLY HANSEN AND OPI CRACKLE POLISHES AND SALLY HANSEN&#x27;S VERSION HANDS DOWN IS MUCH BETTER! IT&#x27;S THINNER AND CRACKS MUCH MUCH NICER! MY OPI NAIL POLISH WAS VERY THICK AND GOOPED UP VERY FAST AND AFTER A MONTH OF SITTING IN MY CABINET IT COMPLETELY DRIED UP!SALLY HANSEN&#x27;S IS FAR BETTER!!</li>
    <li> I had to be careful not to put a coat that was to thick on, but it did what it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected, looks great with red background.</li>
    <li> I got this polish at Walgreen&#x27;s for cheaper than the price without shipping. So if you can buy in store I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the way this crackled. I watched a few video&#x27;s on Youtube to decide which I wanted to try. It turned out great on my toes with a light thin coat. Lots of little cracks. I did a thicker coat on my fingernails and the result was a bigger crack. I posted pics so you can see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It didn&#x27;t seem too thick until I reached my pinkie. Work fast and you&#x27;ll have no problems. Remember roll the polish in your hands vs shaking before you apply.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great. Looks great</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. IT CRACKELS IN SECONDS. I BOUGHT THREE MORE COLORS. THE GOLD AND THE SILVER. I WOULD RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> This polish is absolutely amazing! I used it over Confetti&#x27;s #89 (Beach Dancing), and my nails looked amazing! They were chip-free for about 2 days (with constant wear,) but then the Confetti started to chip. However, I didn&#x27;t use a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I also wore it over Sally Hansen Lustre Shine #5 Plume, (which may be discontinued,) but it looked way better over Beach Dancing. This is a great crackle polish with an equally great price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well. The thinner the coat  the more it cracks. Dries quick too. It&#x27;s jet black, it&#x27;s not grey. Perfect if you want some flair to your nails.</li>
    <li> I simply cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> I really like this polish..I got my order on time ..very satisfied..</li>
    <li> I was so excited to buy this, but now I know it was a total waste of $7!!! It is very sticky and lumpy. It works OK, but it is really disgusting to use it sometimes. At times, the lid won&#x27;t even come off!! I am kind of diapointed. :(</li>
    <li> I have used this before, loved it then and love it now. It was delivered MUCH sooner than my confirmation email stated. I am super HAPPY.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift. It arrived the day before Christmas - before it was even expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works much better than the blue we have, and crackles perfectly. My only complaint is that you have to put it on in one coat. You can&#x27;t make mistakes, and if you do, you have to clean off all nail polish and start again. Other than that, worth the buy!</li>
    <li> One bottle was dried out no good</li>
    <li> This product is best used over a light nail polish, otherwise the crackle effect does not show up as well.  I have used it over pink and orange (for Halloween) and it looked pretty nice.  It takes some practice to get the right amount on - and you only have one shot before it starts to crackle.  Too thin of a coat and there will be too many crackles and the black will be too transparent.  Too thick of a coat and you will only get a few large crackles.  Personally I like the look of large crackles better, since it is more noticeable.  Once dry, the black appears matte so definitely use a shiny top coat.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Got it super quick use it all the time!! I like this one better than OPI&#x27;s crackle believe it or not!</li>
