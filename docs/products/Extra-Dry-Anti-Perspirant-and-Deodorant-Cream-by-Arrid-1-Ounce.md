      <li>it keeps the feet dry, and that keeps them blister free.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it for underarm deodorant; I find it uncomfortable and not as good as the modern stuff.  </li>
      <li>Creamier than I like for everyday but easy for travel.</li>
      <li>Applied to feet prior to heavy hiking (I love to backpack in the Sierra Nevada)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very active person, I&#x27;m on my feet constantly at work with a hands on job, I love playing sports and doing my daily workouts.</li>

      <li>If you have tried everything with no help I highly suggest you try as you will see instant results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is extremely effective, just as well, if not better, than the other</li>
      <li>Great product, unfortunately getting more difficult to find in your local Walgreens or CVS.</li>
      <li>I transferred the contents to an an even smaller container (old dollar store Nivea cream container)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little sticky at first but gently absorbed a few minutes later.</li>
      <li>I used to buy the other \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; 9-10 bucks deodorants - and then one day I looked down on the shelf and there is this tiny cream right in the bottom.</li>

<li> you are looking for something that will keep you dry and fresh smelling all day long, something that will stop the excessive wetness that come with your daily activities</li>
<li> ARRID KEEPS ME DRY ALL DAY LONG and the next.</li>
<li> at least - so Amazon price is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> you try it - you will be singing its praises - being stinky-free doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive! :)</li>
<li> Very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> No more worries of soaking through my shirts, no more double checking under my arms, no more embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;There was no irritation when or after applying, goes on smooth no greasy feel and no worries of the white marks you get with other deodorants when putting your shirt on.</li>
<li> It was to the point I was beyond embarrassed for myself, when at work or when out I was constantly check my underarms and keeping my arms down.</li>
<li> My friend gave me a tip that if I use a small amount of Arrid Extra Dry cream on my hands it will eliminate the perspiring.  </li>
<li> I mean who wants to admit they have an excessive sweat issue, it&#x27;s embarrassing but...</li>
<li> Playing golf in hot humid weather can be difficult because as I heat up my hands perspire.  </li>
<li> so I bought this to cut down on bulk.</li>
<li> [I also like how it takes little room in the bathroom cabinet drawer.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
<li> , it smells slightly, but very little, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume if you go that</li>
<li> seriously can&#x27;t think of one single bad thing about this product - it works even though the packaging is not flashy and there is no million dollar promotion budget for this product.</li>
<li> It has stopped the excessive buckets of sweat I would produce.</li>
<li> When I backpack (usually for a week)</li>
<li> It has become hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> My husband has used this brand of deodorant cream for years and was unhappy when our local Wal-Mart quit stocking it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not good at controlling sweat, but I use another anti-perspirant at night for that</li>
<li> This product is very hard for me to find anymore.</li>

    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review I mean who wants to admit they have an excessive sweat issue, it&#x27;s embarrassing but... OMG!!! this stuff is effin AMAZING!!! I don&#x27;t think there are any words to describe how GREAT this stuff really is. I&#x27;m a very active person, I&#x27;m on my feet constantly at work with a hands on job, I love playing sports and doing my daily workouts. I wouldn&#x27;t so much get an odor more so I would have tiny amount of wetness but enough to sweat through. I noticed this becoming more and more of an issue, it could be winter and I could be freezing but I would still sweat through my sweatshirts and sweaters with just a tank underneath. It was to the point I was beyond embarrassed for myself, when at work or when out I was constantly check my underarms and keeping my arms down. There is nothing sexy about a girl with two huge pit stains. I did LOTS of research as I wasted tons on money on other popular name brand clinical strength deodorants that promised to help stop wetness and were nothing more than a huge let down. After reading tons of reviews I decided on 2, this being one. I seen this at my local CVS and purchased it. One of my BEST buys ever!!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, like it actually works. It has stopped the excessive buckets of sweat I would produce. ARRID KEEPS ME DRY ALL DAY LONG and the next. A little goes a long way and surprisingly it has a very pleasant scent. No more worries of soaking through my shirts, no more double checking under my arms, no more embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;There was no irritation when or after applying, goes on smooth no greasy feel and no worries of the white marks you get with other deodorants when putting your shirt on. Yes you have to apply with your hands but it washes off easy so no worries of a lingering oily/greasy feel. The scent is GREAT almost like powder fresh and unlike other deodorants that do the same ARRID, this is the only deodorant you need apply.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that will keep you dry and fresh smelling all day long, something that will stop the excessive wetness that come with your daily activities this is the stuff for you. If you have tried everything with no help I highly suggest you try as you will see instant results.nd fresh smelling all day long, something that will stop the excessive wetness that come with your daily activities this is the stuff for you.

    <li> Very good deodorant and antiperspirant, works great. Never leaves any residue on my clothes or anything like that. Very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger</li>
    <li> If you have tender underarm skin that reacts to alcohol based odorants, this is the one to use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several decades. It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
    <li> I have tried many deodorants in my lifetime and this is the only one that controls odor. I feel confident that even if I do perspire on the tennis court, There will be NO offending odor. Great product, unfortunately getting more difficult to find in your local Walgreens or CVS.</li>
    <li> Wow, so far so good! It&#x27;s not good at controlling sweat, but I use another anti-perspirant at night for that (I have a perspiration issue anyway). For the odor it is great! I didn&#x27;t think I would find anything to keep it under wraps. I was so embarrassed and had to take multiple showers throughout the day. Arrid has been the only thing so far that has been able to control it.</li>
    <li> I travel extremely light for trips so I bought this to cut down on bulk. Works great and is very compact for travel. The container could be even smaller but I guess they packaged it to make it look like there is more product inside than there really is. I transferred the contents to an an even smaller container (old dollar store Nivea cream container) so it&#x27;s even more compact (about 1/2 the thickness of the original container). I&#x27;ve been on several trips and still haven&#x27;t used it all.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this item.  It has become hard to find in stores.  Prefer it to roll ons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky at first but gently absorbed a few minutes later. I&#x27;m sure it is the most effective anti-perspirant. 감사합니다^^</li>
    <li> Good for hiking. Creamier than I like for everyday but easy for travel.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard for me to find anymore. It is the only product of this kind that works for me. I was pleased with the price at which I could obtain this product from the vendor. I would recommend this vendor to others.</li>
    <li> Glad that someone still carries a cream style deodorant...there are a lot elderly people who still like to use this &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; style of deodorant.</li>
    <li> Playing golf in hot humid weather can be difficult because as I heat up my hands perspire.  My friend gave me a tip that if I use a small amount of Arrid Extra Dry cream on my hands it will eliminate the perspiring.  I tried it and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is way too perfumed for me (a man).  The smell is so strong, that anyone standing nearby will be able to smell it.  I wish they would have made this unscented.</li>
    <li> Nice clean scent that doesn&#x27;t hang around for very long. This is the best anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m all set for Summer.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this brand of deodorant cream for years and was unhappy when our local Wal-Mart quit stocking it.  Amazon.com came through for us once again.</li>
    <li> This cream is a classic, the original antiperspirant cream sold by Arrid. In its day it was unique and the best on the market.  For most applications it has been replaced by various roll-ons and sprays.  However it is absolutely irreplaceable for one important application -- to prevent blisters.  Applied to feet prior to heavy hiking (I love to backpack in the Sierra Nevada) it keeps the feet dry, and that keeps them blister free.  The US army discovered this application, and it makes the product irreplaceable.  When I backpack (usually for a week) I carry a container of this cream with me and apply it every morning.  For someone like me who has suffered from blister problems for many years, it is a miracle.  I don&#x27;t use it for underarm deodorant; I find it uncomfortable and not as good as the modern stuff.  (one star)  But I hope they keep on carrying it forever.  For blister prevention, it is worth 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the other \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; 9-10 bucks deodorants - and then one day I looked down on the shelf and there is this tiny cream right in the bottom. I think I paid 5 bucks at least - so Amazon price is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a cream that you apply with your fingers to your pitty - so you can control the amount very well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells slightly, but very little, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume if you go that route.&lt;br /&gt;It is extremely effective, just as well, if not better, than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works! This amount will last you forever - I have had mine for 1 year...&lt;br /&gt;I seriously can&#x27;t think of one single bad thing about this product - it works even though the packaging is not flashy and there is no million dollar promotion budget for this product. [I also like how it takes little room in the bathroom cabinet drawer.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try it - you will be singing its praises - being stinky-free doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive! :)</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I would get sweaty still and the smell was overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving two stars instead of one because it might work for someone else, just not me.</li>
    <li> I remember this product from many years ago.  Still works well, easy to apply.</li>
