<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it a lot, It is sometimes uncomfortable to shape my goatee, but I guess I am really inexperienced.</li>
    <li> When I first started shaving I tried a Phillips/Norelco triple head electric razor, it didn&#x27;t do a very good job and gave me a nasty face rash.  Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been convinced that nothing beats a wet shave and a simple safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, due to a stay in hospital, I was forced to start dry shaving again and I have to say the Panasonic ES-LV81-K, which I chose after reading a bunch of other good reviews on Amazon, has made me a total convert.  This razor is awesome!  No skin complaints and easily as good a shave as the safety razors I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the simple controls, the ability to lock the floating head in one position, the charging stand and of course the built in automated cleaning system, which I&#x27;ve already tried and it seems to do a good job also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly the Emperor of electric razors.  My only criticism is the price, but then luxury cars don&#x27;t come cheap either.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  I used it for the 1st time last night over my head (I&#x27;m bald) and face, and it&#x27;s the closet shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.  It was just as close as a regular blade.  It cost a bit, but it is totally worth it.  I bought this as a replacement for my Norelco SensoTouch 3D.  It can&#x27;t compare!!  Thanks Panasonic!!  You definitely got this one right!!</li>
    <li> works well with lather in the shower.  Does not deliver the closeness I expected.  Way overpriced.  Should be about half the price charged.</li>
    <li> Very user friendly of all the electric razors I have used in the past 40 years this comes closest to a lathered shave cleaning with this razor is easy and efficient</li>
    <li> Good shaver. Came from using a Braun. I like the Panasonic cleaner refills, they are much smaller than Braun and you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling the liquid. Overall keeps shave close, not as close as a razor, but works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco and Braun, but I find Panasonic simply shaves closer.  You do get a bit more irritation; as the speed of the blades is much higher.  Norelco and Braun seems to sacrifice a close shave in favor of comfort.  Now, I don&#x27;t mean to say this shaver feels bad.  It doesn&#x27;t.  I just feel it pull a bit more as I shave.  A little after shave lotion works fine with no lingering irritation.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it. Best he has ever had</li>
    <li> I bought it and return it unopen.&lt;br /&gt;For the new series is into market, even it&#x27;s top product of its series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the new series has some new tech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decide to buy new middle instead of old top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunitly, amazon doesnt sold new, only 3rd seller does,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ill wait amazon to sell new series.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try after my older Panasonic 8228&#x27;s cleaning station broke. The 8228 has 3 blades, but the Arc5 has 5 blades. I thought the Arc5 would be better since it is their newest model. I tried shaving with the Arc5, but was disappointed. The large head is hard to maneuver around my face compared to the 8228, especially under my nose. The large head really only works well for straight, flat areas of my face. Also, the Arc5 left my face red and irritated. My fiancee noticed the redness immediately. The closeness also seemed to be the same as with my 8228. The extra cost for the Arc5 is not worth it when you can get the same results from a 3-blade model for much less also. I also do not really like the cleaning station with Panasonic shavers. I don&#x27;t think the water &amp; detergent system gets the shaver any cleaner than using the faucet.</li>
    <li> Exceeded My Expectations and Am Very Pleased Up To Now.</li>
    <li> Great shaver would recommend to friends</li>
    <li> I recently bought 2 razors for my husband and son; a replacement for my husband and a first razor for my son.  I bought Phillips Norelco rotary systems for both of therm based on their top reviews at the time.  While it may seem odd to some, I generally do the shopping in our family as my husband has neither the time nor patience to read reviews or comparison shop.  I do, and generally try to find the best product in whatever e are looking for.) Both of them were reasonably happy with the razors, and so my husband grudgingly tried this one (somewhat put off by all the bells and whistles and thinking of them as, more or less, window dressing).  He said that he had never used shaving cream or gel with an electric before or even considered it, BUT after trying it said that he did in fact get a closer smoother shave than with his old razor. While his old rotary was satisfactory, this was clearly a notch or 2 up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic has an automatic cleaning system, which I find a very nice feature (wish they had it on the women&#x27;s models) 5 blades, a flexible pivoting head  and a very fast motor 14,000 cpm.  It provides a clean, fast and comfortable shave, and then prepares itself for the next use. As one who has used several different multi-blade razors I have found the biggest issue to be cleaning,  the closer the blades the more likely they are to clog.  That said, I find the automatic cleaning component to be a very nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly expensive as razors go but as with other things each of us must balance the value of our time, the premium we put on comfort and safety and convenience against cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also note that while I would not have thought to look to  Panasonic for a razor, we have had exceptional experiences with the brand, also in an area where they were not a known entity: cameras.  I bought my first Panasonic Lumix 5 years ago, and our family now has 4 Lumix cameras (as a consequence of my experience).  They use very high end components (many come equipped with Leica lenses) and provide a nice combination of technology and high end components, finish level and design elements.  Panasonice seems to be continuing that trend with their new razors.  As I shopped for one for myself, I saw that in Women&#x27;s razors, Panasonics were the top 3 most highly rated.  Unfortunately I can not provide any personal experience here, as for some reason, Amazon will not ship them to Hawaii.  I can say that my experience with the brand has been exceptional: very high quality, durable, well designed products, so much so that everyone in my family bought Panasonic when it was time for a new camera.  With respect to this product, my husband is very happy with the razor, commenting on how close and clean a shave he got (with no nics) and I only wish Amazon was willing to ship one of their Women&#x27;s razors!  I guess for the time being I will have to settle for a well groomed husband and keep looking for a comparable product for myself!e equipped with Leica lenses) and provide a nice combination of technology and high end components, finish level and design elements.

    <li> The Panasonic electric shaver is by far the most expensive shaver I, or my husband, have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has a Panasonic (similar to this model but with fewer blades) and a Norelco with the three, round, floating heads. After using this Panasonic, he says that he thinks the Norelco gives the closest dry shave, but this Panasonic gives the best wet shave he has ever had and that it is as smooth and close as a regular razor. I use it on my underarms, wet and dry, and it is definitely the best electric shaver I have ever used. CAUTION: The users manual says not to share this shaver with others for sanitary reasons and I would never share it with anyone but my husband of almost 40 years. Even then, I clean it carefully after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a foil-style electric shaver. There is a huge difference between rotary style shavers and foil style shavers and how you shave with them. The user manual says that it takes a month to get used to a new shaver and when I first read that, I thought it sounded crazy. It&#x27;s not. Particularly if you are accustomed to using a regular razor or a rotary style shaver. My husband felt this shaver didn&#x27;t give as close a shave initially compared to his old shaver, but now after two weeks, he feels he gets an exceptional shave with it. I would caution anyone considering this shaver to understand that you may not be happy with your shave at first and to realize that any new shaver requires a commitment of daily use for at least a couple of weeks before deciding if you are pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is quite large and pivots in two directions, however you can lock the head so that it is stationary. My husband has found that locking the head is very helpful for shaving under the chin and neck. It is fairly loud, but not unpleasantly so. The handle is extremely comfortable. There is a pop-up trimmer that works fine - nothing special but does the job. There is a digital read-out on the handle which tells you how long each shave takes and how much battery life is left. (I thought the timer for how long your shave lasted was silly, but my husband and sons think it&#x27;s cool.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recharging/cleaning dock is one of the features that make this an exceptional shaving system. It will take up some real estate on your counter. It measures 3 3/4\\&quot;W x 5 1/4\\&quot;D x 7 3/4\\&quot;T with the shaver in the charging position. But it will charge, clean and dry your shaver for you with just the touch of a button. The shaver is held head down in the charging/cleaning/drying position via magnetic contacts. It takes about an hour to fully charge this shaver. Note: you can also plug the power cord directly into the bottom of the shaver, which is good for traveling because the cleaning station would be bulky and messy to transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head sits in a well that fills with cleaning solution when you initiate the cleaning process. The cleaning process automatically sets the shaver to sonic cleaning mode several times while it is cleaning. When cleaning is complete, a fan dries your shaver with heated air. Drying is important in my experience with foil shavers because it extends the life of the foils. The solid cleaning solution is in a small cartridge that you slide into the bottom of the cleaning station. It should last about 6 months. The back of the cleaning station has a slide out reservoir that you fill with water used to dissolve the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also clean this shaver by applying liquid soap to the foils and then setting your shaver to sonic cleaning mode. It produces a lot of foam and then you can remove the foil head and rinse the shaver clean. The emphasis on cleaning is important because regular cleaning keeps the blades sharp longer, prolongs the life of the foils, provides a closer and more comfortable shave, and is more sanitary to avoid minor skin infections. Cleanliness really IS next to godliness when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included is a custom fitted, zippered travel pouch and a snap-on plastic foil head protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this razor is a premium product at a premium price. Is it worth it? I would say that it depends upon whether or not it is comfortably within your budget. You will get a fine shave and the cleaning/charging station makes the whole process completely effortless, but the price seems a little high to me based upon other shavers with similar features.uded is a custom fitted, zippered travel pouch and a snap-on plastic foil head protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this razor is a premium product at a premium price.

    <li> Right when you think you&#x27;ve got the best razor out there, somebody has to go and come out with something 3x as expensive. The question then, is it 3x better? Let&#x27;s find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 790cc razor for over about 19 months. I know this because I just replaced my blade at the 18 month mark about two months ago. This ensures it had a fair comparison with the Panasonic, as it was obviously brand new. This is also my first Panasonic. I&#x27;ve been using various high-end Braun razors for many years. Once they were worn out, I replaced them with whatever was the latest and greatest. I like my high-end razors. But when I saw this razor was retailing for $600, I was naturally skeptical that it was worth the price. Fortunately, this was a review unit, as you can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, out of the box you have all of the usual expected items. Razor, blade, cleaning system, refill cartridge, etc. This is all basic, so I won&#x27;t go into too much detail. You just plug it in, charge, shave, clean. Repeat. I&#x27;ve been doing this for about a month to give it a fair comparison. They also suggest using a new razor for a month to allow your face to get used to it. However, compared to the Braun 790cc, which also had a fresh blade, there was really no adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s mostly because they use a similar cutting system. Except the Braun has a single larger cutter and the Panasonic uses 5 smaller ones. But not small enough. The head on the Panasonic is nearly twice as large as the Braun. Which is great for saving time on shaving most of your face, but it does make it more difficult to get into the tighter areas such as between the eye brows or under the nose. The head pivots in any direction that you&#x27;d like. Personally I&#x27;ve never found that to be as useful as it sounds. For everything else, the Panasonic wins, albeit by a slight margin. We&#x27;re talking about a few seconds less shave time in favor of the 5-blade cutting system of the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about noise and comfort? First thing you&#x27;ll notice when you turn it on is that the Panasonic is much, much quieter than the 790cc. It also vibrates much less. Braun uses this \\&quot;feature\\&quot; as a selling point claiming it&#x27;s supposed to help shaving. I always found it slightly annoying, but it is something I&#x27;ve gotten used to over the years. The Panasonic is quiet enough that you can really hear it cutting each hair (and letting you know you missed some spots). It&#x27;s also slightly smoother and just a little nicer to use on a regular basis. Another win for the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics. Braun wins. Between the unusual large head, slim body, and lack of a place to grasp it, the Panasonic is a little awkward to hold and switch positions. Sure, you do get used to it. But the Braun is much easier to hold in various position. I also keep finding that I&#x27;m pushing on the trimmer because it&#x27;s right behind the head, where you hold it. Win for the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miscellaneous features? The trimmer works comparably well. Although the Panasonic&#x27;s trimmer only likes going in one direction, otherwise it&#x27;ll try to close. Neither are the easiest to maneuver around your face, but they get the job done. How about the cleaning system? Well, that&#x27;s easy. The Panasonic wins here. It&#x27;s quieter (thanks to a quieter razor) and it&#x27;s nice enough to dry your razor after cleaning it. You also don&#x27;t have that alcohol smell that you&#x27;re left with the Braun. Both Razors also have LCD&#x27;s with interesting information that&#x27;s nice to have. But certainly something you could live without. Especially with the Panasonic as it has no memory and only displays battery/shaving time for a few seconds. The Panasonics display looks nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s wrap this up with some Pro&#x27;s and Con&#x27;s for the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Quiet and Smooth&lt;br /&gt;* 5-blade cutting system works&lt;br /&gt;* Cool looking blue LCD display&lt;br /&gt;* Every feature you could want in a razor&lt;br /&gt;* Fast and effective cutting&lt;br/&gt;* Improved cleaning &amp; drying system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Crazy expensive&lt;br /&gt;* Awkward ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;* LCD display could be more useful&lt;br /&gt;* Trimmer tends to close when moving \\&quot;upward\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the tricky part. Who wins? Based on the features and performance listed in the review, The Panasonic easily wins. But price versus performance, the Braun wins. While the Panasonic does have the clear edge in features and performance, it&#x27;s not enough to justify a $600 price tag when you can have an excellent Braun 7-series for around $200. I could easily go back to the Braun and not lose any sleep over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are in fact looking for the best razor money can buy, the Panasonic is the way to go. Not to mention I can only assume the price will go down on this one fairly soon. In either case, I know I&#x27;ll certainly continue using the Panasonic over the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE 5/16 ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to provide a quick update after some more time with the shaver. First, the shaver has been working great. I&#x27;ve just been servicing the cleaning system and replacing the filter as needed and it still works good as the day I got it. I have found that it works best if I start with a quick dry shave and complete a \\&quot;final pass\\&quot; with a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That seems to help reduce the number of \\&quot;passes\\&quot; along the skin and reduce irritation. Something you obviously can&#x27;t do with dry-only shavers. The only negative, which was mentioned in the first review, is that darn trimmer. If you move upward, it keeps closing, unless you make sure to keep your finger on it. Which isn&#x27;t super convenient given it&#x27;s ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, still a minor issue, but I just like to follow up with these type of reviews. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Its been 30 days since I received and began using my Panasonic shaver. I thought I owned a very good Braun Series 7, and seriously doubted that anything could be much better, even at three times the price. I&#x27;ve owned my current Braun for at least 5 years, and have always been a foil shaver user, although I&#x27;ve tested (and quickly given up on) a decent rotary shaver by Norelco, foil works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I turned on the Panasonic, it sounded like a turbocharged version of my old razor - the Panasonic&#x27;s F-18 whine made the poor old Braun sound like some poorly tuned Briggs and Stratton weedeater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, the first shave was a bit awkward. Since my Braun has a skinnier head, and the Panasonic is much wider, the actual movement required is different and takes some getting used to. Also the Panasonic tilts on two axis - allowing virtually any rotation, where the Braun only tilts front/back. Each day I became more accustomed with to how to hold it and my shave time became more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic got down to work right away with such speed and power that there was no tugging or pulling of my whiskers. After each shave, the razor tells you how long you&#x27;ve been using it and how much charge is left by percentage (by 10% increments). It will flash at ten percent for a about a day, and because it&#x27;s digital, will go from full power to nothing instantly - as opposed to the Braun which will wind down slowly on the final day of shaving. Both last exactly 7 days between charges for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 weeks of  Panasonic use, I decided to take my Braun with us on a short vacation, allowing me to have a great chance to really compare the two shavers. Another reason to take the Braun is that the Panasonic only comes with a soft case, where the Braun&#x27;s case is hard, which I feel is better protection. Sorrowfully, my old Braun made me feel like I&#x27;d gone back in time, driving a Model T instead of a 2012 Mercedes. It really was that different. Just like a faithful trooper, the Braun worked, but didn&#x27;t give me as close or quick a shave as the Panasonic. I&#x27;d say the Panasonic takes me about 20% less time to shave and gives me about 25% better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet or dry option with the Panasonic is definitely useful, and something I&#x27;ve never had the pleasure of experiencing before. I admit, it felt very strange taking an electric razor into the shower with me, and it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d do every day, but definitely gives a closer and more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s nice to have an automatic cleaning and charging system (housed a strangely ugly and cheap-looking unit), it is also exceptional to have a razor that doesn&#x27;t require expensive fluids to keep it clean. With a squirt of liquid soap, a special power setting, and a splash of water, the razor is clean and ready for another week of shaving duties. Not only does this save money, it&#x27;s especially helpful for travelers who don&#x27;t really feel like lugging the cleaning unit around (a messy proposition, even if you had space in the suitcase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic did not disappoint me, and I feel it lived up to everything I believed a very expensive shaver should be. With a beautiful blue digital readout, nicely ergonomic handle, and great results, I really hope this shaver lasts the rest of my life, since I would truly be hard pressed to pay this much for a replacement!ul trooper, the Braun worked, but didn&#x27;t give me as close or quick a shave as the Panasonic.

    <li> I have been using a Braun 8000 series shaver for over 5 years.  So, I was looking forward to what an upgraded shaver could do.  Although the ES-LV81-K has some real strengths in its shaving ability, it is a shame, that some of its other features fall short. First to the shaving.  The manual recommends using it for a month to get your face used to its cutting style. This is true.  Although I was using a different foil electric razor, it took a couple of weeks until I could achieve a really close shave.  After that, I am completely sold on its cutting ability!!  How much is due to the 30º nanotech blades, or the dual lift-tech foil/finishing foil system, I don&#x27;t know.  The LCD screen helpfully tells you how long the shave took, and how much charge is left.  Another great strength is the ability to work wet or dry.  I am also a great fan of its integrated cleaning/charging stand. Another useful feature is the power off lock button, so it won&#x27;t get turned on when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weaknesses are all the more disappointing because, for the most part, they should be easy to fix.  One generally does not expect much from product manuals, and this one does not disappoint.  There seems to be some real gaps in information.  For example, what is the recommended cleaning frequency and how often should you replace the cleaning sponge?  When cleaning/charging, the LCD screen does not indicate time left (it is off).  This would be helpful to show how much longer the cleaning/charging will take.  However, the biggest design flaw is the outsized shaver head, and too narrow body.  It is not as comfortable to hold while shaving as my old Braun, and I have smaller hands.  It seems like a larger body would be easier on one&#x27;s grip.  Likewise the shaving head is large, but that does not translate into more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;If Panasonic were to fix these flaws, then they would have a shaver that goes to 11.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver very much!</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best that I have ever had!!! It makes way less noise than most of the other electric shavers that I have ever had. You get a very close shave without much, hitting the same spot again and again like some other shavers that I have had. Only one minor complaint. The cleaning system is a little louder than it needs to be and part of this is the beeping it makes through most of the cycle. Otherwise the BEST shaver I have ever had!!</li>
    <li> best shaver so far I have used.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about the wider face, but it only took a couple of weeks before I was hooked, the wider surface has cut down my shave time and is definitely a closer shave; the cleaning motor is still noisy, but not as loud as before.</li>
    <li> The very first shave was fantastic.  Smooth and quick.  Did not have a break-in period.  The closest shave with an electric razor that I have ever had, and I have shaved with just about all of them.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Purchased this when it first came out.  Many people ask \\&quot;Who would pay several hundred dollars for a razor?!\\&quot;  It was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing shave and it cleans wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Lousy, lousy, lousy. The worst purchase I made so far. Read product reviews, most people that wrote that, must work for panasonic. A waste of $300.00 had to go back to disposable razor use. What a waste. Does not shave if your beard is a week oo more in growth. Even after I shaved with a razor, I tried shaving with this electric shaver, you spend a lot of time listening to the buzz and it does very little. I really don&#x27;t know how someone would rate this as the best out there. If this is the best I wonder what the worst will do to your face. Shame on panasonic and on the people that stir you to buy this and waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love it, great close shave</li>
    <li> First time buying a \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; (or more expensive) electric razor. After using for several months now, it&#x27;s just okay. Really no better than the $50-$100 razors. In fact, the design of this razor with the bulky head, makes it pretty much impossible to trim hair that grows immediately under the nose or to each side. Still misses hair just like the cheapies. When using it as a wet razor, it pretty much makes a big mess, so stay leaning over the sink when using it this way.</li>
    <li> Shaves like a dream.  The cleaning system though leaves much to be desired.  Decided that I would never wet shave and opted for a different razor.  Is though a very nice razor...</li>
    <li> I am well pleased with this shaver. It is the first shaver I have had to give such a close shave. It is as close, if not closer, than than any safety razor i have used. The communication with the company after the purchase has some flaws. I asked for some information on the detergent cartridge a few weeks ago and never did get an answer.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  After years of dealing with a razor burned neck from shaving with a blade, I finally decided to move to an electric after reading that they were the hair pulling chainsaws they used to be.  I first tried out the Braun 797, which was pretty good.  It did a great job on my face, but it was difficult to use on my neck since I have a lot of hairs growing in different directions.  Next I tried the Philips Norelco 9300.  It was really bad.  It did a poor job on every part of my face, and the new design that made you keep track of the beard trimmer instead of having it still integrated into the shaver made this a definite no-go.  Lastly was the Panasonic.  This thing is amazing.  I get as close of a shave as I would get if I used a Mach 5 and shaved against the grain.  It takes a little more time on the neck if I haven&#x27;t shaved in more than 2 days, but I still can finish a shave in around 5 minutes.  I should also note, I only tried these shavers dry, and I have not yet tried the Panasonic with a wet shave since I get such a good shave dry.</li>
    <li> Wowsa!!!! At this price I was expecting it to come with voice commands or something hi-tech at least. A GPS built in perhaps? Bluetooth? Sync it with your ipad/ipod or iphone?? haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in all reality it&#x27;s just an average electrical razor. It doesn&#x27;t have or do anything different than any other electrical shaver out there. In fact the [[ASIN:B004UKSKCQ Braun Cruzer 5 Face Cruzer, 5 Face Shaver]] works just as good for $54.35 here on amazon. So please, please, please whatever you do, do not waste your money on this overpriced item.</li>
    <li> I am comparing this to my previous razor, which is a Braun Series 7 - no slouch of a razor.  However, the Panasonic ES-LV81-K blows the Braun Series 7 out of the water - so to speak.  First, there is the fact that you can use it in the shower.  I have never used a wet shaver before and I was pleasantly surprised.  I think it gives a closer shave, and it is really handy when I need to rush things up since I can just take the shaver into the shower with me. What is also really nice about this feature is that you can easily clean the shaver in the shower. Just remove the cover, stick the head up under the water and rinse it off right there in the shower.  VERY convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good, so you can easily leave it in the shower for an entire week and then put it back in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning system yet because I love the shower cleaning method so much.  I assume it is similar to the Braun&#x27;s cleaning system - which worked well and was easy to use, but expensive. The Panasonic is different in that you add water to a cleaning cartridge, rather than just getting a \\&quot;blue alcohol\\&quot; filled container to install.  Otherwise they seem similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the way the Braun fits into the charger at an angle. I never feel like it is properly placed in the holder, the Panasonic is much better and fits straight into the charger.  The Panasonic also shows far more information about how much charge you have left than the Braun provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is MUCH better with the Panasonic. The high power setting is a little noisy, but it REALLY works and in the shower the noise makes no difference anyway.  If you are using it while someone else is still asleep, it might bother them but my wife hasn&#x27;t complained yet.  The Braun also has adjustable speeds, but nowhere NEAR the highest setting of the Panasonic.  The Panasonic wins hands down here, where it matters most.  I shave faster and better with the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only place I feel the Braun outdoes the Panasonic is in build quality and \\&quot;solidness.\\&quot;  The Braun FEELS like a better made instrument, while the Panasonic has a bit of a plasticky \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; feel.  A shame, but not enough to make me think for a second about going back.  I&#x27;m a Panasonic fan all the way now when it comes to electric razors!n build quality and \\&quot;solidness.\\&quot;  The Braun FEELS like a better made instrument, while the Panasonic has a bit of a plasticky \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; feel.

    <li> The Panasonic replaced a Braun that was about two years old.  Overall the Panasonic provides a closer shave when used with shaving cream and the saving time is a little faster.  I have not had any issues with the cleaning/charging that some others have reported. Overall it is slightly better than the Braun, but if you plan to travel the ability to use soap and water to clean the razor is a big advantage of the Braun.  When I bought the razor Amazon reduced the price by $100 so while still expensive it was inline with other razors from Braun and Phillips.</li>
    <li> Great product performs exactly as described and met all my expections.  may be the best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have been a big fan of \\&quot;linear\\&quot; shavers since I purchased my first Panasonic Linear shaver about 15 years ago. Panasonic seemed to dominate the market for many years, but then Braun came out with a very nice version a few years ago (Braun calls them \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; shavers), and suddenly the Braun Pulsonic shavers were the top selling models.  I also currently have the Braun 790cc, their top of the line model, so comparing it against this top of the line Panasonic was an interesting showdown.  Base station: Both units have a nice base station used for cleaning and recharging the unit. Both do a fine job. I was a little skeptical at first about the utility of a base station, but now I&#x27;m sold. Dealing with cords and plugs is annoying. I really appreciate the convenience of dropping the shaver in and having it automatically cleaned and recharged.  Articulation: Both units have an articulating head which maintain an optimal angle of attack against your skin. The Braun only pivots forward and backward, however, while the Panasonic also moves side to side. Both do a fine job of maintaining good blade contact, and the additional benefit from Panasonic&#x27;s side to side movement is minor.  Closeness of shave: First of all, both models provide a very close shave. That&#x27;s why so many people love these shavers. Just as close as shaving with a blade, and much more convenient. I often shave while surfing the web (in fact, I was shaving while writing this review). It&#x27;s recommended to shave before taking a shower so that you take advantage of the natural lubricants your skin produces on your face, so shaving while reading the morning news online is my typical routine. After using both shavers for at least a month, I find that the Panasonic will shave slightly closer. Not sure if that is due to the additional blades the Panasonic has, or the faster drive system (the Panasonic vibrates at 14,000 per second while the Braun is 10,000). However, the Braun is still very close.  Skin burn: Zero. Both of these shavers produce no irritation for me. Even after I&#x27;ve basically finished shaving, I can do additional passes with the shaver, over and over the smooth skin searching for that last bit of hair to remove, and my skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  Vibration: Here is finally a category where there is a substantial difference. The Braun vibrates quite a bit. It&#x27;s not annoying at all, in fact I find it relaxing, but your milage may vary. The vibration produces more sound (more on that below), but some people suggest that it is beneficial. For example, my girlfriend uses one of these: [[ASIN:B0009F402K Clarisonic Classic Skincare Brush - White]] which is specifically designed to vibrate your facial skin to exfoliate dead cells and promote circulation. So, the Braun&#x27;s vibrations may actually help your skin stay more youthful.  Noise: The Panasonic is definitely more smooth and sounds more refined than the Braun. I got out my Radio Shack sound level meter to measure the difference in volume. At 4\\&quot; (roughly the average distance the shaver will be from your ears during operation) the Panasonic is 73 dB while the Braun is 78 dB. Thus, the Braun is 10^((78-73)/10) &#x3D; 3.16 times louder than the Panasonic. The Braun isn&#x27;t deafening by any means, but I appreciate the more quite and refined sound of the Panasonic.  Price: Currently, the Panasonic is about 2x the Braun. That&#x27;s not a small difference.  In summary, the Panasonic delivers the smoothest shave with a more refined experience. The Braun also delivers a smooth shave, along with some vibration that some people may want, but also with some noise.</li>
    <li> It is the best electric razor I have owned, which includes the Braun 690.  The Panasonic provides a closer, quicker shave with no sacrifice of comfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of the minority of reviewer&#x27;s who actually purchased this product (*definitely increasing since I wrote this though!); I didn&#x27;t pay full retail (still listed some places as just south of $600), so let&#x27;s say a little over half that. And the replacement head/foil is 80 bucks.  So my comments straight up relate to whether I think I got my money&#x27;s worth, not just the technical aspects of the shaver.  The short version if you don&#x27;t want to read the list is, yes, I think I did, with a footnote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used just about every new model electric shaver out there in the quest for the perfect shaver, and reviewed several of them here:  [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], [[ASIN:B003V32UDI Philips Norelco 1290x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]], [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]].  To cut to the chase, there isn&#x27;t a perfect shaver, at least one that fits everyone&#x27;s shaving style.  This one comes pretty darn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the obvious:  this is a foil shaver.  If you use a rotary shaver and are happy with the results, stop reading and/or get the Norelco; it&#x27;s the best one out there.  A rotary shave is completely and totally different than a foil experience.  If you think there might be something better, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, among foils there are dry shavers only, and those that are both wet and dry.  The LV81 is both.  The Braun above is dry only.  If you like to shave dry only, the Braun will serve you as well as any in my opinion, and has a superior cleaning system to the Panny, as well as costing a lot less.  If you like a dry electric shave and don&#x27;t care to change, get the Braun.  If you think there might be something better, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LV81 is the successor to the ES-LA93 (which I was using immediately prior and it was pretty good) and a worthy successor it is.  It&#x27;s the best wet electric shaver I have ever used.  Ever.  Things Panasonic has improved over the LA93:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The constantly flashing blue police-cruiser charging light is gone; when the cleaning/charging cycle is complete, the unit goes off (cleaner and shaver).  Some might miss it; me - not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver is quieter than the LA93, both in use and during the cleaning cycle.  Significantly less to my ear, but the previous model Panasonic shaver itself was already quieter than the Braun, although none of them are anywhere near as quiet as a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A faster shave.  The larger head really is functional, and if you already use the LA93 the transition will be seamless.  It&#x27;s more like gently scrubbing your face with a pad rather than shaving, and less irritating since you don&#x27;t need to move the head as much over the same area.  The larger head covers a lot of ground quickly, and I&#x27;ve reduced my shaving time by 30-40%.  There is a shaving timer in the display, which I actually like - I&#x27;ve had one on other shavers; it helps me improve my shaving technique and speed up to a point of diminishing returns.  The popup trimmer is functionally the same as the LA93.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning station looks almost identical to the one for the LA93 externally (other than the silver front); in fact, the LV81 actually fits in the old one (sort of), but it&#x27;s apparently a completely different unit.  The interior well seems to be deeper; the back is contoured differently to fit the LV81, the cleaning cartridge fits flush rather than inset, and it does seem to be quieter.  It also seems like the cleaning cycle is shorter, but I haven&#x27;t timed it.  When the cleaning cycle is complete, the lights go out, unlike the LA93 unit where the green LEDs for Clean/Dry flash continuously.  It does use the same cartridges, and the water reservoirs appear to be the same.  Noisier than the Braun or Norelco cleaners - and it runs longer - it does what it&#x27;s supposedto do, and very economically as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it worth three hundred and a half bills to upgrade from the earlier Panasonic?  To me, yes - I knew what I was getting, and it&#x27;s really a significant improvement over any other Panasonic.  Is it worth it to switch from another system or manufacturer?  That depends....  If you THINK you might want to switch from a blade or a rotary experience, or switch to a wet shave from a dry with a different foil, I think a good price point would be in the $200+ range, which this shaver will eventually hit within a few months I would guess, and you might not feel too bad about switching back if it didn&#x27;t work out.  At today&#x27;s price point, if you have the bucks and want to experiment, I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried it, a wet electric shave with a foil shaver is (to me) the closest, most comfortable electric shave you can get - and with this shaver, as close as you&#x27;re going to get to a blade with an electric in my opinion.  If you&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect electric, this just might be it.to do, and very economically as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it worth three hundred and a half bills to upgrade from the earlier Panasonic?

    <li> Shaver is awesome and noticably better than its superceded model ie 93k arc 4 series. Shaves with even lesser irritation and shaves really close. I dont use a razor at all anymore. I would recommend using this product with a pre electric shaver oil such as King of Shaves Kinexium or Aramis Labs which results in virtually no irritation and a super close shave. Would I pay the ridiculous $500 or so pricing? NO! But for the special price of $286 that I purchased it at absolutely fantastic. Keep in mind that with this baby you do arguably have the best shaver on the market!</li>
    <li> I still shave with a [[ASIN:B000065AB0 Gillette, Mach3 Turbo Shaving System, 1 system]] with a mirror in the shower.  I can get a baby-smooth shave with the razor with little to no nicks.  I don&#x27;t have a problem bringing the razor and shaving gel with me when away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why would I spend $100s for an electric shaver?  Well, if it shaved as close as my razor and was low-maintenance then I might be convinced to switch.  Individual [[ASIN:B0039LMTHE Gillette MACH3 Cartridges, 15-Count Blister Sustainable Pack]] are about $2.00 each, so if I changed them once a week, that&#x27;s about $100 per year plus cream.  So I tried this (expensive!) electric shaver because Amazon Vine gave it to me to review.  Would it be worth the switch?  Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Does it shave as close as a razor?  On my smooth skin and light beard, I would say \\&quot;almost.\\&quot;  To be fair, I have only shaved a couple times dry with it, and they recommend 30 days before your skin is used to the shaver, although I&#x27;m not sure what that means.  But when done shaving, it feels about the same as around 12pm after a razor shave - just a little stubble in the tough spots to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Is it easy to use?  Hmm... the razor hangs in the shower next to the gel... can&#x27;t get much easier than that.  The electric shaver sits in its charger on the bathroom counter; although it does say you can shave in the shower with it, but I assume you&#x27;d normally keep it in its charger base.  So you&#x27;d have to remember to bring it in the shower with you (or shave after getting out, wet or dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Is it cost-effective?  About $100/yr. for a razor up against the up-front cost of $599 (I assume this will come down in time) plus (directly from Panasonic - Amazon should be cheaper) about $59.99/year for replacement foil and 2-year replacement of the head for $34.99.  And if you use the auto-cleaning system, expect to pay another $25.99 every 3 months for a 3-pack of detergent cartridges.  That&#x27;s about $175/yr. maintenance cost.  Razors are cheaper by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Can it do anything a razor cannot?  It can shave dry skin effectively.  It also has a trimmer to do sideburns and mustache trimming; although I must add that in use, the trimmer is hidden behind the large shaver head which makes it difficult to see what you&#x27;re trimming.  One other thing that might not be so obvious is that I can more easily shave after showering with the electric with my glasses on.  It&#x27;s getting harder to see clearly in the shower mirror, so this might come into play more as I get older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion is that I prefer a razor for normal, at-home, everyday shaving.  But if my lifestyle demanded it, and I were on the road a lot, shaving in the car, in hotels, in airplane lavatories, while camping, etc., then this shaver would be handy and effective.  If that is you, then wait until the price comes down and give this a try.  You can get almost as close as a razor with the convenience of an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/25/11:  It&#x27;s been the recommended 30 days now and there are a couple things I can say at this point.  The closeness has indeed got closer as I&#x27;ve learned how to shave with this electric.  I can get about as close as a razor on the smooth and flat parts.  Different pressures from barely touching the skin to &#x27;pushing&#x27; down and against the grain seem to make a difference.  But I still cannot seem to get all the stubble around and under the chin, and I sometimes find a few annoying hairs that have somehow escaped the shaver for a few days and got long enough to have to use the trimmer first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have got my shaving time down to about 2-3 mins. (noted on the handy digital readout).  However, sideburns and mustache have suffered in appearance somewhat, since I cannot shave as sharp of a line with this over a razor.  A couple benefits I didn&#x27;t mention before:  No nicks!  And no smell of shaving cream if you shave dry.  So I still stand by my originalconclusion, a razor works better and is cheaper.  But there are applications for an electric, and this is a great electric.or an electric, and this is a great electric.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good deal~good for use</li>
    <li> I had been looking for the perfect combination of the ease of electric shaving with the closeness of wet shaving so I jumped at the chance to review this unit. I generally use it while in the shower with a fogless mirror and some King of Shaves shaving gel and I&#x27;ve never gotten such a close shave in such a short time (generally less than three minutes). My face also didn&#x27;t go through the break-in period that Panasonic warns about (they actually have an insert requesting that you try the shaver for 30 days before returning it).   Cleaning the unit is also a breeze, but I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system built into the dock. Basically you fill the water reservoir with water and insert a detergent cartridge. You&#x27;re supposed to replace the water and the cartridge at the same time and the cartridge can last up to two months. The thought of two month old water and beard shavings \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; my shaver doesn&#x27;t make sense. Instead, I clean the razor out in the shower with a quick rinse after each shave and then use the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; cycle on the dock to make the sure the razor doesn&#x27;t rust or get funky.   A quick warning: The dry cycle on the unit takes some THREE HOURS for some reason. That&#x27;s gotta put a dent in your electricity bill at some point.  In any case, the performance of the shaver is great. the blades whip a bit of shave gel into a nice soft lather and it glides across your face. The side burn trimmer could be better but I don&#x27;t use it too often.   It&#x27;s a great shaver but is it worth the price? $600 (MSRP) is a little ridiculous for any shaver and I&#x27;d try some lower level wet electric shavers before making the investment.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband as one of his Christmas presents, he has used it every day and says this is the best present he has ever gotten. His face feels like a baby&#x27;s a--.</li>
    <li> I had the older Panasonic shaver for 10 years. It would clean me up good and had the power that my thick hair needed. This shaver dosent have the power or the ability to get all the hairs even tho it has two more blades. I wish I could find an older one like I had. :(</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old and this is the Best razor I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Great shaver, it is worth to spend money on this one.  It arrived on time as promised without any damage.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a braun 7 series right out of the box this panasonic is 10 times better than the next best. worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LV81-K will give you as good a shave as you&#x27;ll ever get from an electric razor.  Panasonic has really refined the art of building a solid men&#x27;s razor.  I&#x27;ve owned many Braun, Panasonic, Norelco and Remington razors over the years.  These days I find I like the Braun and Panasonics the best.  Some of the other reviewers say the shave is just \\&quot;OK.\\&quot;  I humbly disagree.  The LV81K gives a very smooth and close shave without causing any irritation at all. This is due to the new 5 blade razor design.  The battery lasted 6 shaves (but I take a long time to shave as I do it while reading the news on the Internet).  I suspect if you shave in front of a mirror, you&#x27;ll probably get about 10 shaves out of one charge. Once the battery dies, you have to recharge to use the shaver.  If the shaver is plugged in to the charging cord, it simply will not operate. To me this is a negative.  But I suppose Panasonic does it for safety reasons, to prevent dunce users from trying to operate the shaver plugged in while in the shower.    When you turn the shaver off, it displays the minutes you have used the razor and the percentage of battery life left - this is a nice touch. There is a dial you can turn to prevent the razor from turning on while you travel.  The razor comes with a nice travel pouch and a cleaning kit.    The cleaning kit is about the same size as the Braun cleaning kit.  However the Panasonic is quite a bit noisier when it operates.  That is a negative.  The Panasonic and Braun cleaning kits have slightly different designs.  The Braun cartridge is bigger and comes with a large reservoir of cleaning fluid in a cartridge.  The Panasonic design has the user fill the water tank with tap water.  The cleaning cartridge is thus very small and provides the cleaning chemicals -- not sure what is in it. It appears the Panasonic cleaning cartridge will last you about 6 months, while my Braun typically lasts about 3 months.    While the LV81K is an Excellent razor, ithas one big negative...price.  I own the Panasonic ES-LA63 razor which gives equally good shaves, but costs considerably less.  It has no cleaning kit, but you can simply clean it with tap water. (You can do the same with the LV81K).  Whereas the LV81K is currently priced at $599 on Amazon, the LA63 is priced at $150.  I&#x27;d buy the LA63 as the shaves are just as good...even if it only has 4 blades.  I also currently own the Braun Series 5 (569).  It also is an excellent razor, and priced in the $125-$150 area.  It&#x27;s shave is not quite as close as the Panasonics, but it is almost as close. I would say the Braun might be smidgen more irritating on the skin...but definitely a topnotch alternative. It also comes with a cleaning kit.  Bottom Line:  LV81K gives as good a shave as you can get with an electric razor - but at an astronomical price.  Buy the Panasonic ES-LA63 instead of the LV81K and get as good a shave...and pocket the $450 difference (that&#x27;ll pay for most of the price of an IPAD).</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve never used a foil shaver before, only rotary style. I like how effortless it glides. Love the cleaning system</li>
    <li> I purchased it on Black Friday. So good.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor back in June of this year it was by far the best shave I had ever had with a electric Razor. Two months after the unit would not charge and I sent it to Panasonic for repairs It has now been two months and all I get from the service department is they are waiting on shipments of the razor and cannot give me a firm date on when it will be shipped. They offered me a refund that will not cover shipping so I will be out that money. They are also telling me it may be up to six weeks until I see the refund check. Never again will I purchase Panasonic</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers over the years.  I started with a triple rotary from Norelco, followed by a few iterations of Braun shavers, the most recent being a 5-series Braun, which followed a Braun 8000 series.  This Panasonic gives me the best shave of all of them, and I can&#x27;t imagine a fixed blade doing a better job than this electric.  Next to the Panasonic, the Braun 8000 series was my favorite.  After using the 8000 series for 5 years, it stopped holding the blade in place properly, lost its ability to shave close.  I figured I would stay with Braun since I liked the 8000 series so much, so I bought their current generation 5-series, the middle line of their 3, 5, and 7-series.  While the Braun 5 was quieter than the prior gen, it also felt slower, and it definitely did not shave as well.  I had trouble with the fleshier parts of my neck, even when stretching skin.  Enter the Panasonic ES-LV81-K, provided by Amazon.  The shaver has an led display that will show you the run-time while you&#x27;re shaving...interesting information, but not essential.  I typically finish shaving face, neck, back of neck within 3 minutes with this shaver, if that&#x27;s important to anyone.  To get this kind of shave with the Braun 5-series would take probably at least a minute longer.  The display also shows the battery level, definitely useful information.  The Panasonic shaver is a bit noisy, but no more than I would have expected from an electric.  If their option to make it quieter was to slow down the oscillations, then I would eagerly choose the noise.  A feature in the Braun that I liked, their cleaning solution was alcohol-based, and I would run it after each shave, to keep bacteria from forming.  I do similarly with the Panasonic, run the cleaning cycle after each shave.  You fill a reservoir with probably around 4 ounces of tap water, or distilled water if you like, plug in the small Panasonic cleaning cartridge, and it&#x27;s ready to go for a month or two of cleaning cycles.A feature I like in the Panasonic, they follow the Clean cycle with a Dry cycle, so the shaver is dry the next time you go to use it.  The Braun passively air-dried, and there were times that it still had the cleaning solution dripping from it when I went to use it.  Not an issue with the Panasonic, it ends up bone dry.  The cleaning cycle takes around 5 minutes to complete, and the razor runs intermittently during that time, followed by a few minutes of a fan blowing air during the Dry cycle.  That&#x27;s a lot of detail, maybe a waste of time to some readers of this review, but let me cut to the chase.  If I accidentally dropped this razor in the toilet, or on a concrete floor, to where I had to replace it, I would DEFINITELY seek out another Panasonic just like this one.  I had my latest Braun for around 3 months, and I was not happy with it all, was wanting to try some other brand.  The timing of arrival for this Panasonic was perfect.  After using the Panasonic now for around 3 weeks, I am thoroughly satisfied.  I wanted to live with it for some time before posting my review, and I honestly could not imagine another electric giving me a closer shave than this Panasonic ES-LV81-K.  I realize it&#x27;s a bit pricey, which may put off some buyers, but if your budget will allow, or can be stretched a bit, I can not recommend this Panasonic any more highly.  It&#x27;s an outstanding shaver.  PRO:  - Comfortable shave  - Very close shave  - Wide cutting path  - Fast blade frequency  - Powerful  - Articulating head  - Cleaning station  - Clean and Dry cycles  - Water-washable  - Travel pouch included  CON:  - Wouldn&#x27;t mind if the housing was thicker, not as slender.  I have large hands, and the slender shape of the housing takes some getting used to.  - A tad pricey</li>
    <li> Before using the Panasonic ES-LV81-K I&#x27;d been using a Braun Pulsonic 9595CC for almost 4 years. I thought the Braun was great and I&#x27;d never used an electric shaver like the Braun before but it wasn&#x27;t quite perfect. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;d always get a rash around my adam&#x27;s apple from shaving so when I got a chance to try the Panasonic ES-LV81-K I jumped at it. I&#x27;m not sure I could have justified paying what this shaver goes for before trying it but after using it for almost two months I&#x27;m sold.  I tend not to write my reviews for products right after I start using them. I find that given time a product&#x27;s true faults and benefits really become obvious. Sometimes they&#x27;re things that are easy to miss while in the honeymoon phase.   So here we go... the Panasonic ES-LV81-K is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It&#x27;s also the most expensive so it comes down to a cost vs. benefit decision. Given that I tend to keep my shavers for 3-4 years it&#x27;s an easy decision for me because this is a tool that I use almost every day. Here are some pros and cons to make things simple:  Good stuff  * Fast. The 5 blades cover a lot of surface area at once  * Wet/Dry system. Usable in the shower  * Self-cleaning system that requires soap and water and nothing else. So you&#x27;re not stuck using the Vortex Cleaning System and Cartridges  * Minimal irritation. Not sure what it is but it doesn&#x27;t chew up my skin  * Cleaning cartridges don&#x27;t contain alcohol and that means less irritation. They&#x27;re also cheaper than the Braun&#x27;s and ship by air  Bad Stuff  * Expensive. Did I say that before? $450+ for a shaving system?  * Very large shaving head so it&#x27;s not that maneuverable. I have a tough time shaving the area under my nose and getting my sideburns quite right  * Single option for cleaning. I got used to the Braun&#x27;s which had light and deep cleanings.  That&#x27;s about it. When it comes to products that I receive from Amazon Vine it&#x27;s quite simple... if I&#x27;m using it after 2 months then I love it. If I&#x27;m not and it&#x27;s been relegated to the garage then... Even at $450+ I think this is a great shaver and I&#x27;ve never used anything quite like it. When that price (don&#x27;t forget to add the cleaning cartridges if you use them and the replacement blade) is amortized over a few years and the fact that most of us guys will use a shaver almost every day it&#x27;s expensive but not that crazy if you&#x27;re getting something that you can&#x27;t get elsewhere.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but at this price the lack of maneuverability is something that you shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 8585 self cleaning shaver for the past 7 years and have had overall good results. But that shaver irritates my face from time to time, so I was eager to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic produces the smoothest shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor. The 5 blade system works very well - one single pass and the hair is gone. This means there is far less irritation compared to conventional electric razors. It is a bit tricky to maneuver in very curvy areas (adam&#x27;s apple, directly underneath your nose), but I have that issue with most electric razors and this is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil head in the Panasonic, unlike my Braun, does not get hot after several minutes of shaving. This makes it less irritating to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is since the Panasonic can be used in the shower, it can be cleaned with soap and water. You don&#x27;t need to purchase the Vortex cleaning cartridges. The upside, besides the cost savings, is alcohol doesn&#x27;t need to be used to get the device clean, thus producing a less irritating shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is louder than I expected, but not obtrusive. I just don&#x27;t shave when my wife is sleeping, because it would definitely wake her up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the LCD display for the battery. So far, the battery has lasted a long time (I&#x27;ve had it a month and have charged it 2-3 times). Pretty impressive battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is definitely the heaviest shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. But it feels solid - you definitely don&#x27;t need to worry about this thing falling apart on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. However, I&#x27;d have a hard time justifying the astoundingly high price tag. As someone else mentioned though, you need to determine how important getting a super close, non-irritating shave is worth. For some, the price may be easier to justify.</li>
    <li> Got this end of December and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Best shaver I&#x27;ve own from a Braun to a Phillips and some straight edge.  This is ga st wr and just as close as the straight edge</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son - terrific razor. Panasonic stands by their brand. Had to replace the razor top after almost two years -  sent him a whole new razor!</li>
    <li> The fact that I am taking the time to write this review is testimony enough about this razor.  I am having fun with it as I waited two days to shave and then three.  For the first time in my life the razor gives me a shave as close as a blade.  Very cool!  The negative reviews are warranted in regards to shaving with a big head in tight places but I think those people have no creativity at all as you just angle the razor in a way to hit the spot.  The Razor is amazing.</li>
    <li> Really good shaver, come in a really big box in case you expect something small.&lt;br /&gt;It molds to your face and goes well in difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;Blades work good.&lt;br /&gt;But can really damage skin if you have a gentle one. I mean really rash it. Suposely the skin gets used to the blades in one month.</li>
    <li> Although electric shaving machines will never be perfect to razor shaving, this is as close as it gets. Over the years I have tried many different brands and models and this is by far the easiest and smoothest of all. The big head sort of makes it difficult maneuver at some obvious mentioned areas but you will get used to going around it. Overall it is the best out there for the price.</li>
    <li> Being of Middle Eastern decent, shaving sucks.  Over the years, I have tried almost every electric razor and never get a good shave regardless of brand, so I always end up using a normal razor with shaving cream.  If I had to shave every day, I would get the worst razor burn ever.  So when I read the reviews on this razor and it was on a lightening deal, I decided to try it.  IT IS THE BEST RAZOR EVER!  I have used it for about 30 days now shaving almost every day.  Not only does it shave as close as I have ever had, but I have not yet developed any razor burn. If you are looking for a great razor, be sure to get this one...absolutely amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews, I ended up purchasing this shaver. I figured the last shaver lasted for 10 years (Braun), this one should as well. I love Panasonic products and opened this shaver to find it first rate on everything - to include the AC power supply. Excellent quality that befits the price of the product. I tried shaving with it dry at first and did not really cut the hairs on my face. I heard you need to \\&quot;train your face to the razor\\&quot; so I used it wet. Wetting my face with water and using shaving creme I used the shaver. I was amazed and surprised how well it cut. The shave was excellent and very close! However, I really don&#x27;t shave wet - I shave dry. This is where you should be cautioned with this shaver. If you have a beard that lays flat on your neck or like to shave dry, this is not the razor for you. If you like to shave wet and your beard tends to stand up, this is the razor for you. Great for some as you will be completely satisfied. If you are like me, beard that lays flat on your neck and likes dry shaving, this is not the shaver for you.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for my son who has sensitive, acne prone skin. It works really well on his face, he doesnt get the red, irritated bloches that occurs with blade shaving. His acne definitely improved.  Blade shaving typically carries more bacteria, and the cleaning process for this electric shaver removes that variable. The One downside is that it is difficult to get a close enough shave on the neck area.  It is true that nothing gives quite as close a shave as a razor, but frankly the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; today for guys is to have that five-o&amp;#34;clock shadow appearance anyway. So, i would have to say that it was worth the money and i would recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been a Gillette blade shaver for my entire life because I am one who loves and needs to have an extremely close shave.  Naturally, doing this every day causes more skin irritation, cutting, and nicking then one can imagine.  Their was no comfort in my daily shave.  I have always been afraid to try an electric shaver because I felt that I&#x27;d have to spend a lot of money and would still never get a close shave.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong about this particular product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver immediately cut as close, IF NOT CLOSER, than my regular gel/blade razor and leaves absolutely NO razor irritation, nicks, or cuts after my shave.  I actually look forward to shaving every day.  I have an extremely close, silky smooth shave every day!  I only wish I would have switched sooner!!!!!</li>
    <li> good shave with less irritation and faster to finish. still not a perfect shave but a step up from the other Panasonic shavers!!</li>
    <li> I use it in a wet shave environment all the time and it cuts great and I expect the blades will last well longer than a year. I have owned more than six Panasonic shavers and they just work very well.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used my dad actually has a similar model that I first tried and absolutely loved the results</li>
    <li> Hitherto trying the Panasonic ES-LV81K, I didn&#x27;t even know manufacturers made $600 electric shavers.  $600 you say, that&#x27;s crazy!  Yes, I thought so too until I used the Panasonic.  I&#x27;ve primarily been a manual shaver man most of my life, bouncing from the early Mach 3s, to Remingtons, and then my trusty Fusion.  My last electric shaver was a $90 Norelco 1150X, which I thought was pricey for a shaver.  I had a bad experience with the Norelco, despite being advertised as being able to dry shave, was never able to do so without irritating my sensitive skin.  Moreover, I found the Norelco had a tendency to shave off large patches of hair, in a particularly uneven manner.  So my faith in electric shavers was shaken until the Panasonic...  EXTERIOR DESIGN:  The first feature you&#x27;ll notice about the Panasonic is the particularly strikingly large head, comprising 5-blades.  It reminds me of the Mach-3/Quattro/Fusion manual razor wars, where each manufacturer would try to up the other in terms of the number of blades.  However on the Panasonic, the 5 blades aren&#x27;t a gimmick, they do wonders.  The blades are encased in a head, which has an easily removable outer casing, which exposes the inner blades for cleaning.  Depress two buttons on each side of the head, and the outer casing pops right off.  The head freely rotates, though somewhat limited in its side-to-side and back and forth motion.  The rotation was more than suitable for my shaving needs.  The head also mounts an integrated trimmer which is easily locked into place by a selector mounted below.  The shaver is a sleek black (not as nice looking as the gun-metal dark blue on its cheaper ES-LV61 brother in my opinion), and is not a bright tacky light blue like on the Norelco.  The body is finished in a 3/4 slip-resistant &amp; fingerprint resistant material, which is comfortable to hold.  The body is also contoured for a comfortable grip.  There is a chrome circular selector switch that toggles between operating mode andtravel lock mode.  Lastly, a display screen with bright blue LED digits shows battery life, minutes/seconds the shaver was in use (a helpful feature), charge status, etc..  The LED display is very bright, and easy to read, even in a pitch black room.  The razor recharges with an AC adapter connected to its base; alternatively, the ES-LV81K can be recharged when plugged into the provided cleaning station.  The biggest downside of the Panasonic is that it requires replacement of the blades every 1-2 years, though I expect those who are less hirsute can observe a more lax replacement program. These replacement blades don&#x27;t come cheap either, at least $50-70 (which is about standard for electric shavers; IIRC, replacement Norelco blades were about that much too). If you want a cost-effective system, stick with manual razors. If you&#x27;re putting down five benjamins for this system, then replacement blade costs probably aren&#x27;t going to deter you from making the purchase.   It&#x27;s a solid, good looking razor (more on the cleaning station later).  OPERATION:  The Panasonic only needs 1 hour charging time, before full operation.  A quick 5-10 minute charge will get you maybe 1-2 shaves.  The ES-LV81K emits a solid, high pitched whine when in use.  The 14,000 cpm and 5 blades is no joke here.  I was able to dry shave WITHOUT SKIN IRRITATION.  That&#x27;s a first for me, as I have sensitive skin which I usually have to slap with copious amounts of aftershave following each session.  My post dry-shave session was incredible, didn&#x27;t even feel like I had just shaved.  I also tried the Panasonic with a wet-shave, and was able to achieve an amazingly close shave.  Remember the old adage that an electric shaver will never be able to replicate the results of a manual blade or razor?  The Panasonic completely destroys that adage.  I feel as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s posterior.  The Panasonic also allows shaving in the shower.  The trimmer works no differently, and I was able to get a smooth trim on my sideburns.  The LV81 is also very easy to clean.  Add a little dishwashing liquid or liquid soap to the outer blades, hold down the power button to activate the \\&quot;sonic vibration mode\\&quot;, at which point the razor self-cleans.  I also used a toothbrush to remove some small hairs that had deposited on the base of the inner blades.  SELF-CLEANING RECHARGER STATION:  The primary difference between the ES-LV81K and the $100 cheaper ES-LV61 is the addition of a self-cleaning recharger station.  The station is a cradle for both recharging the LV81K, and for holding the LV81K during cleaning.  A detergent pack is provided, and one just has to fill up a mini-water tank before selecting a cleaning option.  The cleaning process takes 10 minutes, at which point it engages in an 80 minute drying process, then a post-recharge.  The cleaning station has a little too much tacky plastic for my tastes considering the price of the system, but at least it seems solidly built and fingerprint proof.  During cleaning, the station emits several loud beeps every 30 seconds, which can be annoying.  The station is the answer to every lazy man&#x27;s question.  If you can&#x27;t be bothered to self-clean the razor with its built-in sonic mode vibration system and are also OCD about having the razor dried at 170 degrees C, then buy the system.  Otherwise, save yourself $100 and get the cheaper and nearly identical LV61.  Minus one star because the LV81K is a poorer value than the LV61, and Panasonic&#x27;s MSRP is a bit outrageous.  OVERALL THOUGHTS:  Is the Panasonic expensive?  Yes, but it certainly lives up to its claims and provides an amazing shave.  Cue heavenly music playing from above.  There is one caveat, this LV61 shaver is not interchangeable with the shaver on the LV81 cleaning/docking system; the LV61 is missing three electrodes on the rear of the body which allow charging with the cleaning/docking system.</li>
    <li> Really cuts the wiskers off</li>
    <li> On curved parts of my face (such as my chin) it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the earlier 4-blade model.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent shaver.</li>
    <li> Received the product and very happy with it</li>
    <li> Did a lot of reading on top sellers on Amazon and other sites, this Panasonic and a couple of Brauns kept coming up as best of breed, I have been using this Panasonic shaver for 10 days now and I am very satisfied with the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. I didn&#x27;t expect the shave to be as close as it is, granted, it isn&#x27;t as close as with a manual shaver, but I think it is as close as it is likely to get&lt;br /&gt;2. It only takes me 2 minutes to shave, which is record time for me (shaving every other day - dry)&lt;br /&gt;3. No cuts and zero skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit noisy when cleaning and drying on its recharging cradle, but nothing that would keep me from falling asleep or anything.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase indeed.</li>
    <li> I am a long-time blade shaver and just got this unit.  Today was the first chance I&#x27;ve had to try it.  I will rate this 5 stars and go from there if it gives me reason to change I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a solid feel and is very comfortable to use.  It stands far above my old Braun shaver as well it should for the money.  It is a bit loud but not too much louder than my Braun.  So far nothing to dislike at all (except my shrinking counter space!)  The razor itself has a pivot action switch near the head that has three modes: \\&quot;free\\&quot; (the head pivots), \\&quot;lock\\&quot; (no pivot), and trimmer (which pops up to trim beard, stache, side-burns.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button on the front of the razor has a locking feature that prevents it from being accidentally turned on when traveling.  Holding the power button for 2 seconds activates the \\&quot;sonic vibration cleaning mode\\&quot;.  A separate flyer in the instructions clearly shows how to clean using liquid soap but fails to indicate to use this mode (the instruction manual does, however.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unpacking this razor was nice - the razor comes with a plastic cover over the foil and packed in its own zip-up travel case.  The base unit was packed separate from the AC power cord and detergent unit.  The water reservoir pulls down and away from the back of the base unit and there is a plug at the top for the water fill and a fill-to line.  The detergent unit was sealed in two places and installed easily under the base when the two seals were removed according to the tabs.  Pretty simple to put together.  The AC cord reaches from the power outlet all the way across our double vanity with slack to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the razor cover and placed it in the base unit, connected the AC cord to the base and left it to charge.  In about an hour (I did not time it but that is about right) the unit was fully charged.  The LCD on the razor shows the battery charge clearly and the time of usage.  There are numerous other features of theLCD that I will update on as I experience them, for example a cleaning indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base unit has three operating modes one for charge, clean and dry in three different combinations.  There&#x27;s charge; clean, dry, and charge; and dry and charge.  A Select button chooses the combination desired.  The razor sets easily in the base and the three charge terminals on the razor clearly match the three on the base making it obvious how to place the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AC cord used to power the base can also be hooked directly to the razor to charge it, lightening travel needs.  Combined with the \\&quot;sonic vibration cleaning mode\\&quot; this is a pretty nice travel package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my first shave dry and it was very close, much better than my Braun, which was admittedly old and a bit neglected.  I would say it was on par with my Shick disposable blades and look forward to trying it different ways, wet and with shave gel.  I am also leaving the unit off the base to see how long the charge holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far impressed and feel like I have received good value for my investment.&lt;br /&gt;** Update 1/13/12&lt;br /&gt;Dry shave was ok but decided to try it wet and all I can say is WOW!  This is how you need to use this razor.  I have a shower mirror on order but with my shave gel it&#x27;s baby face time!  Best shave I ever got.  Shaving in the shower will shave (hah!) 5 minutes off my morning schedule so I&#x27;m psyched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update 1/20/13&lt;br /&gt;A year of use and the shave is showing wear.  I just replaced the foil and blades as my shaves have gotten progressively worse - more stubble and less \\&quot;baby face\\&quot;.  They recommend a year to replace the foil but I feel that is too long and plan to replace more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That alone may not warrant me pulling a star off this but what happened next does.  I now have to return the unit for repair as it the on-off switch has stopped functioning.  It will turn on erratically if at all and I will not get to see how Panasonic&#x27;s repair works.  So far it looks like I have to return at my expense, but I have an email in to their repair for instruction.  Fortunately their warranty is two years to I will not have to pay for the repair itself.&lt;br /&gt;** Update 2/2/13&lt;br /&gt;Sent the shaver alone back to Panasonic on 1/22 via UPS ($10 shipping.)  7 days later I received a boxed unit with a packing list indicating they returned a \\&quot;new or refurbished\\&quot; unit.  Well it looks like brand new but I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged the new unit last night and used it this morning.  After using disposable blades for the last two weeks I can reaffirm my recommendation of this unit as superior to them.  The shave is again smooth and close with no bites or problems with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update again should any further issues arise but Panasonic has done a good job of standing behind their product here.  I cannot restore the star lost as the first unit did fail in normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning: Should you need to return your unit, and if you recently replaced the blades and foils as I did (like two shaves worth) TAKE THEM OFF before you send it!  Unless they are related to the problem you will likely get a replacement unit and your blade/foil replacement will have been wasted $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update 11/30/13&lt;br /&gt;Same problem turns up again - razor will not operate to shave - only comes on in clean mode.  As good as the shave is (was) my disposables work all the time.  And for the price of this razor you can buy a lot of disposables.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend this as now I need to see if I can have it repaired outside of warranty.  Buyer beware on this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update 1/8/13&lt;br /&gt;Unit was still under the 2 year warranty so I was able to obtain a replacement unit.  Customer service was good and replacement took a week.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m unhappy with that but now that the warranty is up any other problems would be trouble.</li>
    <li> Just a few years ago, perhaps 3 years or so, I bought a top-of-the-line Braun shaver.  I would like to tell you the model number but I can&#x27;t.  The Instruction manual says \\&quot;Braun Pulsonic\\&quot;, then there is a \\&quot;9585\\&quot; floating around on the cover, and at the bottom it says \\&quot;Type 5673\\&quot;.  It may be the the model number was on the shaver itself.  But the shaver was coated with a nice looking silver paint that has largely been eaten away by the cleaning system.  The model number may be part of the debris that now clogs the pop-up trimmer so it no longer will pop back down.  I am disgusted by the way the Braun deteriorated over just a very few years.  This is why after using Brauns for roughly thirty years that I decided to try Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am very pleased.  The Panasonic is giving a much better shave than the Braun ever did.  And that&#x27;s saying a lot.  The Braun was an excellent shaver until it fell apart.  The Braun used a cleaning system that used large alcohol based cleaning cartridges.  The Panasonic uses a small cartridge that contains detergent.  There is also a reservoir in back that gets filled with tap water.  The Panasonic detergent and water system seems much more environmentally friendly than does Braun&#x27;s alcohol system.  I also think that Panasonic&#x27;s system is more conducive to a long life than the Braun alcohol system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is much more quiet both while I am shaving and during the cleaning cycle.  I like to listen to the radio in the bathroom while I shave so this is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the shaver a few weeks and I am delighted.  But I would have said the same thing about the Braun for the first few months.  The real test will be how the shaver is at the end of a year.  If my opinion changed, so will this review.  But for now it a five star shaver and it&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now 2013 and I am still delighted with this shaver.  5 stars is still the right rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit 2***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Sept 2013 and I just replaced the blades and foil.  The replacement kit cost just over $70.  I think that&#x27;s rather high.  I will need to do that every 18 months or so.  This raises the cost of ownership quite a bir.  I won&#x27;t change my rating since I still love the shaver.  But I suggest you consider the overall cost not just the purchase price as you make your choice.</li>
    <li> Panasonic continues to improve on \\&quot;outside the box\\&quot; razor design just as they do with cameras, washing machines, etc. This unit is a a little better than the LA93. It cuts faster with 5 blades. The prime improvement is the new blade (foil really) that lifts flat hairs rather than vibration alone. Took advantage of a promotion.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised how close, fast, and efficient this shaving/cleaning system operates.  For me, I never thought I would spend this much on a razor but glad I did.  If I were to be very very picky, the only issue that was unexpected was the buzzing sound the cleaning system makes in the beginning of it&#x27;s cycle.  Again, not a big deal, my wife thought it was a bit annoying.  Then again and after 36 years, most things I do annoy her.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband,I don&#x27;t understand what about men。My husband said very clean shave。Of course, the price here，it&#x27;s Not cheap</li>
    <li> Seriously  I could not be more happy with this shaver. My girlfriend got it for my birthday and this thing is amazing. The self cleaning kit works great, there is a sideburns trimmer, and the head can be switched from adjustable to normal.  Would def. recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought I had ordered but got this cheaper one instead, it works great and shaves super close. Only thing that you need to do is bush out the cutter blocks with a tooth brush, if you don&#x27;t do that it will pack up making a close shave impossible. I just use a little dish soap after brushing it out under water and then let it dry, it&#x27;s not a problem but I have kinda oily skin. It&#x27;s a very good shaver though so get it and enjoy your soft face.</li>
    <li> Best electric I have ever owned in 44 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been a shaving cream and blade shaver for over 30 years.  I tried a Norelco razor several years ago but was not happy with it and never tried anything else.  Some recent changes in my medications prompted me to look at electric razors again (shaving with a blade when you are taking anti-coagulants is NOT a good idea :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that electric razors have 30 day money back guarantees so I figured I had nothing to lose.  I reviewed several of the units available both on Amazon and on other web sites.  This Panasonic unit was always very highly rated.  So, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day that I used it I could not believe how close the shave was and how comfortable this device is to use.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and do not plan to ever go back to blades and cream again.  My wife and 5 year old daughter both commented on how smooth my face is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it in the shower yet, but have been using it after showering with a dry face.  It takes me 2:45 - 3:00 minutes to shave and I am getting faster as I get used to doing it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is wonderful.  The only question I have not been able to find an answer to is how often I really need to clean it.  I have been running it every day but not absolutely certain that is necessary.  Other than this question everything else I have needed to know is covered in the included instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a little expensive, but definitely worth it, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver for years, I own three ES8228 models (home, vacation place and travel kit).  Overall reliability has been great, so I decided to try the 5 cutter model rather than change the cutter and foil on one of the 8228s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using the Arc 5 a couple of weeks.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased - a smoother (and quicker) shave when compared to the others.  Here&#x27;s a few pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pro -&lt;br /&gt;* A clean, close shave ... especially in the places - under the chin, etc - that took multiple passes before&lt;br /&gt;* Seems to fit to your face contour better than the 3 cutter models, despite the larger shaver head&lt;br /&gt;* Shaver display goes off when it&#x27;s in the stand and fully charged, no more annoying flashing display all night&lt;br /&gt;* The charging/cleaning stand design is improved, quieter in operation ... I keep the shaver in this all the time&lt;br /&gt;Con -&lt;br /&gt;* The 5 cutter head is a brick, seems huge after using the earlier model for years&lt;br /&gt;* Seems heavy and not as well balanced in your hand, but I&#x27;m getting used to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, overall an excellent shaver.  Expensive?  Sure, but for me it&#x27;s about being confident that it will provide a great shave.</li>
    <li> Though I have been shaving for decades, I have generally made do with low-end razors.  I have used both rotary and vibrating type razors of the years with about the same level of success with each.  The Panasonic ES-LV81 is a \\&quot;shaving system\\&quot; on an entirely different level than I am used to, but it was worth the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is very comfortable to hold and has a lock on the power switch - as someone who has had electric razors start up in his luggage while traveling, I appreciate this a lot.  The business end of the shaver has five blades, but if you pull off the head you see only two.  Three more are hidden inside the head.  This model is said to have an improved foil design that lifts hairs better than the previous generation.  The head normally swivels in two directions, but you can lock it in place if you want.  The third position on the swivel lock switch pops up a small trimmer for mustaches, etc.  I liked that in use I could actually see the trimmer blade in the mirror, unlike on most shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shaving bit was wonderful - it sounds like an angry hornet but it does an excellent job of shaving.  I was especially interested in trying it in the shower, something I had never done before.  This model is waterproof and I was impressed with how well it performed in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can charge the shaver two ways - by connecting the power cord directly to the shaver, or by connecting the cord to the cleaning dock and inserting the shaver, blades down, into the dock.  The dock can dry the shaver (which you&#x27;d want to do after using it in the shower) - this runs a fan for three hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dock can also clean the shaver.  This uses a water tank you clip on the back and a detergent cartridge that slips in underneath.  When you activate the cleaning cycle, water cycles through the detergent sponge and enters a reservoir in which the blades are sitting.  The dock causes the shaver to oscillate the blades at low speed and then at \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; speed, at intervals.  At the end of the wash, it enters the dry cycle.  After either a clean/dry or dry cycle, it charges.  You can select clean/dry/charge, dry/charge or just charge. The detergent cartridge is said to last for about six months - at that time you dump the water, rinse the tank and then refill, along with replacing the cartridge.  I tested the cleaning and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also clean the shaver by pulling off the head and rinsing the blades under running water, pressing and holding the power switch to enable the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; cleaning mode.  The head just rinses off normally, then dry the shaver. Now that I&#x27;ve had the shaver a few months, this is the cleaning method I tend to use most. It certainly takes less time than using the automatic cleaner, and works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dock is quite large and you will need to make room for it on a table or shelf.  I was amused to note that the manual warned against using the dock or plugging in the razor in a bathroom. I am not sure why this is - the power cord has a small switching wall-wart on the plug end, and it is universal voltage.  Maybe it&#x27;s the lack of a ground-fault interrupter that makes it unsuitable for bathroom use?  I expect most users to ignore this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the Panasonic ES-LV81 and it gave me the best shave I have ever experienced.  If you&#x27;re willing to pay the price, you&#x27;ll get a superb product. (A note on the price - I have observed that when Amazon doesn&#x27;t have the product in stock, it shows the list price, but when it is in stock, the price is significantly lower.  Even at the lower price I have seen, that&#x27;s a lot of money for a shaver in my opinion.)speed and then at \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; speed, at intervals.  At the end of the wash, it enters the dry cycle.  After either a clean/dry or dry cycle, it charges.  You can select clean/dry/charge, dry/charge or just charge.

    <li> To cut to the chase: the razor works OK. By OK, I mean that it does the job. Sort of, anyway. Like all electric razors I&#x27;ve used, it produces an uneven shave and, overall, is frustrating and cumbersome to use: you&#x27;ll definitely have to go over some areas of your face repeatedly before the hair is actually cut. And even then, the hair on your face will grow out unevenly. It would seem that an electric razor would be far less irritating, but in fact this razor was extremely irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly don&#x27;t understand the retail price of this razor -- given that it&#x27;s no different than any other I&#x27;ve used, regardless of price point. In fact, I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s even as good as a Norelco I tried that cost 80% less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real bottom line is that electric razors stink, overall. I keep waiting for one that doesn&#x27;t, but it appears the wait is in vain.</li>
    <li> This is my first Panasonic, having been a Norelco user for almost 30 years.  I like the closeness of the shave and the ease of cleaning the unit.  No more razor burn!  My only complaint is that the size of the head interferes with the trimmer, but I have another trimmer for my beard anyway.</li>
    <li> I have used many different types of shavers over the years, but have used Braun exclusively for at least fifteen. Braun makes an excellent product. As I just found out, Panasonic does, too. The Panasonic Multi Flex Nanotech has given me an even closer shave than my Braun, while being comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large head (with five blades) took some getting used to, but it shaves more closely with fewer passes than my two-bladed Braun. Also, I find that my beard is not as heavy a day later as it was with my Braun. The head pivots two ways, and the arced blades easily accommodate the shape of my face and neck. The pop-up trimmer is easy to use and works well. I use it most often as a dry shaver, but it can also be used in the shower or with shaving cream/gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base automatically cleans and dries the shaver using a cleaning cartridge and tap water. If you prefer, the directions tell you how to clean the shaver by hand so you don&#x27;t have to buy their cartridges... it&#x27;s very easy either way. I love the LCD readout which lets you know when to clean it, how many minutes have been used, and the battery status. I find I can get at least two weeks of shaves from one charge. You can recharge the battery by directly plugging in the shaver, or if you place it in the base correctly, there are contact points on the handle which will automatically start the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium shaver, and you&#x27;ll have to decide if it&#x27;s worth the premium cost. I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/26/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still LOVE this shaver! I took it on a fifteen-day trip and forgot my cord. It was fully charged when I left, and still had 20% charge left when I returned home after shaving every day. Also, I have started shaving more often \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with a small amount of shaving gel, and it&#x27;s unbelievable how close the shave feels!  I continue to be very pleased with this shaver, and recommend it highly to my friends.</li>
    <li> EDIT 1/5/12: The cleaning cartridge ran out and I was forced to use my Braun for the past couple days.  There&#x27;s just no comparison.  The panasonic is a much smoother, less painful shave.  1) I used this razor for over a month before writing this review.    2) For comparison, I have been using Braun electric razors for about 10 years (most recently a Series 7 Pulsonic).   3) I ALWAYS wash and use a pre-electric on my face before I shave.    4)Even though it&#x27;s waterproof, I never tried it in the shower.  I did rinse it under the sink once, which only removed some of the cannon fodder inside the head.  I initially got this as a backup to take to out for field exercises and deployments but will retire the Braun to the cabinet now instead.  My neck is pretty sensitive to any sort of shaving; I had no issues w/ this razor irritating my skin or producing &#x27;neck vomit&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t have terribly thick stubble, but there was no problem w/ 5 o&#x27;clock shadow showing up at lunchtime.  I shaved after 2-3 days growth a couple times and the shave was just as close as w/ only one days growth.  It did take a little longer, but that&#x27;s to be expected.  PROS:   Huge foil/razor head - It really did cut down on my shave time by about 30 seconds.  Cleaning cartridge - It lasts six months.  My Braun cartridges are done in about 30 days.  $9.99/3 months or $13.99/3 months.  You do the math.  Battery life - The fact that it takes less time to shave will result in longer time between charges.  I cleaned/charged mine almost every day, but something to consider if you plan on taking this camping, hunting, etc, or not using the charging/cleaning station regularly.  CONS:  Huge foil/razor head - It&#x27;s a quicker shave, but man the size of this thing is bordering on ridiculous when you take it out of the box.  Whatever, it works.  Clean/charge station - I never timed it, but it had to take at least an hour to run the clean cycle.  And it&#x27;s LOUD.  I couldn&#x27;t even run the clean cycle in the morning for fear of waking the family.  Can&#x27;t speak on long term sustainabiity, but the thing looks kind of cheaply made. Not what I would expect for a $600 razor.  Travel kit/bag - It&#x27;s just some cheapo pleather knock-off thing w/ a cap that just covers the foil.  Braun got it right here.  Hard case all the way.  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied w/ the razor and it will serve as my daily go-to over the Braun.  I didn&#x27;t think I would make the switch, but the pros of this razor really are that good.  I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it because I am a Vine reviewer, but if I had forked out the $599 that Amazon wanted at the time I got it, I would have been left feeling a little disappointed over what this package lacks.  If you wipe your butt with 500 bucks, you&#x27;ll probably feel like you got your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LV81-K Wet/Dry Shaver provides an incredibly close and comfortable shave. It&#x27;s a step up from my old Panasonic [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU ES-LA63-S]] 4-Blade Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver, which I&#x27;ve been using for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Panasonic ES-LV81-K model has one major improvement over the older models. It has 5 nanotech blades instead of 4. The 5 blades consist of a cutter block, 2 foils above the cutter block, and 2 foils below the cutter block (the old model has only 1 foil above the cutter block). I really like the new design because it helps to get more stubble on the \\&quot;up\\&quot; stroke than my 4-blade Panasonic ES-LA63-S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Close and Comfortable Shave&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaves as close as traditional shaving blades. In fact, this shaver definitely provides a more comfortable shave than traditional blades - wet or dry. There&#x27;s no need for shaving foam, although you can use it if you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/Dry Convenience&lt;br /&gt;I usually opt for dry shaving simply because it&#x27;s more convenient, but I occasionally choose to have a wet shave for the increased comfort a wet shave provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy To Clean&lt;br /&gt;If you elect not to use the cleaning dock, you can easily clean the shaver by rinsing it under tap water (with the shaver running). There&#x27;s no need to crack it open to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pop-Up Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is comfortable to hold. The back of the shaver is rubberized to help improve your grip on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the ES-LV81-K worth spending so much money on? That&#x27;s a tough call. If the price of the shaver is a drop in the bucket for you, then the answer would be a resounding YES! Otherwise, you will do well to look at a close contender to the Panasonic ES-LV81-K -- the Braun Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- ES-LV81-K vs. [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7]]&lt;br /&gt;I used for Braun Series 7 for 3 years before switching over to the Panasonic. In my opinion, the Braun Series 7 does as good a job as the Panasonic ES-LV81-K, but it requires more strokes to achieve a shave with the same level of closeness that the Panasonic ES-LV81-K delivers. The Braun Series 7 has only 3 blades (1 cutter block, and 1 foil on each side of the cutter block).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the body of the Braun is slightly flatter and feels a little more ergonomic than the Panasonic. The build on the Braun also seems a little more substantial than the Panasonic (the Braun is made in Germany, while the Panasonic is made in Japan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;There you have it! I love the Panasonic ES-LV81-K Shaver for the incredibly close shave it provides and for the ease with which it can be cleaned. It&#x27;s a high-performing and wonderfully convenient shaver, but the price seems a little exorbitant. If you&#x27;re strapped for cash, consider getting the Braun Series 7 instead.S-LV81-K, but it requires more strokes to achieve a shave with the same level of closeness that the Panasonic ES-LV81-K delivers.

    <li> Until now, I have used a Braun 7 series shaver (and still love it).  However, the Panasonic ES-LV81-K kicks its butt.  The difference is in the speed of the shave.  With 2 more blades this thing cuts my shave time in half.  With the Braun I needed to go back and forth quite a few times, taking about 4-5 minutes.  With the Panasonic I am done in 2 minutes.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down-side is the price of this device.  I got it from Amazon for a great discount as a Deal of the Day.  If it were not for this discount I would not have tried it.  But with the results I now feel that it is worth the high price. Worth it completely...!</li>
    <li> Alright, out fo the gate, I&#x27;ll have to admit that a shaver with a list price of $599.95 seems insane.  The actual $350-$450 you might actually pay is quite a high price of admission, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s worth it.  For the price of admission you get an amazingly close, comfortable shave.  There are some pros and cons to keep in mind...  This baby delivers a closer shave than Braun&#x27;s best shaver and you can use it in the shower as it works wet or dry.  It&#x27;s hefty feeling, but not heavy, and perfectly balanced in the hand. The shaver feels well built.  Though it is plastic, it certainly does not feel cheap at all. The battery indicator and cool blue display are very easy to read and quite accurate. A very nice feature. It&#x27;s ergonomics are a little strange, but once you&#x27;re used to it, it&#x27;s not a problem. The shaver head, housing 5 blades, is quite large though. This makes shaving under your nose a little tricky, especially for those men with not a lot of real estate between the nose and upper lip.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with the large head, but I can see where some men might. The automatic cleaning system works like a charm, and though the refills cost about the same as Braun&#x27;s, they seem to last a lot longer. The shaver is fairly quiet for having such a large shaving head.  The only negatives I can find with this shaver are the cost of consumables and replacement parts.  To replace the shaver foil and cutter will set you back well over $80.  I suppose if you can afford this shaver, you&#x27;ll be able to afford the replacement parts as well though. One minor complaint is that it comes with a flimsy vinyl travel case.  Something this pricey should come with a hard case for travel.  Ultimately, a shave that is superior to every other shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Truly amazing.</li>
    <li> I had been using a different btand shaver but this is superior to any of the others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> product lives up to the good reviews I read.  shaves closer than the other electric razor I had and left a smooth face feeling.  One rating mentioned &amp;#34;to much noise&amp;#34; and I do not find it that objectionable.  Instructions for care were good and have been rinsing the shaver after use and it is performing very well.  I have had the shaver 1 1/2 months and still enjoy it.  Find it is better with shave cream than with just a wet face.  Personal preference as to how it slides over the beard.  Overall it is better than I expected  as the Panasonic shaver is the second shaver I have used.  First one I got in Jan, 2015 and got the Panasonic  shaver the beginning of February, 2015.</li>
    <li> I keep hoping for a good electric razor, but have never been as satisfied as with a regular razor. I bought this one about a month ago, and while it is pretty good, for the price it doesn&#x27;t make sense. For this amount of money, you could buy several years worth of regular blades. Shave is ok, but just not worth the price.</li>
    <li> After 15 years using a Braun, I got fed up wasting money on the Braun refill system. I bought the Panasonic after some research and I can honestly say after two weeks of use this thing it&#x27;s not worth the money. First of all, the head is far too big, the 5 blade system is a marketing gimmick. It&#x27;s ok shaving the side of the face and neck but around the chin and upper lip its awkward. Second, the shave is close but stubble that grows back later in the day is rough and sharp. It&#x27;s the exact same shaving experience as a razor. My Braun was always smoother. Lastly, not sure whats causing it but I&#x27;m getting shaving rash around my lower neck. Save your money and buy a razor if you want the same shaving experience as the Panasonic. I like electric shavers so I&#x27;m dumping this. Sorry Braun all is forgiven !</li>
    <li> first electric shaver, find it absolutly fantastic good bye old razor, price was also great, bought on a special sale, i live in Australia and this item is double price, been using over 2 weeks and shaving just gets better</li>
    <li> I like this razor better than any other I have tried.  However, I would like a little closer shave.  Thanks.  Jerry Von Tungeln</li>
    <li> First a little background. I&#x27;m 65, and was a confirmed electric shaver user until 3 years ago. I had used most of the electrics (Norelco, Remington, Braun, &amp; Wahl) either extensively or for trial periods before switching to a double edge blade razor. I was happy with the switch for 2 1/2 years, enjoying the drawn out ritual of blade shaving and shaves closer than I had ever gotten with any electric. Then everything changed last October. I suffered a heart attack and underwent a triple by-pass. After the surgery I lost some vision in both eyes to a stroke-like event likely caused by a micro-clot during the cardiac procedure (uncommon but by no means rare). The end result was that I was getting a multitude of small cuts every time I shaved. I was having too much trouble with my vision to continue with the blade, so I decided to try an electric again.&lt;br /&gt;  The last electric I had used was a Braun Pulsonic. I don&#x27;t know the exact model number, but would not try that series again. It had the more narrow trimmer than the first two (wore them out) Brauns I had and loved. When the trimmer quit working, I saw that the trimmer was powered by a plastic vibrating/oscillating gear/tooth thingie. Since the shave I got from this Braun wasn&#x27;t up to those two earlier ones, I gave it away. Before those Brauns, I had a couple of Remingtons preceded by a couple of Norelcos. All had been OK, but not great. My Dad died earlier this year, and left behind a Norelco of about 2007 0r 2008 vintage. He had tried it for a month or two and then switched to a Wahl, so I figured to try the Norelco out. After 3 weeks, I knew this wasn&#x27;t the answer so I did a lot of research and decided to try a Panasonic. I had used one for a week or two some years ago between the first two Brauns and remembered that it seemed good then.&lt;br /&gt;  I settled on the LV81-K, figuring that it was their latest and from review after review their best. Expensive? Yes, but quality often is. I ordered one and waited. Upon the shaver&#x27;s arrival, I unpacked it from its quite good packaging and charged it with just the cord. The first shave, with Williams Lectric Shave, wasn&#x27;t baby&#x27;s bottom smooth but it was darned close. Succeeding shaves have gotten better. I can now get a smooth shave lasting all day and evening with minimal effort and no chafing or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve shaved with the LV81-K for 2 weeks now and here are my pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1 - Very smooth and close shave with no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;2 - It&#x27;s quiet. Whiny like a hornet, but with low volume. The high (14,000) RPM works.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Ergonomics. This razor looks huge, but fits my hand well and it took me only a couple of minutes to feel at home with its handling. It really is no problem shaving the upper lip quickly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;4 - Travel lock. This such a no-brainer I wonder why shaver makers didn&#x27;t start including this feature twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;5 - Wet shaving capability. I&#x27;ve only used the shaver wet (for me, in the shower) 3 times, but this has produced the best shaves yet. They&#x27;re super close, the closest yet. There is NO irritation of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;6 -Trimmer. This one is better than OK, where the Braun&#x27;s was mickeymouse and the Norelco&#x27;s is laughable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1 - Size. The LV81-K is HUGE. Actually, just the shaving head is huge, but it does its job so well that the size isn&#x27;t an issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;2 - Tone. The tone of the shaver&#x27;s noise output is so like that of a hornet that my wife has gone looking for the bug&#x27;s whereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;Twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknowns&lt;br /&gt;1 - Cleaning/charging/drying system. I haven&#x27;t actually used the very large charging etc. stand yet so I can&#x27;t comment on it. If you and your significant other share a one sink bathroom you&#x27;re going to have to put this beast elsewhere, an elsewhere with a handy electric outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this is by far the best performing, closest shaving, least irritating electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. It looks as if my large collection of quality double edge gear is redundant now. Check eBay for some bargains around Thanksgiving.</li>
    <li> THE PANASONIC RAZOR IS AS GOOD AS ANY I HAVE TRIED.  UP TO NOW I HAVE USED ALL OF THE BRAUN SERIES (LAST WAS THE 7 SERIES).  VERY CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
    <li> My beard seems more difficult to cut as I age. It was taking longer for my expensive Braun or Norelco shavers to complete a shave. I read reviews and decided to buy the Panasonic ES-LV81-K. It is not a disappointment. Quieter than my Braun, this shaver provided the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any electric shaver. And it was also the fastest. This shaver is remarkable. I don&#x27;t care that it seems a little heavy, that the head is plastic, or that I may need to replace the detergent cartridge several times a year. This is a great shaver, which I highly recommend to anyone who has the bucks to buy it.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah.......no more cuts or razor burn. After a month, I took the plunge and used it wet....I swear, close as a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Excellent, well made, relatively quiet, well-designed, stylish shaver giving very, very close shaves with very little time and effort needed due to the 5 blades. After having now used Panny&#x27;s ES-LV95s and their newest ES-LV9N and Braun&#x27;s 9090cc and 9290 since buying the LV 81K in 2015, I continue to return to the Lv-81K as it is easier to maneuver, feels more comfortable in the hand, shaves as closely as the other Panny&#x27;s and closer than the Brauns, has no irritation, is lighter weight and, for me, is just a better electric shaver. I do like the Braun cleaning/charging station better than the Panny&#x27;s but, that not why you buy an electric shaver. The ES LV81K is the winner as the best shaving system. Pricey, although now less than the newer models and less than it was in 2015 so, it&#x27;s a great buy and well worth the expense.Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to buy panasonic shaver,but It&#x27;s Exceeded my expectations.As a dry shave, it&#x27;s smooth and never irritates my skin.I use it every other day..</li>
    <li> i am enjoying the shaver very much.it does what it is suppose to due. it cuts close to the skin and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd shaver and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far. The shaver itself is slick looking, with a glossy black body and a cool blue LCD display to alert you to the length of your shave, your battery level, charge level, cleaning updates and more. The ON/OFF button is easy to accidentally click again after you start shaving so the included lock button is pretty handy. I&#x27;ve used the cleaning cradle once so far and I noticed the difference in power once it was complete, so love that as well. The single head smoothly contours to your face with an impressive variety of tilting motions, and it can be locked in place if preferred. Lastly, the blade technology is clearly superb. Probably the cleanest shaves I have ever gotten are with this machine.  Some gripes: The most obvious is the brutal price. As much as I enjoy this shaver it shouldn&#x27;t be worth several hundred dollars more than a top of the line $200 model from another brand. I really can&#x27;t find a feature that would justify the extra expense. You also can&#x27;t shave while charging the unit, so if you&#x27;re out of juice, then no shave even with the A/C adapter. This was not a problem with my last Philips mid-price model. Lastly, the head itself is quite large so it&#x27;s not always easy to get hard to reach corners like under your nose when you can&#x27;t really see what you&#x27;re doing. I see the value in the old triangular shape with 3 heads that some models have to address this.  Overall, if price isn&#x27;t a concern then this is a top pick.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin - I can&#x27;t shave manually without bleeding profusely - and it is very difficult for me to find an adequate shaver. The Panasonic ES-LV81 is a very gentle and efficient shaver. It comes with a convenient charging/cleaning station. I would give it a 5/5 rating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several high-end shavers in the past, most recently Braun, and they always had trouble with the thickness of my hair. I don&#x27;t want a beard so I shave every day (if I have time). To get a close shave with other shavers required over 20 minutes and would cause redness and irritation. I decided to try this mack-daddy and it really does the job. It is very smooth, not too loud, but most importantly it goes through the beard without much trouble. I keep my skin wet while shaving and I think that does a lot to prevent irritation. The shave is a lot quicker and it&#x27;s just easier. I don&#x27;t really have to hold my skin in funny positions to get a clean cut. It does the job and I&#x27;ve just been cleaning it with soap and water and letting it dry, so I haven&#x27;t had to deal with the expense of refill cartridges. I would recommend this shaver to anyone with a heavy beard. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> Best shaver ive ever owned!!!! Way better tahn braun series 7</li>
    <li> I have used Braun and Norelco in the past and found them very good. This shaver outdoes them by giving closer shaves, quietly, and smoothly.  It is easy to clean even if not using the included cleaning device. People have mentioned that it is harder to get under the nose because of the large head, but I have not had that difficulty.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver! Close and comfortable, I put away my razor and soaps. Only drawback is the level of DBs rolling over your face. Why do they have to be so loud?</li>
    <li> Coming from a guy who can grow a full beard over a weekend, this razor rocks! It has broader than normal head so it covers more real estate faster, but doesn&#x27;t chew up your face in the process. The dry only option, on the charging station, means I can give the razor a good rinse and let it roll, keeping me from having to buy a rack of cleaning cartridges. The only down side is while it&#x27;s self cleaning it sounds like a cell phone going off on vibrate, which sometimes wakes up the wife. I&#x27;ve bought \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; razors in the past ($200 bucks on average) and I&#x27;m glad I splurged on the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers, but gave them up a couple of years ago to go a Phillips Norelco rotary razor. While the Norelco did an okay job, I found myself spending much too much time shaving, even after I changed the blades. Even then, it only did a fair job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this hi-tech wet/dry from Panasonic. WOW! This is without a doubt the best shaving experience I have had in years. I use this razor in the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; function, with a gel shaving cream. Even after spending time spreading the cream on my face, my total shaving time has decreased by several minutes with this baby. It shaves very close on the very first go-round. While the instructions say to give it about 30 days to adjust to the skin, I adjusted right away. It was almost like my skin was telling me, \\&quot;Thank you\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have when compared to the Norelco is that this razor makes a louder noise, so it might wake my wife from her sleep. But the good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t last that long because I&#x27;m done so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor charges in about one hour, and you can do this with a cord or by inserting it in the charger/cleaning station provided. With the cord though, you cannot use the razor to shave, but there is an LED readout that tells you how much charge is left so you should never get caught short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor. I say that this is for the guy who has everything because of the very steep price. Others compared it with a Mercedes and a Cadillac, and it definitely falls into the luxury category. But your face will thank you.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive shaver I have ever used. Is it worth it? I&#x27;m not sure, but it does give me the best shave I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used the shaver dry. It gave a close shave with slight irritation. The shave was much better than a 4-blade safety razor and slightly better than my old Braun Syncro electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the Panasonic ES-LV81 wet and with shaving cream. You can&#x27;t do this with the Syncro. Wow. Not only did it give me the closest shave ever, it did it with no irritation. Although it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had a professional shave, I don&#x27;t remember the professional shave being this smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried the shaver in the shower. This also resulted in a close shave, but I had difficulty making sure I didn&#x27;t miss any areas since I don&#x27;t have a mirror in my shower. I had to do it by feel and I didn&#x27;t do as good a job as I had done over sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridges seem to consist of just soap. You provide your own water for the cleaning tank. The cartridges are not that expensive (cheaper than the Braun Clean and Renew tanks) and they don&#x27;t have alcohol. The alcohol containing Braun tanks could not be shipped airmail because of the alcohol. The cleaning system seems to work well, but I clean mine manually first to get off the shaving cream. This makes for redundant cleaning. You can set the system to just dry and not use the cleaning cycle, but I haven&#x27;t done this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a fabulous shaver, but it will cost you.</li>
    <li> I have use about every razor out there including other foil shavers. This is without a doubt the best I have ever had. Combined with the ability to shave in the shower or out and clean it without the expensive cleaners is very convenient. But the shave, I just cant say enough good things about!</li>
    <li> Had the braun 8585 for 10 years and it finally is to the end of its life, loved the shaver-never thought of ever buying the panasonic. Bought the braun 790cc razor 2 months ago and was not pleased with it what so ever, even did a side by side comparison with the 8585 on each side of my face and the braun 790cc didnt cut nearly as close and took multple more passes to even get close to my old one-and the new one still never did... Being that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied whatsoever I capitalized on the returning for my money back and I sure am happy I did, however, note they will send you a visa gift card in up to 10 weeks (oh well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching over and over and reading so many reviews on this shaver i decided to take the plunge, I was nervous b/c I dont want to go through the returning again, especially since amazon had them on sale for 214.99 otd with free shipping (look for the deals), the braun I paid 190+tax so it wasn&#x27;t much more but it shaves night and day for me, very close :) BTW: i do not use razors because my skin is sensitive and I breakout if I do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the closest shave I have had in a long time. I shave twice a day and this thing kicks butt. I also didnt notice the issues others have with getting the top of the lip or in-between the eyes. isn&#x27;t an issue for me maybe b/c of larger head lol JK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this shaver for a week and I havent yet tried the shavers cleaning solution since I used what a lot of people suggested just putting foam soap on it after a shave and putting it on the microvibration and putting it in the charger to dry, it also has a heat cycle to disinfect i believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 axis rotation of the head is nice and makes it easy to shave (chest, upper arms, etc) BTW: i dont grow a full beard like other guys do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am personally very happy (almost fixed my braun since i wasnt sure anything out there was as good) and for all the other reviewers that state it isn&#x27;t good I personally just don&#x27;t understand then again you cant make everyone happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving since the 1960&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve used blades with shaving cream and electrics. Virtually all of my electrics have been made by Braun or Norelco. The Panasonic ES-LV81 is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using the ES-LV81 for just over a month and have a few observations based on that experience.  - As good as it is, I&#x27;d have trouble justifying the purchase for myself. When I mentioned it to my dermatologist, he compared it to cosmetic surgery: you have to decide for yourself if it&#x27;s worth the cost for the benefits you expect to receive. On the other hand, I think almost anyone who shaves on a regular basis would welcome this as a gift.  - The ES-LV81 is both larger and heavier than I expected. This is not to say that it&#x27;s ungainly or hard to handle, just different from the Norelcos and Brauns I&#x27;ve used in the past. It feels solid and well-made (the razor is made in Japan, the cleaning base is made in China).  - The thing that most surprised me: I experienced no discomfort or irritation from the first use several weeks ago on through this morning. There was no break-in period for me. The last time I moved from one Norelco to a newer (3-4 years) version of the same model, I suffered irritation on my neck for about ten days. There is a 30-Day satisfaction guarantee and an entreaty to please stick with it for 30 days.  - The reason I chose the ES-LV81 over the ES-LV61 was that I was curious about the cleaning system. The self-cleaning recharger does exactly what it is intended to do: it throughly cleans the razor and then charges it. It tried using it once a day and then every four or five days; the cleaning performance was the same in either case. I do think the self-cleaning recharger would make a good project for a talented industrial designer;  to my eye it&#x27;s bulky, unattractive, and retro (and not cool retro, just out of date).  The self-cleaning recharger uses a proprietary detergent cartridge which is good for about 30 cleanings.  Three-packs are currently available from Amazon for about ten dollars and are available under the Subscribe &amp; Save program, which takes 15% off the price at the time of shipping.  - The self-cleaning recharger is kind of noisy. You definitely would want to start it in the morning before you leave the house and not at bedtime.  - One thing I like about the ES-LV81 is that, while it may be a little louder than some other electrics, I can clearly hear the sound of individual whiskers being chopped off. This is great for places like my neck and below my jawline; I just keep going until I don&#x27;t hear any more cutting instead of relying on a mirror and my middle-aged eyes. My experience is that whiskers on my neck are less likely to be cut with an electric if they are missed and grow out even a little. I&#x27;ve always had to touch up my neck every few days with a conventional razor. I have not had to do this since using the ES-LV81. I did try it a blade touch-up a couple of times in the shower, but found none of the 1/8\\&quot; or longer whiskers that usually turned up in my Gillette Fusion in the past.  - Panasonic specifies liquid hand soap to clean the shaver if you choose not the use or cannot use the self-cleaning recharger (a travel case for the shaver is included). Instructions are both in the manual and on a separate insert.  - Panasonic recommends changing the outer foil once a year and replacing the inner blades every other year. These parts are not yet widely available in the US. The foil can be found for about sixty dollars and the blades for about thirty-five dollars. A combo pack is about eighty dollars. I would expect to see lower prices as they become available from more retail outlets, including Amazon. It would be foolish to buy such a high quality device and not maintain it. It&#x27;s also true that you could buy a new lower-end Norelco or Braun every other year for about the cost of foils and blades for the ES-LV81.  This is not a casual purchase, but it seems to be a quality product that should have a long useful life if properly maintained.</li>
    <li> This is a present for my husband&#x27;s birthday and that will not happen for a few more days.  From all the write ups I have read, this is the best shaver.  I am hoping my husband thinks so too.  It looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve had bad experiences with electric shavers and think you&#x27;ll shave into your old age with shaving cream and a safety-razor take heed: Your shaving salvation is at hand! Your shalvation... shavlation... Something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I&#x27;ve been using the Panasonic ES-LV81-K every day for more than a year. It is, by a wide margin, the best personal grooming tool I&#x27;ve ever owned. It is capable of delicate edge work with the built-in edge trimmer and silky smooth cheeks, chins, and dimples with its exceptional wet/dry cutting action. It is very easy to clean--I&#x27;ve had little problem running it under warm water to rinse hair and shaving scum off the blades after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year into ownership, it still cuts like it did the first day. I&#x27;ve only used the (included) cleaning solution on the unit once and other than that have simply rinsed it in warm water. Unlike every other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, this unit simply continues to impress me. With past electric shavers I&#x27;ve thrown the device in to the trash in less than three months. The Panasonic continues to impress. Plus, the simple availability of replacement parts guarantees that when the blades finally do dull to the point they need to be sharpened or replaced they will be readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is well crafted, and is comfortable even in my (admittedly) large hand, and in combination with the smooth articulation of the shaving head contribute to your confidence in giving yourself an accurate shave, every morning. If you have to do a lot of tight work around your beard, take note: The edges of the foils are very accurate. You may not need to use the edge trimmer every time you shave in order to keep your beard in order. But if you must you&#x27;ll find the edge trimmer remains aligned correctly and doesn&#x27;t pull or pluck hairs, cutting them cleanly as close to the skin as you&#x27;d dare, leaving the rest for a trim with the foils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: I can&#x27;t think of any. The charge lasts for a long time. So long, in fact that it will surprise you. If you shave every day you&#x27;ll find you can go for 4-5 days without using the charger and stay above 60% power. If you shave only once or twice per week it will go even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are an absolutely clean-shaver this is the best razor money can buy. If you edge and trim a beard or mustache it is in the top three. I love mine and look forward to shaving with it for at least a decade, based on longevity of the models that preceded it and whose reviews can be found readily here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is superior to just about everything else out there, and although you might find razors that cost more money, you won&#x27;t find razors that give a better shave at any price.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor.  Seems well made.  I hope cleaning materials won&#x27;t be needed to often, since they only give you two.</li>
    <li> This was purchased by my husband just over two years ago. It is the best shave ever from an electric razor. For two years it has saved us on the ridiculous expense of blades and shave cream. However, now that the warranty has just expired, this unit is malfunctioning and Panasonic is impossible to deal with. Their phone numbers all lead to automated systems. They refuse to converse with us. They have a chat system online, but the agents there are awful. They tell us where the repair center is, using only a physical address, but will not give us a phone number or put us in touch with somebody who can assist in diagnosing the issue.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for my husbands in December. It is now July and it still gets the job done. The amount of razor burn and breakouts have diminished greatly since my husband has been using this razor. It gives a smooth shave and it gets hard to reach places. We love the cleaning feature, it is worth having to buy the cleaning solution!</li>
    <li> This is the third Panasonic electric shaver that I&#x27;ve owned. I like the Panasonic shavers, and this model is no exception. It is very good and gives an excellent shave. I have a heavy beard and it gives me a smooth and close shave. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> In the world of electric razors there are two basic types:  The foil type (like those made by Braun and Panasonic).  And the rotary type (like those made by Norelco).  I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for many years.  They shave well and they&#x27;re easy to clean.  My old Norelco burned up (literally), and I thought I&#x27;d try a foil-type razor again just to see if there was anything I was missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise:  The first thing I noticed is that this razor is a lot louder than a Norelco.  This isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning if noise is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of shaving:  For the neck and cheek area it&#x27;s great.  But the Panasonic is not as easy to use around the chin when compared to a Norelco.  Specifically, I think Norelco razors follow contoured areas of the face with less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics:  This razor isn&#x27;t as easy to hold and maneuver as a traditional type Norelco razor.  When I say a &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; type, I mean the older style Norelco razors they&#x27;ve been making for decades, and not the newer Norelco SensoTouch series.  In my opinion, the Norelco SensoTouch razors are a far cry ergonomically from the easy-to-hold shape of the traditional Norelco razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness:  This razor shaves very smooth and close.  But then again, I don&#x27;t think it shaves any more smoothly or any closer than Norelco razors costing a fourth as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of cleaning:  I have no interest in using cleaning systems.  They may be convenient in some ways, but I&#x27;d rather not have to periodically clean the cleaning system or replenish it with special cleaning fluids.  I prefer to clean electric razors myself using hot running water, soap, and/or isopropyl alcohol.  Overall, I think the traditional Norelco razor is a little easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:  The workmanship of this razor is excellent.  Upon close examination, I didn&#x27;t find a single scratch or blemish in the finish.  Please note that although the razor itself is made in Japan, the AC adapter and the cleaning system are both made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:  I returned this razor for a refund.  Apparently, I&#x27;m just not the foil razor type.  I get a faster and easier shave with a Norelco.  In addition, I find the traditional Norelco razors a little easier to clean, and they cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd razor I am returning to Amazon after shaving the red status has a constant red color lit when placed in the cleaning charger.  Panasonic said I should return it to them.  I decided after the 3rd one to switch brands.</li>
    <li> My  husband needed a good electric shaver because of severe weakness in one arm.  This one gives him a terrific shave using only one hand.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the most expensive electrical shavers but worth it. Does not give you as close shave as razor. But at same time, if you have sensitive skin, does not irritate it or opens up scabs.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product. This shaver works exactly as advertised. Even when using dry, you can expect a near razor close shave. The battery life is great and i especially love the charging option.  Traveling? No worries there, take it with you and bring along the cord.  The razor charges through either the cleaning station or cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station works exceptionally well and doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol smell other detergents have. Hands down, this is the Rolls-Royce of electric shavers.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great close shave.  Takes a little while to get used to but stick with it and you will be rewarded.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to this electric shaver for a long time.And now I finally own it. Apart from the a little loud sound of it, it is the best of all my shavers.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used, and possibly the best shaver in the market today. I have been shaving with electric foil shavers for the past 20 years and thought that there was no shaver out there that could shave as close as a blade. Until I discovered the Panasonic ES LV-81K. It is simply amazing!. It really is. It is one of those “you have to see it to believe it”  kind of thing. I have been using a Braun Series 7 Pulsonic for the past 5 years and that is a fine shaver as well, but the Panasonic offers a closer shave hands down. I usually shave dry or with the Bold shaving gel for even a closer and more comfortable shave. You can’t get a better shaver. You have to see it (and try it) to believe it.</li>
    <li> Great close and fast shave.  Best Electric Razor I have used so far!</li>
    <li> Silent and efficient.</li>
    <li> The LV81-K shaves slightly faster than the previous model. It shaves close enough to cause minor irritation - more like you know you shaved, than irritation. The ergonomics could be better with my fingers constantly adjusting the lock or trim tool. I like that the blue light doesn&#x27;t flash all the time, but still wish the display was more useful. I can&#x27;t say it is a necessity over the previous model, but can say that I am glad I have it.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how good this shaver is, I had never experiences such a close and smooth shave with an electric shaver (or a shaver blade). It is also very fast, less than two minutes. The cleaning base is nice and leaves the blades very clean, altough I think that using it once a week is enough for dry shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaves with foam are very comfortable, but I get better results with a dry shave.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite electric razor ever.</li>
    <li> Boy am I an idiot! About every 10 years or so I get the urge to try an electric razor. I have always bought the top of the line razors and have never been satisfied with the results. I don&#x27;t have a very tough beard so an electric should work somewhat well. I Googled the &amp;#34;best electric razors&amp;#34; on line and this Panasonic was at the top of most everyone&#x27;s list. So I decided, what the heck, it&#x27;s been years since I tried and electric razor and there should be some significant advancements. What a joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I have been using the Gillette Fusion Power razor (not an electric razor in the sense of this Panasonic). The Fusion runs circles around this Panasonic electric razor. One: the shave is far better with the Fusion, with the Panasonic, even after spending far too much time shaving with it, I still have stubble like I haven&#x27;t shaved for a day, 2: It takes about 1/3 to 1/2 the time to shave with the Fusion, and 3: for what the Panasonic costs, I will get years of better shaving with the Fusion at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Panasonic, you make excellent products. This is just not one of them!</li>
    <li> I have a really thick beard.  I normally can not shave with an electric razor if I have more than 1 day of growth or I will get really bad razor burn on my neck.  I normally shave with a blade and have to change the blade every 3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shaver for Christmas.  THANK YOU SANTA!  I didn&#x27;t shave for 2 days so I had a very thick beard growing and took this shaver into the shower with me.  I wet my face and applied shaving butter all over my face.  This stuff is great if you have never used it.  I then proceeded to shave with my new razor.  I didn&#x27;t feel a single thing.  Not one hair pull or anything!  It cut through my beard like nothing at all.  I can&#x27;t believe what a great shave it gave me.  It was fast and easy and gave me a better shave than using a razor!  I then just rinsed the shaver off and put it in the charger to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used a regular blade since and I shave daily.  Thank you Panasonic.  This is by far the best razor I have ever owned, and I have purchased several.  It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever had, A+++++!!!!! Shaves as close as a blade, I love it, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I very seldom take time to write reviews, although I often read them (I know, \\&quot;freeloader,\\&quot; right?), but this new Panasonic shaver is just too awesome to leave unheralded.  I have had a number of electric shavers over the years; my previous one was also a Panasonic, but it was getting to the point that it took a whole charge to shave, and left my face irritated and raw.  I had already replaced the blades once and the foil twice, so ...  After getting myself over the \\&quot;sticker shock,\\&quot; I went ahead and ordered this Panasonic. For the price, I expected/intended to be impressed, but I&#x27;ve been more like blown away.  This shaver does a GREAT (!!!) job for me.  I shave my head, too, and it&#x27;s not only a much quicker process than I&#x27;d been putting up with, it&#x27;s just as close as a blade (as close as I can reasonably get, anyway), and essentially no irritation.  I researched the \\&quot;competing\\&quot; Braun models as well.  They&#x27;re not as expensive, but they&#x27;re also not wet/dry, and honestly, I personally doubt that they&#x27;re really in the same league as the Arc 5 - a league of its own, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Go ahead and splurge; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Took a little time to get used to it but nice</li>
    <li> well worth the additional dollars.  feels as close as a blade.</li>
    <li> My children and I purchased this gift for my husband.  He loves it.  We purchased it 3 months ago, and my husband doesn&#x27;t mind shaving everyday anymore.  He says this electric shaver does not come near any of the other ones he has ever owned. This shaver is far more superior and a very comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR IS EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED FOR A CLOSE SHAVE AFTER A SMALL BREAK-IN PERIOD. VERY EASY TO CLEAN AND HOLDS A LONG CHARGE.</li>
    <li> Product great:  but no small bottle of anything included, (as pictured here).</li>
    <li> The packaging and the product both look high-quality. I bought it for my dad. He loves it! This is the most expensive shaver he has ever owned. The price after discount is a good deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased it mainly for shaving my head and it does a great job. I suspect it would do well on face, but I have beard.</li>
    <li> Only early experience with shaver so far.  It is giving a closer shave than Braun.  Am concerned about lubrication when cleaned and would appreciate your answering this question.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous shaver. Fits my hand perfect, gives a close shave and easy to clean. Panasonic you&#x27;ve done I it again!</li>
    <li> Have had this shaver for over a year.  Was an old Braun user, but their new ones hurt my face.  Tried the ARC-4 and this one (ARC -5) is much smoother and more comfortable.  Cleaning station (the cartridges) are worthless, though.  Use the tap.  I know Panasonic has an updated model to this one, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  Especially if you have a really coarse, thick beard like I do.  You need a top-of-the-line shaver.  In fact, for reviews, check out [...] for the best advice when buying a shaver.  This guy knows his stuff.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best shaver I&#x27;ve used in all my years of shaving!  I&#x27;ve had several Norelco, Braun, and now Panasonic.  Compared to the Braun Series 7, this Panasonic shaver is much quieter, with lower vibration, but still gives a very close shave - about the same as my sharpest blade razor.  Construction feels a little flimsy, so I hope it lasts - it does have a 2 year warantee.</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Only downside is that the battery wears out before it should and cannot be separately replaced.</li>
    <li> great shaving experience!!! the most fast shaver i ever used!!! enjoyable and fast battery charge!!! it is more effective if reduce the price!</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m retired and living in the woods, shaving is less of a priority than before and because I like a very close shave, I&#x27;ve liked blades over electrics. Over the years I suppose I&#x27;ve tried every &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; electric razor and I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with the shave. But, shaving with a blade is a hassle: wash your face, hot wet towel, brush on the soap (you get a better shave with a brush than can), shave back and forth, up and down, rinse and dry. I guess I&#x27;m just lazy. I&#x27;ve used this sort of high-end panasonic for about a week and it is a lot easier than my go out to town shave and I like it for that. I actually shave every day now and don&#x27;t feel like a bum. Even though it&#x27;s nowhere near as close a shave as with a blade.</li>
    <li> Boss! -- Panasonic, in case you didn&#x27;t know is probably the LAST true &amp;#34;MADE IN JAPAN&amp;#34; company still selling to a now 3rd world welfare state America.  Back in the day buying Japanese goods was like buying gold.  Today, if you look closely most &#x27;Japanese companies&#x27; are &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; if you read the print on the back...  not Panasonic.. still geniune made in japan --note the optional &#x27;cleaner&#x27; is made in china, and of course summarily breaks in about 4 uses...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is boss.  It&#x27;s &#x27;expensive&#x27; only if you are used to Wall*Mart quality and prices.  If you have any respect for yourself you will find that this razor is priced exactly as what you&#x27;d expect for something that will ACTUALLY WORK AND LAST....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People in America expect everything to be $19.95 and last 100 years.  Then they act surprised when it breaks after 2 uses...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you get what you pay for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the thing shaves great, and LASTS... cheap pays thrice...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been electric since my teens and I&#x27;m 48 now. Always had a heavy beard. This shaver does it with ease, unlike the Braun Series5 I have been using. I can now shave in 4 minutes flat!! I&#x27;ve read the reviews from others and I see what they mean. What a huge difference this shaver makes. Just go ahead and get it and whoever is the recipient will be amazed!&lt;br /&gt;I manually clean mine after 2 shaves and use the cleaning system every couple weeks.</li>
    <li> He says it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever used.  Gives a really close shave quickly. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> If this shaver holds up for more than two years I will be pleased. I have bought Panasonic wet dry shaver 4 times in the past 12 years because the shave quality is great! My biggest problem is they don&#x27;t hold up. You must be willing to buy new screens, blades, cleaning pads etc. which can cost as much as a new shaver, so I end up just replacing it. BUT the shave quality is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few months now and I like it, it shaves well. I&#x27;m afraid I fell victim to a &#x27;shaver review&#x27; site that said it was awesome. Funny as I usually am the one suggesting stuff like that. All in all, I have a Norelco 3 blade rotary that&#x27;s maybe 15 years old. I replaced the head a few weeks ago. I can&#x27;t say the Panasonic is superior. It might be a little better at most (than the ancient Norelco). If I had it to do over again I would get another Norelco for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m sure a new Norelco would be a little better than the old one too.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor for about three weeks.  Worked fine on my face.  The problem with razor is that even when I had hair low on sides/rear of my head, razor could not get close enough.  Top of my head, shaved just fine. Top of my head was SMOOTH.  I couldn&#x27;t handle my dome being this uneven mess :(</li>
    <li> Very pleased with it.Provdes a close shave.</li>
    <li> Coming from a Phillips-Norelco with the Nivea lotion for years, I really enjoy using this shaver.  As a dry shave, it&#x27;s exceptionally smooth and never irritates my skin (whereas the Norelco would occasionally irritate).  It also leaves a shave almost, if not as close as a blade shave.  Cleaning this is also MUCH easier than any other electric I&#x27;ve used, even without the fancy system.  I use the base to clean it about every other week or so, just to keep things good, otherwise using some water and a little soap works every other day. One thing to note though, it is definitely louder than my Norelco.  Much louder.  HOWEVER, that being said, it still doesn&#x27;t wake up my roommate who&#x27;s room is right next to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;As for method of use, I do a little up/down, then a left/right.  I find that gets everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - Amazing shaver, I truly enjoy using this and refuse to go back to my old electric.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this shaver a lot, better than his previous Braun. The initial shaver&#x27;s cleaning system was not working after the first use, so I got it replaced by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. His review is this is the best razor he has ever used.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how but this razor is even closer than the Arc 4. Don&#x27;t know yet whether it&#x27;s faster but it got the trouble neck hairs in one pass.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it with shave soap.  The head is large but not unusably so. If you need to do some fine edge work just lock the head and use the outer foil at an angle. It&#x27;s better balanced than the arc 4 with a more premium feel. Certainly worth the upgrade if you can find it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have to say the arc 5 is astounding. After my skin break-in period I found my shaves to be as close as my DE razor but without the time or irritation. Don&#x27;t get me wrong this razor does produce a little bit of irritation at first. But to be that close I would think it would have to. Previously with my Arc 4 I will get a good smooth shave however around my lips and chin the skin would look slightly darker due to stubble under the skin. With the arc 5 the skin looks as clean as if I had used a razor and water it&#x27;s quite amazing! I even got carded for beer. Since I&#x27;m in my 40s I guess that&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint I have is the cleaning solution soap smells really odd. Sort of like that green slime you used to get in a plastic egg to play with as a kid. You can really smell it the first few shaves after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;With time the cleaner smell gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it a 5+ star product</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and transation</li>
    <li> My husband goes through shavers like crazy. His hair dulls blades fast and he&#x27;s never liked shavers much until now. This thing is awesome and he loves that it cleans itself in the tray. Easy to setup and use. Shaves faster than anything he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
    <li> Earlier this spring when my 6 year old Braun died I researched for a replacement and narrowed it down to the Braun Series 7 and the Panasonic Arc 5.  While my skin is not overly sensitive I do get some in grown hairs with some of the electric razors out there.  Over the last 20 years my experience with Braun has been positive when it comes to this which is why I chose to go with the Series 7 790 cc.  The series 7  has a changed foil design compared to my older Braun which resulted in lots of in growns for me.  I stayed with it for 5 weeks and still no improvement.  Therefore I bought the Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5.  After using the Arc 5 I can say that for me it delivers much better results.  No in growns and a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to Braun, Brauns overall build quality is better and I like the way the Braun fits in my hands better...however the ultimate reason for buying a shaver is the quality of the shave and this is where the ARC 5 beats the Braun 760 cc.  I shave in less time, the shave is closer, and I have no problems with in growns.  As far as 4 stars versus 5...the shave quality is a 5, however the plastic cheaper feel of the shaver does bring my rating down just a little.</li>
    <li> I get a close shave on a very tough beard</li>
    <li> This shaver may be nice to some people, I don&#x27;t beleive it is that nice for what you have to pay for it. I tried it for 30 days, and I didn&#x27;t see any different  form what I did have for 7 years, that was a Braun serise 5.</li>
    <li> I tried both, wet and dry shaving but couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave. Actually, my trimmer does a better job than this shaver. Also, the shaver injuried on my skin, and caused slight bleeding at couple of spots. I will stick to conventional razors, they offer a much closer and smoother shave.</li>
    <li> After using the Braun 790 as my home shaver for just over one year, I decided to purchase the Panasonic as my travel shaver, this replaces a Braun 3 series that I purchased about 18 months ago, that shaver was adequate, barely. Although I have only used the Panasonic a few times I can say that I love it,  the shave is simply amazingly close, the LV-81 is the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Spend the money on a high end shaver if you can as the difference is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;If I were to need a replacement for the Braun 790cc today (I do not) I would not hesitate to buy the Panasonic. I like it!</li>
    <li> This shaver works brilliantly. So much better than the Philips I had. Gets all those side way hairs that most shavers cant get.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a little over a month and the Automatic Cleaning and Charging station has been failing to drain properly leaving the razors head to sit in the dirty water till I go to use it again. Being that the Automatic Cleaning and Charging System  was a feature I looked forward to I am greatly disappointed in this product as a whole. I am going to be contacting Panasonic soon to see if they can help me trouble shoot my Automatic Cleaning and Charging station. Hopefully it is something simple or I was just unlucky and received a malfunctioning unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problems first started about 20 day after I started using the razor and at about 30 days (before red light went on) I changed the cleaning cartridge and water supply to see if it solve my problem. It worked for about 5 days and on the 06/07 the unit failed to drain (and the shaver ended up sitting in dirty water for two days...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of June 2014 Update -- After contacting Panasonic they had me ship the entire unit back to them (they did not pay for shipping to them and it cost me about $12 dollars to ship) and they had sent me back a brand new unit the whole process took about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07/10/2014 today the cleaning system had a little excess water left in the reservoir after the cleaning and dying cycles had completed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day later and allot of water was left in the reservoir after the cleaning cycles had completed. I am dropping this review down to one star as now I have had two cleaning stations (and an additional $10 spent on shipping it to me) and the second one is malfunctioning after a little over a week of use... I am going to call Panasonic again and see what they will do but if it involves me investing more money into this shaver I am never getting another Panasonic and counting the cleaning system as a loss.</li>
    <li> I read many on line reviews and this shaver did not disappoint. I have owned dozens of cheap to expensive electric shavers and this one as advertised is the fastest shave for me of all of them. The price tag is not for the faint of heart, but well worth it in performance. I used to skip shaving because I hated the old cheap razor, then was frustrated because with only one extra day growth, the cheap razor couldn&#x27;t get me clean shaven (back to the blade then). This easily handles 2-3 days without shaving with little extra effort. For an every day razor it gets the job done in a matter of a minute or less for me. The self cleaning feature is great considering it also dries the razor so I just push the button after shaving one morning and I am good to go for the next with a nice clean dry shaver.</li>
    <li> The shaver continues to provide an above average shave, especially wet. The cleaning system however worked for maybe one week and is now good only for charging purposes. I have tried inserting new vortex cleaning cartridges with no luck. As stated, the shave is exceptional, cleaning system stinks.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spray shavings all over the place, big PLUS. Compact so perfect for portable action, i didn&#x27;t care about the noise it makes just wanted a good shave, the Panasonic does the job fast. Only WTF, would have be the recharge; you can&#x27;t use the shaver when its charging- come on panasonic what&#x27;s that about? If you forget the charge it and it runs out of power you need to wait around before use, duh!</li>
    <li> Just received Panasonic ES-LV81-K and used for more than a week. This machine is fast and give me a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving, and I have sensitive skin which is a horribly unfortunate combination. For the past 10 years or so I&#x27;ve been using a routine of alternating every other day between a Norelco 3 head pivoting razor and using a manual razor, either a Gilette Fusion Proglide power and a Schick Hydro 5 sensitive series. I was tired of replacing expensive razor blades so often and my Norelco was almost 10 years old so it was definitely past its prime. I began looking for a new razor and was worried at first as I had used a rotary style unit my entire life but the Panasonic foil units got some really good reviews. After a lot of research and youtube videos I decided upon the Panasonic LV81 or LV61 - for all intents and purposes they are the same unit aside from one coming with a cleaning kit as well (this one). The cleaning kit adds almost $120 to the total price and I was hesitant at first but decided that if I was going to get the razor to last many years I should take care of it properly. As soon as I got it I charged it up and gave it a test run with a dry shave and I was amazed with how good of a job it did and how quickly it did. The next day I tried with the shaving gel which I used for my manual razor before and it felt even better (to be fair I never used gel with my Norelco unit before, I didn&#x27;t even know that was a thing that could be done so I can&#x27;t compare it in that aspect). I haven&#x27;t had any issues with my sensitive skin or any breakouts on my neck which were fairly common with my Norelco. I have actually completely stopped using my manual razor now which is great because the entire shaving process before took almost 10 minutes when using a manual razor. The pivoting head and built in trimmer is a nice added benefit as well. I would recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;-Fast, smooth, and comfortable shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Accommodates both wet and dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a cleaning system to help prolong the blade life.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be cleaned quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting head and built in trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;-COST&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life isn&#x27;t very impressive, I find myself charging it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very solid choice in a razor, and if you can swallow the large up front cost it should provide you many years of a great shaving experience!and easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting head and built in trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;-COST&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life isn&#x27;t very impressive, I find myself charging it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very solid choice in a razor, and if you can swallow the large up front cost it should provide you many years of a great shaving experience!</li>
    <li> Electric shavers still do not cut as close as a manual razor and are slower. However, the Panasonic Es-LV81 is better than other electric razors I have owned.  It is relatively quite with only a low buzz sound.  The head can be adjusted to a fixed or floating position.  The flip top razor is ideal for sideburns, but is no better than my other Panasonic and Remington razors. Under the chin/neck extra time is required to get a really close shave.  Shaving cream makes it easier to slid across the skin, but I get a clean shave either way.  Cleaning is easy.  Also, it came with a nice travel case. Pricey, but glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver ever.  I&#x27;ve been using them all my life and the comfort and efficiency of this tool is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not obnoxiously noisy, either.</li>
    <li> quick logistic , Good tasted, healthy infant food, package perfect.&lt;br /&gt;we are all in belief of in this famous international brand</li>
    <li> This is one of the better shavers in that you don&#x27;t ever have to worry about a hair being pulled, but it&#x27;s not as close as it should be. In addition, there is too much black edge at the top where there should be cutting blades. The whole top is bit too bulky making it hard to reach under the nose. It requires several passes to really get all the hair and even then, it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is too complicated. It requires two components, water in a little bucket and some sort of soap component, which must be prepared in an exact order. The lights look like they are mounted on a button, but they&#x27;re just lights. The actual button is below and lets you choose between clean and dry and just clean or dry. That makes no sense.</li>
    <li> I have been using my new razor for one month.  It is the closet shave from an electric I have ever had.  I have been using Braun for the past 8 years and remmington before that.  With the Braun I was not getting a close shave and also getting ingrown hairs.  This Panasonic is just as close as a blade shave, and I have a heavy beard.  I cannot imagine a better electric shaver and I am also shaving in half the time!</li>
    <li> Amazing gentle shaving, it&#x27;s wow. I&#x27;ve tried with all kinds of razors such as Straight razors, Safety Razors etc, and they all leave my face so painful and burns. But with this Great Product I can get very close shave as a sharp blade with no problems, even in my neck area, Highly recommended !!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, and he loves it! It was to replace a fairly high end razor/shaver that he&#x27;d had for years, so he is very pleased with the replacement and quality of this one.  The only thing is it is a bit loud when in the cleaning and drying modes.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun and Wahl shavers and this is the best one I have used as far as close shave. The Braun was only slightly less but the cost to maintain was considerably more (the cleaner). I would recommend this one for that reason mostly.</li>
    <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I have purchased and it did not disappoint. I enjoyed my first one for several years and I&#x27;m glad I upgraded to this one. It has cut about three minutes of time for each shave. I highly recommend Panasonic shavers.</li>
    <li> great shaver, powerful and efficienct</li>
    <li> I thought it would be good, tested it for 30 days and it started causing severe razor bumps.  now I cant even return it.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> I just purchased and tried use the self cleaning function and that was a waste!  It is Saturday and I cannot complain as they are closed now.  So I have to wait till Monday!  Also, pictured in the advertisement was a small bottle of oil which I could not find as well as the AC Adaptor Cord.  What can you do to resolve this?</li>
    <li> This is an expensive shaver, but you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric shavers for years. This Panasonic shaves much closer and faster. Very comfortable, close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my Panasonic ES8243 that I bought almost 4 years ago to the day, oddly enough.  The ES8243 was the best shaver I had owned up to that point, it served me very well...or so I thought.  I have to be honest and say that the $300+ price tag on the ES-LV81-L Arc 5 is a bit much to swallow, it likely makes it the most expensive item in my bathroom other than the vanity or the tub itself...and it has a much shorter life span than either.  That being said, so far it is a dramatic improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had trouble with shaving, I have a very coarse beard and using many of the other shavers out there is akin to using a grass trimmer to try and cut a bamboo forest down, assuming &amp;#34;its made to cut grass, after all&amp;#34;.  I always had to use the talc powder sticks when using the ES8243 to avoid my face reacting horribly, which was easier to do on a every-other-day or so basis than it ever was with the razors I tried beforehand.  The ES8243 always annoyed me with how much &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; it made, but I didn&#x27;t think there was that much difference between it and any other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I unboxed the ES-LV81 and immediately plugged it into the charger.  After it was at a full charge I gave it my first test...and to really test it, I skipped the powder pre-shave.  The shaver was quiet, I almost thought I was mis-remembering how loud the ES8243 was...so I took it back out of the drawer and turned it on, it rattled and vibrated.  I can only compare this to riding in a econobox car and then getting into a solid made luxury car, you really don&#x27;t realize the econobox is &amp;#34;that bad&amp;#34; until you make the direct comparison.  And like my luxury car that I often wonder how would I ever go back to a &amp;#34;lesser car&amp;#34; I fear I am hooked on a $300+ shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was great, this LV81 mowed through my beard like no razor ever has.  The ES8243 always had to gnaw on some areas of my beard...probably what led to theirritation from shaving, the LV81 just sailed through barely slowing along the way.  The real sign is how my face is the next day, while it showed some signs of irritation it was nothing compared to what I would have with the ES8243 if I had waited &amp;#34;too long&amp;#34; between shaves.  I shaved with the LV81 for the 2nd time today, also forgoing the stick of powder pre-shave (and the associated mess) and again the LV81 slid across my face with ease and gave me a better shave than I&#x27;ve had in a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a skeptic that something would actually make a $300+ shaver worth the expense.  I had considered the Braun 7 series over this, but after looking at them both and reading many reviews I decided to stick with the Panasonic...in part because it appears it is easier to clean without the &amp;#34;car wash&amp;#34; attachment...perhaps the Braun is the BMW of shavers and the LV81 Arc5 is the Audi, time will tell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the washing station, I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I really thought that there was a high likelihood that I would be returning this shaver for it &amp;#34;not being worth it&amp;#34; in regard to the price premium it fetches over others...but I think I am attached to it the shaver and will test the washing station out as well.  These are likely the first 2 shaves I have had that didn&#x27;t leave my face somewhat irritated since I started shaving, I just hope it keeps this up for a long while.</li>
    <li> The review is not about the product but about the delivery service because I received a used one covered with dirts and hairs. It came with the broken seal. The vortex cleaning system was depleted and filled with haris. By looking at it, anyone can notice that somebody already used it like 30 days or so and returned it. It gives me really unpleasant and gross experience. Amazon should check the quality of a product if it is a returned one before shipping it to another customer. I am very disappointed with this experience.</li>
    <li> I did not use an electric razor in the last 20 years. I researched all the models before I bought this one and I agree this is the best.. I can not find a single fault with this choice. It does a fantastic job. I really like it.. Donald Bear, CWO2, USN, Retired.</li>
    <li> This new Panasonic razor shaves much smoother and a bit closer than does the still current 3 blade plus trimmer razor(ES-LA 93). In additioin, the lights on the handle are not wastefully on all of the time. Finally, and I am not as of yet completely certain, but the cleaning system is a bit quieter than was past models and I believe the cleaning cartridges are lasting longer. Just because it looks similar to previous models, it is truly improved.  I also compare this to other brand shavers and find this to now be the very best available. The only razor I have used was the now discontinued Braun Eltron nearly 30 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver Panasonic has produced in my opinion.  It shaves very close very comfortably. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this to replace an old Panasonic electric, and have been amazed at how much better the new model is.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave rapidly.  The only disadvantage is that the on/off button gets easily turned off during shave.  Have adjusted to holding it differently.  A new advantage is that there is no area where sludge can build up.  This is my third Panasonic wet/dry shaver and it is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> Works very well and shaves close.  Razor head is very large compared to a Braun. Cleaning fluid has strong smell and takes a long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor - especially enjoy the cleaning system that came with it!</li>
    <li> It is so nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I use a electric shaver first time.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great. so great</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to my husband as a gift.  Before I got this shaver for him, he never shaved every day -- he said it was too much time to shave every day.  He tried almost all shavers available in US from Norelco, Braun, and probably almost all Panasonic models.  His favorite shaver was [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]] till he got this shaver.  Now his shaving time is under 2 minutes.  This shaver has a timer so you can see exactly how much time it would take to shave.  Clearly extra blade on this shaver shorten his shaving time from 3 minutes to 2 minutes.  It was very expensive gift but so far this is the best gift for him and I am so glad I got this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. The first that exceeded my expectations and replaced the razor.</li>
    <li> The product arrived a bit later than was indicated and the shaver screen was damaged.  I purchased a replacement screen and the prodcut worked well.  Bottom line good product - bad supplier.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my father. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Replaced both Braun/Norellco, best shaver available</li>
    <li> Perfect. As i expected</li>
    <li> I use electric shavers to shave my head once or twice a week. I don&#x27;t pay for haircuts, so I don&#x27;t mind ponying up the extra dollars to get a good shaver. So, in short, this is an exceptional shaver. I previously owned the Panasonic ES8103S - essentially a cousin to this shaver, but definitely on the &amp;#34;lower end&amp;#34; in terms of the shavers Panasonic produces. I think that shaver cost me one-third of what this one cost. However, after using that shaver for two and a half years and only replacing the foil once, I figured I was due for an upgrade and since I was satisfied with Panasonic&#x27;s performance, I went with the ES-LV81-K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LV81-K cut my shaving time in half. It is simply so much more efficient. It used to take me around ten minutes to completely shave my head (shaving once or twice a week), now it takes about four and a half minutes, and I don&#x27;t even try to go fast. Where you shave, hair is cut. It&#x27;s that simple. There were a couple areas I had to go over a couple times, but that is just a fact of reality and not a knock on this shaver. I can queue up a song on Spotify, start shaving my head, and be done with my weekly haircut right after the song finishes. It&#x27;s unbelievably efficient.</li>
    <li> the shaver is the best ....</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say I have really coarse hair and sensitive skin. I thought this would be the razor to end the search for the perfect shave. I was wrong. The blades dulled after the third use. Would not cut hairs that were lying down as advertised. I had to follow up with a disposable blade to clean up the leftovers. The charge held well, and the features and cleaning system were nice. But for the price at $300 this product should have performed more effectively. I probably would have kept it if it was around $50 - $70. I couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference from any other 3 blade circular shaver on the market. You&#x27;re better off buying something cheaper that will obtain the same results. I would not recommend this purchase unless the price drops down to at least $100.. Even then I don&#x27;t believe the razor is worth that, but with the cleaning system that would be the maximum I&#x27;d be will to spend on this product.</li>
    <li> Great product, works great in the shower.  The charger, cleaner is a bit noisy and can take a looooong time to do its job, so I decided to do so as as I was leaving my apt...</li>
    <li> Product exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style shaver from Panasonic for decades and this is the best yet.  I tried the top of the line Braun about 5 years ago and gave it to my 17 year old son. The shave wasn&#x27;t even close.  It&#x27;s pricey but worth it to me.  By the way, this purchase was for my son.</li>
    <li> Overall&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;Yes it works great and it may be worth the price for you depending....  For starters, I have a thick beard and a sensitive neck area to the point where many razors and shavers irritate my neck too much to use, and I use this shaver every day.  It does a great job, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Who is this really for???&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is for people who have a thick beard that want a close shave, (wet or dry).  It&#x27;s great with sensitive skin, but if you have a light beard, going one model down will save you money and you wont notice the difference, (I used the 4 blade for five years and loved it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;+ Great, clean, close shave (wet or drv this is about as close to a blade as I&#x27;ve been, and I&#x27;ve tried most shaver models.)&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy on your sensitive neck, though you must give it a month to get used to it&lt;br /&gt;+ Self cleaner charges and cleans with no thought or effort from you&lt;br /&gt;+ Extra blade cuts through thick beards faster, and a bit more cleanly, even after a few days of stubble growth&lt;br /&gt;+ Charging station is convenient and ensures you have a clean charged shaver every day, saving you time in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s expensive, but for me it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;-The extra blade wont be noticed on a medium or thin beard, go down a model for those&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Considerations&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;+ The shaver is very easy to clean as it is waterproof (liquid soap, turn it on, rinse it) without the charging station, which really is a positive unless you don&#x27;t want to pay for the station, (the cleaning station is not a must have, but i like it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;With a thick beard and a sensitive neck that has hair going in many directions, this is by far my favorite shaver.  i do enjoy the convenience of the cleaner though I didn&#x27;t have one with the last model and it was fine.  Also if you have a lighter beard or even a medium beard you&#x27;ll likely not notice a big difference with the 4 blade model, (but a thick beard will enjoy the difference).a medium beard you&#x27;ll likely not notice a big difference with the 4 blade model, (but a thick beard will enjoy the difference).</li>
    <li> very awesome !! I really love it</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant to spend this much on shaver. I have a Braun 7000 and norelco 3D. 2 of the heads of the 3D stopped spinning less than a year. The Braun worked OK fine on face, but nasty neck hair, it could not get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 shaver is the best shaver I have ever used. 2 minutes and it shaves your face and neck areas and its butter smooth. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I was getting tired of using my straight razor and was looking for a quicker solution. After reading all the great reviews I figured if any electric razor could be as good, this would be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I will say that when it does cut the hair it does a great job and gives you a VERY close shave.  However, for my face at least, it misses way to many hairs.  I would have to do in excess of 10 passes and in almost all cases it would miss several hairs.  Once it got down to the last 20 hairs or so there was just no way to get the razor to cut them ultimately forcing me to whip out my straight razor to clean up the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really a shame because if it was better at getting all the hairs it would get a 5 star easily.  Close, easy, and fast shave that cleans easily.  Maybe I just have difficult facial hairs because others seem to love this item but it just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great electric shaver!  It is a investment but it is for those who want the best and serious about shaving with a quality electric shaver that has very good for either wet or dry shave.  I like a wet shave and Panasonic does the job!  I also travel over 200 days a year and the ES-LV81 holds up!  Please note: Give your face 3 weeks to get use to the shaver. Even if you use another electric shaver.  The Multi-Flex cleaning and drying system is very good but do not need it for travel.  Very easy to clean without the multi-flex system.</li>
    <li> I have an older panasonic electric shaver and after much debate and certainly waiting i bought this one and i have to say this one is definitly better than the older one, i havent tried the cleaning function as yet, but will update my feedback once i have tried that feature</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.  Gone through Norelcos and Brauns, this one is great.  Close shave, no skin irritation, and you could store it in a bucket of water between uses and I don&#x27;t think it would function any differently.  I could take or leave the cleaning system, but it&#x27;s a nice little gadget that does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I preface this by saying that I have yet to find an electric shaver that can do the job that a Gillette \\&quot;Fusion\\&quot; razor can.  That said, this Panasonic is darned good, and is head-and-shoulders above the capability of electrics that I have owned in the past.  I use the Panasonic because my face can&#x27;t take the trauma of constant Gillette shaving.  The Panasonic seems to work better for me shaving dry because it is easier to stretch facial skin when the skin is dry, so that the Panasonic shaving head gets its best shot at the beard hairs.  But sometimes I use it in the shower and it&#x27;s still pretty good.  It beats the Braun, which I thought was pretty good until I bought the Panasonic.  I have also owned Norelco electrics and was dissatisfied with them (promising myself to never buy another one of those ever again). Bottom Line:  This Panasonic is closer to a blade shave than any other electric shaver that I have owned.  Since the goal of any type of shaver (blade or electric) is \\&quot;the perfect shave\\&quot;, I can&#x27;t give this Panasonic 5 stars based on the absolute result.  If you must always have a perfect shave, stick with Gillette.  But if you can accept the minor limitations inherent with a fine electric shaver like this Panasonic, most can buy this unit with confidence that they will get a 4 star shave.  I would buy this product again if it was stolen or lost.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my bf for his bday and he LOVES it. He can shave it everyday wet or dry without getting his skin irritated. Could be a little pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Used to love my Norelco 1280X shaver until Philips changed to the V-Track replacement head. The new head turned a great shaver into junk. Replaced the Norelco with the ES-LV81-K which is now the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, a good price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The very best electric razor I have ever used in decades of shaving.  Close to blade quality.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> there is A LOT of varying reviews, mostly all positive, so you don&#x27;t need me, I will say, its just overpriced, it is.&lt;br /&gt;  Now, there are some things,most I try to buy the best of, I might not be able to have a nine million dollar home or 1/4 million dollar car, so, there are some things the wealthy can have access to we can&#x27;t, but when it comes to other things, Like my polaris rzr, Walther PPQ handgun, or this razor, that no matter how wealthy you are, your not going to get a better four wheel side by side, polymer pistol, or in this case, shave......,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 5 Panasonic electric shavers and tend to replace them every 3-4 years as they wear out.  Panasonic has continued to improve their shavers with each generation and this one is no exception.  It replaced an ES-LA-93 model and after a month of use seems to shave closer and about 20% faster.  Definitely worth the upgrade when you need it, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In researching this purchase, I noticed that several people had asked in the Q&amp;A&#x27;s whether the cleaning systems are compatible with the earlier models like the LA-93.  They are NOT.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic electric shavers for years.  I have sensitive skin and their products give a close shave without tearing up your skin.  This model is pretty amazing and has a cleaning system, beyond simple rinsing.  Charging LED will let you know when you need to recharge and how much juice is left.  The swivel head really lends to good ergonomic function.</li>
    <li> Had this for a few days - FANTASTIC shaver.  This was a step up from an aging 3 blade Panasonic, so I was already comfortable with the style, but I have to say: amazingly close and comfortable shave, with all of the conveniences.  I saw some comments suggesting the head was too large - I have no issues whatsoever there, and no trouble hitting all of the detail spots (under the nose, under the lower lip, etc.). Moreover, if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I can shave (pun intended) valuable seconds off my normal morning prep; but honestly, this makes shaving such a pleasure I&#x27;m inclined to take a few extra moments to get as close as possible.</li>
    <li> The only one providing a close as a rasor shave. Quite expensive.</li>
    <li> I have it for about a month now and I can&#x27;t say that I am 100% satisfied at this point. The company says give it a month or so and it will do better job. Really hope so. But for now it is not shaving clean enough.</li>
    <li> I like the product&lt;br /&gt;performs very well I never used dry shavers before this one cause it would irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this one and no iritation and close shave like no other.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll like it .</li>
    <li> I previously had an ES-LF, which I liked a lot but which died after my second trip to where the electricity is 220V.  This model is noticeably better.  It shaves cleaner with less pressure and fewer passes, and never irritates my skin.  It&#x27;s light, and the trimmer popup operates smoothly and without much effort.  It works equally well wet and dry.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever shaved with.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Gillette proglide for a long time.. in the past I bought a Braun 8000 series and it just couldn&#x27;t compare to the shave of the Gillette.. so recently I decided to purchase the Panasonic Arc5. It does give a nice close shave on the parts of my face that it shaves well.. after numerous tries on my neck and jaw area I still have hair that I have to get with a tweezer or go over with a razor. When I give myself a wet shave it is the most painful experience I ever had.. the first time I gave myself a wet shave with shaving cream my neck became so red it was like my neck was on fire! The razor burn lasted two days, I tried a second time wet with shaving cream and the shave is very close but just too much razor burn and still no luck with the hairs on my neck and jaw line. Overall build quality is excellent it fits well in the hand and is very comfortable... the cleaning station does it&#x27;s job but doesn&#x27;t feel like it belongs with a $300.00 razor. So sending this back and I am going to see how the new Norelco 9700 will be.. maybe a rotary razor will be better for my face type.</li>
    <li> this shaver is a BIG disappointment, it is awkward to handle,noisy, and cuts ok. WAY overpriced always thought Panasonic meant quality but they missed it this time</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace a 6 year old 3 blade Panasonic shaver that no longer worked. While this one does an adequate job of removing facial hair; it was no better than the one it replaced. In addition; the exorbitant cost is a decidedly negative factor. The cleaning system is poorly designed and is exactly the same as the one that came with my former Panasonic shaver. This cleaning system has a known engineering defect, yet Panasonic continues to manufacture it. After a period of time; the cleaning system will develop a leak, and you&#x27;ll be forced to replace it. I ended up replacing the cleaning system 3 times on my old shaver, than finally gave up when the third one developed a leak. There&#x27;s a tiny hole in the bottom of the cleaning system that can be cleaned with a toothpick. Unfortunately; doing so doesn&#x27;t resolve the leakage problem. The fact that Panasonic knows that the cleaning system fails prematurely, yet they&#x27;ve never redesigned it, shows how little they care about the customer. Had I known that this shaver used the same cleaning system as my 6 year old shaver; I never would have purchased it. The bottom line is to save your money and purchase a different shaver. I ended up returning mine to Amazon and purchased the very reliable Braun 790-CC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:11/07/13 The \\&quot;reliable\\&quot; Braun 790-CC lasted all of 7 weeks before I started having problems. First, the cleaning system malfunctioned, than the locking mechanism on the shaver itself stopped working.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is a die hard Braun user.  He was really \\&quot;against\\&quot; trying this razor, because he was so anti-anything-NOT-Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, he gave it a shot for me.  The first time he used it, he complained that the head was too big, and was uncomfortable to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He kept at it, though.  The manual says to give it 2 full weeks, to give your skin a chance to get used to the new shaving method.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after the third day, he said that it was growing on him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, he hesitatingly said he thought it was as good as his Braun...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he says that it&#x27;s a good shaver.  Maybe some aspects even BETTER than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cycles are longer, and it has a dryer.  Pretty cool, although it&#x27;s noise might bug you if you shave just before bed and you keep the razor near your bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my legs, and am surprised at how it handles the fine blonde hair.  I have never had much luck using men&#x27;s razors on my legs, because of the fine-nature of the hair.  Typical razors miss more than they cut.  This razor, however, took care of the hair--even on my knees, which I usually just skip because it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, coming from the reluctant perspective of my 55 year old boyfriend, he begrudgingly concedes that this is not only as good as his ever-loved Braun series 7, it&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that it handles his rough 5 o&#x27;clock shadow as well as it handles my fine blonde hair on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cleaning cycle.  The Braun has a cleaning cycle, but it is much shorter, and doesn&#x27;t have a drying cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the head is larger, and takes some getting used to.  But it&#x27;s only \\&quot;different\\&quot;, not better or worse than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are easy to use, and the digital display is really nice.  Looks pretty cool, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking at getting a high-end shaver, this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of Braun, Panasonic, and Norelco shavers over the years, and definitely prefer the foil shavers (Braun, Panasonic) over the rotary shavers (Norelco). My current shaver is a 2-year-old Braun Flex Integral shaver with a cleaning system/base charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try out the new Panasonic ARC5 shaver based on positive previous experience with Panasonic&#x27;s shavers. Panasonic&#x27;s main claim to fame is its wet/dry technology, which allows you to get the shaver wet, e.g. if you like to shave in the shower. This model is no exception, and it also has a nice feature to allow you to clean the shaver under running water if you don&#x27;t want to use the included cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was pleased with the shaving performance, which gave a shave comparable to the Braun. There isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in the speed or closeness of the shave, but this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, since the Braun is a top performer. The beard trimmer is serviceable but not exceptional - you&#x27;re not going to be able to do a lot of fine beard sculpting with it. The shaver comes with a nice travel case, combination charger/cleaning system, and AC cord for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the other reviewers, my main gripe is the price. I gulped when I saw the price of this system, and it is hard to justify spending roughly 2-3x the cost of a Braun shaver when the performance is not very different. Also, the 5 blades do make the head very large, which doesn&#x27;t allow you to see where you&#x27;re shaving very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, smooth shaving performance&lt;br /&gt;- LCD screen is large and clear to read&lt;br /&gt;- Option to clean either under running water or using the cleaning system (you add water to the included detergent cartridge)&lt;br /&gt;- Quieter than other shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Price!&lt;br /&gt;- Large shaving head&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver is quite bulky and less ergonomic than the Brauns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if the Panasonic were priced more reasonably, it would be a great everyday system, especially since you can get it wet without worries.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to receive this product through the Amazon Vine program. While it works much better than the rotary shavers I&#x27;ve used the last several years, there is no way in the world I could justify the high price. Who has that much money to blow on a razor? I haven&#x27;t really figured out the point for the cleaning system and how it works differently that running the blades under running water. So, while I think this Panasonic delivers a great shave, it is way too expensive to recommend.</li>
    <li> difficult to return, the shaver was irritating my skin, I contacted the Amazon merchant and they said they do not accept returns for shaver  , in the future I will order  some where else</li>
    <li> I know that there are tons of reviews comparing this guy to the Braun so I wont beat a dead horse for to long but considering the Braun has 2 blades and this dude has 5 very similar blades to the Braun, you do the math. The trimmers on both brands are awesome but the Braun gets the edge here because it is a slightly longer and more convenient extension. This shaver was also the featured item in a recent hammacher schlemmer mag which also says something. This was recently my 25th birthday present from my parents and it makes me look 17 again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver a little more than 6 months and I have mixed feelings about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, forget about shaving dry with it.  It&#x27;s just abysmal.  If you&#x27;re going to use it out of the shower then it&#x27;s almost a necessity to use this:  [[ASIN:B0013NB7DW Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave with Soothing Green Tea Complex -- 7 oz.]].  Using &#x27;Lectric shave, this shaver does remarkably better.  It glides well and shaves closely and gives results as good as my 7 year old Braun ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this model really shines is wet shaving in the shower with shave gel.  Now we&#x27;re talking an excellent shave!  It&#x27;s a close shave and leaves my skin very smooth.  The comically large shaving head does make it difficult to get certain areas around the jawline and neck though.  Even after 6 months I still have a hard time getting everything without irritating my skin sometimes.  For best results I highly recommend [[ASIN:B002UUT44Q Nivea for Men Q10 Energy Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]].  It works better than the Edge gel I started with, it smells great, and you use an impossibly small amount so it should last a long time.  Follow it up with the matching face balm and I&#x27;ve never been happier with a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself looks nice and seems well-designed, but the materials feel cheap.  Which brings me to the aforementioned conclusion: it&#x27;s grossly overpriced.  $300 for a shaver that you have to use in the shower if you want excellent results?  Shaving dry with &#x27;Lectric shave gives very good results, but you could get the identical shave quality for so much less money with the Braun 790cc.  (I&#x27;m inferring about the 790cc, I have an older version of the same model (8595).  Based on the reviews, the new version is just as good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way that this shaver was ever worth the original $600 it was selling for and I feel sorry for the people who spent that much expecting something in a whole new league of shaving perfection.  It&#x27;s still a very good product, but if you buy it just go into it knowing that you&#x27;ll be paying a LOT of extra money solely for the convenience of shaving in the shower.  You&#x27;ll have to decide if it&#x27;s worth that much to you.</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> Great razor but not sure if it worth the price. The thing is extremely loud when cleaning. Don&#x27;t do it before going to bed. Takes about 10 mins and sounds like it&#x27;s going to blowup.</li>
    <li> This is really great, been using it over 4 months now</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband on Fathers Day. He says it works no better than his $50 Norelco shaver. He used it exclusively for 30 days as suggested, and still is not impressed. :-(</li>
    <li> nice smooth cut (not under the chin at start) with no irritation. It needs at least 3 weeks for the skin to learn the change from razor to electric cut. I love the dry shave now. ( You need to apply more of shave cream of curse - balsam). Awesome product. Defiantly buy it worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The best razor i have ever owned. Close smooth shave every time, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This model no longer has the police car flashing blue light after it is fully charged.  This is really a + and should also be applied to other Panasonic razors.  Gives a close shave and is easy to clean.  The replacement blades and cutter foil is rather expensive to replace and this may give some people a second thought before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had many Panasonic in the past and in my opinion this is one of the best so far.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband as a birthday present and he LOVES it! It takes him seconds to shave now.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Oh, holy hell. I love this thing.  Let me start by saying that I love electric razors AND Double Edge (Safety) Razors.  Nothing beats a DE blade when you use real shaving soap and a brush to get a close shave. On the weekends when I can sleep in that&#x27;s my thing. I&#x27;m not a morning person. Every last second in bed is like heaven to me, therefore during the week I love the ease of an electric razor. I bought this to replace a Braun 3 series foil razor and it shaves closer than the Braun with fewer passes. I&#x27;ll call this a win!</li>
    <li> The battery is long lasting and ths shave is pretty close.  It is comfortable to hold in your hand.  The cleaning system is unique and overall is probably the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is OK at best.  The cleaning/charging base simply does not work.  It regularly clogs up, causing the cleaning solution to spill over.  The drying fan at times does not shut off causing the razor not to charge.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this item is not worth the box it is packed in.</li>
    <li> It was well worth the price!! Took my face about 2 weeks to adjust from a manual razor, but this gives me a close shave!! I use it in the shower as a wet shaver instead of a dry shaver with no problems!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased an ES LV81k strictly for resale as I found an outlet for shavers that had been customer returned/open boxed.  I got this one back after a not so nice customer switched parts.  I kept the shaver and purchased a new part in place of the switched part.  I cannot believe the shave I got from this shaver.  Just spent $179 on a new norelco last Christmas and put it for sale on ebay.  This is the closest shave (dry) without using a razor (which I tend to break out from)  I have been using Norelco&#x27;s since I was 18, I&#x27;m now going on 63.  I have tried other foil razors in the past and they either irritated my skin or didn&#x27;t give me a close shave like (I thought) my norelco gave.  I wish I had tried one of these years ago or before purchasing the last shaver.  This replaced a Norelco 1280x a 3D shaver. It was Norelco&#x27;s top of the line without the shaver cleaner tank.  I always use top of the line, but I tried a 3 blade from Panasonic and liked it too.  This one is superb. The feature of using it wet/dry appealed to me but was not a necessity.  This can be taken into the shower as it is cordless and WATER PROOF.  If you don&#x27;t like the price, go for the ES-LV61-K Same shaver but without the cleaning/charging tank.  You really don&#x27;t need it anyway.  Although this buzzes a little louder than a rotary shaver, the sound lets you know when you&#x27;re smooth.  Sort of a built in stubble detector!  The charge lasts a long time and it doesn&#x27;t lose power because it uses lithium technology.  It appears as if any of the Arc shavers Panasonic makes are great.  They all give a very close shave, it&#x27;s just the head size and number of blades inside.  Tried 3/4/5.  The Arc 4, 4blade I was not impressed with.  The three and 5 actually seemed to shave closer.  Try one, you&#x27;ll never go back to your old razor.  If someone told me I would have liked this better than the Norelco I would have said \\&quot;no way\\&quot;.  The guy that thought he pulled a fast one on me actually did me a favor which I&#x27;mgrateful for.</li>
    <li> I consider this shaver expensive, but if you&#x27;re looking for fast shave in the morning with long lasting charge. (This Panasonic 5 blade is the right machine for you)</li>
    <li> Stopped using electric shavers years ago due to skin irritation, and less than perfect shave. Decided to give it another try with the Panasonic ES-LV81-K.....wow was I pleasantly surprised. No irritation and a great, close shave. Product is pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good razor a bit tough to get all the neck whiskers</li>
    <li> Clean my face very niceli and fast with or without water and is very good for traveling and the battery last long.</li>
    <li> I love my new Panasonic ES-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry  Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver. I have never had a shave so close,clean and smooth. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> I spent a great deal of time reviewing other shavers and picked this one.  It really does give a great shave, but after 2 years the battery is beginning to fade.  At first I was able to shave for about a week on one charge, now after 2 years, I can barely get 3.  WAY to expensive a shaver to have to replace every 2-3 years, if I can get that much more out of it!!</li>
    <li> Info: Early 30&#x27;s with light/sensitive skin and thick dark beard. Have been using Gillette Mach 5 Hydro (or similar) for the last 15 years. I found after experimenting with electric razors years ago that no matter how many I tried, they all left scattered hairs along my neck line and Adams apple area (I will call these my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas). Older electrics would get hot after endless passes and eventually burn/make me bleed. After forgetting my Mach 5s recently while on vacation, I tried a friends $60 Braun electric. I was so surprised at how well it worked on my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas I thought wow, how things have changed! If a $60 electric razor can impress me, the top of the line model Panasonic must be the holy grail. Seeing the glowing reviews of the Panasonic ES-LV81 it made me want to give electrics another try. I&#x27;m going to keep the positives/negatives/overall specific to my experience and be as objective as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I got a very close shave on my face. The razor is lightweight, easy to hold and keeps a great charge. The charging station with cleaning option is a neat idea. After about 5 minutes of continuous use the metal does get a little warm, but not uncomfortably so like older electrics. I got a very close shave under my nose, no tugging or pulling around the mouth.  No irritation/burning/bleeding even after 10 minutes with various degrees of manual pressure and passes over the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; neck areas. The \\&quot;lock\\&quot; option for the head is great. I fancy the wet/dry option though I usually use it dry. Had I compared the \\&quot;closeness\\&quot; of the Panasonic to a straight razor JUST on my face I&#x27;d honestly say I could not tell the difference. Perhaps by mid-day I could start to feel some stubble after using the electric, but that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The Panasonic still left scattered hairs (these aren&#x27;t ingrown or too long for an electric) along my lower neck and Adam&#x27;s apple. Even after 10 minutes I could still feel and see stubble/scattered hairs on my neck, which were long enough to easily pull with a tweezer. For comparison I asked my buddy if I could barrow his Braun for a day just to compare, and I was surprised at how the Braun picked up the remaining hairs that the Panasonic left behind. I thought perhaps maybe it was a fluke day, but after several weeks the results were the same. Also, I&#x27;m taking another star off for the \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; cycle...which is so loud, I put the whole thing in another bathroom to clean. Even after 1 (Yes ONE) shave and 2 (YES TWO!) wash/dry cycles there were still clumps of dry stubble in the metal blade and underneath the head when I looked. Manual washing is definitely preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impression: Maybe it&#x27;s just me but this $250 Panasonic razor simply didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the $60 Braun in my \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas. I thought perhaps maybe it was a fluke, but after several weeks I decided it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped (especially for the price!) I will definitely be giving this to my buddy for XMAS and stealing his $60 Braun! My advice for those with thick hair/sensitive skin would be to try a less expensive model first, before making a big purchase. Hope this is helpful.long enough to easily pull with a tweezer.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had about every electric shaver you can name.  This one is the best yet.  Cleaning system works well, it tells you when to replace the blades and foil, can be used wet, dry or with shaving creams/gels (which gives an amazingly good shave) and the charge lasts for long periods even with lengthy shaves.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing i love it ;-)</li>
    <li> The shaver works good, but the cleaning unit broke after one week of use. Panasonic customer service is terrible, I sent several emails and they responded something totally different than what I was asking them about.</li>
    <li> Changed from a Braun that worked well, but died.  I had Panasonics before and glad I returned.  Large head, close shave, quieter than the Braun.  The cleaning system is nice, too.  I have a very tough beard, and this does a great job.  I do &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; with a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; blade (mostly my neck), but I&#x27;ve had to with every electric I&#x27;ve owned (again, tough beard -- my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow must be in a different time zone, because it&#x27;s always early!).</li>
    <li> Ok, let&#x27;s get one thing straight: this shaver is not worth an MSRP of 600 bucks.  Unless it literally shaved for me - even if it shaved for me - it wouldn&#x27;t be worth that kind of dough.  But on Gold Box deal of the day?  Well, it was still expensive.  That&#x27;s the only reason I took off a star; it&#x27;s a relatively expensive item vs. the competition.  That said, in every other aspect, I love this shaver.  Pros:  - A base that works!: I was hesitant to get the base, but since it was part of the gold box deal, I bit.  in the past, I&#x27;ve used the Braun bases, which make you buy a solution that evaporates quickly.  You didn&#x27;t have a choice but to replace it on a regular basis.  The Panasonic base has a concentrated solution that mixes with water you put into a reservoir in the base.  I believe it only mixes when you set it to clean.  This is obviously a big savings if you don&#x27;t feel the need to use the cleaning function on a daily basis.  And since this is a wet/dry shaver, you can wash it on a daily basis, and save cleanings for special occasions.  It also allows you to just dry the blades and head, so it seems they anticipated this.  - A close shave: Dry, it performs marginally better than my old Braun.  It took some getting used to - the 5 blades make you feel like you&#x27;re shaving with the side of a brick, and it feels difficult sometimes to get to the smaller parts of your face, like your upper lip.  However, it is much more efficient than my old electric.  Wet, however, this thing is amazing.  I took it into the shower, no cream or anything, and got the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  And no burn.  - Easy to clean: just pop off the screen, rinse the blades using the sonic vibrating mode, rinse the screens, pop it back on, stick it in the base to dry.  You can use soap on both, or use the base cleaning.  Very quick and easy.  - Lock: This is handy if you pack your shaver.  It locks it&#x27;s ability to turn on.  - Charges quick: didn&#x27;t think this would be that big of a deal,but it&#x27;s actually pretty handy if you travel.  Cons:  - Cost: Wow, this is expensive.  It&#x27;s expensive on sale.  - Travel pouch: It is leather-like (but not really leather), so I guess one could claim it is premium in some sense, but I prefer the hard case of my previous shaver.  If I&#x27;m dropping 300 bucks on a shaver, I don&#x27;t want it to get inadvertently crushed in my bag.  - Ergonomics: they aren&#x27;t horrible, but they certainly aren&#x27;t the best.  It&#x27;s a very head heavy shaver, so when you&#x27;ve rinsed it, shaking off excess water makes you feel like the head is going to come off.  I have no reason to expect that it will - it is well made - but just the weight distribution gives you this sense.  The floating head actually makes it difficult to shave sometimes, though there is a position lock, so if that bugs you, you can always lock it in place.  - Trimmer: I guess this is partly attributed to the ergonomics, but the trimmer is underwhelming.  It&#x27;s slightly difficult to use, even if it cuts fine.  All in all, it&#x27;s a great shaver, albeit at a very high price.  My gripes are a bit nit-picky; none of those are make or break problems, just annoyances.  If you&#x27;ve got money to burn, and really need a shaver, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a better one.</li>
    <li> For the sake of comparison, this was the last step in my quest for the perfect replacement to my Braun 8500 series razor. I&#x27;ve tried a month with the [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic]] as well as the step-down [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering the Braun, you may want to read my ES-LA93-K review that points out the differences between the two. And if you&#x27;re not, either way, the biggest difference between this razor and the ES-LA-93K (besides the absolutely massive head) is another blade row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really struck me between this and the 93K, is that the 2-row cutter block is apparently the same. I would have expected an extra row, considering the big price jump between the two models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shave quality, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between this and the 93K at all. If you have a beard, precision is hopeless with this model (even after a month, and another month of the also-big 93K before that). But actual closeness is pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base? Well, this one&#x27;s silver. Otherwise, that&#x27;s the same, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the only other appreciable difference is purely cosmetic. The LCD on the 81K has a bit more information and doesn&#x27;t turn in to a blue strobe light, unlike the 93K. Otherwise, they&#x27;re just so similar, I don&#x27;t think the price difference is justifiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you&#x27;re just knocking down your facial hair entirely, the 93K is a much better value that gives you basically the same quality shave.</li>
    <li> From other reviews, this would tempt we away from my usual wet razor shave, but I&#x27;ll wait until the price is back down to $220 when it was on offer with rebates in Jan 2012.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.&lt;br /&gt;My old Braun was getting tired figured I would try out this since it was rated high. Very different shave than Braun and so far I am pleased. Seems to shave closer but only comparing to old Braun 6+ years old</li>
    <li> This shaver does it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, every new shaver shaves great, but this one not only is lighter than any other I had, but runs smoother over my skin.</li>
    <li> good shaver close but if u have mong hair it wont do it im talkin like a little over 1/4 inch the norelco top end with the cleaner i have two and it gets every length great for if ur hairs to long and dont have time to trim before u shave with this the norelco will easily get the all but this one get maybe a tiny bit closer for close close shaves but im ocd</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about electric razors but read some good reviews on this one.. I&#x27;ve tried different ones in the past and returned them.  This one was definitely the best of the bunch.  . unfortunately, they all see to be the same.. Nothing beats a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, an electric razor is not for everyone.. different skin textures and hairs don&#x27;t make it suitable for all..&lt;br /&gt;I was never able to successfully get a clean shave.. I had to constantly go over and over and over and still hairs remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;ve never had success with electric razors, this will not be any different.. Save yourself some trouble, but if you have never tried one, this is definitely the best one so far I have tried and I have tried all the top of the line from Norelco and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps..</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he says it is the best electric shaver he has ever owned... a little pricey but well worth it</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  This is my third Panasonic electric razor and every time I get a new one (they last about 3-4 years) they are at least 100% better than the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is no exception.  It&#x27;s much more quiet... it&#x27;s far less messy.  My now retired 2 blade Panasonic was noisy and left hair all over the place.  This thing is so quiet, all you hear is a hum, and the subtle sound of your hair being cut so you know your head is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes... I said head.  Back in 2000, I discovered that for shaving your head, going electric was far cheaper than going with shaving cream and a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing will handle all your head bumps, scars and fat rolls you might have on your head and your head will be baby butt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had anything bad to say about the razor, it would be that the self-cleaning unit sounds like a choo-choo train, but it gets it really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another gripe (and it doesn&#x27;t apply to me, but it was mentioned), is that the head is so big, folks that want to shave under their nose might find that getting all the &amp;#34;nooks-n-cranneys&amp;#34; is difficult if the space under your nose is small or you have a big nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in All... very minor complaints... still gets 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Panasonic LV81 to replace my Braun series 7. I have a used a top of the line Braun for years and it has often left me disappointed with many hairs still laying around in the neck area. I&#x27;d often have to use the pop-out trimmer to go over the areas after I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Braun seems to be better built the Panasonic gives a much better shave! The Panasonic&#x27;s shave is much smoother and closer. I only need to use the pop-up trimmer for few errant hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave dry so I can&#x27;t really comment on how the shaver works wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station is nice to have, as you just press the button every other shave or so and the station takes care of everything for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, the best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric shavers in my time, but this is the ultimate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Braun series 7 shaver with cleaning station, and it is really a piece of junk.  The part that locks the pivoting head in place is made out of plastic and it broke.  In addition, I had to keep going over and over the same places on my beard to get the Braun to get all the hair.  Even after that, the shave wasn&#x27;t really that close.  You could feel the coarseness of my beard left on my face after completing the Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a Philips Triple head shaver with cleaning station.  That unit does an amazing job even after days of not shaving.  It&#x27;s sort of like a mulching mower.  It does a great quick job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing though, can match the shave I get from this Panasonic shaver.  With its 5 blades it glides effortlessly over my beard and does a magnificent job.  When I run my hand over my face after shaving, I feel NOTHING!  It is absolutely that smooth.  That&#x27;s really saying something, because I have a really heavy beard.  This Panasonic works just as well for me even after not shaving for 5 or 6 days.  Most foil shavers would have a very difficult time after that much beard growth, but not this unit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at how close and smooth of a shave I really get.  This is by far the best shaver I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this razor.  The five blades do an exceptionally good job in two and a half minutes.  The razor glides over my face leaving it smooth and soft.  The turbo clean setting makes it simple to clean and I don&#x27;t feel it is necessary to invest in the cleaning system although I did.  Before purchasing, I watched the reviews on UTube and found them very helpful in making my decision.  I don&#x27;t plan on using the wet shave but it is nice to know that this is available.&lt;br /&gt;Bill</li>
    <li> I never used an electric razor that worked, although this was quite expensive it works great. At times it seems to work better than a regular razor. Under the nose is still a problem area, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
    <li> Panasonics are my favorite electric razors. My facial hair is rough and I have sensitive skin - a combination that means even a mach 3 blade lasts no longer than 2 or 3 shaves before it begins to rip my face. I bought my first Panasonic linear out of a Hammacher catalog 20 years ago and used it for years... until it was lost in some luggage. Then I used mach 3s for years. The m3 gives a much closer shave than any electric, but the continuing cost of blades is prohibitive. None of the 4 or 5 blade systems were any cheaper, longer lasting, or provided a better shave either. I then went to a norelco titanium rotary, which gave a good shave but couldn&#x27;t get all the nooks and crannies, and was useless if I went a day or two without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two years ago I picked up a Panasonic 8103 in a clearance sale and loved it. No fancy cleaning system, just rinsed it under water once a week or so. The great thing about the Panasonic linear 3 blade system is that you can get to all those places you can&#x27;t with a rotary system - between the ears and eyebrows, the corner of the jaw, etc. And you can SEE where the blades are in the mirror. If you don&#x27;t need the closest shave ever, it&#x27;s perfectly comfortable to shave dry. The 8103 served me well for almost 2 years before the dog destroyed it. I never even changed the blades or foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving experience with this 5 blade system was no better than with the 3 blade. In fact, the bigger head made things more difficult, just like a rotary head, and did not result in a better or closer shave than I got from the 3 blade linear. In the end I returned this and picked up a panasonic es-lt71-s off Amazon for less than I paid for the 8103 on clearance. It&#x27;s almost identical to the 8103 except it has a cleaning base and a \\&quot;travel lock.\\&quot; Wonderful!</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used, including previous Panasonic, Braun, Norelco and Remington models. Excellent when shaving &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and very good when shaving &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Wish I had purchased ths years ago.  Really great for sensitive skin. Highly recommended. Shaves as close as a blade. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this most expensive shaver around would be perfect ! It is good, has an incredibly strong motor - removes huge amounts of day old stubble fast, but it does not provide a baby smooth shave which is what I get from my $20 CVS electric shaver. Unfortunately the $20 shaver has a weak motor - so I use the Panasonic to remove 90% of my stubble, fast, then use the $20 shaver to finish off with a smooth face. It does work a bit better when wet. The instruction ask to use it for 30 days before making an opinion, as it takes that long top get used to it. I have now used it that long - still good, but not perfect, which it should be for the huge cost !</li>
    <li> Just so happened I had a nice Christmas check and could afford a super luxury and this razor is that.</li>
    <li> I get the newest and &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; shaver every 2 or 3 years. This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever owned.  It replaced my  former top of the line Braun.  It gives me an amazingly close, fast shave.</li>
    <li> Gets a very close shave for an electric and remains sharp for a long time.  However, I can not get a good shave when wet and is only marginally better than razors that cost much less.</li>
    <li> The best shaver!  I love it.</li>
    <li> Close, clean shave.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> Works great. Clean shave. Trimmer is a bit awkward.</li>
    <li> It is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for 40 years and I decided to try the new Panasonic and to my surprise it provides an extremely decent shave. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Best saver ever owned, that&#x27;s saying a lot given I&#x27;m almost 70 years old. First review ever wrote. If you have a hard beard to shave this is like using a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Bought as new, came in as brand new sealed box but shaver was used with someone’s hear and dried soap inside and outside the saver. I have been buying from Amazon a lot, newer even imagine that something like that could happen. It makes my stomach turn. I am taking pictures now, so Amazon customer service can see it. Also they set this up that there is no option to return this shaver, only to exchange, I have been wondering to what? Another used one with less hears? I still can’t believe that Amazon would do this to me after spending thousands of dollars over the years with them.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS!  An oversized pile of junk.  I don&#x27;t know why, buy the old cheaper 2-head panasonic cuts much better.  Also, the trimmer couldn&#x27;t be any worse on this if you tried.  I don&#x27;t know how the panasonic engineers could come up with such an inferior product, but they SUCCEEDED!</li>
    <li> For the past ten years, I have bought each new Panasonic Electric Shaver... whatever their Top-Of-The-Line Model currently was... always upgrading to the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;, with each marketed \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; that Panasonic touted every couple of years.  I went from the old \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; line... following the trend from 3 blades... to 4 blades... and about two years ago upgrading to the very expensive ($400 at the time) \\&quot;ES-LA93\\&quot; series with 4 blades at higher RPM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly... while each new Panasonic shaver was a SLIGHT improvement in performance over the previous generation (and always moderately superior to whatever Braun was selling... yep, I tried those also)... the disappointment came in realizing that even the Top-Of-The-Line electric shaver was somewhat lackluster in its performance on my hard-to-shave beard, due mainly to the numerous slightly in-grown hairs on my neck.  Even on the easier-to-shave areas, I still found myself having to press down with some force, while pulling my skin taught, and going over and over and over the same areas to get a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just resigned myself to the fact that this was the limited inherent nature of electric shavers... the world&#x27;s best shaver was widely accepted to be that Panasonic 4-Blade Model ES-LA93 that I used every day, and that was just \\&quot;as good as it gets\\&quot;.  No amount of money could buy anything better, as we had apparently reached the limits of technology with the Panasonic ES-LA93.  I could either accept that... or return to the messiness and occasionally bloodiness of an old-school razor blade, like countless generations of men before me had used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND THEN... along came the Panasonic ES-LV81... with its newly-engineered 5-Blade Cutting System.  WOW!  This thing is unbelievable.  Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking,,, because it&#x27;s exactly what I was thinking... \\&quot;So it&#x27;s got 5 blades instead of 4... big deal... that cannot possibly make it more than 20% better... yet another SLIGHT improvement... who cares?\\&quot;  Well, fellow electric shaver fans... WRONG!  It&#x27;s NOT about the number of blades with this ES-LV81... it&#x27;s about the huge leap forward in the FOIL design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the previous generation&#x27;s (ES-LA93 model) foil... this new ES-LV81 model has something Panasonic calls a \\&quot;Lift-Tech Foil\\&quot; which is brilliantly reverse-tapered to slide UNDER those hairs that want to lay-down-flat on your face.  (And as a side-note, it is also MUCH quieter than the previous model, and it feels lighter in the hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first shave with this ES-LV81, I let my beard grow for 3 days to give it a good challenge.  It glides over my face far more smoothly than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Amazingly, it is not necessary to press-down with significant pressure (as I had to do with previous models)... it just glides lightly and leaves a clean path behind.  Yes, I still have to go over problem areas repeatedly... but not nearly as much as before... which leaves my neck and face far less red and irritated.  I was absolutely amazed at how much quicker I could complete a shave with this latest and greatest model from Panasonic.  It easily reduces my shaving time by at least 30% versus the previous model... plus it does so with a light touch and a far greater level of comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LV81 is also available without the optional cleaning and charging stand... which is called the ES-LV61... and that one at this time costs about $38 less.  You still get the same great model of shaver, but you have to plug it directly into an electric outlet to charge it, and you have to clean it yourself (which is very, very easy) using liquid soap and running water (which is exactly what I do to clean it daily when I am traveling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is an expensive product... (Retail: $600... through here on Amazon, it&#x27;s nearly half-off at just a bit over $300)... but seriously... if you use an electric razor, you need to put down whatever you are using now, and buy this Panasonic ES-LV81.  It is flat-out amazing, and just a huge leap forward in electric shaver technology, due to this new \\&quot;Lift-Tech\\&quot; foil design.  You will not be disappointed.  It&#x27;s not just a \\&quot;slight\\&quot; improvement as previously-introduced new models were... this one is a dramatic improvement over previous models.  You will notice it right away... within a few seconds of starting your first shave with this magnificent electric shaver.e using now, and buy this Panasonic ES-LV81.  It is flat-out amazing, and just a huge leap forward in electric shaver technology, due to this new \\&quot;Lift-Tech\\&quot; foil design.  You will not be disappointed.

    <li> I have really sensitive skin on my neck and my previous electric razor, while it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, i definitely didn&#x27;t feel like i got a very close shave. There were always little whiskers that it wouldn&#x27;t pick up. So i thought, &amp;#34;hey, i&#x27;m going to get this super awesome expensive razor.&amp;#34; i was really excited about the wet shave option because everyone said you got a super close shave that way. Well the first time i tried to the wet shave while it definitely seemed pretty close, it also made my neck all red and splotchy and irritated. I tried wet shaving for a week, and every time i did my neck would get very red and splotchy and irritated. So i stopped and tried dry shaving instead. And while it works, i can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any closer than my last razor. It is nice, being a wet razor, that i can just rinse it out and clean it really easily. But in all honesty, wet shaving irritated my skin and looked really bad, and dry shaving is not any different than my last, MUCH less expensive razor. i can&#x27;t recommend it. But maybe my skin is just too sensitive.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  We have been married for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve seen him go through several shavers, never satisfied with results.  He has VERY thick and coarse facial hair, that grows fast.  We tease him that his 5 o&#x27;clock shadow shows up around 1.  He also spent a considerable amount of time trying to get through a shave with other shavers.  This one is powerful, fast and gives him the closest shave.  He has had it for about 6 months now and still, he usually comments on how much he likes it when he shaves.  It is well worth the money and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Panasonic razor for about 6 months.  This product is absolutely amazing: shaves as close as a blade without the nicks and cuts...you know, the kind that happen when you have been working your behind preparing for a big deal presentation and you look like you&#x27;ve escaped from a slaughterhouse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with sensitive skin I&#x27;d recommend this razor hands down.  It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery typically lasts 36 - 40 minutes on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartedly recommend this great product.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver for about a month and I LOVE it!  This is the closest shave from an electric shaver I have ever had, and for me, no razor burn.  REALLY close to the best manual razor shaves.  It is expensive, but with a sale that brought the price down to about $200, I put it on my Christmas list and my wife bought it for me as a present and told me to open it early.  She loves the closeness of the shave as much as I do.  I use the cleaning system every few days and it comes out perfect.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I wavered about buying this for my boyfriend for almost a year.  I read the reviews and finally decided to unload the cash for it.  It was worth every penny.  He loves it and it shaves exceptionally well!</li>
    <li> Received as promised. Razor is exceptional, works really well. Was pricey but worth it. Love the wet or dry feature.</li>
    <li> More than my expection. I really like this shave system. Maybe I will buy another one quickly when the price is lowest.</li>
    <li> I had this shaver for a few months, then it would not switch on, even with a full charge.  I shipped it to Panasonic for repair under warranty, and didn&#x27;t get a replacement for four months.  Now, after light use less than a year later, the base will not charge the shaver, and the shaver won&#x27;t switch on, even with a full charge with the cord connected directly to the shaver.  Let me guess: made in China?</li>
    <li> My first experience with Electric shavers have been with Norelco, last of which being their Senso Touch 3d.  I just was never satisfied with the shaving experience I got from them especially with a lot of tugging and pulling of hairs. I decided to jump ship and switch to Double Edge Razor shaving based on a friends recommendation.  I&#x27;ve been using DE razor&#x27;s for over a year and I thought I would never go back to cartridge or electrics ever again.  Even though the DE razor&#x27;s gives you the closest shave ever, (No Electric can ever compare to it) only problem with DE Razor shaving is the amount of time it takes.&lt;br /&gt;I came across a special deal for this Panasonic Shaver a coupe of weeks back and after reading all the reviews both from users on Amazon and other professional Reviews, I decided to take the plunge and give it a try.  I was totally taken by surprise by the results from the very first time I tried this shaver.  Not only did it give me a very close shave, but it was also incredibly quick.  Best of all, this Shaver did not do any pulling and tugging of hair which is common among other Electric Shavers.  Made in Japan, the build quality is excellent.  I&#x27;ve only tried dry shaving so far and will soon try wet shaving, since this does both really well. Thanks to DE Razor shaving, I now enjoy the whole experience of creating your own lather from a quality shaving cream like Proraso and using a Badger hair brush.  (For those of you who use a shaving cream from a pressurized can - please do yourself a favor and get rid of that junk).  I&#x27;m a big advocate of Panasonic Shavers and will definitely be recommending them to all my family and friends.  If your thinking about this shaver and are hesitant because of the costs, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t think twice about it and just take the plunge, it will be well worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic EX-LV81-K has been the very best electric razor that I have ever owned.  A bit expensive and almost worth all of the money</li>
    <li> It looks and sounds like a toy. It&#x27;s almost embarrassing to use it. But it gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver. Cartoonishly disproportionate head. Oversized icon in LCD display. Sound is loud an, well, toy-like. Feel is lightweight. It totally seems like a ridiculous toy in every way, except that it gives the best shave I have ever gotten form an electric razor. My beard is coarse, fast growing, and has lots of directional changes in it. Very hard to shave well. This thing, in part because It allows me to shave wet and or with cream, but even when shaving dry, cuts closer and more evenly than anything, and with less irritation. &amp;#34;A+&amp;#34; for engineering. &amp;#34;C-&amp;#34; for industrial design.</li>
    <li> Very good, better than expected.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be better than it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had it a year and have had to replace the foils twice. When the foils are new the shaver is superb, after a month not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for the foils dulling quickly everything else works brilliantly. But as to economical, it is not.</li>
    <li> great!! perfect shave</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase opportunity and provides an terrific shave!  Closest shave you can get, without using a blade.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic men&#x27;s razor...the first one lasted about 7 years shavers. This one is another fine product from panasonic. Very close shave with no irritations.</li>
    <li> ive been a loyal  norelco and braun user for  35 yrs but i love this shaver it really gives me as close a shave as a blade  it is remarkable and  it doesnt take a lot of effort or passes to achive amazing results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  i figure i sped 300-400 a yr on high end  8$+ for 4 razor blades since  with my heavy beard they dull ever 2-3 days  so in a year this has paid for itself&lt;br /&gt;get one</li>
    <li> To start, this is a nice looking shaver, and well made. The blue digital display is blacked out most of the time, except right after turning it off, or during charging.  The shaver gives an excellent shave.  I’m not sure whether it is worth the list price of $600, but at the Amazon price (42-48% of list) it is a very attractive purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Norelco 1255X, which gave a pretty good shave for the 7 months I had it. After 7 months, it felt a little less sharp, and I started shopping for a replacement head.  I returned the Norelco to the big box store when I discovered that Norelco had discontinued the original head and the replacement head is notorious for being very uncomfortable.  (Read the Amazon reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic gives a far better shave than the Norelco did.  I use Jack Black Supreme Cream Triple Cushion Shave Lather for shaving (available on Amazon).  I usually wet the shaver before shaving.  It takes less than 3 minutes for a close, comfortable shave.  I did not time shaving with the Norelco, but always felt that it took about 4 or 5 minutes to get everything.  I have a pretty tough beard, and as it turns grey, the hairs seem stiffer.  Like other older guys, I am getting one or two low, flat moles. The LV81 shaves comfortably without irritating them much.  It was because of them that I chose to give up shaving with razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic cleans easily with soap and water.  The package also includes the handy cleaning/drying machine, which also charges the shaver.  The cleaning machine does a very good job.  However, do NOT run the cleaning cycle if your significant other (or an insignificant other) is sleeping in the next room.  During the cleaning cycle it makes a periodic buzzing sound, similar to an alarm clock.  In my home, it can be heard 25 feet away, through a solid maple door.  The shaver itself is quiet enough to use while others are sleeping, providing you close the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the charge, I find that it last a long time.  Two shaves reduces the LED indicator to 90%.  That would equal about 20 shaves per charge, which at 2-3 minutes per shave pretty much matches or exceeds the claimed 45 minute charge life.  This morning, it was at 80% after 3 shaves and 3 cleanings using baby soap and the shaver alone (not the cleaning machine).  Eighty percent is still consistent with getting 45 minutes of usage per charge.  I split my time between downtown Los Angeles and Dana Point, so the shaver gets charged every weekend in Dana Point, but has plenty of charge to get through the week in Los Angeles.  I have not tried going two weeks between charges, because I don’t want to risk having to shave with a blade.  For travel, the power supply unplugs from the cleaning/drying machine and will plug into the shaver, so you could take just the shaver (it comes with a soft travel case) and the charger with you.  Extra chargers can be purchased for about $20 on Amazon.  Throw one in your suitcase and you won&#x27;t have to remember to bring one with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I look forward to shaving in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - JULY 2016:  The cleaning station malfunctioned.  Although I could clear the drain with a paper clip, it also would not run the clean cycle unless I unplugged it for a few seconds. I had an unsatisfactory customer service experience, talking to someone in the Philippines who was working from a script, and later with someone domestic.  Both insisted that I had to send the entire system to them, even though the shaver works. Now, I cannot find out the status of the repair. I guess I&#x27;ll wait another week and see if I receive a package from McAllen. Not a good experience for a shaver with a $600 list price. They should have just sent out a new cleaner, or sent a new system out with a credit card deposit, charging for the new one if the old one is not returned within 10 days.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of Electric Mens Shavers in the past but never able to get what I am looking for. I now own the best Shaver on the Market. There is nothing to beat the Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Blade Shaver. I have never seen such a close shave I even looking forward to the next morning to shave wit it !!!&lt;br /&gt;Willem</li>
    <li> As a quick overview, I have owned a few Panasonic shavers over the years, but I have definitely found this to be the best, especially for the price you can now get it for on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could spend a lot of time addressing most of what has been already said, but I think a lot of you will get a lot more out of a simple pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Charger can be taken along for traveling and plugged directly into shaver.&lt;br /&gt;-Locking switch is a HUGE plus for traveling&lt;br /&gt;-End result is smoother than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;-Less razor burn on neck than previous models.&lt;br /&gt;-Leather travel case is nice.&lt;br /&gt;-Construction has a solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-LCD does not flip when in charging base, so info displays upside down.&lt;br /&gt;-Still tugs a bit on long beards, but better than before&lt;br /&gt;-Still causes a bit of minor razor burn&lt;br /&gt;-Cannot charge and shave at the same time (makes sense for safety).&lt;br /&gt;-Shaver head is a bit awkward and bulky</li>
    <li> The electric shaver has a great design.... good for sensitive skin.... It cuts clean my face beard but not my neck beard.&lt;br /&gt;thank you. any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I really went through a lot of shavers recently, in my quest to find the perfect shaver. The problem with these shavers are usually that they do not offer a close enough shave, or that it simply takes too long to shave with them.  This shaver feels like the designers thought exactly about that and how to fix it and they came back with an almost perfect product. The shaving time is short and the shave itself is very close to a blade shave (especially when using in shower). The biggest problem with it is of course the price, at over $300 this is one of the most expensive shavers out there and it&#x27;s not easily affordable. I haven&#x27;t had it for too long (about 6 months) and so far it still works well and the battery life feels good.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about its functionality is that when I had a lot of stubble (like after a week of no shaving) it can really hurt to use this (quite normal for electric shavers but I expected more from this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;4/5, the best electric shaver i used so far, but expensive and not perfect.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing this, I owned the Panasonic ES8109S for years.  It was great and I had no problems up until recently when the cleaning station was retaining water in the base.  The ES-LV81 in my opinion doesn&#x27;t cut any better than my 8109.  It&#x27;s nice to have the extra blade to cover more surface, but in the end it didn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference.  I also tried the Braun 7 series, but didn&#x27;t like the fact that it can&#x27;t be used in the shower.  I wish I could get my hands on the European version that can be used in the shower, the Braun 799-c4.  I will be returning this an going with the replacement model of the ES8109 which is the ES-LT71S.</li>
    <li> There is no need to look any further for the best shaver out there. It is still not up to a good blade, but I shave 6 times with this and one time with a blade.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great ,but adaptor like a s***,when I plug it noise of current make it like a cheap copy</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shavers over the sixty-three years I have been shaving.  None compare with this one.  Yes, it  is expensive - but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric shavers over the past 10 years, including the top of the line Braun Shaving System with the self-cleaning system and tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LV81 knocks all of the other shavers dead off the shelves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very heavy beard and used to have to shave the other areas of my face over and over again just to get rid of those small little hairs after the thicker whiskers were still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic does an excellent job of clearing the big whiskers away and then on the second or third go around, it clears out all the stubble and leaves me with a clean, smooth, cool face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is amazing about this shaver is the pivoting head.  It leaves you able to hold the razor in any number of positions:  you can shave with the razor head upside down, sideways, at odd angles,etc.  It&#x27;s pivoting head moves along with you at whatever angle you wish it to shave at.  It is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to apply a lot of pressure and then mess up your skin.  A light touch does a tremendous job of cleaning up your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a neat digital display that tells you how much power is left in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self-cleaning tray is a real plus BUT you don&#x27;t have to use that system very often.  There is a 2nd back-up system that shows a &amp;#34;faucet&amp;#34; on the razor unit.  To clean it up when the &amp;#34;faucet&amp;#34; shows up, you simply take one or two drops of any liquid hand soap and place the drops on the razor head.  You then place a drop or two of water on the razor head, run the razor for a couple of seconds to let the soap get into the &amp;#34;razor head&amp;#34; and then run hot water while placing the razor head directly under the faucet.  This then cleans the razor head, the screen, and the inside of the mechanism.  You then have an absolutely clean razor head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electronic cleaning system features a deluxe cleaning system of the special solution that comes with the original kit and a &amp;#34;drying system&amp;#34; that cleans out the razor as well.  This takes some time so you may want to do this in the morning after you leave for work.  When you get home you have a clean, dry razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the Panasonic ES-LV81-K is the best razor I have ever shaved with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried looking around for a good price (e.g. Amazon, K-Mart, etc.) but Amazon.Com had the very best price anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check all of the vendors on Amazon.Com before selecting the one you buy it from as the price differentials can save you $ 20 to $ 40 on the sale.t and a &amp;#34;drying system&amp;#34; that cleans out the razor as well.

    <li> Easy to hold , smooth shave , easy to clean , easy to charge , too soon to see how long blades will last.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in October 2013.  My Philips RX1280 was not shaving as well as when new. With the Philips I began to notice that even after replacing the heads, although I got a good shave (wet, with Schick Gel), stubble was &#x27;feelable&#x27; some hours after shaving.  Previously I used a Braun 7 760 for some years.  It gave a good dry shave but not as close as a blade.  The Panasonic shaves closer than the Norelco or the &#x27;old&#x27; Braun but then after 2.5 months after purchase it simply &#x27;died&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Much closer shave than previous Norelco (Philips) 1280 (2.5 years).&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent shave.  I shave wet with a gel foam (Schick) wet (gel).  Result has been as close as earlier blade shaving, with little irritation.  Also, the shave lasted right through the day and even the next day there was less stubble than with previous electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Difficult to trim under nose and in front of ears because of the width of the head.&lt;br /&gt;- Noisier than the Braun 7 760 and much noisier than the Rx1280.&lt;br /&gt;- Disappointing cleaning/drying system.  The wash cycle is a full 10 minutes - with lots of very noisy episodes.  Then, the (relatively quiet) drying cycle is  impossibly long - 180 minutes!  Sometimes it worked and other times it was still wet at the end of the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After death of the Panasonic I &#x27;instant chatted&#x27; with an Amazon rep who first told me I should contact Panasonic.  I told him that was unacceptable and Amazon, as the retailer, should take responsibility,  Then he made an offer of a partial refund of $80(!)  I explained tat after a decade of dealing with Amazon this was the first issue I&#x27;ve had and the amount was unacceptable. Some further negotiation he refunded approximately 78% of the cost.  The &#x27;instant chat&#x27; made the process straightforward. This was an OK outcome I guess, without having to freight the item back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I get another Panasonic Arc 5?  Absolutely not!  I&#x27;ll go to the new Braun 7-799 which has so far received very good reviews.</li>
    <li> smoothly and easy to use</li>
    <li> Really like this shaver.  It gives me a closer shave compared to my Braun.  I found that with this shaver, wet shaving with some shaving cream gives me better results than dry.  3.5 minutes per shave and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean, just pop the foil cap and rinse the cap and the blades with water.  I mainly use the cleaning station for charging and drying.  I run the clean cycle around once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that it comes with a soft traveling pouch as I prefer a hard case like my Braun for some added protection inside my luggage.</li>
    <li> In 9 years I have had 3 panasonic razors, each one is better than the previous model. I always get their best model, this one is crazy expensive, but I got it on Amazon for $280.00 which is more than half off, so it works for me.</li>
    <li> I have long fought the shaving battle, and I have tried everything from electric razors to straight razors.  This product got great reviews overall, so I decided to give it a try.  This shaver works about as good as any electric can, but I still had trouble with it cutting well in a lot of areas because I have very coarse facial hair.  If you have a light beard this will probably work great for you, but not if you have a coarse beard.</li>
    <li> I returned the product for what I paid it did not come close to meeting my expectations..Don&#x27;t but one at all</li>
    <li> As others have described, take your choice as to the luxury car comparison of the Panasonic ES-LV81-K: Porsche, Audi, Mercedes.  It&#x27;s that good of a razor and that expensive.  It also has the poor reliability, high maintenance cost, and poor service support of the above brands, so 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real comparison isn&#x27;t between this and other brands - that&#x27;s really a personal preference - but  between this and the Panasonic 4-blade series, which can be found for 50-70% less than the exorbitant pricing on the 5 blade.  It does shave closer than the 4 blade series, although it paradoxically takes a little longer to do so.  Whether or not that&#x27;s worth the $200 difference to you is a reasonable question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade and foil replacements for these are also both a bit harder to find and more expensive, so maintenance cost should be considered as well.  On the bright side, Amazon finally started carrying both after a long delay, although foil and cutter combined are only available through third party vendors at full retail; you&#x27;re better off buying the foil and blade separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s model numbers are slightly off on the model summary page, so here are the links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005HMOEEE Panasonic Wes9170p Replacement Inner Blade for Men&#x27;s Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003H9GN9S Panasonic Wes9171p Replacement Outer Foil for Men&#x27;s Shaver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I rating this 1 star rather than the 3-4 stars of the shave versus price that would be appropriate for its overall value?  Well, unfortunately, after about 10 months of use the battery will no longer hold a charge for more than a few hours.  It is the weirdest battery error I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  Most batteries will simply hold far less of a charge when they are ready for replacement; this one will hold a full charge for 60 minutes of continuous use, but if left alone overnight it will have no charge left.  That&#x27;s a defective design, and unlike previous Panasonic models you can&#x27;t use the razorwith the cord plugged in so the razor is essentially useless if this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite a nominal warranty of 2 years, customer service refuses to accept this for warranty without a receipt even though this model wasn&#x27;t released until late 2011.  It&#x27;ll be returned for warranty service eventually, but the combination of these errors means I cannot recommend this product or Panasonic customer service.  Product failure like this on a exorbitantly priced flagship model is bad enough, but poor customer service means it&#x27;s not something worth buying.  1 star.</li>
    <li> I love it. I was used to Philips rotary shavers and this is so much better. A smooth shaver that operates with precision. Easy to wash. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I think there are better products out there. It doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hairs off your face as advertised even if the area is shaved repeatedly.</li>
    <li> Every few years I update to the next Panasonic Shaver. They just get better and better. Very clean shave. Easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> The price of this shaver will likely be more than most people want to pay for a shaver, but after wearing out many Remingtons and Brauns over the years, this is absolutely the BEST shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Due to the relatively steep price paid, I bought a Square Trade Protection Plan for it. Close, comfortable, and clean shave every time. I love it. I hope it lasts a LONG time, and believe it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed shaving and have done the majority of it in the shower. I&#x27;ve also always had some sort of irritation or a few nicks on my neck. Lately, I&#x27;ve cut open the same bump on my throat and it&#x27;s become quite a nuisance, esp with our fluffy white towels. I thought I&#x27;d give an electric a try and hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this this thing is well-made and thoughtfully designed. The controls are easy to use and everything just works like you&#x27;d expect it to. I&#x27;ve been using this for the last 2 weeks and I really enjoy shaving. It&#x27;s so easy that I like to do it twice a day now, because, hey, why not? I&#x27;ve also watched as my skin has cleared up considerably. Very happy with this shaver and would recommend it. Sure, it&#x27;s expensive, but at less than a dollar a day (assuming you only use it for a year, which is ridiculous), it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> This shaver has many very nice features but does not give a smooth and complete shave. It left my face and neck very irritated. I was very disappointed in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;steve springer</li>
    <li> For an electric shaver i was impressed by the close shave.  I enjoy the the wet technology enabling me to lather up. Faces are important to me, in that I am a Plastic Surgeon.  artofplasticsurgery.com&lt;br /&gt;Best electric shaver I have used.  Jeffrey Rosenthal, M.D.</li>
    <li> i have owned other panasonic shaver models which i found to be very effective .  with this model i decided to splurge and spend the maximum to see how it worked .  this shaver is outstanding and gives a razor close shave even in the hard to get to areas under the nose and on the neck ... i doubt if there is anything better on the market .... don&#x27;t see how there could be ..</li>
    <li> its very nice .Very useful and good quality of an object, I am satisfied, it comes to cleaning, a little weaker</li>
    <li> best shave ever........closer than my blade</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver that my life partner Bruce enjoys using on me as well.  The shaver is gentle on my sack and gooch. Bruce takes his time in my sensitive spots as not to irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> This is simple a great product!  The closest shave from an electric I&#x27;ve ever seen and I&#x27;ve tried them all (Norelco, Braun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sure fire shaver and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I do not do well with shavers, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. And I mean all. I&#x27;ve tried every combination of 3 blade, 4 blade and 5 blade replaceable cartridge razors from Bic, Gilette, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the top of the line Norelco and Brauns through the years. I instantly loved this razer. For me, the problem has always been my neck. My hair grows curly and in all directions, and with the Braun Cooltec I most recently had, sometimes it just couldn&#x27;t cut neck hairs, and I&#x27;d have to grab a regular razor and cut one or two hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did okay with the Norelco, but it took FOREVER to shave as I found the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this shaver, my shave time is down to 3-5 minutes. 5 minutes if it&#x27;s been 2 days. Otherwise, 3-4 minutes. It gets everything on my neck, without question. There hasn&#x27;t been any irritation. And my cheeks are AS SMOOTH as using a non-electric razer. Almost too good to be believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only suspect it&#x27;s a combination of the five blade foil, the really high RPM motor, and the pivoting head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleaning system keeps things sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;2) Sonic cleaning mode for when you are on the road. Wet the razor, put a little liquid soap, and activate the sonic mode, it will clean it self remarkably well until you get home to your base station cleaner. My dad immediately asked me &amp;#34;what good is that, hotels give you bar soap, not liquid soap&amp;#34; - but shampoo does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;3) Pivoting head, but also can be locked stationary. Not sure why you want to, but I guess that&#x27;s a feature.&lt;br /&gt;4) BEST shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;5) Power lock. Makes sure it won&#x27;t turn on in your luggage and drain itself.&lt;br /&gt;6) LCD screen so you know what battery power is left. Also times your shaves. Not sure that&#x27;s important, yet I like seeing it. I guess I&#x27;m just glad to be done fighting for 8-10 minutes with a shaver that never gets that last neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Replacement parts are expensive compared to the competition.&lt;br /&gt;2) Slightly lower battery life than other brands... but again, if I&#x27;m shaving in 3-5 minutes and it has a 45 minute battery, it&#x27;s going to be ok... I&#x27;m rarely away from electricity for weeks. :)&lt;br /&gt;3) Soft case not hard case.&lt;br /&gt;4) No brush included. If you&#x27;re upgrading from another electric, keep the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next model up seems to have some sort of sensor system to adjust the speed of the motor depending on if it&#x27;s your neck or cheek or what have you. Seems like a $200 gimmick. I&#x27;m happy with the second from top of the line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shaver for a long time and when I saw this Arc 5 available at such a low price I picked it up and it does not disappoint.  Dry shaves are even smoother than with the Arc4 and I loved the Arc4.  This machine is also slightly quieter - same engine so maybe the housing is more robust.  Either way, this is hands down an awesome shaver!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving results, use a short time after charging</li>
    <li> My husband has had numerous electric razors, but this one is the best-perhaps a bit pricey but worth every penny.  He gets a close shave without having to go over and over the same spot even though he usually waits several days before he shaves. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  An added plus is that it can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Great shaver and nice battery life. Have been using for almost 30 days and never have had a closer and better shaver. A little expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Excellent, first class shaver.  My dad using it for his head, now it&#x27;s smooth as a mirror!</li>
    <li> Only had it for a month but it gives a very close shave so far.</li>
    <li> Certainly the best electric shaver I have ever used. Over the past twenty some years I have purchased 4-5 different brands and at various prices.  This Panasonic is the most expensive shaver I ever purchase and it performs as it should. In the past I would look in the mirror and talk myself into believing I don&#x27;t need to shave this morning usually because it was such an unpleasant task. Not now. It is one of th first things I do to prepare myself to look decent. I would recommend this shaver for ones personal use and consider one as a gift for a friend or relative. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have never before found an electric shaver that I actually liked. I thought I would take a gamble and try this one, due to all the good reviews. I was not disappointed. I love this shaver. It shaves as close as a blade and I&#x27;ve had no irritation issues whatsoever. I prefer to dry shave, but I&#x27;ve tried it wet and it&#x27;s just as good. Fast, powerful motor. It doesn&#x27;t pull or yank at all. On the odd occasion it will miss the odd softer hair on my neck, but a couple of passes over it and I&#x27;m usually good. I was told the cleaner wouldn&#x27;t be much good, but I rinse it and put it in the cleaner every week, and it works great. Been using it for six months and haven&#x27;t had to replace a cartridge. I dug out an old shaver I don&#x27;t use to compare, and it was night and day. I don&#x27;t think you can find a better shaver.</li>
    <li> so far I forgot about shaving, and never getting hurts or achy chin unlike when using blade.&lt;br /&gt;the only disappointing part it has to keep some small hair and when the hair grow you will notice some are growing inside the skin.</li>
    <li> it is very loudly sound</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth the price. All of the reviews about this shaver said it performed well. I use it on my face and head daily and I like the results.</li>
    <li> I started to shave with an electric razor in my teens because my father had one. I found a Norelco not bad. My Uncle got me to use a new Gillette safety razor that he had just bought when I was in my early twenties. It was amazing. The shave was very comfortable, very close, and took very little time; especially in comparison to my Norelco electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later, I did try a Braun electric that my father gave me shortly after he bought one for himself that he loved. I thought that it was uncomfortable and gave me a terrible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 18 months ago, I had to buy an electric shaver. I settled on a Norelco that could be used in the shower and which excreted a shaving gel. It was surprisingly comfortable and fairly close. However, I decided that it wasn&#x27;t for me when I was required to get new blades for it twice in the last six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I settled on a Panasonic ES-LV81-K to replace it. I have had it ten days and it has been a wonderful choice. I use it in the shower with shaving cream since I have a heavy beard but sensitive skin. It is supposed to take up to thirty days to get used to a new electric shaver but I have been pleasantly surprised that I have had no trouble getting used to it from the first shave that I had with it. It is comfortable, closer than the closest shave that I have ever had with a safety razor, and takes less time than even shaving with a safety razor. The shave is competitive for closeness with a shave from a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. It is very light and well balanced.&lt;br /&gt; 2. It has a switch that locks it in the on position so you cannot turn it off by accident in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt; 3. It can be cleaned very easily with liquid soap rinsed with water while the shaver&#x27;s sonic control is on.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Its head rotates up and down and side to side so it can reach areas on the neck and under the nose that are normally difficult for an electric to reach and shave efficiently.&lt;br /&gt; 5.Little effort is needed to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt; 6. The shaver has a very informative information panel that lets you know how long your shave took, what percentage of battery power is left, and whether the shaver needs to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt; 7. The cleaning device has a drying position that dries the shaver efficiently and can be used without cleaning it. The device also is very good to store the shaver between shaves.&lt;br /&gt; 8. The shaver is significantly quieter than expected; especially with a 14,000 rpm motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have noted none so far but will update this review if I note any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspects That Have Not Yet Been Evaluated:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. I have not yet used the cleaning aspect of the cleaning/drying/recharging device.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Panasonic says that I will need to replace the foil in one year and the blades in 18 months. I do not know it either of these claims are accurate.&lt;br /&gt; 3. I have not traveled with it yet but it has a travel case, can be recharged by attaching the plug for the cleaning base directly to the razor and plugging it in, and, as noted above, can be cleaned with liquid soap rinsed with running water while the shaver is in sonic mode.&lt;br /&gt; 4. The noise level of the cleaning base when it is in cleaning mode. It is fully acceptable in the drying mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after I can evaluate these items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noted earlier that this is the best shaver that I have ever had. True, it is expensive but you can find significant discounts on line and if you can afford it you should get the best shaves of your life if your beard and skin are similar to mine. I wish you luck with this[[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]]</li>
    <li> For me it shave almost as close as a razor minus the cuts</li>
    <li> Has take the &amp;#34;Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned&amp;#34; crown and is leagues better than anything I&#x27;ve had in the past!  Great job Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Bought my husband two new electric razors. He wanted both dry and wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves this razor, the head floats over his face and gives him great shave with no redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is his first Panasonic razor, he usually gets Braun or Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, would buy again.</li>
    <li> ***This is a slightly edited review from the one I gave on the Braun page.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to compare over what I feel the most important features are. I thought this would be completely easy to decide the winner, but as I write this, I still haven&#x27;t completely decided. So let me get started and I&#x27;ll have to make my pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build Quality and Looks: Not much to say here, they both feel pretty solid. Braun \\&quot;feels\\&quot; better built as the Panasonic has more of a plastic feel to the outside. Panasonic seems to have smudges that I cannot get out from when I used shaving cream,  makes the shaver look stained. Cannot rightfully compare that with the Braun since I cannot use shaving cream with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: I would say the Braun feels like its meant to fit in your hand better though the Panasonic is by no means bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loudness: ESLV81K is a good bit higher in pitch, which seems to just barely creep past my 2 shut doors to my sleeping girlfriend. The Braun 790cc cannot be heard with 2 doors between you and it. Its lower buzz is more enjoyable to my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Station: The Braun&#x27;s looks way better but the Panasonic&#x27;s is easier to read and figure out for first timers. They both get the job done and the shavers come out as clean as when it was unboxed. Tossup here, can&#x27;t decide which I prefer until I mention the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning Solution: I had to put this in a completely separate category because I don&#x27;t feel the cleaning station of the Panasonic is by any means inferior to Braun&#x27;s. Though the cleaning solution is just bad to me. The Braun 790cc comes out smelling lemony fresh and is so very pleasant during 90% of your shave time and the 10% of the alcohol smell while doing your upper lip isn&#x27;t that bad. The Panasonic on the other hand, it smells so odd... Hard to describe better, smells soapy but not a good soapy smell. Like soap trying to cover up a mold smell. The more worn the Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning cartridgeis the less obtrusive the smell is though. But 100%, Braun cleaning solution is so much better on the senses. Though I would like to repeat, they both get the shaver clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual Clean: I know Braun gives you a brush but they shouldn&#x27;t, you cannot manually clean it, don&#x27;t even bother. The Panasonic&#x27;s manual cleaning is easy and probably as effective as the cleaning station. Heck, I would probably recommend people get just the shaver for the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the important stuff, the shaving experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I use Lab Series For Men Electric Shaver Solution when Dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: They both stink hardcore. Choosing between a turd and a pile of poo here. If forced I would pick the Panasonic&#x27;s trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-Day Stubble: Braun did way better than I would have thought, just some jaw hairs needed touching up. Panasonic looked just as good as 1 day stubble shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry Shave Experience: Both are very comfortable, feel as though I end up with more red bumps and irritation with the ESLV81K but might just be the closeness and its only around my bottom neck. Braun gives me some around my neck/jaw probably from all the skin stretching I do around that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet Shave Experience: Only Panasonic here, have I used it with cream? Yes, I won&#x27;t say much about it because I don&#x27;t like using cream with shavers because I think its messy but I will say it works. I use shaving gel, a little lighter and not quite as messy. With my gel (Eshu, had to throw the brand name in there, I love their stuff), the Panasonic glides effortlessly and gets a pretty close shave. I would say it&#x27;s only slightly closer than a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling: I NEED TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED A LOT BY IT! The Panasonic&#x27;s 5 blade head is not as big as it looks and it fits in my &#x27;stache area with ease. The big head doesn&#x27;t off-balance the device in your hand and the maneuverability of the head is admirable. I might say it is too maneuverable and you may need to put the lock on to press down harder to get an area. The Braun feels even better though, probably because the Panasonic moves left to right as well as up and down which I feel is overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Speed: Holy cow, Panasonic just destroys my facial hair. Cheeks and upper lip only need 1 pass most of the time. Neck requires an extra pass or two. Braun requires a lot more face stretching which adds up. the 790cc also needs a minimum of 3-4 strokes at one spot, the Panasonic is just way faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Closeness: An unholy patch of neck/jaw hair my Braun couldn&#x27;t get was shaved closer by the ESLV81K but not as good as I hoped. Would have to say besides that, the difference isn&#x27;t huge. Panasonic is just a little closer everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I required to pick a winner? Ugh, I think I may return my ESLV81K and hope the Braun 799cc wet/dry shaver comes out this summer (had a personal response from BraunUS twitter saying it was coming out this summer)or the 790cc hits a big sale here on Amazon. I&#x27;d say the Braun wasn&#x27;t worth the price but the Panasonic isn&#x27;t either. Add the replacement heads of the Panasonic which, as I write this, are currently on backorder and are over $80 for the combo foil and blades! The Panasonic cleaning cartridges are cheaper in the long run but nowhere close enough to make up for the replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My winner comes down to the one thing I didn&#x27;t want it to, price... Even if you don&#x27;t mind throwing around money, the boost in shave quality with the Panasonic is so minimal that it&#x27;s not worth $100 more than the Braun. Let me finish by saying, I would be keeping the Panasonic if Braun&#x27;s cleaning solution didn&#x27;t smell so very good.</li>
    <li> Change from the brown to to this brand. So far so good. Tried it in wet condition as well. It does close and clean shavers advertised.</li>
    <li> Always a clean close shave. Lets me shave every other day instead of every day. It&#x60;s also easy to clean</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves as close as my Power Shaver from the Art of Shaving. I am very pleased with it and I have not had any problem with the base cleaner. The shaver also performs better than my pulsonic Braun shaver 790 series that I have had for over 5 years.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great! It shaves closer than my Gillette fusion. Some spots you have to go over more than others but it is a quick shave and the self cleaner is great although it does take a very long time. I always hated electric razors because they would cut my neck this one does not have this issue. I believe it has the fastest motor on the market. The only issue I have is it shaves so close that I develope ingrown hairs on my chin and the sides of my mouth. I am 36 and looked like a 16 year old after I shaved. After 2 months of use, I do switch and use the Gillette every other time to help the ingrown hair problem it is not nearly as bad. It definitely takes a little time for your face to adjust. I have to shave often and it really is unbelievable how soft my face is after using this razor. It is expensive but when you consider an 8 pack of Gillette blades are about 40 dollars it will pay for itself in a couple years. I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because i have Rosacea and shaving irritates my skin.  The head has two degrees of motion that provides for a smoother shave.  I purchased the version with the automatic cleaning system because i thought that part of the problem i have shaving is my ability to get the razor clean enough.  It appears i was right, because using the razor with the automatic cleaning is producing a very good result while hand cleaning did not.  To be sure i always rinse the shaver out by hand before using the automatic cleaner - this removes hairs from the razor.  I also am careful to shave slowly, focusing on minimizing my discomfort and producing a result without bumps or cuts and minimal redness.  The result is the best shave i&#x27;ve had in years.  A friend believes that these razors always start off with a good result, but no matter what you do within a year or two even replacing the heads won&#x27;t bring the shave back to the quality you had when you first used it.  That remains to be seen and i&#x27;ll certainly update my review if i experience the razor going downhill in quality.  Why four stars instead of five?  Using the automatic cleaner isn&#x27;t cheap.  Beyond the initial cost there is a cost for the soap/brush dispensers you have to change every month.  Also, the automatic cleaner is definitely noisy, and, there is no way to tell the razor NOT to charge so that you can ensure a longer life from the battery while still getting a good clean; its both or charging but not cleaning without charging - if you want to wait for it, you can set it to clean, dry and charge, then pull the razor out during the dry and place it on a something to dry by air.</li>
    <li> Most of the other reviews hit the key points. Hands down it is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I came from a Braun series 7 and it was great, but this is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons why I did not give it 5 stars. First, because of the large head it is difficult to fully shave tight-uneven areas. Second, the side burn trimmer could be larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product!</li>
    <li> I previously had a Panasonic shaver and recieved a Braun as a present.  It was OK but switching to this is a night a day difference.  This shaver is so much better!</li>
    <li> I received this shaver yesterday, and was pleasantly surprised at the closeness of the shave, and the fact there was no irritation that has been present with every other shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned. Due to the fact that Norelco&#x27;s replacement heads have sky-rocketed past $190. for my 3D 1280x, I decided to say farewell to Norelco and try this particular shaver out. First of all, it gives a closer shave ( that&#x27;s the main thing ! ) and secondly, there is no irritation, unlike the Norelco 1280x. I got a deal through Amazon that I couldn&#x27;t pass up, so I jumped on it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier....I don&#x27;t have any experience with the Braun line-up, but from what I&#x27;ve seen of the reviews, you may be able to get by with the 799 series shaver, if you&#x27;re interested in saving a couple of bucks, and looking for a comparable quality shave ? The ergonomics will take some getting used to, and the cleaning cycle is rather noisy on this Panasonic, but I can live with that. Other than that, I&#x27;m convinced that I did the right thing.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad who has an extremely thick beard. He has always been a standard razor user but needed a safer means to shave when he went on blood thinner medicine. He liked the trimmer and said it was the best shave he ever had with an electric razor. Only downside is the cost but appears to be well worth it so far.</li>
    <li> A W E S O M E  time and face saver</li>
    <li> Been using this razor for months now. Love it.</li>
    <li> Close shave, quite, no burns... The very things I always wanted. Highly recommend it. Throw away your Brun, as I did, and get this gem.</li>
    <li> Dear Amazon Shopper,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot that could be said about all of the technology that goes into this razor, and a great many other reviewers have dissected every feature this gadget has to offer.  I am writing this review to concisely answer the question I assume led most people to read this item&#x27;s reviews: \\&quot;Does it provide a close shave compared to other razors in its class?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, there really aren&#x27;t any other razors in this class.  I own a Braun Series 7 and have used a Norelco 1280X 3D on several occasions; this razor is better.  The shave is smoother, it&#x27;s less apt to nick you, even if you&#x27;ve got an irritated hair follicle or two, you can cart it into the shower with you, and the self-cleaning is thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you could buy both the Norelco and the Braun for the price of this razor.  The question thus becomes, is the superior shave worth the stratospheric price tag?  The answer depends on you.  If you&#x27;re willing to fork over double what the next-best electric razor costs for the closest shave an electric razor can provide, this is the razor you want.  The first couple of times you use it, it will be uncomfortable and may nick you, but within a week&#x27;s time your face will adjust and you&#x27;ll be getting a smoother shave than you thought possible from an electronic device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the Braun is a fine alternative for a dry shave at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: The best electric shave money can buy at twice the price of the nearest competitor.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for many, many years, never very happy with them. That has changed with this Panasonic Shaver. Although it is expensive, it is worth every penny. I would never have believed a electric foil shaver could perform as well as the blade razors, but this Panasonic Shaver does. Well done Panasonic!</li>
    <li> MILITARY APPROVED! BEST ELECTRIC SHAVER EVER... No tugging, No biting, Smooth shaver and shave.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver. He said it is the best ever.</li>
    <li> Best Shaver In The Wide World.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 on Black Friday for $178, it was too good of a deal to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;This razor made me switch from 15+ years of disposable blades to an electric, and I shave my entire head as well as my face.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Gillette Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo since the late 90s, it was always the best in my mind for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I always shave in the shower, I find that the warm water, steam, and bar-soap lather gives me a closer shave than standing in front of my sink. The draw of this Panasonic was that I could use it in the shower, with bar-soap lather, just like my existing shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;At first, when using this razor, I felt it was too much work. I can shave my entire head and face with a Mach 3 in 10 minutes, even less if I am concentrating and not high. This razor takes on average 15-20 minutes to perform the task, but I think I am still getting the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;I was really undecided at first, it is a lot of money for a razor and I was not totally satisfied. So I took the Pepsi Challenge.&lt;br /&gt;I shaved half of my face with a Gillete Mach 3 turbo, and the other half with the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend and my best friend both incorrectly guessed which side was which. They thought the side I shaved with the Mach 3 turbo, was in fact the side I shaved with the Panasonic. When shaving with a disposable blade, I cannot shave against the grain on my chin and jawline. If I do, I cut myself 1000 times and its a bloody mess. Not &amp;#34;bloody&amp;#34; like I am from England, but real blood, blood. With the Panasonic I can go against the grain all over my face without looking like I am suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;Typically after 2 days of non-showering (and shaving) while using the Gillete Mach 3, it was time for me to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34;. My stubble was visible and you could really tell I am going bald, and not just making a fashion statement. Now, using this Panasonic, my window of looking &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34; has now been expanded to 3days, a 50% boost in the amount of time I can be lazy.&lt;br /&gt;I have been recommending this to my friends and family, I am now recommending it to you.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have used so far.</li>
    <li> very good shaver. would have given 5 stars but still not the best on neck. in saying that its still a very good product worth buying.</li>
    <li> My wife was skeptical about the price; but once you consider what good razors cost, it&#x27;s a bargain.  I highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Not kidding. I&#x27;ve had a lot of others, but this one beats the pants off ALL the others. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m most impressed by how fast this shaver gets the job done. Also by how smooth and comfortable it is on my face. The Braun Series 7 that I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now (and yes, I&#x27;ve replaced the head a couple of times) was much more harsh. Glad I took a chance on the Panasonic and switched.</li>
    <li> The finest electric razor that I have ever owned. It shaves, with no irritation, almost as close as a blade. The cleaner system works very well, but, is loud. The cleaner is very economical, compared to my old Braun 7 system. GREAT PRODUCT!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me first say I have a really thick beard and sensitive skin . Not easy to get a good shave even with the best blades .Because of all the \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; in my face ,cuts would always be a problem even with an electric razor .I have used Reminton and two different models of Norelco Shavers .My last shaver was the Panasonic es8249 which gave one of the best shaves to that point .The es8249 did create some irritation but was the closest shave so far . Then I heard about the LV-81k . Read all the reviews and it looked like it would be lot better than my 8249. Well with Amazon&#x27;s return policy I figured I would give the LV-81k a chance even with the high price .&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I have never had a shave as close and irritation free as I get with this new shaver .Absolutely amazing .&lt;br /&gt;With the lv-81k :&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved dry and it was very good . I have shaved with lectric shave and it was even better . Then I shaved wet using King Of Shaves Kinexium oil and got great results . Yesterday I wet shaved using Nivea gel and all I can say is WOW ! Usually by five pm I&#x27;m looking like Richard Nixon on a bad day ,here it is a day later and my face is as smooth as it would normally be a few hours after shaving using other shavers . There is a lot of talk about how great the Braun 790 is and it is a lot cheaper . It does not shave wet and when you clean it you have to use the self cleaner that comes with it . The Panasonic gives you the choice of putting a little liquid hand soap on it ,putting it in turbo mode and running it under water . This will save on buying cleaning cartridges and gives you more flexibility .&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money you will not be sorry buying this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have 3 Braun electrics with the cleaning tank setup and they have recently changed the motor (on the newest ones) so that it doesn&#x27;t cut as fast or as well.  much slower actually.  Also, the Braun&#x27;s go through expensive cleaning tanks monthly, whether they are used or not because the fluid drys out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is quieter, enough so that the cutting of hair can be heard, unlike the Braun&#x27;s, and faster cutting---and maybe a little closer, but definitely better with less work.  So far i do like it better, and the cleaning chemicals are less expensive and last longer.  The head may be a bit large, but so far that hasn&#x27;t created a problem.</li>
    <li> Works as well as expected.  Best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from a fusion razor to this electric model. I debated for quite awhile if the high price was worth the plunge, but in the end I decided to purchase.  I had a Braun series 7 a couple of years ago and that was ok but the alcohol cleaning solution in the stand always irritated my skin. I have a thick beard and very sensitive skin so I have to be careful in what razor/shaver I use otherwise I&amp;#34;ll look like someone took sand paper to my face with all the razor burn that occurs. So far this shaver has been great, the cleaning stand does a good job, and the solution does not irritate my sensitive skin. The powerful motor also makes easy work of a couple days of growth. I have shaved both wet and dry and got a close shave from each. I did get a little more irritation after the first couple of dry shaves I did but according to Panasonic I need to give my face a couple of weeks to adjust. However, a wet shave is amazing with this unit. The results are almost as close as my fusion and I did not get any razor irritation even after the first shave. So far I have really enjoyed this product. The best part is the reduced irritation I have experienced even with shaving 5 days straight for work. I am glad I purchased this shaver and hope it last for several years to come.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a Panasonic 4 blade razor from a retail store in early February and was quite pleased with that model.  Then two weeks ago, it fell out of my bag when changing from a rental car to another...during one of our snowstorms!  Needless to say, though dismayed I wanted to urgently replace it.  After some further research, I decided to order the ES-LV81-K.  I just received the package several hours ago and all I can say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;!!!  This shaver does a remarkable job...even better than the 4 blade electric razor.  This model I&#x27;d say gives me about 95% of the results that I get with a razor blade (Fusion).  Thus I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the performance of this model.  I highly recommend to every man who desires a precise shave in a limited amount of time.</li>
    <li> I just received this shaver from Amazon.com. It arrived promptly and was packaged nicely so that it was easy to open. I have used it twice so far. The first shave was dry and did a superb job. With my previous electric, the Philips Norelco 1280x/42 (please see my review of this shaver), it took me seven or eight minutes to shave dry, needing to repeatedly go over areas and causing irritation. With the Panasonic, it shaved great, taking only about two minutes. The second shave with the Panasonic was wet. It was the best shave I ever got, blade or electric. I didn&#x27;t have to go over any areas on my face. It shaved in two minutes and was very comfortable; no irritation at all. If you have the money and want a great shave, I&#x27;d recommend splurging on the Panasonic Arc 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (10/22/2013):  The shaver is still great, but the cleaning base has clogged up. The instruction manual states that if this happens, use a toothpick or other sharp, thin object to unclog the drain. I tried this but it is still clogged, causing a watery mess. I called customer service and got some woman in the Philippines or somewhere who didn&#x27;t know what she was doing. She kept reading from the manual and putting me on hold. She finally told me to send it to McAllen, Texas. I told her I only had it less than six months and paid $340. I also told her that they should send me a new base and a postage-paid box to send them back the defective base. She insisted that I send it to them, even though I&#x27;d be without the charging and cleaning base. I told them never mind. I now would give 5 stars for the shaver itself, 1 star for the cleaning system, and 1 star (zero stars if I could) for customer service. For that exorbitant price, I expected better.</li>
    <li> best thing ever made, works great wet shave, dry kind of gives you the burn or itchy skin, worth the price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who hated shaving due to skin sensitivity. He would literally bleed every time after shaving with regular 4-blade razor. Thanks to many positive reviews, I decided to give this one a shot and we both happy I did. He has absolutely no reaction after shaving. No bleeding, no razor bumps. His skin looks and feels very smooth. Best shaver in the market!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! I had not used an elec shaver for over 30 years, they were hopeless. This is one is fantastic and has not caused any skin reaction at all, it&#x27;s easy to care for and works wet or dry. I use it on my head and face nearly every day. An excellent product.</li>
