      <li>Love chapstick.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I could buy three ChapSticks in one pack online.  </li>
      <li>I ordered on amazon because it was the best deal I could find on chapstick, I like that it comes 2 days later</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure he understood</li>
      <li>Lip balms worked a 100 times better than this product.</li>
      <li>I decided to circumnavigate the store one more time - this time looking at each item on the shelf and repeating the names under my breath.</li>
      <li>Love Original Chapstick!</li>
      <li>Nothing notable about the buyer experience, everything went smoothly.</li>
      <li>My lips made a sticky smacking sound that seemed to amuse him for a moment before he set out to help me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I received ChapStick Original, no mention of Sun Protection Factor...</li>
      <li>I love the classic ChapStick!</li>
      <li>Will continue to order if the price is right.</li>
      <li>Product is as expected, and one I already knew I liked.</li>
      <li>Keeps my lips soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time I have used this product and I am sure it will not be the last.</li>

      <li>It comes in a few flavors, but the regular flavor is great for me.  </li>
      <li>the same time I realized just how bizarre this might have seemed.</li>
      <li>I dont really see any benefit going with this chapstick over a competitor besides the price.</li>
      <li>Near the front counter two very large ladies with tall hats scanned the store until the saw me.</li>
      <li>They revamped it down to 44% petrolatum which gives lips a more \\&quot;lip-gloss\\</li>
      <li>Classic.</li>
      <li>Classic chapstick.  </li>
      <li>Classic Chapstick from the &#x27;70s and 80&#x27;s had 48% petrolatum in it.</li>
      <li>They spoke in a vaguely european accent but pronounced their P sounds with a BR sound so that Pink became Brink and Pretzels became Bretzels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Old fashioned Chapstick.</li>
      <li>They started barking orders loudly  before I could tell them that I was not a store employee.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t planned on stopping at this particular gas station, but the cool dry winter day had made my lips chapped and my throat dry.</li>
      <li>, I believe, go back to original/classic formula which actually provided better coverage and way less slippery feeling shiny lips.</li>
      <li>This gas station like many of the other stations, was well stocked with beverages and other sundry items, but the chap stick eluded me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The next few minutes happened very quickly and without any time to think.</li>
      <li>I did a brief run of the store looking quickly in the personal hygiene aisle but didn&#x27;t see anything that could remotely relieve my cracked and crusted lips.</li>

    <li> Keeps the lips from being chapped.  You probably already know everything you need to.  If you have chapped lips, apply to lips.</li>
    <li> This is what I expected.  I ordered on amazon because it was the best deal I could find on chapstick, I like that it comes 2 days later and I don&#x27;t have to leave my house.  Will continue to order if the price is right.</li>
    <li> I love the classic ChapStick! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> If you order SPF4, you should get SPF4!&lt;br /&gt;I explicitly looked for the feature SPF4 when I ordered this item.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received ChapStick Original, no mention of Sun Protection Factor...</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.  My husband goes through chap stick like water so these were great stocking stuffers.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Good value - so easy to buy from Amazon online!</li>
    <li> Love chapstick. I use it a lot. No complaints.</li>
    <li> adicted to this product</li>
    <li> The best things don&#x27;t change. Bought it for my mom who has been using it for years. I definately recommend.</li>
    <li> No matter how many times I applied the Chapstick my lips kept feeling dry. My wife later recommended that I use a lip balm.  Lip balms worked a 100 times better than this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this sometime ago and forgot to review. I like this chapstick, but I should have bought another flavor. I forgot I didn&#x27;t like this kind, but it did the job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this  product for years.  I love it. It comes in a few flavors, but the regular flavor is great for me.  The price is just what the doctor ordered. It coast double in the stores.  JUST DON&#x27;T ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY CALLED \\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;URUSH\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;they don&#x27;t care to get your order to you ASAP...</li>
    <li> Classic Chapstick from the &#x27;70s and 80&#x27;s had 48% petrolatum in it. They revamped it down to 44% petrolatum which gives lips a more \\&quot;lip-gloss\\&quot; look.  They did NOT, I believe, go back to original/classic formula which actually provided better coverage and way less slippery feeling shiny lips. Go back to the 48% petrolatum formula and then call it \\&quot;classic\\&quot; or whatever. I bought the product and I feel duped.</li>
    <li> Love Original Chapstick! Keeps my lips soft and smooth. I have a bad habit of picking at my bottom lip but Chapstick keeps it from cracking!</li>
    <li> Classic chapstick.  Helps keep your lips perky.</li>
    <li> while the product was exactly what i was looking for it came so late i did not know where the package was for so long</li>
    <li> Old fashioned Chapstick. No fancy colors or fragrances.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, and it was received before Christmas for the person.  I was happy about that.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is what it is, its chapstick and a necessity for the cold winter months.  I dont really see any benefit going with this chapstick over a competitor besides the price.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my son, he loves them.  They keep his lips moisturized but has no scent or taste. Classic.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that the packaging was excessive.  Otherwise, fine!</li>
    <li> Product is as expected, and one I already knew I liked. Nothing notable about the buyer experience, everything went smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I have used this product and I am sure it will not be the last. It helps chapped lips to heal in good time.</li>
    <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t planned on stopping at this particular gas station, but the cool dry winter day had made my lips chapped and my throat dry. This gas station like many of the other stations, was well stocked with beverages and other sundry items, but the chap stick eluded me. I did a brief run of the store looking quickly in the personal hygiene aisle but didn&#x27;t see anything that could remotely relieve my cracked and crusted lips. I decided to circumnavigate the store one more time - this time looking at each item on the shelf and repeating the names under my breath. The young man behind the counter watched me carefully reading the various names of potato chips and boxed crackers. As I made my way back around the chocolate bar/ gum row, he finally asked if he could help me find something. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to say and momentarily forgotten what i was looking for and I blurted out, &amp;#34;lips! - chapped&amp;#34; . I wasn&#x27;t sure he understood so I stuck out my lips in his direction and puckered. My lips made a sticky smacking sound that seemed to amuse him for a moment before he set out to help me. &amp;#34;Follow me&amp;#34;, he said and limped toward a door beside the ATM machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t noticed the limp before and wondered if this was a permanent thing or just some temporary injury from a weekend soccer play-match with his nephews. I thought that he must have nephews for some reason. It just seemed obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I walked through the door, i could smell the eucalyptus immediately but the hallway was empty save for another door at the far end. The store attendant was busy unlocking door number two under the flickering fluorescent light when I heard the front door chime loudly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next few minutes happened very quickly and without any time to think. Of course my immediate reaction was to go see who had entered the store. So I left the hallway and let the locked door close behind me. Near the front counter two very large ladies with tall hats scanned the store until the saw me. They started barking orders loudly  before I could tell them that I was not a store employee. They spoke in a vaguely european accent but pronounced their P sounds with a BR sound so that Pink became Brink and Pretzels became Bretzels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time I could hear Darren, the store employee banging on the inside of the door by the ATM. I found out later he had broken off the key in the lock trying to get back out. I also found out that his limp had been the result of relaxing in his work chair with his feet up under the counter. Sometime his leg would fall asleep and he&#x27;d have to limp around for a bit before the tingling sensation dissipated. The peculiar sounding ladies were nattering to themselves and filling the counter with boxes of chocolate bars. One of them started fumbling through her purse for her wallet and as she shuffled I noticed a gold and black tube of lipstick fall out onto the lotto ticket holder and roll toward me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t usually, take these things too seriously but this felt like a sign and my lips were in terrible shape, so without too much thinking, I picked up the lipstick, pulled off the cap and drew a big greasy bright red circle around my mouth. The relief was palpable and I smacked vigourously for maximum coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time I realized just how bizarre this might have seemed. So I ran out from behind the counter, out the door and onto the busy pedestrian sidewalk with my brand new face. Conspicuously moisturized.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I could buy three ChapSticks in one pack online.  Perfect solution to my lip balm needs.</li>
