      <li>AWESOME quality and VERY affordable.</li>
      <li>It is a nice eyeliner brush with no shedding at all</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I do like this brush for applying liner to the lower lashes as I find I can smudge it out quite nicely.</li>
      <li>Nice design.</li>
      <li>Putting on gel liner is so easy it cleans very easily just amazing!</li>
      <li>The brush is very easy to control.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best eyeliner brush..</li>
      <li>The tip is very fine, making it easier to line and glide it onto my lids.</li>
      <li>Very fine.</li>
      <li>I am learning how to use a brush like this to line my eyes since I have always used a liquid liner which already comes with a very very fine brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of real techniques products, this one is just as great as the rest of the brushes I have!</li>
      <li>They are a GREAT deal and I highly recommend!!</li>

      <li>Really nice and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and fine</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not that great  but perfect for a thick eyeliner  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok product</li>
      <li>I like this one better than the silicone one.</li>
      <li>But then I actually used it, and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad; I splurged on Bobbi Brown gel liner and was finally able to apply it.</li>
      <li>I love it for cream and gel liners.</li>
      <li>more versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The brush is ok.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t wonder if this brush is awesome, because it actually comes from &amp;#34;Real Technique Family&amp;#34; I love the way they work on my face to blur the imperfection.</li>

      <li>I love this liner brush.</li>
      <li>Its ok</li>

      <li>And I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I know there will be some people out there who absolutely love this brush, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>Until I find something better for my top lid, I&#x27;ll keep using my e.l.f. liner brushes.</li>
      <li>I think applying eyeliner is the most intricate part of makeup.</li>
      <li>Maybe they&#x27;ll soften with more use.</li>
      <li>I was in love.</li>
      <li>I love their brushes.</li>
      <li>just purchased two more for myself and one for my mother.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Also, you make a very fine line with the tip or just a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; fine line.</li>
      <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The design of the hairs is pretty awesome because its soft but not so much that the hairs bend, making it good precision.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Not quite as dense as I wanted the brush but regardless it still puts your eyeliner on great. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Very fine. I like it. Helps me dry a thin line with my gel liner like I like. But the bristles seen a little too stiff. But maybe that is because it&#x27;s still new. Maybe they&#x27;ll soften with more use.</li>
    <li> I am a  certified makeup artist and learned how to do a cat eye with an angled  brush.  it remained a  technique that I had difficulty mastering.  That is until I watched a Pixiwoo  video on YouTube and saw them using this brush.  That was the missing piece!  So much easier to control gel liner with this brush. I tend to take very good care of brushes,  but this one got frayed  very easily so that is why not 4  stars.  However I love the  Real  Techniques  brush line.  Good quality and so affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It works as well as those little mini dental swabs when wet (or dry) for applying powder eyeliner.  I&#x27;m really happy with the quality and size.</li>
    <li> It is possible to make a thin line, you just have to know how to manipulate the brush and dip it into your liner properly. I use it with a gel liner and it does its job. It does take practice.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day and have recommended it to every and anyone. Putting on gel liner is so easy it cleans very easily just amazing! I can&#x27;t live with out this brush!</li>
    <li> It is an excellent Eye Liner brush. Not too stiff, as most are.</li>
    <li> I love Sam Chapman&#x27;s line of brushes but this one falls in the \\&quot;meh\\&quot; category for me. The synthetic \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; are quite long for an eyeliner brush so it gets fairly floppy. And because of the length you also get some stray hairs. Its ok but I would not repurchase it if it got lost.</li>
    <li> I am learning how to use a brush like this to line my eyes since I have always used a liquid liner which already comes with a very very fine brush. This has been very tough learning process for me haha. Since I have other brushes by Real Techniques I decided to purchase this one as well and try it out. Umm..I dont know maybe I am doing something wrong but I am using this brush with a gel liner and when I apply product on it, the brush hairs sort of separate into two sections so you cant draw a straight line it because like a dual line. I have to use my fingers to stick the brush hairs together but they still separate. I will use the brush a few more times with different products and see if it does the same thing.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for</li>
    <li> I got the Real Techniques eye brush set, but the liner brush included with it was too large for my uses.  I like to use a fine brush for liner, and have the option to just build it if I want a larger line.  I find it easier, and more versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect! Well made, fine but still manageable and easy to use with my gel liner.  I cannot express how much I love this brush!</li>
    <li> This brush is just the right size and firmness for me. The price is very reasonable. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Not as fine a brush as I was hoping for. Some bristles stick out and are not all even and the brush is a little thick. For the super thin eyeliner look I wanted to achieve this is not the brush I would recommend. If you&#x27;re looking for a thicker line however, I think it would work just fine.</li>
    <li> Not as thin as I was hoping.  Good strong fibers though and puts on eyeliner great.  The bristles don&#x27;t bend or stick out or anything, so that&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love all of my Real Techniques brushes.. If you are thinking about ordering some, stop thinking and just do it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Gahhh...I waited for what I thought was forever for this brush. I love it!!! The brush makes eyeliner application fun and easy.</li>
    <li> Draws very accurate, bristles are soft but firm enough to make great winged eyes.&lt;br /&gt;You can go wrong with this brush</li>
    <li> This brush is not good for applying eyeliner or anything at all. It&#x27;s not stiff at all so it&#x27;s impossible to apply anything with it.. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it :/</li>
    <li> I think applying eyeliner is the most intricate part of makeup. This brush has made my life quite a bit easier. I get good precision, but at the same time not too thin of a line like other precision liners. The price is also great. I will recommend this to friends and should I need another lining brush, this is the one I will buy.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect eyeliner brush.. i have tryied a lot and this one is the best. so easy to use with gel liner</li>
    <li> Nice quality for a brush that is less than $10!  I&#x27;m a huge fan of real techniques products, this one is just as great as the rest of the brushes I have!</li>
    <li> A lovely little liner brush that does what it says at a cost that can&#x27;t be beat!  Does not shed.</li>
    <li> The hairs are nice and long for great wing application.  I use this with my Stila gel liner and it does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> Although it took a bit of practice and getting used to, I have perfected my eyeliner using this brush. It&#x27;s not too thin or too thick and I&#x27;ve never had any shedding or hairs straying off and sticking out of it after multiple cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can finally do my cat-eye quickly thanks to an awesome gel liner (the one by Clinique is the best and doesn&#x27;t dry out!) and this great, affordable little brush. Well done again Real Techniques!</li>
    <li> The brush is ok. The bristles are synthetic so if you are using a thicker gel eyeliner it&#x27;s hard to get a thin line.</li>
    <li> I love Real Techniques brushes.  Each time I make an Amazon purchase I throw one in my cart.  They are a GREAT deal and I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> i dont know why but the hair was not pointed enough which is not good for a fine liner brush!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a precise line. It&#x27;s an ok product</li>
    <li> I was a little wary based on reviews, and sure enough, when it arrived, the bristles did seem really long and a tiny bit irregular. But then I actually used it, and it worked perfectly. I&#x27;m so glad; I splurged on Bobbi Brown gel liner and was finally able to apply it.</li>
    <li> has no point. Is too  brusy.</li>
    <li> Bristles fell out the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This is sold as a fine liner brush.  When it arrived the bristles were already askew and not useable as a liner.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is Amazon&#x27;s problem, it is the seller and their care and packaging.  Sending it back</li>
    <li> Good quality fibers and well constructed. This brand has a nice weight and heft to the brush. Easily cleaned with water and a drop of shampoo. Brush fibers dry straight and don&#x27;t frizz. I&#x27;m a hairdresser, and for the money this brand is a good deal. Applies makeup well, easy care, and bacteria resistant. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating it 4 / 5 stars because I don&#x27;t use it as it was intended. Instead I think it&#x27;s perfect for spot concealing whether with creme concealer or mineral because of the firmness. Just start with a gentler hand and apply more pressure as needed, it&#x27;s pretty precise.</li>
    <li> Few bristles were not &amp;#34;within the group&amp;#34; so i had to cut them. The whole brush is of good quality but i had higher expectations not to at least cut rouge bristles.</li>
    <li> Real Techniques brushes are excellent value for money. They apply makeup beautifully and last a very long time. This brush keeps its shape pretty well as long as you store it properly.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush. I love it.</li>
    <li> I had already gotten the pixel-point eyeliner brush in the Real Techniques brush kit for eyes. However, I think the pixel-point brush is better suited for creating dramatic lines, as I found that it always created a very thick line. This brush, the fine liner brush, allows me to get really close to my lash line with a thin line for a more subtle, natural look. For that reason, I prefer the fine liner brush to the pixel-point brush. (I think this liner brush would also come in handy for a person who is drawing patterns on their eyelids which they will fill in later, either with this liner brush or the pixel-point brush.)</li>
    <li> Nice design. Comfortable and allows a smooth line. Very soft and the brush is light. Very easy to clean. Delivery was faster than expected as I live very far from US. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is a great liner brush for the price. I have no complaints. The tip is very fine, making it easier to line and glide it onto my lids. The bristles ae soft but stiff. Does a really good job!</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply bimatoprost (generic Latisse) to my upper lids.  Works perfectly for that.  I just make sure to thoroughly clean the brush w some baby shampoo and HOT water once a week or so. And BTW the bimatoprost has done a great job of growing my lashes.</li>
    <li> You can easily (with practice if you&#x27;re a newbie) achieve beautiful winged look with this brush. Use gel eyeliner or dark eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not good with the gel liner cat eye.  Watching Pixiwoo on YouTube and using this brush made it possible.  But this could be thinner.  They always use the Louise Young brush that is much finer than this brush.  So why isn&#x27;t their brush finer?  I like it but yeah, I&#x27;d get Louise Young if I could find it!</li>
    <li> has helped me perfect the cat eye look and other looks that require a steady hand. i use this with a pencil, just brush the pencil and apply. sometimes i&#x27;ll wet the brush for a more liquid look. great quality brush for the price!!!!!!!!! perfect for eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner brush is great! The brush is very easy to control. I can get just the right line for whatever look I want. The bristles are slim and form enough to provide stability but flexible enough for comfort. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I had bought Maybelline gel liner and the brush it came with made eyeliner application take annoyingly long.  This brush finally arrived and I used it for the first time today.  Eyeliner application was so quick and easy! I love it! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this brush! I definitely would recommend it for gel eyeliner application.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just have to be careful when washing it.  This is my second because I was a little too aggressive when I cleaned my first one and the bristles pushed back into the handle.... oops.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I like Real Techniques and have never been let down. I use this primarily for details, not just eyeliner, but it&#x27;s obviously great for that as well. I can blend the tiny crevices in my eyes and apply to small places. It&#x27;s nice and fine and I&#x27;m very impressed, especially for the small price I paid. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted these  for Christmas and so I bought them for her and she loves them! Great price too according to my wife! She swears by them!</li>
    <li> I love real techniques brushes abd own almost all they have put out. This brush is no exception. My only problem was that some of the bristles stuck out. I noticed this on the ones in the store too. Some of the brushes had nice tight bristles and some were frayed. I got a frayed one.  I like this one better than the silicone one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan and supporter of the Chapman girls and I will continue to be- I have many Real Techniques brushes and use every single one of them on a daily basis. AWESOME quality and VERY affordable. Can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes- great, great, great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t wonder if this brush is awesome, because it actually comes from &amp;#34;Real Technique Family&amp;#34; I love the way they work on my face to blur the imperfection. I Highly Recommend all of them.</li>
    <li> Makes the eyeliner look very precise and neat.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. An amazing product. The plastic packaging was difficult to open it. Once I got the brush out it was a little puffy, not what I would expect from a \\&quot;fine eye liner\\&quot;. Thankfully once I damped it with a drop of water it maintained its the shape I think it was supposes to have. Which btw, I&#x27;ve already used it a couple of times and it hasn&#x27;t lost the shape.    Style:  The style of the brush is very pretty. The brushes aren&#x27;t heavy and they don&#x27;t look cheap (considering the price you paid for them). Also each brush has the name of the brush (so no numbers/letters, yay!). In the package it has a good description of what the brush is designed for.    Using it:  As I mentioned before, I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times. And I love it. The hairs really get a hold on the eye shadow. Also, you make a very fine line with the tip or just a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; fine line. The design of the hairs is pretty awesome because its soft but not so much that the hairs bend, making it good precision.    Over all, its an amazing product. A must have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been watching pixiwoo on YouTube for a few years and this brush was not satisfying. The bristles aren&#x27;t stiff enough and the brush isn&#x27;t even pointed :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and this is the second Fine Liner Brush purchased. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! This brush makes applying gel eyeliner such an easy task. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it&#x27;s good to use again within 1-2 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
    <li> I love this liner brush. Really nice and easy to use. I make some nice eyeliners with this one. Happy that I bought this one.</li>
    <li> I was in the search of a brush like this for my gel eyeliner and for the price, this is great quality, size and work excellent! better than expected!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I was waiting from Real Techniques.  A very fine brush, easy to use and clean.  I love it for cream and gel liners.</li>
    <li> I love Real Techniques brushes.  The hairs don&#x27;t seem to fan out over time like cheaper  brushes and are easy to maintain.  This liner brush is perfect for what I use it for.</li>
    <li> It works so well with Bobbi Brown eyeliner gel. Precise application, you can go thin or bold, it won&#x27;t go wrong. Such a good make-up tool with a reasonable price, easy to use, even for beginners.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For the price, its a good eyeliner brush.  I also have sigma, mac, and smashbox eyeliners.  So for the price this is great....stiff and thin...does the job well</li>
    <li> Basically, if you a looking for a skinny eyeliner brush get this. It is so easy to use. I use it with my Bobbi Brown gel liner and it gives me the skinny liner look I have NEVER been able to get and the price is perfect! I have a travel size MAC one and I prefer this for thin liner looks.</li>
    <li> I havent had a chance to really use this liner brush but I own many other real techniques brushes and I am a big fan of the quality!</li>
    <li> Item came in fast and in good condition.  This is THE best eyeliner brush I ever tried and I am a beginner!!!</li>
    <li> Bristles too long and a little scratchy. I cut it down but still didn&#x27;t help. I returned it. Need to start over with this one!</li>
    <li> Amazing liner for gel eyeliners, i usually use this with my mac blacktrack to get the perfect cat eye! Very thin and amazing quality!</li>
    <li> Used for nail art and cleaning up polish around my cuticles.  Seems well-made.</li>
    <li> Super precision with this brush from real techniques&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;s great for eyeshadow details.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t wanna trade it for anything.</li>
    <li> not worth the money at all! you&#x27;ll never be able to apply a decent liner with it coz of its sparse hair.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I had bought two eye liner brushes before buying Real Techniques Fine Line Brush.  I thought will be hard for me using Real Techniques brush (so thin I thought) thats the reason I hand&#x27;t buy it from the  beginning, I really regret about it. The other brushes didnt work for me, I couldn&#x27;t manage to draw a thin line.  With Real Techniques brush I had no problem at all, I can have a thin or bold line, clean application. Love It !!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not that great  but perfect for a thick eyeliner  I couldn&#x27;t get  a perfect flick for my cat eye this really was annoying I had to use  a angled brush to correct it</li>
    <li> This is perfect for applying concealer! It is soft an non-irritating but is stiff enough to apply my concealer ever so lightly, allowing me to use a minimal amount of concealer for perfect coverage. Great quality and shipped to me 2 days before the expected date. I am ecstatic! Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, does the job. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I found this brush to be extremely thick and long for my style. If you like to do a perfectly well done wing eyeliner do not purchase this brush. It&#x27;s difficult to manage due to how long the bristles are and also how the tip of the brush is not pointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy high quality brushes for a low price and this brand is amazing!! I bought 2 sets and this eye liner brush and I&#x27;m absolutley in love with them. They are super soft and easy to clean. My makeup looks so much better when I use my new brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to draw the thinnest eyeliners ever but it absolutely didn&#x27;t work for me that way. It is a nice eyeliner brush with no shedding at all but it cannot draw thin lines and the brush itself is a bit fat actually.</li>
    <li> this is a very good quality brush for those who use either cake liner or cream liner.  i have used it with both, very succesfully!  good idea!</li>
    <li> used it twice so far and my eyes looked so clean and nice. plus I was able to play with the shape of the eyeliner too, which was fun to do. I like it on the upper part on the eye...under the eye I think I like using a different brush though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because I generally enjoy Real Techniques brushes. I wanted to try a new eyeliner brush that would give me an even thinner line than my angled liner brushes do. So, having a name like \\&quot;Fine Liner Brush\\&quot;, and with the price being so cheap, I had to try it. And even though I didn&#x27;t give this a gleaming five stars, I&#x27;d still recommend trying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I was pretty disappointed in this brush. Maybe it was just the brush I received, but I noticed a few stray bristles through the clear packaging. The bristles weren&#x27;t shedding by any means, there were just a few that were not in uniform to the rest of the bristles, which I knew was going to be a problem for eyeliner application. The brush was also thicker than I was expecting. Turns out, this is now one of the thickest eyeliner brushes I own. Even my e.l.f. angled liner brushes are thinner than this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not huge, but definitely not the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; brush I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bristles are long - in my opinion they are TOO long and don&#x27;t have any firmness to them at all. When you dip the brush into your eyeliner and apply it to the lid, the bristles kind of bend flat. What ends up happening is that the eyeliner has no choice but to be the width of the bristles and there is no firm control over how thin I want the liner to be. It is also, in my opinion, a terrible brush for winging liner for that reason. I need to have that firm, precise control for flicking the liner out and this brush doesn&#x27;t give it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like this brush for applying liner to the lower lashes as I find I can smudge it out quite nicely. I know there will be some people out there who absolutely love this brush, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. Maybe I just received a bad one, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m debating whether to return the brush or keep it as a lower-lash liner brush. Until I find something better for my top lid, I&#x27;ll keep using my e.l.f. liner brushes. Sorry guys, I was really hoping to love this brush given the experience I&#x27;ve had with some of their others.s, I was really hoping to love this brush given the experience I&#x27;ve had with some of their others.</li>
    <li> I had an old brush that I&#x27;d been given that was in sad shape. Found this and it is about 100x&#x27;s better than my old one. Very quick to get the liner on the brush and easy to apply. A bit challenging to get a really thin line but it can be done.</li>
    <li> I use this brush every day.  It holds and cleans well.  Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I have used different kind of EyeLiner brushes..from MAC, Sigma, and many other brands..this is by far the best eyeliner brush..My Holy Grail...</li>
    <li> I got this brush in the starter kit. I didnt expect to use it because so many people have said they had trouble with it. Well not the case with me! From the first time I used it I was in love. It put on liner quickly, evenly and with half the time that ususal (way more expensive) brushes would take. Do not hesitate to buy this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased two more for myself and one for my mother. obsessed with it!</li>
    <li> i did not like it so much , I prefer if they were thinner than this&lt;br /&gt;But not bad brush do it job .......</li>
    <li> It is nice and thin, but I would like it more if it was a little stiffer. I think the other brush similar to this one by Real Techniques may be better. I love their brushes. Good quality, cheap price!</li>
