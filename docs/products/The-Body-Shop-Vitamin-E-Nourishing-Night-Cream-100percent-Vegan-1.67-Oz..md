      <li>It feels really good on my skin and will be part of my nightly routine.</li>
      <li>This cream is a great price, lightly and well fragranced and really does leave my skin so much better every morning!</li>

      <li>I love this cream....</li>
      <li>it is ok,</li>
      <li>Love this stuff for night cream.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>me and jar lasts a while,making it a very good deal.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this cream works as good as a lot of other stuff that costs 3-4-5  times more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also too light to be night cream -- more like a day cream.</li>
      <li>So it is easy to put on and then put your face on the pillow.</li>
      <li>Light feel and light smell.</li>
      <li>my skin was smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Follow a full skin cleaning routine - wash, tone and moisturize 2x a day (morning and evening)    </li>
      <li>Some of the better creams will temporary fill in wrinkles or mask them by reflecting light or concealing,but most just moisturize, and moisturized skin always looks better and less wrinkly than dry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>can see how if you put too much on it can become too greasy and sticky, so I use very little of it ,and this way it works best for</li>
      <li>C creams make matters worth for me, in terms of visibility of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Body Shop cream is good moisturizer,it reminds me a lot of L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift+firming cream, except this one has less chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is so highly perfumed that it gave me contact dermatitis after the first use.</li>
      <li>I feel it really helps minimize my wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I have combination skin and felt like this cream doesnt absorb very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy but hydrates my skin really well overnight.</li>
      <li>This cream was fine at first, but after a few uses it really began to irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I live in the Las Vegas desert</li>
      <li>this winter in New England.</li>
      <li>This was a great disappointment.</li>
      <li>The old Body Shop Vitamin E night cream was heavier and unscented.</li>
      <li>I tried so many different night creams,both expensive and cheap, and came to conclusion-there is nothing that comes in a jar that is going to erase wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and this works well for me.</li>
      <li>I also break out frequently and this has drastically reduced the amount of break outs</li>
      <li>Cheaper than Body Shop directly and subscribing to this and receiving an additional discount now.</li>
      <li>No breakouts so far.  </li>
      <li>Not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have used this cream day and night for the last 5 weeks and my skin has not been this clear or smoother in quite some time.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do the trick on its own, so I am on the hunt for something else.</li>
      <li>It leaves a slight sheen when first applied but doesn&#x27;t &#x27;come off&#x27; or have the feeling it is glazing your face.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive dry combination skin and the moisture level felt alright, but something in it made it a misery to use.</li>

    <li> I have used this cream day and night for the last 5 weeks and my skin has not been this clear or smoother in quite some time.  I have combination skin and worried about breaking out. No breakouts so far.  Follow a full skin cleaning routine - wash, tone and moisturize 2x a day (morning and evening)    During the day I apply it before spf and makeup.  At night I apply it after washing.</li>
    <li> This was a great disappointment. The old Body Shop Vitamin E night cream was heavier and unscented. This is so highly perfumed that it gave me contact dermatitis after the first use. It&#x27;s also too light to be night cream -- more like a day cream. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Good product.  Cheaper than Body Shop directly and subscribing to this and receiving an additional discount now.</li>
    <li> it is ok, I did not see any problem with this yet . It just too small, smaller than what I think</li>
    <li> I use this under my eyes in the delicate tissue every night.  I feel it really helps minimize my wrinkles.  Very good product at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and felt like this cream doesnt absorb very well. After applying it on the previous night, I would wake up in the morning with my skin feeling heavy and greasy and i would feel compelled to immediately wash it off and save my pores from feeling clogged. Also smells powdery which i dont like.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for night cream. It&#x27;s not greasy but hydrates my skin really well overnight.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I had dry and flakey skin and within a couple of days my skin was smooth and hydrated. I also break out frequently and this has drastically reduced the amount of break outs I usually get while also something out bumps on my face that seemed like they would never go away. It is a pretty thick nightcream but I use it in the daytime as well because it&#x27;s not greasy and nothing I&#x27;ve tried can compare to this. Must try!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It feels really good on my skin and will be part of my nightly routine. I was thinking it was going to be a larger size when it arrived but I just had not paid close enough attention when I had initially placed the order. Item delivered on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for ages and to be able to buy it on amazon is even better and at a better price</li>
    <li> This cream was fine at first, but after a few uses it really began to irritate my skin. Made my whole face turn red and hurt, giving me small bumps all over (I almost never get acne). I have sensitive dry combination skin and the moisture level felt alright, but something in it made it a misery to use. I ended up throwing it out. Not recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is a great price, lightly and well fragranced and really does leave my skin so much better every morning! It leaves a slight sheen when first applied but doesn&#x27;t &#x27;come off&#x27; or have the feeling it is glazing your face. So it is easy to put on and then put your face on the pillow. I recommend it.</li>

    <li> This night cream is great. I&#x27;ve been using it during the day lately since it has been so so dry this winter in New England. It is thicker than the normal day wear creams from the same line, but definitely does NOT feel heavy and thick once its on my face. It absorbs well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated, never oily or weighed down. Would recommend. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts, and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> It is a creamy lotion (smells like baby lotion) but doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my 40-something skin.  I live in the Las Vegas desert so dry skin is a big problem.  I use this day and night in addition to two other moisturizers.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do the trick on its own, so I am on the hunt for something else.</li>
    <li> Everyone asks my secret for staying  looking so young (and they say &amp;#34;please don&#x27;t say diet and exercise&amp;#34; ha).  I love this cream....I wear it all day especially in the very dry winters!</li>
    <li> Light feel and light smell.</li>
    <li> I love this product. In the morning my skin is glowing!! I love the way it makes my skin look and feel!!! It&#x27;s great for the 40 + woman!!</li>
