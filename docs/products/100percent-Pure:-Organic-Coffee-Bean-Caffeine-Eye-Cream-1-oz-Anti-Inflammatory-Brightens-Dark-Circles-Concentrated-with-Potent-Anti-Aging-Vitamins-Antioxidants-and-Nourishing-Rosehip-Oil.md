<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For some reason this eye cream irritated my eyes with a burning sensation. It was so irritating, I was unable to continue using it.  The scent is vanilla like, but not in a pleasing way.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but although this stuff smells GREAT and feels wonderful, on your face, it does absolutely nothing!  And there were two of us trying it (agent 73 and agent 49) and we tried it every day, for a month!  Agent 49 only has a little puffiness going on but no dark circles, while agent 73 has both.  I suppose it would make a great lotion, if nothing else.  Sorry Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream, but you really get a BIG F-A-T  &#x27;0&#x27;  stars for not doing what you claimed you would do, for these two BEAUTIFUL agents!  ... on the hunt for better products, for women everywhere ...</li>
    <li> My husband uses this.  He used another cream which was not natural and non-organic.  This is much more effective!  Will get again.</li>
    <li> I should have read all the reviews and I didn&#x27;t.  I used consistantly for 3 weeks...morning and night and didn&#x27;t see any difference.  I did notice, as everyone said, the dispenser is a pain. One good thing it didn&#x27;t have any awful perfumy smell like some of those creams do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to getting this product with a pump dispenser tube but this time it was like a toothpaste tube. I use more I think when the tube is like this. I still kept it since I ran out of eye cream but if you rely on the pump for even dispensing I&#x27;d go to the actual store. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m gonna do next time.  4 stars because the picture is deceiving with the pump but you get it in a tube, but it&#x27;s still the same product.</li>
    <li> I put this cream under my eyes every morning! It smoothes out my wrinkles and my puffiness is gone. I love the smell also!</li>
    <li> Not knowing that I was trying a new eye cream, my Husband complimented me one afternoon by saying \\&quot;Hello Bright Eyes!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I cracked up laughing, he&#x27;s never said that in 23 years!  I do agree with him however, this eye cream not only smells heavenly, it truly decreases lines, wrinkles and invigorates my skin!  I even use it on the my smile \\&quot;lines\\&quot; :)</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used. All natural ingredients. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought and I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I WILL NEVER NOT HAVE THIS PRODUCT IN MY MAKE UP DRAWER...DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES AND DOES IT IN A DAY OR SO...LOVE IT, WILL CONTINUE TO BUY AND WILL LOOK INTO THE PRODUCT LINE FOR OTHER GEMS.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream for a whole year and it did not improve my under eye circles nor puffiness. The reason why i gave it a two star instead of one is because its prevented my under eye circles from getting darker than it already was and it also lasts a very long time. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This item feels greasy to me, and after applying it under my eyes in the morning, waiting about 15 minutes and then applying concealer, the concealer felt as if it would come right off. To me, this was more hassle for what it was worth. I had to reapply concealer several times a day. After seeing all these high reviews I figured i would go ahead and give it a try, but it does not work.</li>
    <li> Very ineffective. I didn&#x27;t see nay results with this product at all.  It had a strong smell that was not very pleasant and ligered.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, smells good, and makes my under eyes feel extremely hydrated/moisturized. Not sure if you aren&#x27;t supposed to use eye cream any where else, but I also use it on dry patches on my forehead.</li>
    <li> Added moisturizer on top of my eye serum....I have VERY dry skin. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE this eye cream. I never ever have under eye bags anymore. I use it morning and night. I seriously haven&#x27;t had puffy bags under my eyes since I started using this cream, even if I haven&#x27;t slept much. I also really love the smell. It&#x27;s divine! I&#x27;ve recommended this to several of my friends too.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s eco-friendly - no chemical preservatives, synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances...etc. I like the way it dispenses and it&#x27;s texture and thickness (not to thick not to thin). It works good for mild cases such as &#x27;sleepy eyes&#x27;... not sure how much it would help for more severe under-bag cases or dark circles since I don&#x27;t have a problem with either.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye cream.  I have seen a big improvements with my puffy eyes in the morning, it is a miracle worker.  Plus it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love it, use it on my entire face every night. Feels great, makes skin look and feel soft.</li>
    <li> love this product. traveled without ONCE ....never again... my eyes need this product and the caffeine. thank you will re order</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great product in terms of the ingredients. they really do have pure ingredients. the only downfall is that is makes you smell like a chocolate cherry frappuccino and it&#x27;s STRONG. i would much rather smell like frankincense, or lavender, or citrus, or some other classic essential oil than a Starbucks.</li>
    <li> I would suggest you not buy this product.  It totally burned my eyes.  As everyone know whatever you put on your skin, be it creams, oils, any makeup, it goes directly in to your system.  I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient caused the burning, but the company does not allow returns.  No matter what it does to you.  I have bought from a lot of companies that even return items after you have used the whole jar.  Stick with companies like VitaCost, Drvita, iHerb.  They are all reputable companies that will let you return anything that either is not effective, or causes an allergy reaction.  So please be careful, I write this only for the consumers sake.</li>
    <li> Do I look 10 years younger after using the product for a few weeks?  Not yet at least, but I have replaced my Salma Hayeck under eye cream with the 100% Pure Caffeine Eye Cream.to give it a fair trial.  What I do know is I&#x27;m not allergic to it, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, my makeup goes on smoothly over the absorbed cream.  I am being frugal with it as the other users said to so it&#x27;ll be awhile before the tub is finished.  I&#x27;ll come back and update my review if there has been any significant change,</li>
    <li> I find most eye creams aren&#x27;t rich enough, but this one IS. It smells heavenly but scent goes away and the ingredients are perfection. You get a lot for the price and a sanitary squeeze tube. Caffeine takes away morning eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;d stop short of saying this stuff is a miracle cream, it is moisturizing and it does decrease puffiness. I like the pleasant coffee smell, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last past application, so I was not bothered by it. My skin tends to break out easily, and this product didn&#x27;t give me any issues. I will probably buy it again. The reason I say probably is because there are a handful of comparable products in the same price range. Still in search of a cream that actually decreases lines, but maybe that&#x27;s not a realistic request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update***ran out of cream and purchased a different eye cream that I like...shortly after I realized I like this one better! I&#x27;ll be buying this again soon.</li>
    <li> seems to work well... lightens up darker areas and seems to de-puff pretty well. Has a strong, but pleasant smell of coffee (more like a latte), but dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> Great results for my puffiness under my eyes.  Eyes look more rested.</li>
    <li> I am loving this eye cream. My favorite is still Clinique, but I like to switch it up sometimes. It&#x27;s light weight and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few creams that do not cause breakouts. If you have sensitive skin, you will love it. It works great on puffy eyes, decreasing puffiness in a matter of minutes.</li>
    <li> It was expensive and didn&#x27;t seem to do a darned thing!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my dark circles for a month, and have not noticed any difference. However, that could be due to continued insomnia. It smells fabulous. I really love the coffee and other scents that blend together so nicely, and I will continue to use it just for the moisturizing effect. A tiny dab goes a long way. It never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> This product seems to have the right ingredients, however, it just does not work at all. It also has a bad ordor to it which is unpleasant.  Arrived in nice packaging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years. Really love it.</li>
    <li> I got a bad tube. I returned it. Smelled so rancid.</li>
    <li> 100% pure products are very nice and work great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for over two years.  I give it as a gift because it works so well!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream after a salesperson demonstrated a different, $300 eye cream on me where the primary ingredient was caffiene, and I noticed a visible result after one application.  Can&#x27;t spend $300 on a cream, so I looked for a caffiene eye cream and found this. It is very effective on puffiness- sometimes when I have sinus issues I get puffiness under one eye...this helps within 10 minutes, and seems to help with dark circles too. I have mild rosacea and some broken capillaries on my cheeks, I also put this on those trouble spots and it seems to (temporarily) diminish redness, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I love that it is organic, effective, and a reasonable price. I have repurchased many times, and would recommend to anyone, especially if you suffer from puffiness under the eyes, dark circles, or redness</li>
    <li> Pump did not work right out if the box. Not really a problem because the top can be removed.  I was hoping it would reduce the puffiness and redness under the eye but results were minimal.  I have been using the product for well over a month.  Ok as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Awesome eye crime!! Great for puffiness.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this stuff would actually work very well but I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a while now an  I&#x27;ve noticed amazing results. My eyes don&#x27;t look exhausted anymore the circles under my eyes have faded away significantly. I am now a huge follower of this company especially this product. I recommend it to everyone who happens to mention circles under their eyes</li>
    <li> I bought twice that&#x27;s how much I love it and a testimony to how great it works!!</li>
    <li> The Pure Caffeine Eye Cream - Organic Coffee Bean 1oz  is an expensive product that does not work. The previous reviews pointed out that the ingredients had changed. This could be why the product does not work. Plus, everyone will smell you a mile away. The coffee fragrance is extremely loud and strong and takes a long time to dissipate. Definitely would not recommend. The reason for 2 stars is the return policy. It&#x27;s better than the product itself.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say if this stuff works. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2 weeks now and don&#x27;t think I notice a difference, although it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s subtle. Regardless, this stuff smells AMAZING. The first time I put it on I wanted to rub it all over my face. Gross, I know, but it just smelled THAT good. Kind of like chocolate, but without the sweetness or stickiness (I generally don&#x27;t like products that smell like food). It also makes for a decent moisturizer, I think. I will continue using this, hoping it does something.</li>
    <li> this eye cream works great. I recommend it completely! It&#x27;s a third time I&#x27;m buying it and I love it</li>
    <li> I used it faithfully for more than 2 weeks but did not see any difference. Maybe I gave up too soon but based on the reviews, I was hoping to see some difference by then. Oh well!</li>
    <li> I keep horrible hours (I run my own business) so going to sleep at 4am is the norm and waking up with bags under your eyes worse than zombies from the walking dead is the norm for me. I noticed a dramatic difference withing 10-12 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is worth it b/c you use SO LITTLE for both eyes... It seems like this bottle can easily last 6-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything else under the sun (tea bags, cucumbers, cold compresses, etc..), but this really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I have found and I have tried a lot of them.  It really smoothes the wrinkles around my eyes and is very gentle. Heard about it from Dr. Oz..</li>
    <li> Awesome for puffiness, but doesn&#x27;t do too much about circles, which are my bigger issue. De-puffs like nobody&#x27;s business though.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream I have tried that takes away my dark circles.  Doesn&#x27;t help much for the puffiness, but definitely improves the appearance around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference so I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
    <li> I have loved this eye cream for years, but the last one I received from Amazon seemed to be a different formula.  It&#x27;s really clumpy and very hard to get out of the tube.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell and after a week I have yet to see improvment.......I will try longer to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I love this! It makes tired eyes open up and shout, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m awake.&amp;#34; Dark circles become non existent and eyes look as if you&#x27;ve been on a restful spa afternoon.  And those little lines around your eyes, you can barely make them out and you&#x27;re left with smooth, soft skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it wakes me up in the morning. It&#x27;s rejuvenating and good for you!! My eyes look tired because of kids and working but this is a very nice treat for myself, I love it!! I&#x27;m 40 I can vouch that it works!</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old and do not expect miracles. I am careful about my eye products as I have easily irritated eyes. I had noticed in the mornings the puffiness above my eyes. I only use this in the morning but put it around my eyes before make-up. Within a couple of hours the puffiness is gone and my eyes look more youthful. My only slight complaint is that it smells like buttered popcorn. I think it is unscented so that is just the smell the ingredients. It fades after a few minutes. I will repurchase it when it is gone. I expect it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using as directed, no change. I still have puffy eyes that look tired all the time. I am disappointed I was hoping for some improvement.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference!! Shipping was fast!!</li>
    <li> Nice cream but doesn&#x27;t reduce puffiness at all.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes but it is not greasy. No odor  and does not burn the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Make-up goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump bottle much better; the plastic tube pump does not function well.</li>
    <li> I think it is making my eyes brighter! I tried this product because I asked my dermatologist what&#x27;s the best thing to tighten your skin and she said Caffiene - it constricts your blood vessels. There you have it!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products to get rid of puffy eyes and nothing has worked..... until now! This product really works for me. I love the way it smells too! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing under eye wrinkles, which have actually lessened since I have been using this product.  They changed the packaging which I thought would be better, but actually harder to get out then the other packaging.</li>
    <li> Puffy eyes this is the item you most want in your must have item of any season.&lt;br /&gt;Great service and fast delivery.  Thank you much</li>
    <li> This product works well for me.  The skin around my eyes is thinning and shows puffiness more easily now as I am heading into my mid-40&#x27;s.  Not only does it smell great to me, but also makes the skin around my eyes look more refreshed and bright.  I like that the ingredients are natural too.</li>
    <li> Best &amp;#34;de-puffer&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve found.  No bad stuff on the ingredient list.  A real winner!</li>
    <li> Great product works almost instantly. Will be ordering again I cant believe the difference in my eyes less puffy if you get a chance try it.</li>
    <li> I love it...my dark circles was gone. Younger looking</li>
    <li> I am not seeing the results I had read about in a magazine. I was intrigued because it is a natural product, I probably will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> Not a huge improvement but definitely a good moisturizer.  If you&#x27;ve really got issues, don&#x27;t expect amazing results.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of problems in eye area at all- just trying to maintain what I have.  This is a good, light cream to use daily.</li>
    <li> I have had very expensive eye creams that did not work as well as this cream.  It really helps with puffiness and lines, but must be used on a regular basis.  Once in a while I will try another cream but always end up going back to this one since it reduces the puffiness really well.</li>
    <li> i recieved this item on sat, was totally excited to use it and see how it works. it goes on smooth, and it made my under &#x27;crepe&#x27; eyes smoother, looked less puffy and i am satisfied with this product. BUT...for me, i really dont like the coffee smell, its really strong and it made me nauseated. But this product does what is says....i hope this review helped. thank you</li>
    <li> Maybe this works for puffiness.. Im not sure.  My eyes aren&#x27;t really puffy, but I got it to reduce dark circles on my eyes.. and I been using it for a long time.. My bottle is almost finished and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference really in my eye area. If anyone has a product or concealer they recommend for dark circles around the eyes, I would love to hear it.</li>
    <li> Product was opened when I got it, not sealed like a lotion shoudl be. I don&#x27;t like my personal hygiene items used!</li>
    <li> I dont really notice a difference in my eyebags but this eye cream helps keep me moisturized and i love the caffeine smell.</li>
    <li> It works great but you have to give it 2-3 weeks to see results. The smell is not bad or offensive.</li>
    <li> I love this eye creme.  It smells great and I really think it reduces the swelling under my 50+ eyes.</li>
    <li> I Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after using this product. Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;All About Eyes&amp;#34; seems to work better than this product.</li>
    <li> Okay, but you get a tiny tiny little bottle for this price.  If I use it too often it breaks me out.  Nicely scented.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely eye cream--and I have extremely sensitive skin.  It absorbs quickly and you don&#x27;t even realize you have on eye cream.  This company produces quality products.</li>
    <li> This is the first really great and inexpensive under eye bags cream that has really made a difference!  I am 61 yrs.&#x27; old and am aging pretty well, but bags come with age and this cream makes some difference.  My upper eyes do not sag at all so no problem there .  But I highly recommend this &amp;#34;Baggage&amp;#34; cream ladies or men.  TY  Carol</li>
    <li> like most of us, when i wake up in the morning i look ... well ... tired. i put this on as soon as i wake up. about 1/2 hour later when i&#x27;m ready for makeup, i look so much better. this is my second time buying this product ... for me, that says a lot.</li>
    <li> It smells very good, feels light and penetrates quickly. I put it under my eyes on the morning and at night for a little over a week and haven&#x27;t see any major improvement on my dark circle nor puffiness. Maybe it needs more time to be effective. I like the ingredients so I hope I&#x27;ll see more improvements. I&#x27;m not sure yet if i&#x27;ll repurchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is the most gentle eye cream I have used, and gives a fresh feeling every&lt;br /&gt;time I put it on.  I also put a dab on creases around the mouth.  Then I put&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer on my face.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I have ever used. Does not irritate sensitive skin and plumps the eye almost instantly.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Love the ingredients and texture. Not sure if it actually reduces dark circles and puffiness but I don&#x27;t know what creme actually does. Totally worth the price for 1 oz which is twice what most eye cremes are. And, if you like chocolate, you will love the smell! Feels great and works under concealer.</li>
    <li> Wife has used this product for 4 years, with wrinkle softening results. If it didn&#x27;t do the job, she would not buy it. Took her trial of many products, before she found one that wouldn&#x27;t irritate her delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for something that made me look less tired by Friday.  This does work, I use morning and night and noticed a difference in about five days.  The big bags are gone, I look more refreshed and awake.  Of couse I use under conceler and foundation to get a really smooth look.</li>
    <li> Complete crap. This does absolutely nothing for eye puffiness. It feels nice and fresh when first applied to the skin, but ultimately does nothing for bags. Another product that found its way straight into the trash.</li>
    <li> This does leave my under eyes moisturized, but that is really all it does. I have been using this for 6 months not a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in brightness (I&#x27;m not a puffy eyed person as of now, knock on wood). I have began using [[ASIN:B0046HJ15S Hydraphase UV Eyes SPF 29 - La Roche Posay - Eye Care - 15ml/0.5oz]] and it gives me an instant brightening effect. If you are looking for a basic moisturizer Coffee Bean Caffeine Cream is a good option, but if you need something for fine lines and brightening I would continue the search.</li>
    <li> First,&lt;br /&gt;You only need half a pea size for both eyes.  I do not rub in, I have notice that if you use your middle finger and dab the eye cream in.  At first I used this day and night. I have notice that my under eye area is firmer, less discolored, not as puffy.  I now use this only in the morning and it has been my one and only eye cream that I keep coming back.</li>
    <li> This product has a very funny smell.  It seems to work with the puffiness but you have to get over the scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream for three years and just love it.  If I had a $1 for every eye product I&#x27;ve tried over the years, including expensive skin care lines, I could now retire.  From the most expensive to the cheapest, 100% Pure is the best for reducing eye puffiness and provides a more radiant appearance to the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the new packaging as well, having previously bought the glass bottles and smaller plastic tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at a good price!</li>
    <li> This product works great the container exceeds the previous one as the dispenser works great.  This product truly gets rid of the puffiness around the eyes and it last all day even under makeup. Hard to find and the best price is here.</li>
    <li> Best eye creme EVER for me....Gentle and does the trick for the eye area...Try it....you will love it....always have a tube also in gym bag.....</li>
    <li> I like all there products so far that I have tried. I really don&#x27;t see to much difference in my dark circles but really is anything going to help with that. I love the smell of this product though and it does not cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> Love the caffeine in the moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The cream blends easily, no tugging or pulling. It makes the skin around my eyes feel smoother and minimizes fine lines.</li>
    <li> This coffee bean eye cream was suppose to lessen the visabilty of under eye circles.  It did nothing.  Betty Windland</li>
    <li> I did not like this product at all. I really thought that it would be great but it did not help at all. I hope that after I have used it a little longer maybe I will be able to see a difference</li>
    <li> The only reason it&#x27;s getting a 4-star rating is due to the smell which is a little bit too strong for me to be able to give it a top rating, but other than that it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously used Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless eye cream but Pure Coffee Bean is much richer and helps smoothing out the fine lines way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I had a sample given to me and liked it so well I ordered it.  After reading reviews, I was concerned that the product had changed, based on some comments.  After contacting the company, I was assured it was the same product.  After receiving it, I believe it IS the same product - at least it has the same scent and feel, and does help reduce the morning puffiness I have.  In addition, the fact that it&#x27;s made of pure, organic ingredients makes me &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it instead of just &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite awhile. I saw it in a catalog. It&#x27;s the first step to my morning routine. My eyes respond, and don&#x27;t look puffy within minutes. It moisturizes well too, not oily.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!! Since I have sensitive skin I have bought several creams that makes my whole eye area red and break out into a rash. This cream seems to really work for me so I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This product has done an amazing job on firming and diminishing puffiness...it&#x27;s been hard finding products that actually work on my sensitive skin...I love the whole line!</li>
    <li> I did not see significant change but i see it is helping for the puffiness a little, I might see more result in weeks</li>
</ol>
