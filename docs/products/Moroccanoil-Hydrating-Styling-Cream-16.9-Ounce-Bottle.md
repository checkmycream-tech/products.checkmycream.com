<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> arrived more quickly than expected and as described</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair soft and smooth without leaving an oily or greasy feel (even when you use a little too much).</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have thin hair so not all products work for me.  This hydrates/adds shine without weighing dowm my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is on the expensive side.  But it works really well with my hair...and I only need to use a little of it even though I have long hair.  Plus, it smells great!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have fine hair and the smallest amount provides me with lift and body in my hair wihout weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Cons:I was not at all impressed with this product. It was expensive and not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The service was great and they shipped it out right away.</li>
    <li> Bigger bottle for less then what they sell it for in a beauty supply. I love this stuff. I put it in my hair and just let it dry by itself and my hair has more volume and is more soft. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love all the Moroccanoil products.  This helps so much with fly away hair, dryness, just makes your hair feel good!!!</li>
    <li> Works OK but not as good as less expensive drug store products in controling my hair. I have thick, shoulder-length frizzy hair.  This product almost makes my hair too soft, even when I use it in small amounts.  With Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream, I have to run the flat iron over the same segment several times to get my hair straight.  On the plus side, my hair seems healthier when I use it.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very greasy, which also made the skin around my hairline oily.  Product didn&#x27;t seem to do much to hold my curl.  This product did smell very pretty and make my hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product.  I love how it hydrates my hair  and leavs me with smooth, frizz free hair!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that tends to become frizzy on hot and humid days.  I live by the ocean so it&#x27;s frizzy most of the time until now......I have to tell you....this styling cream is amazing!  I was afraid it would be too heavy and weigh my hair down but it just softens it, de-frizzes it and creates a beautiful smooth look. The smell is pure heaven, too! I highly, highly recommend this....worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I love the moroccanoil hydrating styling cream. It works great with the moroccanoil oil treatment. Use both together to create smooth shiny hair. Been using for several years and have tried many products over the years. This one is the best for dry damaged colored hair.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Not a miracle worker but helps with shine and controlling frizz.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I tried the Moroccanoil Styling Cream at my hair saloon and I love it. It leaves a very smooth touch to your hair and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I have curly hair and this product helps controlling frizz. I want to compliment amazon.com for the excellent customer service. I placed my order on Friday night and Monday morning I had my package delivered at my work. Unfortunately the bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed very well and the cream spilled all over the box. I called the customer service and the associate immediately offered me to send another product without any charges. That was awesome. I am very happy with my purchase and the great customer service offered by amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the seller sold me a bottle that was listed as new and 1/4 of the product was already used.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Heard great things about Moroccan Oil and they are accurate.  Bought for my husband who has abundant short course hair that needed some softening and styling at the same time. He loves it and won&#x27;t even share with me!  I use it anyway and it is very nice for my long staight hair too, to get rid of the flyaways and tangles. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  The cream isn&#x27;t as thick as other styling products.  If you have dull, lifeless hair (from too much flat ironing), this is the product for you.  It makes my hair look healthy and shiny. I bought this product along with the Moroccanoil Oil.  They go great together and won&#x27;t make your hair greasy. I have long thick hair (past my shoulders) and I only use about a nickel size of the cream and a dime size of the oil after I shower.  Hope this review helps you out!</li>
    <li> I am a 54 year old woman and have thinning dry hair at the ends. I overwork my hair with blow drying, and heat styling. This hydrating cream has made a hug difference in the way my hair feels and looks. It smells good too. You only need a small amount of product. I thought it would weigh my hair down as most oil type products do but this gave it more bounce and what really amazed me is that I didn&#x27;t need to use any volumizer to get the lift. My hair however is about shoulder length. A little leaked out of the bottle during shipping but I would defintely reorder again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Works wonderfully on color treated or damaged hair.  I use it every day when styling my hair and it&#x27;s made a difference!</li>
    <li> Best for longer hair.</li>
    <li> I really didnt care much for the Moroccanoil shampoo and the conditioner and the oil, i returned that and at the last minute decided to try that styling aid cream leave in, WEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLL, I LOOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEEEE IT!!!!! My hair looked better when I rewet it and use this styling cream leave in, my hair was manageable and softer feeling, I am gonna stick with this styling cream Its fantastic !!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product especially for those with thick, curly hair.  I have been using it for a couple of years and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This product is not the real thing. The actual real product is a miracle worker on curly hair it is a creamy texture not a white, watery, and very fragrant &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;....Not returnable as well.</li>
    <li> I order Moroccanoil a few time. I like it. I very happy to buy from this  seller. Very fast delivery. Always can connect with seller.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this a fair try, so I used it several times before writing a review. The first clue was that the package return address was from a media company. The second giveaway: the scent. I adore the scent of the real thing. The scent on this is different. It&#x27;s not unpleasant - a little like the original, but more like a man&#x27;s cologne smell. The proof is in the results, though. And my results were just terrible. I have fine, wavy, below shoulder length hair that I blow dry straight. With the original, I use one pump and my hair is smooth and conditioned after blow drying, with a great scent that stays in my hair. After several uses of this, my hair was frizzy and dry each time. No smoothing or conditioning results at all, and the scent disappeared completely after drying. I read all the reviews before I purchased this, and saw that many thought it was a fake. But I was also surprised to find that some reviewers found the legitimate one I purchased a few years ago to be a fake: http://www.amazon.com/MoroccanOil-Hydrating-Styling-10-2-Ounce-Bottle/dp/B002CMLS50/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1438450747&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;morrocanoil+styling+cream . I had wonderful results with that one, but decided to give this one a try because the ingredients were the same, and the price was good. Turns out it was, in fact, too good to be true!</li>
    <li> This is not the real product! Hair not smooth or shinny. Actually drier and stiff! Foreign label on bottle. Took 2weeks to get and pump broken. Seller did give 5 bucks credit, but product not worth buying!</li>
    <li> My hairdesser used this styling cream on my hair last time I went in for a cut and color and I could not believe how incredibly soft and shiney it made my hair right after having it colored.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> My hair was getting very dry and unmanageable.With Moroccan oil, my hair is easier to style and shiny.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky and it smells great. I have ombre highlights, which damaged the ends. This stuff makes the dry areas feel like my naturally soft hair. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> Works well in my fine hair and leave a really nice scent</li>
    <li> I love these products! Not only do they smell great, but it truly works wonders for your hair. It arrived when specified and in good packaging.</li>
    <li> The only product that actually makes my curly hair stay curly without getting frizzy</li>
    <li> I get very nervous when I&#x27;m getting to the end of my bottle. It&#x27;s well worth the priec. Hair feels soft and looks shiny.</li>
    <li> do not like the new smell ... is the different smell not the original make ?</li>
    <li> Wonderful product; have used it for several years. Light, hydrating and wonderfully scented (clean, not cloying perfume) and great for blow drying.</li>
    <li> great for very curly dry hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Hair is frizz free, soft, curls nicely by skrunking, &amp; smells great. Fast delivery  &amp; price was best one I could find, very reasonable compared to other sites.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been a poofy, frizzy, mess!  Now my hair is soft and shiny!  It works wonders with a straightening iron!  It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it.  I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> co-worker rec. this for my hair, leaves hair sleek and dries faster.  Not a good product for me, but daughter uses it on her longer, straight hair.  She absolutely loves it and her hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair smooth and silky without the heaviness of other products. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot, so this bottle will last me almost 4 months and I have medium length, color treated hair. Added bonus---IT SMELLS WONDERFUL! my hairdresser suggested I put a bit in at bedtime to give an extra treatment to my ends...works wonders!!!!</li>
    <li> A friend introduced this hair cream to me years ago and I have been using it since. It does not weight your hair down nor make it greasy---just adds moisture. Since I color my hair, this product greatly helps with &amp;#34;the dry look&amp;#34; that I don&#x27;t have anymore.</li>
    <li> it makes my hair soft!</li>
    <li> The vender sent wrong product much later than they said it had shipped. I ordered the 16.9 oz and received the 10.2 oz with no return receipt or receipt.  I have tried several unsucessful times to contact vender with no response-they have no valid phone #.  Not happy and will NEVER purchase from them or recommend them!  Queen Bee supply in my opinion is not a reputable site.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product.  I have tried tons of different ones.  If you want your hair to be shiny, smooth, easy to style, then this is for you.  I even keep one on hand so I never run out.  I will not use any other syle cream on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product - great delivery</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells great and leaves my hair shiney and manageable without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Great for people with so much hair as I have, and cheaper than buying the 10oz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about two years and love it!  Unfortunately, my latest delivery seems &amp;quot;watered down&amp;quot;. It&#x27;s usually thick and butter-yellow. This last bottle is almost runny and looks like a pastel yellow mucous. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s different, but it&#x27;s definitely NOT an improvement.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome price.</li>
    <li> Seems to be the same product so far as I can tell by touch and smell...package is different with an unfamiliar language imprinted on it...will Never order from here again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all! I get this all the time and it smells wonderful! Decided to buy from here 1 time and my last time. Smells like hair dye chemical fumes in my hair and makes it oily! Also noticed... It&#x27;s not official!</li>
    <li> Normally I swear by Moroccan oil and use it regularly. This time the product didn&#x27;t smell right or feel like the Moroccan oil I buy. I have never purchased from this vender and don&#x27;t plan to use in the future.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived with a broken cap and nozzle, essentially rendering it unusable, unless I find a  bottle myself. I like the product from Morrocon Oil a lot, but terrible shipping protection.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a great deal but, being a long time customer of Moroccanoil, I had gotten an imitation of the product.  Neither the smell nor the results were that of the original product.  Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I alway order this styling cream and after reading the reviews on Amazon (1&amp;2 reviews) decided to order it anyway. It had a very good smell, same quality product. It is nice to have a 16.9 oz bottle so I do not have to replace it in few months.</li>
    <li> my curls pop with the scent of exotic lands</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does a beautiful job of taming my dry ends and fly-aways without being heavy or greasy!</li>
    <li> This cream seems like it has gotten thinned out . I have ordered it before and I remember it being much thicker in consistency.</li>
    <li> Best of the best . I have used this product for years and I absolutely love it .</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the oz. i just remember when i opened my package, i was like surprised by what a big bottle i got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love my 500ml bottle! I need to get more soon! i&#x27;m running out!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell.  Never greasy.  Leaves hair silky and manageable.  Would definitely refer to a friend.  I am getting my daughter the whole set for her birthday.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! If this item is being sold by SR Cosmetics, it is an imitation product shipping from Israel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I thought I&#x27;d try and find the product I love using from my hairdresser at a lower cost. Big mistake! This took 3 WEEKS to get to me and is a strange pick color (the stuff from my hair salon is a white cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product in it&#x27;s true form from the real Moroccan Oil is a miracle worker on my naturally curly and thick hair. It&#x27;s never to heavy or greasy and prevents the dreaded frizz-poof. What showed up in the mail, however, is a complete disappointment...</li>
    <li> Costly, though the lowest-price we could find. My wife swears by it; says nothing works as well at keeping hair in place while adding sheen.</li>
    <li> This is nothing but a scam imitation product.  Which scares me because I expected that Amazon would protect its customers from fraudsters like these.  I am now very wary of buying things online now as you never know what you are getting.  It could just be this specific seller because I have bought the real product before.  This one was not as thick and the strong fragrance of Morroconoil that I love was not there.  What made me even more suspicious was what appeared to be Chinese (can&#x27;t be sure but some weird characters that is not English, French, Spanish or other language using normal characters, some Asian type characters) writing on the bottle.  Amazon should do more to protect consumers, tell customers what they are getting and let them decide, especially when you are selling both the authentic product as well as imitation ones.  Should really have been zero stars....do I now throw away my money or risk ruining my hair?</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff on my hair for several years. It works very well- it leaves me hair very smooth and shiny. I also recommend the oil as well as the hair mask. It&#x27;s pricey but don&#x27;t worry- u only use a little bit at a time. I have long hair; one of these will last me at least a year .</li>
    <li> Contains isopropyl alcohol- which contradicts its purpose as a hair moisturizer. I have thick, dark, wavy/coarse hair, and this product only made it dry out and frizz more.</li>
    <li> Way too much fragrance... smells extremely strongly, and not very pleasant either. After using about a pea-sized drop of the stuff it&#x27;s like you soaked your hair in perfume, which is explained by the fact that perfume is the 4th ingredient in the cream (out of about 20 total). For comparison, another similar hair product I&#x27;ve used (which I thought smelled fairly strongly, before using this stuff) had perfume as the 14th ingredient (also out of 20).</li>
    <li> I use this product to blow out my curly hair straight. It works great and it creates a a salon finish to your hair. It moisturizes your hair and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Great product. OK pricing</li>
    <li> I love this product for my very curly hair!</li>
    <li> My damn bone dry, color treated, fine hair needs extra moisturizing in the leave-in conditioning cream.  Just 2.5 squirts of the pump, and a work down the shaft to the ends. A hair stylist explained to me that Moroccanoil is one of the best products on the market because it penetrates the matrix of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might add also that this is an awesome deal for both the item and it&#x27;s larger size, as I have paid more at retail for the 10.2oz size.</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  worth the price.  works great on hair.  can be used for dry or wet hair.  will buy more.</li>
