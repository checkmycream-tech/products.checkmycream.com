<li> Now I have resorted to using this product, letting it dry, and using BondAid for a second coat - then applying the acrylic.</li>
<li> I have dry cuticles so making them drier</li>
<li> I have used this for the last three fill-manicures and it is holding longer than the acetic acid type primers I&#x27;d used previously.  </li>
<li> so you can get into the crevices and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> It works just like any other primer.</li>
<li> Other primers usually burn and sting as soon as it touches your nail</li>
<li> not sure this is working with the other products i have like the asp powder i got from sally&#x27;s or the SASSI purple liquid i got to bond the acrylic powder.</li>
<li> Seller provides crazy fast shipping.</li>
<li> I was having trouble getting the shellac to stay before I used this.</li>
<li> I had trouble with the Shellac peeling off after a week or so.</li>
<li> This was the missing link to the process.</li>
<li> Its not a Strong Primer.</li>
<li> The smell isnt horrible like most nail products.</li>
<li> not good ...</li>
<li> no good.</li>
<li> but i think it maybe from the fake nails i got to start with the glue.</li>
<li> This stuff is crap.  </li>

    <li> It works just like any other primer. I doesn&#x27;t burn! Other primers usually burn and sting as soon as it touches your nail THIS ONE DOESN&#x27;T!! Awesome right?!. Seller provides crazy fast shipping. The applicator brush is really tiny so you can get into the crevices and a little goes a long way. One dip of the brush covers 5 nails. All primers come in nail polish sized bottles so don&#x27;t let the size fool you, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I&#x27;m using in conjunction with the liquid and powder (retention) of this brand, which are applied over this product.  I noticed that it reacted like the dehydrating products that some people use for better adhesion and disinfecting.  Smell wasn&#x27;t as strong as it usually is, so that&#x27;s great for me.  I got the product pretty fast, but there was a mix up with the powder, so I had to wait longer to get it and try it.</li>
    <li> Gel polish didn&#x27;t hold long till I treated my nails with this first</li>
    <li> This stuff is crap.  Nails lift very easily and should not after 2 applications.  I have used cheaper stuff that worked a lot better.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I had trouble with the Shellac peeling off after a week or so. I used this primer after prep and I am thoroughly impressed. The Shellac stays on two weeks with no peeling or chips. This was the missing link to the process. Super fast shipping and this is now a must have item. I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> This product along with the CND Scrub Fresh Nail Surface Sanitizer allows for salon quality results. I was having trouble getting the shellac to stay before I used this.</li>
    <li> not sure this is working with the other products i have like the asp powder i got from sally&#x27;s or the SASSI purple liquid i got to bond the acrylic powder. the nails are okay for a few days then they just pop off. but i think it maybe from the fake nails i got to start with the glue. im going to try changing that glue first. this product is neutral for me till i figure out whats causing them to pop off.</li>
    <li> not good ...it does not work</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful primer.  I have used this for the last three fill-manicures and it is holding longer than the acetic acid type primers I&#x27;d used previously.  It smells better, too.</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected and is great for doing acrylics. I love the kind of brush that it has. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Just stick the acid primer, I did my nails about two weeks ago and use this primer. No lie, immediately after I finished I could see the lift. This week I started using Ez-flow primer which has acid but it works, it works works :) I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in conjunction with my CND Enhancement Retention Liquid Powder Starter Pack.  The retention powder is already designed to minimize lifting, but my nails are pretty bendy and I tend to get a lot of lifting.  I&#x27;m self-learning to do my own acrylics and am on my second refill so far.  So far, so good,  Went on easily and I believe my lifting problems will be mitigated nicely by this product once I&#x27;m better at applying the acrylic</li>
    <li> Its not a Strong Primer. My nails always lift with this Primer after a Week.. I buy a nail primer with acid and maybe my nails will not lift....</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my acrylic nails lifting. I bought this product to go along with the CND Solar Nails Radical system. It&#x27;s not as strong as I need it to be - lifting is still a problem. Now I have resorted to using this product, letting it dry, and using BondAid for a second coat - then applying the acrylic. So far the combination is working well.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this primer as its not so harsh on cuticles.I have dry cuticles so making them drier&lt;br /&gt;is no good. This product doesn&#x27;t affect me nagatively.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time the other night. It worked great and didn&#x27;t burn at all.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful primer would suggest to anyone to purchase this product.  The service was excellent, and the conditon of the packasge was great.</li>
    <li> I use 2 applications of primer before adding the sculpturing. This is a very good primer. So far, have had no lifting. Also, doesn&#x27;t burn like some primers... very gentle.</li>
    <li> came pretty quick. The smell isnt horrible like most nail products. it seems to work better than the last kind I was using</li>
    <li> Nice! Does not life. Great brand.</li>
