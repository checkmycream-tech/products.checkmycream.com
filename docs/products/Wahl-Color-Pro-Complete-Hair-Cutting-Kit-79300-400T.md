<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased this in Mar&#x27;13 (~3 months ago) and it just stopped working. We used this for facial hair only, and now - nothing. I suggest getting something else...</li>
    <li> Heavy-duty easy to use clippers. Payed for its self with one haircut!</li>
    <li> Noisy, as most clippers are, but for $16 on sale it&#x27;s an unbeatable value.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I love it!</li>
    <li> I just cut my own hair with it haha.  Worked as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit messy or clusterful with all the different sizes.  Not sure what can be done about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is the attachable pieces, not the trimmer itself.  It is plastic and can easily be bent or broken if not careful.  But since the price is really good, still worth it.  I haven&#x27;t checked, but hopefully they sell replacements</li>
    <li> Needs very little maintenance, going very strong.</li>
    <li> So far so good, bought it to replace some broken &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; clippers, haven&#x27;t had it long, but you can feel a big weight difference from these and the cheap counterparts, will see if it holds up better over time. The color coded guards make it easy to find what you need without looking to closely. The case is also pretty nice, especially for the price point it was sold at.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for $16ish dollars as a clipper for our young children.  The 400 looks tough and like it is built to last, using it was pretty simple.  However, the clipper size is a little big for smaller children.  While the price and quality can&#x27;t be beat--something smaller would of been more appropriate for a small child.</li>
    <li> The product works well but I was frustrated that the storage case and one of the clips arrived broken.</li>
    <li> Works great and saves me so much money! No longer have to take my boys to get their hair buzzed. I love the colored coded attachments. Makes it so easy!</li>
    <li> It works really good.  Very reasonable price.  One piece was missing and I called the company and they sent it.</li>
    <li> Looks to be a solidly built razor. I really like the numbered and color coded attachments it comes with. I&#x27;m happy with it so far,  but have yet to use it. Definitely pleased with the price compared to similar models in the stores.</li>
    <li> Works really well, good value</li>
    <li> My wife loves the colored clipper guards. Quality seems great. We&#x27;ve had two clippers before this. The first was some cheap thing that didn&#x27;t have much power. The second was a different Wahl brand that we weren&#x27;t faithful with oiling the clipper head and it rusted. Plenty of power in this thing though. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: plenty of power, colored guards are helpful, seems to be great quality, nice hair cutting guide inside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none that I can think of</li>
    <li> Very pleased arrived quickly too</li>
    <li> Worth it for the price. I used it to give my husband a hair cut with the number two set. I think he liked his cut better than his barber who had 30+ years experience. So this device is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like someone mentioned the plastic doesn&#x27;t look very durable but it is okay because I don&#x27;t plan to give frequent hair-cuts/trims to my husband. Once in month usage should still make it last enough years to be able to justify the price.</li>
    <li> Will totally do the work!</li>
    <li> Lots of accessories come with and it works great. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use these every week and love them.  I have saved a ton of money by cutting my own hair at home.</li>
    <li> Rapido Exelente lo recomiendo desde Venezuela . Sastifecho</li>
    <li> Outstanding for the price. As long as your keep the blade oiled, you are gold :)</li>
    <li> Only used once so far but very impressed.  Love the color coding of the combs.  Comes with scissors, oil, and regular comb as well as the attachments.  Pretty quiet operation.  Gave a set as a wedding gift as well.</li>
    <li> it works well. I just think that is little heavy.</li>
    <li> fast delivery. good product, I have to learn to use it - I made a disaster of my hair but this is me not the product - so good order.</li>
    <li> Got what we paid for.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a cheap, powerful, dependable clipper to use when I cut my own hair, and, even though I&#x27;ve only used it once, I&#x27;m impressed with this set so far. I was surprised by how bulky and heavy it felt when I first picked it up, but I don&#x27;t think this is a bad thing, it makes the clippers feel more high quality. That said, if you have small hands or are looking for something with a small form factor, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included booklets about how to use the color-coded clipper guards to get different looks are nice, but I didn&#x27;t really need those. I usually just put on the smallest guard (in this case 1/8&amp;#34;) and buzz my whole head. I have very thick hair so I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems in the past with clippers getting bogged down, but these sheared my entire head completely effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re big, sure, but they&#x27;re also very powerful and I can see the color coded sizes being very useful to people looking to give themselves more complex cuts. If you&#x27;re like me and you just buzz your entire head, they work wonders for that too.</li>
    <li> Really nice clipper set. Surprisingly high quality for the price. It&#x27;s also much quieter than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Replaced my fifteen year old one that still works but isn&#x27;t very sharp now.  It&#x27;s a great trimmer and unfortunately, I forgot how sharp they are when new and nicked my husband&#x27;s ear!  It&#x27;s great that you can get such a reliable product for such a reasonable price.  If I have a complaint it is that both my new one and the one it replaced came in cases that didn&#x27;t stay latched.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks and feels really solid and comes with lots of extras.</li>
    <li> Yup, cuts my hair. Replaces a very old one I had. Have saved many thousands of dollars doing my own hair, and I end up with a better hair cut than I sometimes got at &amp;#34;salons&amp;#34;. Plus at my convenience, not theirs. Gave it 5 stars because it works as designed and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded what I expected. This item is better than any I have seen in stores that cost more.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Works well</li>
    <li> Good quality affordable Price perfect</li>
    <li> Works great, brand new, and great price.</li>
    <li> Great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product! Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy my own clippers and save money on going to the hair salon. These clippers are just perfect and the color coding makes it all the more easier to use. Great job Wahl!</li>
    <li> I just purchased the product and used it once. I am not sure if is sharp enough, I need to look if&lt;br /&gt;any adjustments need to be made prior next use.</li>
    <li> Put her to use within days of receiving it and it was so simple and clean. Looking forward to using this every time, and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I bought a pair from Wal-Mart for the same price that was absolutely garbage- this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This is a very good haircutting tool.  It is easy to use and works as advertised</li>
    <li> A great and dependable tool from a company that you can trust.  I got this kit for a great price and have been happy with it.  I use this in both my professional and personal life and can attest to it&#x27;s durability and make.  Perfect for homemakers, Cosmetology students, and hair professionals alike.</li>
    <li> has very large voice, if turn volume down it doesn&#x27;t work, if up works but is too noisy. also their isn&#x27;t enough information about product, for example can&#x27;t find information about watts, so i had to buy other device to convert watt rate</li>
    <li> Very good piece of hairdressing</li>
    <li> I had what I feel was a similar unit for almost 7 years.I replaced it with this and it barely cuts hair.Blades are very dull.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly and have saved me so much money on haircuts.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
    <li> These Wahl trimmers are a great purchase, especially at such a low price! Comes with your basic clip on tips. Good quality you would expect from Wahl</li>
    <li> Its a great beard trimmer.  Doesn&#x27;t get too dirty, runs like a top.  Great price.  Only complaint is a lack of 1.5 size clipping comb, and that it what I get for buying hair trimmers for my beard.</li>
    <li> Not bad, good price. but not so convenient since you have to replace new XX to adjust the length</li>
    <li> Perfect little starter kit that every man should keep around the house. Easily understandable attachments allow you to get the perfect trim without all the BS. You aren&#x27;t going to get a hundred dollar haircut out of this, but you&#x27;re going to save yourself a hundred $15 haircuts. Paid for itself within a month or two, would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Great quality and great price.</li>
    <li> This came in a great carrying case.  It is so packed full of pieces and it was such a good price!</li>
    <li> easy to use and to clean work fine for now.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair the day that I got them and it would well. Nice even cuts , and came with plenty of pieces for as variety of lengths. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to save money on haircuts.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, works great... thanks</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and they work great!</li>
    <li> Awesome kit! My kids hair is so easy to do now!!!</li>
    <li> GREAT BUY. IF YOU ARE RESEARCHING THIS ITEM AS I WAS. I CAN SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE AND TELL YOU TO JUST BUY THIS ONE.  WE ARE VERY PLEASED.  YOU WILL NEVER BEAT THIS PRICE EITHER.</li>
    <li> Very useful, efficient and easy to use. We are very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the quality of the product. It has more attachments than I need but I&#x27;m sure others will find them useful.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it only twice but it performs well and I think it is very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for a long time. First one lasted a couple of decades before cordset created an open. We viewed it a better value to get a new one than replace the cordset, the difference being less than $10. Huge savings realized using this product over many, many years.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son since his hair grows so quick.  It works very well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Best clippers for the price.Comes with everything you need for a quality haircut.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic - reliable and versatile for less than the price of a single cut (even at Supercuts). I&#x27;ve had it for a year and a half with no issue, and I&#x27;ve used almost all of the lengths at different times.</li>
    <li> All the things and areas I clip look great. Great product.</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair at the age of 19, and I never had good hair to begin with. I damaged my hair from washing it every day as a high-schooler and a boy/man doesn&#x27;t have to when its a crew cut - even after a work out.  I probably could&#x27;ve went once a week! No one ever warned me.  No one sat me down and told me &amp;#34;hey, you&#x27;re italian, once you hit 16 you&#x27;re going to lose your boy-next-door appeal and look hairy, unwashed, and homeless.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided around 24 to start cutting my own hair, saving 100-ish dollars a year.  I was using a beard trimmer with decent success, until I found this as a &amp;#34;daily deal&amp;#34; on amazon, for $25, and decided it was within reason, until I&#x27;ve seen it at two other dept stores for the same price.  Anyway it works as expected, and I like it.  But spoiler alert, you must get some trimmer oil because it needs lubing by the second time you use it.</li>
    <li> 100% Grade A Chinese piece of s***. Made of the thinnest plastic possible, for profits sake of course. The attachments are just as s****, a few will be broken almost immediately due to being made of paper thing plastic. Works fantastic for about a week. If you have kids or a rowdy household, I recommend NOT buying this, it has the built quality of a porcelain doll. As with other reviewers, drop this thing in the sink from 6 inches away is enough to make this thing explode into dozens of plastic bits. Very easy to do, as this is a hefty set of trimmers with substantial weight to it. Had to use tweezers to get the splinters of plastic out of my hand after only a drop of six inches. The five star reviews come from people who have either used it once and wrote a review, work for the company selling this trash, or are just dumb consumers who refuse to know any different.  I had it for three months and I might as well have gotten a single haircut at great s****, i mean clips.</li>
    <li> excellent. exactly what I was looking for at a fair price, fast service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this every 3 weeks for over 2 years now, and it still works great.  It&#x27;s reasonably well made for the price (seriously, what would you expect for under $20).  If you&#x27;re clumsy and have a tendency of dropping or breaking everything you have, you might want a heavier duty model, but I&#x27;ve been more than happy with the amount of money and time I have saved cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I was skeptical at first at how long it would last.  And, it took some getting used to cutting my hair with mirrors.  After a few times, however, I got the hang of it.  Even though I originally purchased it to save money after I lost my job, I still use it today because it&#x27;s just so convenient and many hair stylists aren&#x27;t even as good at doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;ve now probably used it close to 40 times, which means I&#x27;ve saved about $600 at $15/haircut.  Even if it died tomorrow, it&#x27;s more than paid for itself and I would be quick to buy this model again.</li>
    <li> Works great, no issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say...I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a decade now...and I&#x27;ve never had it easier than using this set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it out and lay out the guides and start...and just a few minutes I am done.  The ear guides (left and right) and the eyebrow guide...all the hair guides...simple and quick and I can&#x27;t see how anyone couldn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good except for a little noisy.</li>
    <li> Infinitely better than the Remington haircutter that, fresh out of the box, felt like it was yanking hair out of my scalp.  This Wahl haircutter seems to be self-sharpening, never snags or yanks.  The color coded hair-length combs are very helpful - but you may want to write down which color comb to use on your top, sides, back, etc.  It helps that my wife is good at this; no haircutting kit can overcome a klutzy barber.</li>
    <li> Have cut my hair about 10 times with these and they do a nice job and hold up well. They paid for themselves in the first haircut</li>
    <li> The Wahl clipper was bought to replace a rechargeable unit made by another manufacturer. This corded unit is easy to handle, and gets as close as I want and ........ is a WHOLE lot easier to clean cut hair from. Oh yeah it was cheaper than the other unit as well so I could kick myself for not getting the Wahl earlier. Ah, live and learn my parents used to tell me. Love the quality and Amazon service as always has been superb; getting it to me quickly and in good shape. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!!!! I buy cheap clippers every year or two for my poodle mix. Yes, I know these aren&#x27;t pet clippers, but other cheapo brands have had no trouble cutting his hair- We just throw them out after they&#x27;ve dulled... Anyway.. He is small and is a very good sport about having his mom cut his hair. I&#x27;m not sure that will still hold true after today&#x27;s clipping with our new wahl  colored coded nightmare clippers.  Why? Because:&lt;br /&gt;1. These really are WAY.TOO.LOUD. Poor little guy was freaked out from the start.  He has never reacted like that.&lt;br /&gt;2. Followed directions- but horrible cut from the first try on. Pulled his hair constantly. Uneven, patchy fur. Couldn&#x27;t handle much hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. Plastic guides are crap. Some hair cut short, some looks uncut.&lt;br /&gt;4. I thought my hand might have permanent damage from the extreme vibration. At times I felt I couldn&#x27;t hold it right.&lt;br /&gt;5. Then- I really couldn&#x27;t hold it- it got SO hot it burned my fingers. Really, that hot to the touch. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.... Probably because just doing my dog&#x27;s back ( we&#x27;re talking less than a human head of hair) took almost an hour.  To do a thorough clipping of his fur would probably have taken over 2 hours. I didn&#x27;t want to subject him to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would never use this on a human, especially not a child prone to strong fears. And I would never ever use this on my poor pup again.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Easy to use and do a great job both on hair and beards.</li>
    <li> Best clippers my husband has ever had, and he&#x27;s gone through many! He clips his hair/face every 2-3 days, so even with the excessive use, the quality is outstanding</li>
    <li> My last pair of clippers died a few months ago and after reading reviews I picked these up. They are just as most people say so far, strong and reliable. The only thing I would count against them is that they are a little bit loud, but for the price you can&#x27;t expect everything.</li>
    <li> As a struggling college student -- I don&#x27;t have the funds to dish out $17 every few weekends to get my haircut. I used to use a pair of cheap $15 norelco clippers to cut my hair, but after the 3rd use, the safety broke on it -- and the battery would die half way into a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are phenomenal and worth every cent. The motor is really strong and the clippers are sharp enough so it doesn&#x27;t feel like someone is ripping your hair out.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Especially for the price. I dont think there is a better clipper. My wife cuts my hair with these, and does a great job. I don&#x27;t know why they use color codes, as they still have the numbers on the pieces which we rely on.</li>
    <li> not happy with this product, it makes some unusual noise, also shakes too much. my previous one lasted 4+ yeas. I would return the product but that will coast me another $5/6 dollar and I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;m going get a better one.</li>
    <li> nice hair cutter,it is worth to buy.</li>
    <li> Great price and works great</li>
    <li> I tried Li Ion battery powered devices and it doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard... or should I say my thick, curly hair. This thing does the trick - glad I went back to Wahl, been using them for over a decade now for my hair and beard. I like having a battery powered one for a backup, but this is my go-to.</li>
    <li> It works but I would go with a cordless one (I thought this one was one), but it works fine. The cord isn&#x27;t very long, and its too hard trimming your balls standing next to a wall socket. LPT!</li>
    <li> A terrible noise and vibration, machine Rejection</li>
    <li> Hi,  I didn&#x27;t get a haircut for over 2 months.  I wanted to trim my hair myself so rummaged around the house and found one of those &amp;#34;Just-A-Trim&amp;#34; things, but unfortunately, I had no fresh AAA batteries.  Due to the reasonable price, favorable reviews, and high ratings, I went ahead and ordered this Wahl kit from Amazon and it arrived in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I glanced the instructions then stuck on the longest clipper comb - #8.  HOLY MOLY - I literally cut OFF square INCHES of hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I tried the RIGHT side tapering tool, and then the LEFT tapering tool.  Not too bad, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND doing this until you get a bit more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used the #7, and #6, clippers to shorten the back, and clear off some loose ends.  The final result is of course not professional salon quality, however it does result in a reasonably good SELF haircut!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper allows you to SAVE $20 per haircut, and going months without even getting a haircut, so it essentially PAYS FOR ITSELF AFTER ONLY ONE USE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get REALLY GOOD at doing it yourself, or your girlfriend learns how to use it on you, you can literally save $1000s over a lifetime in haircuts!</li>
    <li> I needed a beard trimmer, so instead of dropping $50 on some fancy Remington, I picked this up. It&#x27;s solid, seems like it&#x27;ll last forever, and easy to use. I wish it was a little easier to fit it and the guides back into the case, but what are you gonna do?</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers to use on my pets.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, the clipper itself looks good, but the cut quality is fair at best (on animal fur, remember).&lt;br /&gt;The hair gets jammed in the plastic guides, the motor is just too slow, the clipper is heavy, and the blade heats up very quickly, all of which make this a poor choice for use on pets.</li>
    <li> these hair cutters are heavy and 1 would think its a sturdy product but its not. I cut the back of my sisters hair and now there is a small crack in the side.Her hair is well maintained so for the clippers to crack means its just cheaply made</li>
    <li> These are very good clippers, especially for the price. I only wish they would cut a little closer. The closest I can get is about the length of 1 1/2 day&#x27;s growth, so instead of buzzing every 5 days (as with my old Wahl clippers), I have to buzz every 4 days. Otherwise, everything else is great.</li>
    <li> Good buzzer, same as the unicolored one</li>
    <li> These clippers work great! Has all the attachmnents most people will need. The only thing it didn&#x27;t come with was a cape. The case it comes with could have been a bit bigger to put everything back into. I would still reccordmend buying as it seems to be a quality product for this price range.And the price was under $25.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, satisfactory service clothing. THX!</li>
    <li> I would recommend these clippers to anyone, they cut great and not pricey at all !!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these clippers.  Bought to cut husband&#x27;s hair and save money!  This is such a deal for the quality!</li>
    <li> This thing is powerful, it will cut through any hair.  It comes with many attachments for the different sizes. I would recommend this to everyone.  Without any attachments it will get pretty short, but definitely not bald.</li>
    <li> My husband used to spend $10/wk for a haircut. But now, I can cut his hair in 20 minutes at home for free. This product has paid for itself over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea how to cut his hair so I just watched youtube videos on how to cut men&#x27;s hair and now I use this haircutter every week! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great devise for the price</li>
    <li> Easy to grip, quite and the unit trims a beard perfectly and with little effort.</li>
    <li> It got the job done and was easy to use,  but it didn&#x27;t seem very sharp. Quite a few stray long hairs left behind. It was easy to change guard sizes and a good pair of clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> These are much quieter than my last pair, and they cut even better! I don&#x27;t know how they got a more powerful motor to sound quieter, but I&#x27;m not complaining. The color coded sizes are a nice feature.</li>
    <li> My last hair clipper was a very cheap model, and this clipper was on sale, so I decided it was time for an upgrade.  The clipper seems solidly built and performs well.  The guide combs seem more brittle than other guide combs I have used, and one of the teeth arrived broken on the red guide comb (1/8&amp;#34;, No. 1).  It&#x27;s not one I use a lot, so I&#x27;m not really concerned about it.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and feel very sturdy and well built. Feel like a quality product, especially for the low cost.  Cut great but do order some blade oil with them.</li>
    <li> Only used once but worked well.  Love the options of clipper guards.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I just choose to try this product and it&#x27;s amazing and I turned to love it.&lt;br /&gt;Already have recommended it to a brother, who also need it. I like every piece of it&#x27;s function.</li>
    <li> So far so good, but my history with Wahl is not promising but there are no other brands to buy.  I go through these machine every 6 months that&#x27;s how long they last without making a terrible noise.  The company&#x27;s customer service is atrocious. They can care less about helping you.</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it for.  Quality product.</li>
    <li> They work just fine.  Can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad one but I tried cutting&lt;br /&gt;my kid&#x27;s hair and he screamed in pain!&lt;br /&gt;The thing was grabbing hair but not cutting it!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my beard and it was pulling the hair.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are too dull. I tried cleaning and oiling the blades but&lt;br /&gt;no dice. If there&#x27;s something else I could try to get the darn thing to cut&lt;br /&gt;please let me know. I give this -1 Star. I&#x27;m thinking of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK I&#x27;m adding this to my review....&lt;br /&gt;Initially I tried cleaning and oiling the blades but never took them apart.&lt;br /&gt;I unscrewed the blades, cleaned and oiled them and reset them the way they should&#x27;ve came and&lt;br /&gt;the razor works perfectly now. I guess they became loose or got off kilter during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m changing my rating to 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Have used once, worked EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Does a good job. The wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> So many attachments, works great, husband loves it</li>
    <li> great price for a great name brand! easy to teach my husband how to cut my son&#x27;s hair so we aren&#x27;t running to the barber every couple of weeks</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers to shave my head, I&#x27;m now bald. Mission accomplished!</li>
    <li> i love this made in USA high quality trimmer for the money.  it is almost too heavy but you can tell it is quality</li>
    <li> All I really need this thing to do is work, so my expectations were set low.  I&#x27;ve used many clippers over the years and they are simple machines that really don&#x27;t need to do a lot...I will say that I liked the color coded clipper attachments (less worry about accidentally putting on the wrong attachment and cutting hair too short!!!) which is why I went to 4 stars from just three and I think the only way I would give any set of clippers 5 stars would be if they cleaned themselves....Otherwise, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and it serves it&#x27;s purpose, but it is hard to get overly excited about clippers...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very useful and easy</li>
    <li> My husband cuts his own hair with this and says that it is better than his old one.  He can&#x27;t think of a single thing that he would change about it.</li>
    <li> Had a $20 kit before I bought this one that took forever to trim my husband&#x27;s hair! Gave us a lot of grief. This cuts hair like butter, it&#x27;s so smooth &amp; easy to use! When cutting around the ears or sideburns, read the instructions for help! This is so far the BEST kit I&#x27;ve gotten yet &amp; was so inexpensive! I&#x27;m definitely getting my money&#x27;s worth &amp; my husband is loving his haircuts! It cuts very well first time through (unlike other cheap trimmers where you have to continuously go through your hair several times to ensure you cut all the stragglers). LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This was my first hair cutting kit,and I admit I bought it with very little research beforehand, so I&#x27;m quite lucky that I chose such a good model. It has lots of options and comes with detailed instructions on how to use it. First time using it was easy and took only a little effort to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is perhaps the loud sound, but unless your cutting your hair in the middle of the night while your room mate is asleep, that&#x27;s not really an issue. It&#x27;s really a great product!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably reliable for the price. a seriously smart buy.</li>
    <li> A good complete set. Works very well.</li>
    <li> used 3 times already and looks pretty good</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these for a few months and love it so far.  Plus it&#x27;s a great price for what I got.</li>
    <li> I had no idea it was so easy to cut my own hair, and that reliable clippers with all the attachments I need are so cheap. This is a steal</li>
    <li> It worked great! Love it.....</li>
    <li> This is a heavy, clunky product. It seems old fashioned. I think it&#x27;s probably suitable for what it&#x27;s designed for. It just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> this saves me money when I dont hafe to take both my sons to get there hair cut.  I love the attachments for it and It is in great condition.</li>
    <li> Great clippers at a great price. Well made in the U.S.A, the kit contains all the blade attachments that you&#x27;ll need - to save yourself money and cut hair on your own at home.</li>
    <li> I use this product at least once a week, to either trim my beard or for a haircut or both.  It has lots of attachments for various hair lengths and they all work just as they should.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is heavy duty! Great clippers! Works very well and the price was unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Works great no problems cutting hair.  May need to oil it now and then.</li>
    <li> Bought these clippers for home haircuts and I am more than happy with my purchase. I was using another set of inexpensive clippers I bought on clearance at a local discount store and these were well worth the additional money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anybody with similar needs.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair with this for a few months now and I have had no problem with it thus far. Great price too</li>
    <li> Very bad it just worked for 5 mins and stopped working...</li>
    <li> It is not expensive. It cut through my thick hair with no issues. The colored cutting length attachments makes it quicker. No need to search for the pieces for the proper length.</li>
    <li> My husband used this product to shave the sides of his hair and it worked fine. Not too long after that he tried to shave my son&#x27;s hair and it wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. Very disappointed. We just had to order a new one.</li>
    <li> its too noisy to use!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the support mail but never got an answer.&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Seems to be sharp enough and has plenty of &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; to attach for various hair lengths.  Works fine for us.</li>
    <li> Got these for my dog... I just recieved them they cut good... Havent had them long enough yet to say anything bad about them... Good buy..</li>
    <li> Good price and it works great.  I had a Wahl for about 15 years, when it died I bought a cheap con-air that lasted 2 years and never worked great.  Going back to wahl.</li>
    <li> The blades are easy to distinguish the hair cut length you will get. The blades are a bit difficult to snap on, but this is most liekly because it is brand new.&lt;br /&gt;I found this device very user friendly and comfortable to use, not too heavy or bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the kit included the scissors to blend the hair length sections and to do a more unique cut/trim in the end.</li>
    <li> I was looking for combs for my old Sears trimmer and stumbled upon this.  Great purchase.  I used the 1\\&quot; comb on myself and scaled down for the sides and a #6 on my son&#x27;s buzz cut.  He loved his haircut and a few weeks later we did it again with a #4.  Paid haircuts avoided to date &#x3D; $36.  Future haircuts paid for... priceless.  Great value and a great tool.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I like the added sizes. The guide is helpful for a mom who doesn&#x27;t know a thing about these contraptions :)</li>
    <li> I do haircuts at home and mostly needed this for trimming up the sides and back of my head.  It does pretty well for that.  The numerous guards combined with the adjustable length lever allows you to get pretty much any length you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with several additional tapered guards for getting around the ears, which is nice, but they&#x27;re a little tricky to use.  Our first pass over my ears resulted in cutting it way too short, so you sort of have to be careful with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is not great, as its just an open compartment that everything rattles around freely in.  Getting everything back in is a pain, and trying to open it without spilling stuff everyone is always a challenge.</li>
    <li> $20.... frankly it would still be a bargain at twice the price. It is simply that good. It is easy to handle, the shape fits your hand well in any position. It cuts a neck line clean the first time which makes maintaining symmetry easy. Overall very well thought out and you quickly remember the specific attachment needed purely by its color. It&#x27;s exceptionally durable. I have dropped it without cosmetic or mechanical damage. Everybody wants to save money and here is a rare opportunity to realize savings that make the price a genuine bargain. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. Its much quieter than the Wahl I had before and cuts my hair close and smoother too. It heats up a little during use which I can&#x27;t recall if my previous Wahl did. However I am very satisfied with it and actually could give it five stars but I am not that kind of person.</li>
    <li> Perfect fot those times between grooming.</li>
    <li> It works fine. Usually lasts me a year or so and then starts acting up and need to buy a new one. If you want one to last, spend close to $100 on a quality one. This one is a throw away but will work fine. Does what it needs to, just isn&#x27;t going to last forever.</li>
    <li> Nothing cheap about this. Very sturdy and quality clipper. Lots of accessories and a great carrying case. Great instructions and cutting guide. Fairly long electric cord. highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. While less expensive than other models, this provide barber shop quality at an affordable price. Goodbye weak, battery operated trimmers. This thing is a work horse and will serve me well.</li>
    <li> Excellent for a beginner...</li>
    <li> It is a little stong and not suitable for baby</li>
    <li> LOVE this clipper set.  Has many sized combs to get just the cut you need</li>
    <li> Works great on my 3 year old.</li>
    <li> All is good with these.  My boyfriend has only used them once, but says they are of good quality.  You cannot beat the price on them for everything you get with this package.  The high reviews are what made me purchase these.  They feel and act like a quality piece of machinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the haircut on my boyfriend and so they are easy to use if you are the one operating them.  And most guys can guide you through what to do.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy these again.  I will update in the future after they have been used more.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and well made.  The attachments come in different colors so it is easy to remember the one you used last time.</li>
    <li> very nice... good quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used once, and was very impressed!  I think it will be a great addition for me!!  Thanks!  Easy to use too!</li>
    <li> Very bad product I bought one and it is too noisy and when you try to screw down the power to reduce the noise it won&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
    <li> [...]. Based on the reviews I read on Amazon, I took a chance and purchased Wahl Color Pro instead. Besides the color guides (which are great), the instructional manual is very helpful although basic. Unfortunately, it caterers more to \\&quot;caucasian\\&quot; haircutting techniques. Additionally, the other negative factor I have about this set is that, the \\&quot;outlining\\&quot; (or taping/trimming) capability of these clippers are poor as it pertains to \\&quot;Black\\&quot; OR \\&quot;African-American\\&quot; hair texture and length. Fortunately, I found a few tutorials on YouTube [...]. One tutorial shows you how to make regular clippers - RAZOR SHARP for trimming and taping Black hair. After adjusting my clippers according to the tutorial, I am very satisified with them. Additionally, THE CLIPPERS ARE NOT NOISY AT ALL. They sounds just like regular ones. I am glad I purchased this kit and I haven&#x27;t regretted it yet.</li>
    <li> These Clippers are awesome!  They are not loud, don&#x27;t hurt the person&#x27;s head or your hand!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. AAAAAAAAAA++++++++++++</li>
    <li> Pays for itself in two uses. Good case.</li>
    <li> bought this for my father-in-law and he said that he got about 3 good haircuts and then he felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything at all.</li>
    <li> Works great with all the extra accessories you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Nice clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> These clippers are so nice!  I cannot believe the deal I got purchasing them on Amazon this year.  They were very easy to use, and I have no experience with clippers whatsoever.  They come with great instructions and the color coding on the guards is FANTASTIC.  I&#x27;m really happy with these.</li>
    <li> The best hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. The attachments are easy to use and clean, comes with scissors and two combs as well. After using this I will have a hard time using other brands which seemed to die out fairly fast or hurt to use from how low-power they were.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work outside the shores of America (i:e 110V.). Was hoping it&#x27;ll support 220V. Details such as this should be clearly stated in the product description</li>
    <li> Broke and won&#x27;t turn back on after 2 uses! I want a replacement!</li>
    <li> I tried all the other, more expensive haircutting kits on Amazon and they have all either broken or failed to cut well. This one for $18 is the best one.</li>
    <li> So quiet and easy to use</li>
    <li> Love it, easy to use.  I never cut hair before and it looks like a prof. job.  Comes with easy to use instructions.  It paid for itself in the first use.</li>
    <li> Nice set.  Easy to use and quiet.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They cut my son hair so good. The price is so great.</li>
    <li> Time was, I spent $15-20 plus tip on a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am an individual who &amp;#34;suffers&amp;#34; from male pattern baldness (I guess I wouldn&#x27;t say I truly suffer, but let&#x27;s move on...), I was paying $20-25 per month for 15 minutes of someone using clippers to remove what was left of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I purchased this bad boy. For the cost of a single haircut, I now get a cut and a beard trim, in the comfort of my own home, whenever I want. It&#x27;s quick, painless, easy, and the many attachments give me plenty of options if I want to get fancy (I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan. You will be, too!</li>
    <li> these clippers are great and they are still cutting like the first day i got them 5-6 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;i never had a pair of clippers last this long.  usually the motor gives out or there&#x27;s an issue with the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve dropped this thing on the blades hard a few times and it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no beautician but I can cut three of my boys hair and it looks great. The manual that comes with it is very informative. It paid for it self the first time I used it, saved money on haircuts!</li>
    <li> Good inexpensive electric clipper.</li>
    <li> Not the best spend a little more and get a better clipper</li>
    <li> Easy to use and quite powerful for home clippers.</li>
    <li> Love all the color coded attachments. This is quite heavy duty and clearly designed for serious work. Quite happy with it!</li>
    <li> Wahl trimmers are great- it makes literally no sense for me to go to a stylist when these trimmers cost less than a single cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I should comment on the build quality- this clipper is built like a tank. It&#x27;s heavy in your hands. The motor sounds like a small lawnmower. Because it is corded, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery weakening and dying. I am repurchasing after 2 years, only because I lost my old one when I moved. Other than that, I can&#x27;t imagine this clipper breaking or malfunctioning for want of build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also nice little touches- the carrying case and color-coded hair trimming guides, for instance. The color-codes are fool-proof, and the carrying case keeps the whole thing organized. The price for this clipper is just nuts- I have no idea how Wahl turns a profit. In short, this is an easy decision if you&#x27;re thinking about cutting your own hair (particularly if you want a simple haircut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small note- invest in a stylist&#x27;s apron to catch the hair. It will mess up your clothes otherwise!</li>
    <li> Sould have bought this years ago when I first started losing my hair. Works great . Already save alot of money. No more barbers for me.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  I loved all the attachments that come with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I got it home without problems and on time. Everything is as it appears in the publication. Good job.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for touch-ups between trips to the barbershop.  The clipper works great with the different length-controlling attachments and is fairly quiet.  Wish I had got one of these earlier.  Scissors too small for my fingers, but everything else is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added:  Does a great job on a buzz or crew cut.  Quick and gives you a very even cut.</li>
    <li> I have several of the beard trimmers from Wahl.  but this one is so much more substantial and easier to use.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these clippers. I use these on my husband and son and they get a great haircut every time. Good quality and easy to use. We&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars using them.</li>
    <li> If you are on a tight budget and are looking for a haircutting kit, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Wahl trimmer and I absolutely love it.  I cut my own hair and I had been a Phillips user myself but needed a new trimmer as the Phillip&#x27;s battery died and kept on pulling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I hold the trimmer in the hand it is a bit heavy.  That&#x27;s the only reason I give it 4 stars.  It is heavy in comparison to other trimmers and could be fatiguing for some if you use it for a moderate time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is a little heavy, the Wahl is cutting through my hair like butter.  Haven&#x27;t had the clipper pull my hair once yet and it does the job quite nicely.  If you are looking for a trimmer that gives you the most bang for your buck, this is it.</li>
    <li> It performed like I expected it too. The motor is powerful &amp; smooth. I wish the case was bigger but, other than that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have had an old Wahl clipper for 20+ years, when I decided to buy the Color Pro.  It lasted 2 clips before I got so frustrated that it ended up in the trash.  Crappy quality, poor performance, and louder than my older one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I had never used hair clippers before I got these, and I tried them out on myself to see if they do a better job with my short hair than using scissors. I was impressed with the ease of using these. Although this was a first try, and I can see a couple of places where I could have done a better job, my hair looks almost as good as last time I went to Super Cuts. The clippers were really easy to use. I can&#x27;t comment on how long they last, but I&#x27;m very impressed initially. This will save me some money, and it&#x27;s kind of fun to use, too! Not to mention that I don&#x27;t have to worry about someone else completely ignoring what I told them I wanted my hair to look like. I got the #10 attachment for the areas I wanted to leave a little longer. It works nicely, too.</li>
    <li> I like these headphones</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Wahl clippers and this is the best yet. Nice and heavy duty with color coded guides that make it even better. If you cut your hair this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart for $22 to cut my 4 year old son&#x27;s hair. I have a girl who&#x27;s almost two, and I easily trim her hair because I&#x27;m keeping it long, but I&#x27;ve been paying a lot to get my son&#x27;s hair cut, about $15 every couple months, which is about $90 per year. But he has some really thick unruly hair and he probably needs a cut at least once a month, which would cost $180 per year if I were to do that...I just bought this Wahl haircutting razor today today and tried cutting my son&#x27;s hair for the first time. I was admittedly in a rush so I didn&#x27;t read the instructions very well. My son and I both were so happy about the color coded combs, which also helped him to be fascinated by the whole process of selecting different combs while I cut his hair. Having not read the directions well, I did make some mistakes, but his hair actually turned out really well for the first time, so I think it will be perfect next time! Two things I warn a parent of a little boy against is to avoid the 1/4 inch or shorter combs and avoid the ear trim combs until you really know what you&#x27;re doing, cuz I cut off a little but too much hair with these two combs (where you can see through to his skin). But I used the number 3 (3/8 inch) on the bottom of his hair, number 4 (1/2 inch around the middle) and the number 7 (7/8 inch) on the top of his hair, and I had to use the scissors to trim his bangs shorter...and I really liked it! It also gives me a little sense of accomplishment knowing I can cut his hair myself and that I can save money too! You can&#x27;t go wrong trying this out because even if you only use it a couple times, it pays for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;m  still not sure about is, am I supposed to use this when my son&#x27;s hair is wet or dry? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: coming back to this over a year later, I still love this. The last time I cut my son&#x27;s hair, family members thought he went to a salon. It has been nice to do it myself and save the money and the hassle of going to a salon. It still works like new!a salon. It still works like new!</li>
    <li> I bought this because our two-year old has decided he is going to fight getting hair cuts through kicking and screaming to the extent it is not possible for any barber (even one specializing in children&#x27;s haircuts) to cut his hair.  And, any kid next up in the barber&#x27;s chair gets a look of fear in its eyes concerning its impending haircut.  So, in order to save barbers and other children the ordeal of our child getting his hair cut in public, I ordered this.  Our child still hates getting his hair cut and is completely uncooperative.  However, this thing is so easy to use that his hair comes out looking pretty good in spite of his efforts to the contrary.  In addition, I had never cut anyone&#x27;s hair prior to this.  The step-by-step guide included with this product was very helpful in making sure our child didn&#x27;t just get a one-length buzz cut.  As far as quality: it seems well built and is quiet.  With regard to our two-year-old&#x27;s web-based image: he is actually a wonderful child in all respects save getting his hair cut.</li>
    <li> It was delievered fast and work great</li>
    <li> I bought these Wahl clippers thinking they would be as good as other Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past, although I have found that not only do they &amp;#34;NOT&amp;#34; cut as well as my previous clippers I&#x27;ve owned, but the built in clipper adjuster IS TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#x27;t add the adjustment height notches found on standard adjuster clippers which stop the adjuster handle from moving while cutting after setting cutting length and causes the lever to constantly move while cutting hair and can ruin a haircut</li>
    <li> My husband likes to do a simple buzz on his hair and his Conair kit was getting dull and shorting out.  After doing the research this seemed to be the best bet for the price and we were very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Glad I got this one. Saw it was at a reduced price and couldn&#x27;t resist. Has color-coded attachments for length of hair being cut.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth cutting, didn&#x27;t tug at hair the way some others have.&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve liked a more specific/detailed instruction sheet.&lt;br /&gt;But easy to figure out overall.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> so this is basically one of the best things i ever bought on amazon. it is 100 percent worth everything i paid for. it pays it self off, i&#x27;ve saved probably 2000 dollars not getting hair cut</li>
    <li> I have to get my hair cut once a week so I usually shave my head to save time and money .  The clipper worked pretty good at first.  I have fine hair and it cut through it with no problems.  Plenty of power and it has not slowed down over time.  Blades are plenty sharp and have stayed sharp.  No complains about the noise and I never noticed much heat coming off it.  The design is fairly ergonomic and I can reach the back of my head with no problem.  I never use the guards so no comment on them.  After 6 months or so I started to have problems with the vibrating mechanism.  It seems that the plastic vibrator comes off the bottom blade causing to to not vibrate properly/fully.  This started happening more and more frequently and now, a year later, I find myself fussing the the blades to make sure it vibrates correctly every time I cut my hair.  It was good while it lasted, but now its time to replace it.  Bottom Line: It&#x27;s a capable hair clipper for a great price.  Durability is its only limitation but what can you expect for $20.  I give it a lifespan of 25 cuts.</li>
    <li> Best buzzer I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;Which I may be damning with feint praise since the only other one I had was a rechargeable remmington buzzer that went a bit funky.&lt;br /&gt;But this thing cuts fast and nice, doesn&#x27;t tug hair and feels powerful from the moment you turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the plastic spacers that come with it feel really flimsy. They feel like they could snap at any moment but plastic is tricky like that, they could be plenty okay and honestly they&#x27;re not going through that much &#x27;abuse&#x27; so I wager they&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors that come with this? Throw them out. They pull hair and are something you&#x27;d expect to see in a dollar store package, they&#x27;re not worth using, and if they&#x27;re your only option....throw them out anyway. They are that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buzzer, feels great, has numerous adjustments and I think was cheaper than my last one. This one so far is very promising.</li>
    <li> Cheap, strong, and easy to use. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd pair of wahl clippers 2 months I got these cuzz of the price plus my other 2 pair work so well the chrome pro wahl clippers and the yellow and black clippers but these are great to</li>
    <li> I already owned one of these. I got it probably 7-10 yrs ago. It still works, but I noticed that the blades were no longer sharp and it would bind in my hair. I was going to buy replacement blades, so I started looking online for them. I found that for only a few dollars more I was able to buy an entire new unit that also came with more accessories. For the money, these Wahl trimmers work very well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was initially apprehensive at purchasing these clippers, but the price was excellent.  When I received them, I was pleased at the quality of the product - The clippers are heavy and sturdy, and the guards were much nicer than I expected.  The combs and scissors are a bit cheap/flimsy, but they&#x27;re not the reason I purchased these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the clippers for the first time to give my fiance a haircut.  The instructions provided made the process easy, even to clip a fade into the back of his hair.  We were both extremely pleased with the results, and I&#x27;m now &amp;#34;hired&amp;#34; to do clips and trims for my Dad as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these clippers for anyone looking to clip hair at home.  The quality is excellent, and they&#x27;re easy-to-use.  I definitely foresee utilizing these clippers for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and such a great price for a high quality product, extra fast shipping as well!</li>
    <li> It cuts well and comes with good instructions. My only gripe is that it is incredibly noisy!</li>
    <li> Trimmers like this are kind of hit or miss. Wahl is a solid brand and is at the very least good. The last set of Wahl trimmers we had lasted almost 10 years and these seem even better made than the last. I highly recommend. I love the color coded guards and the guide on the handle. Top Notch!</li>
    <li> Its a good cutter, I am able to change to different combs when needed. I used a size 3 comb on the side and a size 5 comb for the top. Its so easy to use that even my husband can cut my hair. Looks like a professional did it.</li>
    <li> Enough hair has fallen out due to aging that I&#x27;ve called it quits with my hair and just shaved it off.  Get yourself a light weight, but decent sized mirror and have at it.  The fun thing with this one is that it has enough different cutting levels that you can cut off as much or as little as you want.  It&#x27;s solid and weighs just enough to have a good feel to it without being too heavy to handle.  I found it ideal for any Old Fart&#x27;s balding head!</li>
    <li> This my 3rd trimmed in 12 years and I could not tell you all the money I have saved in those years.</li>
    <li> Works great! love it so far!</li>
    <li> These clippers are great BUT the big box stores have them in stock for 10.00 less! The clippers come with lots of attachements and are easy with the color coding!</li>
    <li> Gave to my son as one of his bday gifts.  He loves it! He was borrowing his older brothers now he has his own. They keep their hair cut really short, why pay someone to do it when you have the tools to do it yourself.</li>
    <li> Overall I found the quality of the cut to be less than desirable when compared to clippers by Oster.  The clipper does not cut evenly with the guide combs and leaves my hair stepped when using a No.1 or No.2 clip.  For a simple trim just using a No.2 clip I have to spend nearly 30mins going over the same areas over and over again to try to get it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I purchased a No.1-1/2 guide comb.  I did not think I could get more disappointed but I was wrong.  The No.1-1/2  clip leaves my hair more uneven than before.  The problem is that the teeth on the guide bend as easy as a sheet of paper, and the clip continuously falls off during operation.  Twice it fell off and I nearly dug the metal trimmer in to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I just received this item today and we tried it out on my friend&#x27;s hair. His hair is pretty thick and longer than 6 inches and it worked great. The biggest concern I had was the quality and the noise level of the machine but both were just fine. The machine isn&#x27;t too heavy and when turned on it makes noise but isn&#x27;t deafening.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it can with different color coded guide combs and in the pamphlet even shows how to do a basic cut for guys or even girls if that&#x27;s what you like. I would definitely recommend getting this if you need a good pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> If you prefer a close cropped coiffure like I do, this is a no brainer.  It does just as well as the barber down the street &amp; pays for itself after only one or two uses!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is so easy to use and does such a good job that I haven&#x27;t paid for a haircut in MONTHS!</li>
    <li> wonderful! I need a little more practice but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Very nice fast S &amp; H. Trusted seller... Thank you.</li>
    <li> OK but the plastic slides, especially the smaller size, are flimsey and break easily</li>
    <li> I have saved hundreds of dollars using this every two weeks! No more driving to the hair cutting place and NO MORE WAITING for the girl who actually can cut well! I&#x27;d be there over an hour waiting for her.... anyway, this product is awesome. The key is learning how to use it! Learning to use the guards just takes some practice. Watch YouTube videos and you can do a GREAT job cutting your own hair! I cut better than the girl who used to cut my hair.... in a few cuts, you will too!</li>
    <li> Since I bought this, the price per haircut has cost me about $0.50 . its so nice, rock solid too. I have my girlfriend cut my hair with it and it looks like I just got back from the barbershop. Its a really good investment!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended.  It is high quality and very affordable.  I have saved hundreds doing things myself.</li>
    <li> have only used this a few times, but love the power and durability of the trimmer. The front guide makes it easy for matching up sizing attachments. It looks like a fisher price toy, but its a nice piece of equipment. I just cut my own hair with it, not a professional barber.</li>
    <li> This thing has a good stable weight. I&#x27;ve used the cheap Remingtons before and those dont hold anything to this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn it on, you can tell how powerful it is just by the vibration you feel in your hand. The weight helps you hold it better (if that makes any sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent selection of combs. I always use #2 and shave my head myself.</li>
    <li> Well it works great! Love the color coded tips! I can just grab my color instead of rooting through the box trying to find my number (although the tips are numbered as well). Two complaints. Does not include every attachment shown in the instruction manual. And, the storage case doesn&#x27;t have any compartments or anything. Everything is just in there all messy. Oh well. Love it overall!</li>
    <li> after adjusting the blade the clippers started making a VERY loud noise!! after adjusting again the noise went down but the blade cut wasn&#x27;t close at all. i stopped using the clippers cause it was to loud!</li>
    <li> Good thing for myself.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them at all and the best part is that they&#x27;ve paid for themselves many times over. I used to go to the barber shop about every 3-4 weeks. I now cut my hair every 2 days to keep the clean look, I couldn&#x27;t do that with the barbershop because it would an economic disaster.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me??? It doesn&#x27;t get any easier than this! I spent less than $20 on this clipper kit. Since then, I&#x27;ve cut my hair at least eight times. These days, it&#x27;s pretty much $20 each time a guy goes for a haircut. I think that&#x27;s absurd! So I&#x27;ve saved myself $160 already doing it myself. It&#x27;s not hard...and if you have someone willing to help, it&#x27;s even easier! Plus I still own the clippers, so the savings will only increase! What&#x27;s not to love about that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got kids? You know their hair grows like weeds! Grab a pair of these clippers and get busy! Save yourself some of that hard earned cash!!!</li>
    <li> Cutting my family&#x27;s hair now great item</li>
    <li> Just bought these myself to replace a set of old, cheap electromagnetic clippers - and the difference is night and day. These are much more solid, much more powerful, and much quicker to do their job than the others.    This is the same mechanism in Wahl&#x27;s other home-grade clippers - a traditional rotating electric motor driving the shears by gears and levers - NOT a simple oscillating magnetic field coil coaxing a plastic arm back and forth as the A/C current reverses at 60Hz. You can&#x27;t stop these blades without stalling a rotating motor - which means even the thickest hair is going to be cut easily - I suspect it would go through fine copper wire just as well (although that won&#x27;t improve your blades&#x27; condition). That wasn&#x27;t the case toward the end of my cheaper model&#x27;s life.    These are the least expensive motor driven clippers I&#x27;ve found anywhere, and so far they are great value for money. My package actually claims to be made in the USA, so bonus for those who are making an effort to bolster domestic products.    These are not top-of-the-line commercial hair cutting equipment, but considering that they cost less than 2 cheap gentlemen&#x27;s haircuts, I think you can find very little to complain about with this set of clippers.</li>
    <li> The bang for your buck!  Built to last a lifetime!  Blades are sharp.  Will save on haircuts!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to replace a Wahl \\&quot;Designer\\&quot; which developed a problem after about 10 years of home haircutting and would have cost more to fix than this kit cost as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is quiet and works well. It gives the impression of a lot of power in reserve, and doesn&#x27;t heat up in the hand. I was pleasantly surprised by the left and right angled guide combs used for the ears, which are included in the kit. They made that part of the haircut really easy. After years of cutting my hair with only the straight guide combs that came with my old clippers, I didn&#x27;t think I would use them, but I tried them once and I&#x27;m very happy I did. They&#x27;re great, and if you bought them separately, they would go for about half the price of the kit, making the kit a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper itself is intended for home use and feels like it, unlike my old one, which felt a bit more heavy-duty. But this one does as good a job of cutting my hair, and costs about half as much. If it lasts half as long as the old ones did, I&#x27;ll be more than satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editing to update after a little over four years (probably about 40 haircuts, although I haven&#x27;t kept an actual count): The clipper is still going strong, without any problem.</li>
    <li> I like the color coding guide on the body of the clippers.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the color coded attachments.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a single haircut at a salon... This has paid for itself many times over...</li>
    <li> This set works GREAT for at-home haircuts.  I&#x27;ve used cordless Wahl and Remington sets previously, and this set beats them hands-down on the time it takes, and getting all of the hairs cut in fewer passes.</li>
    <li> The color coding is genius and helps so much when trying to find the right guide to cut with. Sturdy and powerful.</li>
    <li> I can’t calculate how much money and time I wasted on haircuts when I was in Corporate America… but those days are now long gone. My wife and I started doing trims with a Wahl just to shorten the periods between shop visits and it slowly eliminated those visits as our experience and skill level grew. Now that we’re out of those working environments and living in the high desert a quick buzz cut every month during the summer is all that’s needed and it reduces the amount of shampoo needed and just makes for a much cooler and more comfortable way to make it through those long hot summers. We’re also about 40-miles from a town so self-cutting is pretty much the only way to go. This is a nice kit but we don’t use most of the attachments. The motor assembly is the heart of it and it’s just as good as the vintage one it replaced… which will get an overhaul and become a backup clipper. I see no reason for anything less than 5-stars but some may not like how hard it is to get all those pieces back into the case. We also like that the cutting edge never heats up to be uncomfortable. Keep it oiled and it should give many years of service and it’s even a few bucks less than I paid in August 2013.</li>
    <li> Better than an older one I had. Maybe I won&#x27;t drop this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> great clippers for the price. professional feel and performance.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate and working great</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. He rates it very highly said it was the best he had ever used. The price was good also.</li>
    <li> This is really good, I trim my head every week and I was been using this past 6 months, everything works fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality hair clipper, but it also makes quick work of titanium based facial hair (you know, that facial hair that appears to be constructed of some form of alien element which would require six new razors for one shave). Those who only shave occasionally such as long haul drivers, oil rig drillers and derricks, government agents on long stakeouts, etc. will find these invaluable as it can take a full beard to close shave in a matter of minutes as opposed to the hour long ordeal normally required with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;By using the shortest attachment on the face, you can then remove the attachment and finish to a pretty close cut (caution: be sure to use an attachment on long stubble first or it will yank it out). These were the only clippers that didn&#x27;t require batteries at the time for the price, so that was another plus, and thus I can see these lasting over a decade with consistent use.</li>
    <li> It works as expected and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This Wahl cut hair better than my old conair.  The noise was a non-issue for me and I would definitely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not I use these clippers on my dog! Works great, strong motor, for humans a really big selection of snap on blades. Clipper has a good weight to it better than the Conair that only lasted one year.  It saves me $50 every time I groom my little guy plus he seems to like it better the other clipper would catch his fur. Whether you have two feet or four you&#x27;ll like these clippers, comes in a study carrying snap case the other didn&#x27;t. Glad I bought these!</li>
    <li> Although worked well but just lasted two uses. I really like this and wish it had lasted.</li>
    <li> Oh no! My clippers just blew up, literally!  This is only the 3rd time that I&#x27;ve used them. I was getting them ready to use on my son. I plugged them up, flipped the switch on, then a big internal &amp;#34;POOF&amp;#34; sound, along with a thump in my hand, sudden heat and loud smell of smoke, all in the blink of an eye.  The clippers kicked off and I was left standing there, stunned, afraid to move because I got the sense that I had just avoided being electrocuted to death.  Up until this moment, I thought these were the best clippers that we&#x27;ve ever owned.  My husband has shaved his head with clippers, every other day for the past 20 years.  We&#x27;ve owned some sets for over 10 years. This set was just for my sons&#x27; hair, which I cut into nice &amp;#34;little boy&amp;#34; cuts.  I should have let the hubs use them from the beginning.....at least then we&#x27;d known within the first week that they were junk.  Now, the return window is gone and I&#x27;m stuck with them. :/</li>
    <li> The different colored blade guards  make things easier.</li>
    <li> not my first choice but its OK and does the job . wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> This Wahl trimmer works great, as expected.  It replaced another Wahl trimmer that gave us great service for at least 7 years.  The old trimmer was still going strong until I dropped it on the concrete floor.  I have dropped it in the past without problem, but this time it hit right on the corner and cracked the housing pretty badly.  I thought I could probably glue it back together, but then thought why bother?  A replacement trimmer is really not that expensive, and if I don&#x27;t drop the new one I am sure to get many years of service from it.  So I upgraded, and I am happy I did.  The new one works great.  As expected with a Wahl trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very durable came with a carrying case, all the sizes, a comb, and cleaning brush and solution. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Pays for itself in one cut. The only downside is its really loud! Which is the same with all clippers but my two year old son hates the noise and throws a fit every time. After using this a couple of times, I have gone back to scissors only with my son as this is too noisy. I am hoping my son gets over the noise issue because this is otherwise a perfect product.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair shorter without injury, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Definitely better than the one I had before.  I recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Wow, At the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! Heavy-duty, lots of accessories. Works as advertised. No more 30.00 haircuts for me.</li>
    <li> i have used this clipper earlier for 7 years. recently it was giving me on-off problems. Since i was using it for so long i again bought the same clipper. the first time i used it it tripped off my power supply. i reset it and again it tripped off my power supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used it after a month so not sure if i can return this one. is the electrical wiring too sensitive or is it the clipper i cannot make out.</li>
    <li> Good product. I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works well, very happy with it</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Inexpensive. Make hair cut looks quite professional.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and the directions are clear. However, the attachment to trim eyebrows is missing and I can&#x27;t figure out how to ask for Amazon to send me one!</li>
    <li> It arrived with the cover broken.</li>
    <li> For $16, how are you going to beat this? I was skeptical of how well it would work for the price but I was pleasantly surprised. Great deal!</li>
    <li> This does the job, but leaves something to be desired.  The first one we got was defective and made a super loud noise about a month into using it, and Amazon was awesome and let me exchange it.  The second one works, but I wish the setting with no attachments would give a closer buzz.  Also, this might just be me not knowing how to use it well enough, but I can&#x27;t seem to cut hair using the attachments without leaving a rake-like trail.  There are probably better ones on the market, but this works well enough for most purposes.</li>
    <li> never have to pay for a haircut again. GREAT product for the price.</li>
    <li> It works great and meets all my expectation</li>
    <li> Let me tell you one thing first - it is not easy to do a haircut. I tried it on my wife, she tried on me, and it seems we have no hair-dressing skills whatsoever. So it might not be the best idea to count on your own hairdressing skills.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that easy as sellers of this kit want you to think.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the device itself seems to be ok and usable.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these in New York, but had to leave it behind when I moved to Charleston.  For the time it served me, it worked beautifully and was awfully cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one I just got is also great.  It has less stuff in it, which is fine, (most of the stuff I don&#x27;t use anyways, since I just buzz my hair), and as an added bonus it now has a nifty color coded key which matches the guards that this set comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with these products.  They are low maintenance, and the price/(performance+quality) ratio is one of the lowest out there as far as electronics products goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short I love it, and it&#x27;s darned cheap to boot.</li>
    <li> Have only used the twice, but they work great. My son has extra thick, coarse hair and it cut through without a problem.</li>
    <li> Much better than the last set of clippers that I had.  These cut right through the thickest of hair.  I would definitely recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent pair of hair clippers love the way the attachments are a and colors I would recommend it to everybody thank you very much and have a nice holiday</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Trim pretty good. I used on my two sons. I can get a little warm. I guess that normal for these. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a good, sturdy clipper set.  It is replacing my old Wahl bought in the 1990s.  It is a bit heavier than my old unit.  I love the ear trimming guide and the color coded guides are helpful.  The case is the perfect size and holds everything secure.</li>
    <li> Work as advertised. I cannot use a razor since I have very sensitive skin so these clippers help in that department. Lots of accessories come with it and I love the price I paid for them at the time, $16.99. Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the kit. However, I have not, as yet, tried it because I am afraid of ending up with a bunch of tufts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon I hope.</li>
    <li> works great close cut</li>
    <li> I like how these cut my hair and my son&#x27;s. You definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Its absolutly worth the investment its a good product feels like its a good material i just got this product and used it for the first time it cuts good has a nice touch to it and it comes with a whole bunch of heads the only problem and thats why i took a star off is the metal is actually sharp and it hurts when using it but as long as u use the plastic heads ull be fine</li>
    <li> These clippers work great and I love all the different heads that came with it. It&#x27;s not incredibly loud either(our old ones were horribly loud!). Just what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Very Nice! Works well! Well Worth The Money!</li>
    <li> Dropped my last one and part of the blade broke so cheaper to buy a new one. Had it 10 years and was still going strong. Use it every couple weeks to shave my head. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Shipment came quicker than I expected! Not relying on barbers for my haircuts anytime soon.</li>
    <li> If it starts to get noisy even after adjustment, take the head apart and clean it (which is easy).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months now and must admit that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  Our old clippers were junk and would pull hair instead of cleanly cutting.  This thing is very easy to use and my kids no longer scream in agony.  Well, they still scream and squirm, but now they only complain about the itchy hair and my terrible hair cutting technique.  But the clippers get two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> For some reason the Oster clippers I buy at Target never last.  This one has been in use for 6 months and stays sharp for cutting my boys hair.  It has more than paid for itself and my kids don&#x27;t freak out with the sound (as long as they are distracted).</li>
    <li> Good. Would have given a 5-star if it came with the blade lubricant/oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ALWAYS had Conair clippers, ALWAYS, that was until I bought this Wahl clipper.     My first experience with a Wahl clipper was with one that my parents bought about 10 years ago to replace the Oster clipper they had owned for close to 20 years. It was dull and ripped my hair out NEW out of the box. They threw it away and bought another Wahl clipper and, although it was better, it was marginally better at most and still was a piece of junk. They then bought a Conair clipper set and it worked exponentially better than any of the Wahl clippers we owned for about 1/2 the price. Needless to say I&#x27;ve owned 2 Conair clippers over the last 8 years. The first one worked great for about 7 years and then it wore out, as bi-weekly haircuts will do. However, the second one I bought only lasted about 4 months, if that, and worked poorly from the get-go. The combs I used kept breaking, it took about an hour to cut from the 1/4\\&quot; my hair had grown to down to the 1/8\\&quot; #1, and because it took so long I was having to stop and re-oil and it got blazing hot in my hands.    Then I bought the Wahl Color pro clipper from Target and, although I&#x27;ve only used it twice, it cut my whole head of hair (what&#x27;s left of it) in less than 10 minutes from oiling, setup, cutting, and putting it away. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone who does home hair cutting. It has at least twice the heft of any of the Conair clippers I&#x27;ve had, cuts ALL of my hair in about 1/10th of the time, has more than enough power to do any kind of hair, and...is only 20$.    Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> Wroth it!! I was really impress!!</li>
    <li> SUPER value.... works great, everything I need to save tons of $$$ by cutting my own hair rather than going to barbershop.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t reviewed anything in ages, but I am so pleased with this that I had to say so. I&#x27;m having my 3rd boy, and haircuts for my 2 and 4-year-old boys were definitely taking a hefty bite out of our budget. I knew I had to do something. My sister-in-law taught me how to cut my oldest son&#x27;s hair on a visit, but I was nervous to get home and go it alone.    I bought a set of clippers from Sally Beauty Supply. They were $40, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out the directions. Plus, the blades were misaligned, and I had no idea how to change that. The vibration when I cut them on was awful. Frustrated, I returned them and got my money back. Then a hairdresser told me about this kit, and that I could get it at Target.    It is perfect for people who want to cut hair at home. There is a clear, illustrated guide to cutting men&#x27;s hair for you to follow. They give you clear, illustrated instructions on what the blade should look like before you get started and directions on how to fix it if it&#x27;s a little off. Mine was, and a simple screwdriver fixed that with no problem. There are plenty of hair guide combs, and the clipper feels heavy duty without lots of vibration. This is a WAY better deal for my money than the overpriced clippers at Sally&#x27;s.    I have two squirmy boys, but their first haircuts with me by myself went really well. These clippers blended better than my sister-in-law&#x27;s set. I feel like I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth out of this set already, and I&#x27;ve only used it once. Everything fit back in the kit just fine, and it wasn&#x27;t hard to get the hair out with the little brush included.    Tips to giving a haircut to little boys that I&#x27;ve already learned.... 1. Do the haircut outside where you can sweep or blow off the hair. 2. Use long guards to start off with, and only use two guards, something like a 7 on the bottom and sides and a 6 on the top. You don&#x27;t have a lot of time when cutting little boy hair. &#x3D;) 3. Coat your kids in baby powder after you&#x27;re finished. It takes the hair off really well and brushes off pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Does what is suppose to do, actually I don&#x27;t need 20 piece that comes with it, I only use N2 for short cut. The one I got before (another trademark) always needed to arrange ,,the engine bolt,,  this one - NOT. I did it one time and that,s it. Sharp and quick haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Very good and it saves your money. Thank you</li>
    <li> I liked the product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend money cleaning up my buzz cuts but the container for the shaver and heads is too small. I fit it in my own bag.</li>
    <li> I have used it couple of times and it works great. The quality of the clipper and combs is fair.&lt;br /&gt;Briefly I should say:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;very compact kit&lt;br /&gt;Color coded guide combs&lt;br /&gt;the case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The blades get hot after a few minutes (about 4-5) and make it uncomfortable to use. So you will need to turn it off to cool down. So it is not suitable for heavy duty work.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had two larger combs (1 1/2 and 1 1/4 inches) too.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit heavy but not of a great concern.</li>
    <li> You could buy one or two haircuts (usually have more than 2 a year), or you could buy this and cut your own hair for the rest of your life probably.</li>
    <li> i have been using wahl products for a long time and bought this to replace my last trimmer that was 10+ years old.  I didn&#x27;t maintain it properly and the blades starting getting rusty.  It works great all over the body and it&#x27;s a great value.  don&#x27;t waste your money on cordless they are never as good.</li>
    <li> Have used this model for years; wouldn&#x27;t use anything but a Wahl.</li>
    <li> For some reason as soon as I plug it in my socket it works for a couple of minutes, and then suddenly the motor sound and vibration increases ten fold and shorts the socket. U had to replace the socket and tried again. Same thing happened again. This never happened with any other devices I tried using with that socket. So I am certain it is a fault with this device only.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality clipper with a great selection of guides.  The two bevel guides do a great job of blending.  The clipper is comfortable to hold, low vibration, not particularly loud and has more than enough power for any job that I&#x27;ve thrown at it.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot in extended use.  All in all, it is a great clipper for the price.  It would be a good deal at twice the price.  CONs.  The accessories ( combs and sissors )don&#x27;t add any value to kit and are there just to increase the piece count</li>
    <li> After using a Remington for the past ten years and always having to go slow because of jamming, I was pleasantly surprised when I could cut hair without any stopping.  This unit has plenty of power.</li>
    <li> I normally get a haircut every 3 weeks...at $20  sitting ..was adding up fast. Shipped and delivered for $18....piece of cake. Comes with way more attachments than anyone will ever use. Now a shop professional would not use a model like this....though they could in a pinch. Think of it as a lower end Toyota vs a Lexus. Still dependable and fully functional.  I owned a dog grooming shop....and I have seen a lot of clippers...for 90% of people out there...you will never need a higher end unit. Plenty of power without bogging down. Not overly loud...easy to maintain.  Have cut my own hair about a dozen times without a hitch.  Sure. ..I could have paid over $100 for another unit. ...but....WHY?!?</li>
    <li> Haircuts #s 1 and 2 for my 7-year old boy have been at least acceptable, even though I&#x27;ve never used home equipment before.  #2&#x27;s markedly better than the first.  The razor cuts sharply and uniformly without nicking skin; the graduated attachments reduce the disaster risk significantly.  With some initial caution (including, in my case, not using anything smaller than a #4 razor head for most of the job) and a couple of quick swings through Internet how-to presentations, I&#x27;m more than satisfied and look forward to acquiring more skill quickly.</li>
    <li> Has whatever you need in a clipper/trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers. I cut my own son&#x27;s hair- he&#x27;s only 3 so it can be tricky, but with these it makes it easier! I set up a kids show on the iPad and as he&#x27;s watching his show outside on a stool, I buzz away. The color coded clips make it easier and the set of directions inside also were a great help!</li>
    <li> Bad product&lt;br /&gt;Not only for single star&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> Great clippers. My first pair lasted thirty years.  Wahl has proven its dependability to me.</li>
    <li> never thought i would have to give a bad review for an amazon sold product, this clipper works really good, smooth, cuts clean but omg !! wahl i am certain it cost just a few cents to produce these guards, for crying out loud its an American product, i gave my two sons a hair cut today and the guards kept opening out and leaving patches, i feel like throwing the whole damn thing in the garbage, i had a con air before that worked fine for years and the only reason it gave up is because i thought i would give it a tune up and dulled the blades, yes some people will say you get what you pay for but i could have gotten a no name brand for the same price, but i went for the name, i am sorry wahl this is my first wahl product and it will be my last, very very very disappointed customer</li>
    <li> High Quality; great color coding.</li>
    <li> These clippers have paid for themselves at least 5 times over by now! Actually, these things paid for themselves the first use. If you have your hair cut short, give these a try! I was a little unsure at first, but decided to order these and take the plunge at knocking yet another expense off of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut using the highest level, 1 inch all over my head. I always end up with a nice, clean, even cut. When I told people that I cut my hair myself, they didn&#x27;t believe me until I showed them the clippers. The clippers are surprisingly heavy and the guards are nice and sturdy. I could barely believe how nice these were for the price! I had to do a little neck and side burn cleanup, but it&#x27;s way more convenient and definitely cheaper than going to a salon and paying some chick $20 plus tip for something so simple!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Bough this to do haircut for our son, and works very well. And for 15$, it is just too good. It looks and acts like a quality product.</li>
    <li> Bought it back in March, my wife went to use it today for the first time, worked fine for a few minutes, then got really loud and tripped the breaker. Unfortunately we are now outside of the return window. Not the quality product I am used to from Wahl.</li>
    <li> Works great. My other set of wahl clippers last me 15 years.</li>
    <li> This is my second clipper. The first lasted a few years but we let the cord get so twisted that it eventually started shorting out the outlet.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that was our fault and not a manufacturing issue.  We use this to trim our kids hair every once in a while -- especially before summer camp when we go short.  A solid purchase -- and how good it is really depends upon your skill using it.  You can definitely mess up someone&#x27;s hair cut if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> I had another hair cutter that was about 10 years old.  I don&#x27;t know what kind it was.  But it stopped working well so I got this one.  This is FABULOUS.  The blades are sharp and give a really nice clean cut.  The color coding of the attachments is very nice but probably not necessary.  One of the combs is really flimsy but the other comb is ok to use while cutting.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a cape that would keep hair from falling on a person&#x27;s clothes but I already had one from my previous kit.  But if you don&#x27;t already have one, you&#x27;d have to purchase it separately. Also, the cutter itself feels like it is of high quality, compared with my old one.  I am very very pleased with this purchase.  Wish I had purchased it years ago!  It gave my boys haircuts that looked professional vs. my old one where it look home-cut.</li>
    <li> pretty good for twenty bucks</li>
    <li> At the beginning seemed to not be adjusted, however reviewed the manual and oiled and aligned the clipper and worked perfect, love the color guided clippers and how smooth the cuts are done.&lt;br /&gt;one little detail, you feel the vibration a little strong but that is how it works (vibrating) then this is just FYI</li>
    <li> Seem like a good buy so far.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Works great, no defects, don&#x27;t know much about cutting hair, just learning so that all about I can say ha</li>
    <li> i have curly hair and usually when a barber cuts my hair it hurts for some reason but i just got these today and i cut my hair wow their so smooth they leave your hair amazing and so smooth why go to barber when you can have these?</li>
    <li> Good value and it works great</li>
    <li> Was exactly as posted and rereceived it very fast, thank you</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price &amp; they have already paid for themselves after only two haircuts.</li>
    <li> Not suitable for Israel&#x27;s power grid.</li>
    <li> Good clipper set for the money. They give you a lot of combs but as always it&#x27;ll take time to get good with it.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful did not regret buying them and advise them&lt;br /&gt;I would like to purchase again donated to one of my friends</li>
    <li> I have zero complaints about these clippers. They get the job done well, no snags or slowdowns, and the color coded attachments are idiot proof. The clippers themselves have a nice weight to them, which makes clipping feel solid. Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, solid trimmer.  Just as nice as the next model up.  I expect it to last as well as my others.  Wall makes good stuff.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]]  This is a such a good performer that I bought a second one for my second house. I use it about every 10 days; it stays sharp and is easy to guide. The \\&quot;ear taper\\&quot; guides cut a little longer than I want so I do that by hand but all the other guides work as planned.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut the hair of all male members of my household. I have no background in beauty or hair, but these clippers do a decent job, even in the hands of a clueless beginner. They have saved me so much money and grief, because I can get my boys&#x27; hair cut without paying a stylist and keep their hair neat and trim. I also cut my husband&#x27;s hair with these and he&#x27;s always happy with it. We had a previous pair (Conair brand) that fell apart and stopped working fairly quickly when encountering my husband&#x27;s thick hair. These are much higher quality and seem like they will last much longer. So far I&#x27;ve had these for 7 months, and it&#x27;s still working as well as right out of the package.</li>
    <li> It meets my needs exactly. This is comparable to the professional model used in barber shops at half the price.</li>
    <li> Great, especially for the price! pays for itself after 1 use! It does miss a hair here are there though.</li>
    <li> I used to cut my dads hair with clippers that weren&#x27;t as high quality (even though he paid way more for his), and I bought this to do my own hair and it works perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t pull, snag, our even slow down when cutting and its so cheap. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you either, my friends had his for years and everyone here seems to say the same thing. Great use of $20!</li>
    <li> Works great. Amazing price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for two haircuts so far. The clippers work great, and I like the color-coded attachments. There is an included guide, with photos and instructions detailing how to do a man&#x27;s (or boy&#x27;s) haircut. It shows which attachments to use for the different sections of hair. If you are new to haircutting, I would recommend this set.</li>
    <li> Still works well a year and many haircuts later.  The retractable blade means that the kids won&#x27;t get nicks either.  This little machine has probably saved us 40 hours that would otherwise be spent taking our kids to get haircuts.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers for my son, who has the curliest hair on earth. Scissors just can&#x27;t get the job done. The color coded guards are great and come in a lot of sizes. The clippers even have a list of the guard colors and sizes, in order of size, on the front. He still hated to get his hair cut, but I was able to do it at home and in less than 10 minutes. Wahl is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> Perfect materials, tiny package, multiple pieces. Perfect for home haircutting.  Materiales perfectos, el empaque es pequeño, multiples piezas. Perfecto para peluqueria en casa.</li>
    <li> It is decent. I mean the case it came with was broken so that part is aweful, cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers themselves are surprisingly quite except when you turn it on sometimes it makes this jerking sound, hard to discribe, only initially. Enough to startle my two year old son when I want to clip his hair.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. It works fine. I would buy this again and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked well for first 2 months on minimal use. Now makes huge noise and vibration, difficult to hold and too loudly.&lt;br /&gt;Better spend some extra $$ and buy a better quality.</li>
    <li> The hair cutter does what it is supposed to. If you can see colors and layer your haircut, the unique colors for each length is a really nice feature (because you&#x27;re changing the length, where some people might leave it on 1&amp;#34; all the time) and worth buying it alone for this. The only negative with the product is that it is one of the heavier cutters that I have used. I wish it was lighter.</li>
    <li> What a great buy this has been!! Paid for itself in the first month. Now I&#x27;m able to cut my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and save $20 each time!</li>
    <li> My last one lasted 5 years, this is my second one...WELL MADE GOOD PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, it was ok but after the second use, the vibration got very loud and I had to turn it on and off to make it work more smoothly. Sometimes turning it off works but most of the time the noise is very loud. I tried to change the voltage to make the noise less but decreasing the voltage makes it useless and it no longer does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this purchase and I am going to buy another clipper.</li>
    <li> New Years Eve 2014 I got an itch to buzz my hair, sort of a fresh start for 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research on Amazon, I walked myself down to the local Rite Aid to purchase this Wahl Color Pro. The packaging for the clippers is great, but I wish there was some way to organize the items in the carrying case. Besides that, the clippers worked great. I&#x27;ve shaved my head twice with a two guard since, and also used it to trim my facial hair a couple times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say about these clippers besides they&#x27;re fantastic. I give myself a buzzcut with the #1 guard once or twice a month. The clippers do a great job and have already more than paid for themselves.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I am working  abroad where the closest place I have to cutting my hair is over 2 hours in negative temperates.  The clippers gave out on me (having a serve protected and an adaptor) right in the middle of me cutting my hair.  My head looks horrible and I have nowhere to cut my hair.  I advise to avoid  Wahl like the plague.</li>
    <li> Good product I recommend it 100% fine now merged saving me the money he spent with the barber  Buen producto lo recomiendo 100% fusiona muy bien ahora me ahorro el dinero que gastaba con  el barbero</li>
    <li> I bought this as a backup for the one that I have had for six years (same model) and still going strong!</li>
    <li> Arrived right away.  Will see if they were worth it after they are used.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product. The clippers themselves are well built. Very durable. It took some getting used to cutting my own hair but after several trial and errors I found my Guard (a number 2) Ive used these for at least 5 self buzzes which saved me 15 dollars a pop x5 &#x3D;75 bucks. This is a great way to save some money if you would rather just do it yourself. There is a pamphlet on tips on the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; cut your hair different lengths if your into that. Would highly reccommend these. I bought a second pair with the money I saved just for back ups.</li>
    <li> it is ok and it works</li>
    <li> Loving it, all the good reviews above are true and I recommended it to my people. The price is so good and seems powerful. The quality of the combs are not bad, they could have been a bit more solid so that the brushes line properly but not a big deal.   Great job Wahl!</li>
    <li> Replaced clippers that I had for a long time. These cut hair great. The color coded attachment sizes seems a little gimmicky but really does come in handy. It was always a hassle trying to find the right one in the case I kept them in but I didn&#x27;t think about it all that much until I got this and noticed that I didn&#x27;t need to think about it.</li>
    <li> I used this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and trim his beard. It did a wonderful job, with me being just a beginner.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, at a great price.  Given what I had been paying for professional haircuts, this clipper paid for itself after the second haircut!  That means that for as long as I have an electric outlet to plug it in, I&#x27;m now getting free haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems solid and durable.  The plastic combs, which snap on to the clipper to adjust the length, are in color-coded by size, with a key to the colors on the clipper itself.  Initially, this seemed like a gimmick, but it actually makes it very easy to find the one you&#x27;re looking for.  The combs range from 1/8&amp;#34; to 1-and-1/4&amp;#34; by 1/8&amp;#34; increments, long with three additional combs: a 1/16&amp;#34; size, and two that are tapered, for use around your left and right ears.  The tapered ear combs are a great idea, but take a little getting used to, especially if you are cutting your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is not buying this sooner, and enjoying even more free haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works better than the almost identical one it replaced (theft, not worn out).  I thought the color-coded combs were a bit silly -- I was wrong.  Much easier to pick the color from the bunch than the actual thickness or the writing.  The comb material and locking method are both, in my opinion, much less likely to cause the comb to fail from stress cracking after long service than the previous black combs.  I don&#x27;t know anything about today&#x27;s black combs.  I would hope they&#x27;re made exactly like these colored ones; the improvement in the design/materials of the combs is significant.  The motor is the almost silent oscillating one that tends to start with a sharp *snap* - the kind I like.  This type of motor has an adjustment screw that should be set (and is, by the factory) at just barely tighter than the point at which the clippers suddenly makes a huge racket.  On my copy they&#x27;d shaved the just barely part a bit too thin and I had to tweak it.  No harm unless having it sound like it&#x27;s coming apart an inch from your ear scares you into doing something you regret.  Scissors and hair comb are junk, but I never expected otherwise. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Clippers work fine, just the case hinges are both broken.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for 3 years now and they look and work as well today as they did the 1st day I used them.  I have been able to try out every style that popped into my mind.</li>
    <li> The first two attachments broke on first attempt to secure to the head. The tiny, flimsy tabs both broke off at he same place. It&#x27;s too bad, because the groomer is well made otherwise. A new design is needed.</li>
    <li> Bought this model to trim Pomeranian, but it is completely unable to cut any of the dog&#x27;s hair, even using the taller guards.  Wish someone had posted that in a review...</li>
    <li> We have the Wahl Model MC that looks a lot like this model.  The one listed here must be the newer version.  We have used our MC for 4 years straight cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair once a month; and then it also performs better than our dog clippers on the family poodle.  Dog clippers cost more than $100.00 so that makes this tool a super bargain.  Not sure if this  because poodles have hair and not fur, so keep that in mind when considering using on other breeds.</li>
    <li> Great purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I have saved myself over $100.00 by buying&lt;br /&gt;This hair cutting kit...love it!my dog is happy&lt;br /&gt;He doesn&#x27;t take that trip to the groomers anymore!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!!!!</li>
    <li> no more hair pulling with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I thought I&#x27;d get my fiance a set that he could just use at home for trimming his beard.  These clippers are unbelievably LOUD! I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything high quality but these clippers are bottom of the barrel. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money and get yourself some decent clippers, these are terrible and I&#x27;m returning them ASAP. Seriously, I don&#x27;t know how anyone can give these a positive review.</li>
    <li> Comes with good instructions and lots of accessories. The color coordination is easy to use. I cut my husband&#x27;s hair with relative easy, despite being drunk. And it looked ok! Which is fine for us. Seems to be so far, so good! Use sober first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 2 years now, I remember buying it on sale for 17.99 at target.  I just use it to buzz my head, usually about once or twice a month.  I also used it to trim my beard for a little while until I got a separate beard trimmer.  This trimmer is great... my hair is pretty thick, but all I have to do is dampen my hair with a little water and I&#x27;m done buzzing my head in about 15 minutes.  The trimmer itself is thick and a little heavy (which I like), and the motor must be strong because I don&#x27;t remember it ever catching on my hair.  If I had one gripe, its that the little plastic pieces have been starting to get loose, sometimes the ones I use often snap off mid-trim.  After 2 years, that might be expected... All in all though, a great product for such a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Appears to be well made and does the job. I have been having a little difficulty as it sometimes pull the hair rather than cutting it. To be fair to the product, it is more than likely for me to get the adjustments figured out.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. The instructions can be improved. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is good but I forgot to check the required voltage (110V) before I buy it.</li>
    <li> Very good and it works really good</li>
    <li> I recomended is a very good options</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an excellent product</li>
    <li> We love this set. Cut our son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s hair. Money saving set;)))than spending extra money  on every hair cut.</li>
    <li> Great gift and improved color coded lengths.</li>
    <li> Arrived today and tried it on my son and it&#x27;s pretty quick and fast and easy to use. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! I use it to trim both my beard and my hair. No batteries, no power brick, just a cord, a trimmer, a pair of scissors, and a bunch of plastic trimmer length extensions.</li>
    <li> I already have a Philip Nerelco trimmer so I brought this as it was cheap and had great reviews, its disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Its really heavy even the buttons are tough. Also stopped working when I was using it for the third time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a buy a new good one :(</li>
    <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. This is a great product and cut hair well.</li>
    <li> After a few uses, the quality of the trimmer seems very good. I also like the color coded blade guards and the included plastic storage case. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> I am impressed at how well these work for only $17. Using these to cut my husband&#x27;s hair was like a knife through butter...smooth and fast! I didn&#x27;t have to go over it a second time like I had to with our old ones. These are great.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this is worth writing one for. I have owned different brands of clippers but always return to wahl. I shave my head every 2 weeks so a good pair is a must. These are great clippers with a powerful motor that will cut through the thicket hair. The grip is good and comfortable and not too heavy. The clippers are a great deal and use the SAME motor as the more expensive Chrome pro series( my previous set)..so its worth saving the extra bucks to buy this one, you won&#x27;t regret it !</li>
    <li> Purchasing these clippers has made me realize you really have to pay for quality when buying hair clippers. These things are absolutely terrible. I found that they would only cut properly when on a certain setting and even then they weren&#x27;t great. Do yourself a favor and purchase a decent pair for about 100 bucks these things are useless</li>
    <li> Great Value for the money. The color clipper guides make it easier for me to find the correct guide. The motor of the clipper is powerful enough for home use and cuts without pulling hair.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting toddler&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- not too loud&lt;br /&gt;- lots of comb guides&lt;br /&gt;- creates a flawless haircut for 18 month old boy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- plug in (but this is also a pro because they work better as a plug-in, no issues but real life makes me wish it was cordless)&lt;br /&gt;- kinda big but I&#x27;ll get used to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- give your toddler a massager to play with for a month before you use this on his hair.  I did this and he was not afraid of the hair clipper whatsoever.  He smiled at the sound since he liked putting the massager on the desk, the floor, his ear or wherever when he was playing with it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Homedics-PM-50-Massager-Battery-Operated/dp/B00170DB8U/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1430802979&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;massager&lt;br /&gt;- get a cheap cape&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BS4UING/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;- strap him into booster seat with tile floor and have dust buster handy</li>
    <li> Although it works well, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because of the dye that rubs off of the handle and has now stained my white woodwork purple. Is the blue color really necessary?</li>
    <li> Cuts well, easy to use, start slow don&#x27;t try opening a barbers just yet. I found it needs a little patience and practice, otherwise could be shaving all off.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas present for my son.  It looks very nice and well made.  Think my son will be very happy with this!  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is cause I didn&#x27;t try the clippers out ... guess I shouldn&#x27;t since it is a present!  P.S.  Love shopping 24/7 on Amazon.com; they have great prices and FAST shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got twin boys so getting their hair cut professionally every two months gets expensive!! I bought this for the price of one hair cut and although the first twin&#x27;s haircut was a little rough (nervous mom not wanting to butcher her kid&#x27;s hair, and not wanting to buzz cut him either), the second one came out much better (then I went back and cleaned up the edges on the first one).  Directions on how to cut the hair were super helpful and multiple different guards help get the length I wanted.  I can get their hair cut and trimmed along the sides in 5 minutes.  Saves me time and money at the barber shop.</li>
    <li> All in all good. thought it had a battery so I can cut my hair even it is not plugged. but it had no battery. I need to plug every time I want to cut my hair. I have tried another clipper which was much deeper than this. Overall it works fine.</li>
    <li> I think this was a pretty good deal only because I got it at a tremendous discount.  I don&#x27;t this this is any better than any other clipper set you could buy.  The case is simply too small for all of the attachments.  Being packed in the factory; the attachments fit in the case fine but once you use them, they are pretty difficult to fit back into the case.  I&#x27;m satisfied enough but I would not recommend it and I would not buy another one.  If you need a cheap clipper set; buy it but only buy it if it&#x27;s discounted.</li>
    <li> It stopped working half way through the first haircut, had to finish using the scissors included, which were dull.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what is advertised. If I had it to do over again I&#x27;d buy the cordless model as the cord is sometimes in the way.</li>
    <li> wonderful item. Will do business with again.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. At the price, I can&#x27;t even go to a barber to get a buzz cut for this price (believe me I&#x27;m cheap and I went around to numerous places). The clippers come with almost too many accessories, which is a good thing and a bad thing. I know I&#x27;ll never use some of the attachments, but hey they&#x27;re there if I want to!</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL AND HAS A OK CASE</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, but my neighbor has one and he loves it</li>
    <li> La maquina WAHL color pro de 20 piezas es sencillamente EXCELENTE!! Recomiendo altamente este producto. Tiene gran poder de corte, durabilidad, potencia y desempeño. Trae todos los peines q se necesitan, desde #0.5 hasta #8. Muy Buena potencia... Estoy satisfecho con este GRAN PRODUCTO!!</li>
    <li> I did alot of research on Haircutting kits and clippers before purchasing the Wahl Color Pro Haircutting Kit, and I am very glad I made the choice I did. This Haircutting kit did a fabulous and perfect job at cutting hair. The cut was even all around, quiet and smooth to handle. The attachments clipped on easily, and the entire experience was a very positive one. This clipper is Quiet, so don&#x27;t believe the reviewers who stated it&#x27;s loud, it clearly is not.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this unit, and will definitely buy another one in the future!</li>
    <li> For the money, works great!</li>
    <li> I am really happy I bought this. I hate using disposable razors and over-priced \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; or \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot; razors all the time.  Now I can shave my face, and give myself more or less reasonable haircuts quite easily.  My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t always want to cut my hair as short as the included extensions will allow, so I use a scissors as well to start out the haircuts.  Still, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it, already saved me $15 on my barber trip  that i used to do every month. Looking forward to refrain myself from visiting the salon and saving my money.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I got my first buzz cut with this and i am glad it came out pretty well. I go for a single #1 size all around my head, but there are a lot of other options as well. With 20$, it has practically paid for itself (almost) with the first cut. Plus, it allows you to cut your hair every couple of weeks which you really wouldn&#x27;t if you have to shell out 15 bucks every time. Excellent buy. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The clippers came and appear to be new but the box is missing the #5 attachment (I did get two #4s though).  I needed to do a haircut and couldn&#x27;t wait for a return/exchange.  The clippers aren&#x27;t that loud and seem to work nicely though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Great customer service through Amazon.  We received a new clipper set and it had everything necessary this time.  We have since used it for about 20 haircuts.  No problems and the haircuts always turn out great.  Plus, it&#x27;s relatively easy to attach/remove the guides and clean up is easy too.  I would purchase these again.  I really like that it comes with it&#x27;s own carry/storage case.  The clippers have maintained their sound (still aren&#x27;t very loud) which is nice since my 2 year old gets a little bit upset when his hair is being cut -- I can only imagine what he would be like if we were trying to cut his hair with a loud set.  Would purchase these same clippers again.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier, for the price.  Only complaint is the case is a little flimsy. Still, a great value</li>
    <li> My first haircut with this was terrible. Saw a couple of youtube videos and fixed it in a week. This clipper is really good. I can look like I have a hair cut every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay for it, it is totally worth it</li>
    <li> works well , good &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; to it</li>
    <li> My mother began to learn to perform haircuts, and I decided to buy her this machine. She told me the performance was great, and love the color coding.</li>
    <li> the price is good, but the clipper guide combs are too soft, I think this is not a convenient feature.</li>
    <li> This thing is great, tons of power... but in a pretty big package as well. I could deal with a little less power in a smaller easier to handle device. I have cut my hair for 4 years, and have used a few different clippers, these are second place. The ones I really liked are no longer available.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Just remember tou get what ou pay for in life ... Ive had two now and the first broke after 6-7 month of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for probably 6 months now, and I am very pleased.  The only bad thing I could say is the attachments are a bit too sharp and you get scratched and poked a bit too easily.  But besides that, very very nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son as part of his Christmas gift.  He&#x27;s got thick hair and his old clippers weren&#x27;t doing the job well.  He used it once and loved it.  The second time he tried it though, it died right in the middle of his hair cut.  Needless to say, he was not happy.  He ended up using his old clippers to finish the job.  He called me to tell me what happened.  I called Amazon and got \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; as my customer service agent.  He was very sympathetic and said he has the same clippers which have served him well for the past six months.  He emailed me a label I could print so I could send back the old clippers without paying shipping.  The new clippers arrived in less than 48 hrs. which is amazing considering we live in Hawaii.  Anything we order through Amazon that comes from Amazon verses a company just advertising through Amazon seems to have wonderful return policy service.  The funny thing is, the day I went to pick up the defective clippers my son said they turned on again.  Sounds like a loose wire inside the clipper to us but I&#x27;d still rather get one that doesn&#x27;t stop in the middle of the hair cut since I&#x27;m no electrician or handyman.  I&#x27;m giving this clipper a 2 star rating for right now since it was defective but may amend my rating once I hear how the new clipper work for my son.  When it worked, it was great.  Cut well, very little hair pulling.  He was happy with it.  Let&#x27;s see how the replacement one does.  Lemons happen and not everything that comes off the assembly line will be perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent much money on expensive clippers and when my Oster broke I decided to go a little cheaper. But this is not a cheap set of clippers. I used them on myself and my husband and for the money they were a great buy. I really like them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product, easy to use has a good amount of accessories for the price, totally recommend it. If it breaks in a year or two then just buy a new one - hard not to like it for the price.</li>
    <li> My spouse cuts my hair all the time for me with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, easy clean up, and it is perfect for saving money.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little clipper set! I am impressed! I have rarely been let down by Wahl, and this was no exception!</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl hairclipper for at least 15 years. I bought this one because I accidentally dropped the old one on a tile floor, cracked the body and chipped the metal blade.   This new one has a better feel in the hand, is more powerful, and less noisy. It also has 3 times as many blade guides. I&#x27;ll probably only use 2 or 3 of them, but it&#x27;s nice to have choices.   For around $20, these things pay for themselves in no time. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 20 years, and I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with the results .... I can&#x27;t say that about all the barber shop haircuts I&#x27;ve wasted money on.</li>
    <li> Great a set of clippers. I use them for my beard and it works great. I love the color coding of the clips because its written right on the clippers and easy to interchange without having too look at the clips it self.</li>
    <li> Another good Wahl product.</li>
    <li> I especially like the different colored guards.  Makes it much easier to pick out the one we use most frequently.  Great clippers for a great price.</li>
    <li> Better than the one I had for the price.</li>
    <li> Decent device and a great value. Performs much better than the one it replaced. Easy to hold and control. In addition, the color coded combs are very helpful.</li>
    <li> Used this on numerous occasions up high.... and down below.  Its also stood the test of time compared to my last trimmers which was a Con Air that was at the same cost. Hard case, hair clippers, and blade oil is just bonus!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and settled on these clippers.  They were easy to use, and they paid for themselves after 2 haircuts on my son.  He loves his hair short but we don&#x27;t like paying for a cut every few weeks, so he has been having to wait 2 months until he is a little shaggy.  Now he can have a clean cut any time he wants to.  The only down side is cleaning up the hair from the floor! (I know - I&#x27;ll make the teen do it himself!!)</li>
    <li> Good money saver, especially with kids.</li>
    <li> Nice, now I won&#x27;t be shaggy!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price  - my son has very thick hair and these usually break after 2-3 shaves but this small touch trimmer is stilll going :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t usuall write these Reviews.  Recieved my clipper set yesterday, did my first cut today (8/11/10) and it looks great. My brother can&#x27;t get over how great my hair looked after using the clipper.  The reasoning behind why i bought this, was basically low on money.  Haven&#x27;t had a haircut in weeks, and the Wahl hair clipper did the trick.  Got rid of most of my massive hair.  Gave me a fantastic look.  So if anyone wondering if you should buy this. Take it from this moron.  DO IT. You will like simple motion of this.  The only complaint i have of this is how fast it gets hot.</li>
    <li> A great value! This clipper is a good value for the money, with clear understandable instructions and everything you need to maintain and use your clipper set for haircuts and grooming.</li>
    <li> Our first Wahl clipper lasted 14 years, but it finally froze up..  I&#x27;m sure it paid for itself in haircuts I gave my husband over the years.  We bought this a repleacement.  I always dread replacing things we&#x27;ve had for more than ten years, because it seems like things are made more cheaply and break sooner.  The clippers seem heavy and well made.  The clipper guides are flimsy compared to the old black ones I had.  Two of them broke the first time I used them, and I DO know how to attache them and take them off. Luckily, I still have the old black ones.  The scissors are OK, but the longer guides (that have not broken yet) make it less likely that I will use the scissors.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> A small piece of plastic broke and the clippers won&#x27;t turn on.  My husband got them for Christmas so we have had them all of 2.5 months.  BUMMER!</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t like haircuts.</li>
    <li> These clippers are Great, they feel very well built, heavy duty. These clipper well exceeded my expectations, Would buy again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Wahl battery unit that did a great job. Looking forward to same quality in this electric model. Comes with a nice case &amp; a slew of &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; from 1/16&amp;#34; &amp; up.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Works well enough&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Even after oiling the blades and hanging upside down after one use, the blades began to rust. Come on son</li>
    <li> dam thing is actually made in the USA!  Its very nice!</li>
    <li> Seems sturdy for the low price</li>
    <li> Owned the same pair of Wahl clippers 1989 to 2012 and used them every 3-5 weeks to cut my own hair, until they finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought these in March 2015 and they looked &amp;#34;cooler,&amp;#34; so I was happy at first, but they died before June 2015, after only a handful of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping to find a better brand, because I don&#x27;t want to support yet another company that&#x27;s starting to create disposable products</li>
    <li> good quality use it all the time.</li>
    <li> GREAT try it. I cut my own hair with this. You can easily have your mom, dad, friend, whatever cut your hair and save some money.</li>
    <li> it worked well, tho the plastic cutters make it seem a little cheap but the motor was good. also good price. have only used it once but hopefully itll last me a while.</li>
    <li> Super , fantastic value.  Great item!</li>
    <li> This works great every time we use it, which is every month for my husband! Would buy it again if need be.</li>
    <li> This is a good kit but I had hoped to cut my own hair and that isn&#x27;t going to happen.  A second person is required to do the job.  The cutter isn&#x27;t professional quality but it&#x27;s more than adequate for home use.</li>
    <li> Many reviews were below par on this so I was concerned to buy it. I ordered it on Thursday night and it was delivered the next day! My wife has never cut hair before and she cut my hair like a pro. It shows what attachments to use where and how to do it with pictures. 15 minutes later my haircut was done and looking good. It paid for itself the first use! Easy to use. Has a hum sound but not loud. It worked flawlessly. I am very glad I bought this one. Next haircut is free!!!</li>
    <li> I have used other clippers and did not like the way the cut. I get a better cut with Wahl. My old Wahl clippers lasted a long time as long as use a little oil on the blades. The different color guides are added touch. No problems here.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I got the package much earlier than expected. Within 3 days tops. The product comes in a great little case that holds all the stuff for it. It came with 2 combs and a bunch of guards.  The function of it is greeeeaat. It cuts sooo clean and is super duper quiet. I almost thought it wasn&#x27;t working properly because of how quiet it was. Very good to edge with as well. For the price, these clippers are amazing. I&#x27;m super satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> For the price of one hair cut, this is totally worth it. Its not the most quiet nor the least vibration free buzzer, but it does the job. I use it to cut my 3 year old&#x27;s hair and he seems to not mind it too much. It comes with great attachments for all lengths to make his hair cut look professional. The attachments are color coded, which is great and my son always tells me what color he wants. But, this set does not come with a brush to brush the hair off my child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 3 times so far and have no major complaints.</li>
    <li> The pro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right on point considering what I need it do; cut my hair neatly and evenly.  This is obviously not a professional level buzzer and for that reason it is made out of plastic (unlike the professional ones).  But don&#x27;t worry, it still feels sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern lies on the different size clips. They are also plastic and don&#x27;t feel sturdy enough.  They could&#x27;ve been made stronger. It just seems like the buzzer will outlast them. I wouldn&#x27;t had mind paying an additional $10 for better quality clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think they are good for basic personal use, which is what I use them for.</li>
    <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
    <li> great clippers and awsome price</li>
    <li> work great, great price</li>
    <li> This is a really nice unit. Pretty decent price. I&#x27;ve cut my husbands hair for many years. We save lots of money with the DIY product. Much better quality than our previous trimmer. We use it for hair cuts and trimming my husbands beard. I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars but the plastic protective cover for the trimmer broke the first time we used it. This is a part that is on and off all the time. It should be tough and isn&#x27;t. The other reason for the 4 stars is the directions for maintenance seemed unclear to me.</li>
    <li> Great price for good quality. I buzz my hair down to zero once a week and was looking for a cutter with a strong motor. This one has a motor that reminds me of a professional buzzer i used to have that cost me about $55 wholesale. Most units for under $20 cut horribly make me buzz the same area over and over and over to get an even hair cut. Not with this one :)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and not too loud. I have now given my son many haircuts, most of which turned out okay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using shears for almost 7 years now.  My poor stylist said \\&quot;Let&#x27;s try cutting your hair with shears today\\&quot;, and after that cut, I never went back to her.  Sorry Melissa!  I purchased another brand before these.  They worked well, but the blades had finally gotten dull.  When I checked into replacing or sharpening the blades, I found it was just as cheep to buy a new pair of shears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl are a much better construction and design that the brand I had before.  The shears feel better and more durable while holding.  I&#x27;ve had them since July (5 months) and they get the job done!  I usually only use 2 of the bazillion guides they give you in the kit.  One for the top of my head, and one for facial hair.  It couldn&#x27;t get any easier, or cheaper!  Now if the blades stay sharp as long as the other brand did, I&#x27;ll be even happier.</li>
    <li> I got this clipper primarily to keep my beard trimmed.  I was hoping the lever on the left side of the trimmer was a blade adjustment lever, and it is.  This lets me go from about a 1mm length to about a 4 or 5mm length, the perfect range for a very trim beard.  I was a bit concerned that the wider blade (compared to dedicated, purpos-made beard trimmers) would be an issue.  It wasn&#x27;t, at all.  If you want a quality trimmer for your beard, this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels well made.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were a bit heavier in construction, but I expect it to work well for years; it&#x27;s made in the USA, and has a 5-year warranty.  The bright colors on the trimmer and the combs are a bit much, but I don&#x27;t expect to use it in front of an audience at black tie events, so who cares.  This trimmer can get you looking good for those events, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have commented on the noise level of some Wahl trimmers.  Well, the loudest clippers I&#x27;ve ever heard have all been in the hands of professional barbers, so a loud trimmer doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  This one is louder than the cordless beard trimmer I was using before (a Conair GMT183W), but not nearly as loud as some of the clippers I&#x27;ve heard in barber shops.  Behind a closed bathroom door, I don&#x27;t think anyone would notice, and it certainly isn&#x27;t unpleasant to the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because of the colors and because I&#x27;d like it to be a little heavier in construction.  And because it takes a LOT for me to hand out a 5-star rating.  If this thing is still chugging in several years, I&#x27;ll come back and bump it up to five.</li>
    <li> Works Great........and a very good price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very easy to use... love the different colored guards.  Paid itself off after 2 haircuts.  Great way to save money on children, boyfriends, or husbands!</li>
    <li> Comes with a slew of length attachments which help for on the fly grooming.  The cord could be longer but other than that, really a pristine product.</li>
    <li> working fine for basic home unit</li>
    <li> Love the clippers.  Had a my first set in haircutting school.  This one is very quiet and all the size attachments really give some room for some flexibility!</li>
    <li> Quality cutters, many attachments and comes with instructions for us beginners.  My only complaint is they are a little heavy for my arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> I have very little hair. I bought this purely for the buzzer. I&#x27;ve thrown away all the other stuff that comes in the bag (combs,  trimmer levels, etc.). None of it has value to me. If you just need a great buzzer to keep your hair short then this is your best option.</li>
    <li> My short haird children thank me for this</li>
    <li> These work absolutely wonderfully on my boy&#x27;s hair! The kit is very straightforward and easy to understand. It is very well made and seems very sturdy. I am so pleased with my purchase and with the price. I can&#x27;t wait to use them again.</li>
    <li> No regrets with this purchase.  Frys electronics had this for the same price, but my Frys is 45 minutes driving time away and with my Prime memebership I received free 2nd day air shipping.    Love the color coding.  Trimmer is NOT loud compared to what I expected based off the Amazon reviews.    Don&#x27;t hesitate if you need a decent trimmer.  The trimmer is far better than I needed, but it&#x27;s nice to have it!</li>
    <li> Awesome haircutter and so simple to use! The blades are still sharp and cutting my own hair with the included guides is simple, fast, and cost effective! I paid for these clippers with the first use. I use it on my beard too - no nicks, gouges, or regrets!</li>
    <li> Barber shop quality hardware.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Feels great in the hand.  Balanced well.  Took off one star because I paid for many more trimmer accessories than I would ever use.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly high quality.  I&#x27;ve bought a couple of budget priced kits over the years and this is by far the best.  I can&#x27;t speak to longevity because I just got it but it seems to be very solid.  Update: I&#x27;ve used these Wahl clippers several times it&#x27;s still awesome.  The motor has the strong satisfying hum of my Grandmother&#x27;s profession kit, but it&#x27;s so fast and smooth that I no longer get complaints about how &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; my hair is. This will probably be the only time I update a review, but in my entire life I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a product that cost less then $20.</li>
    <li> This is a nice complete set with lots of guide choices, oil, comb, ect.We have already cut our sons hair enough times to get our money back. I think you could easily learn to cut boys and mens hair and You Tube has tons of tutorial videos to get you started.PS learn how to tighten the blades it makes a world of difference on how well the clipper cut verses pull the hair.</li>
    <li> I dont like it at all, I feel like another china product&lt;br /&gt;I used it for two months now, already feel it does not do the job as intended; it does not cut good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (12/1/2013)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted by a customer service member and it feels good knowing that the company stands behind their product.&lt;br /&gt;I did not/ don&#x27;t want the item replaced/ or refunded as this is not the motive of writing a review rather than writing about my own experience with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I edited my review based on my experience with the customer service department of the seller (the comment here is what I am referring to).</li>
    <li> These hair clippers are great.  I purchased these clippers based on the reviews and the price and I&#x27;m very pleased.  The whole family uses them.  Great purchase!  I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend&#x27;s father. I chose it because it was highly rated and the color coding seemed a nice feature.  Jumping Jehoshaphat this thing is loud!  We all nearly jumped out of our skins every time we turned it on.  I offered him the use of my travel earplugs, but he declined.  We managed to cut his hair once with it, but then went out to a store (tested) and purchased a much quieter one in the same price range. I suspect he discarded this as soon as I left.</li>
    <li> These work well. I had a different brand that started to pull and tear at the hair so thought I would try these.&lt;br /&gt;I only use for trim and touch up but they are better than the other. They are precise and easy to use and very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;They also come with a big selection of spacer combs that make it hard to chop too much hair off at one time.&lt;br /&gt;I was missing the 3/16th inch spacer which was perfect for close sideburns so I called the 800 number. \\&quot;Yes sir we&#x27;ll send you one tomorrow free of charge\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice. Great service. I received it in 3 days and it works great. This is a definite bargain. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Works great as advertised at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Cuts extremely smoothly; love the color coded combs too. The price is great too. I have no complaints about my purchase.</li>
    <li> Firstly, the sound is soooo loud, our neighbours could hear us!! I bought this for my 2-year old son. He freaked out at the noise and was inconsolably crying!! :( It was impossible to trim his hair thereafter!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and love it,love it,love it. It has saved me so much money. And I can do the haircut exactly the way I want it.</li>
    <li> best kit for kids cuts.  don&#x27;t hesitate on purchasing . easy to use .  nice little guides for over ears... save $$$$$  For &#x27;edging&#x27; be carful can scratch your kids neck a bit.  Not a lot of pressure needed.</li>
    <li> great for the price, color codes are nice.  How many times have you grabbed the wrong size and buzzed your way into trouble? the color codes fix that nicely.</li>
    <li> Works great!  What a bargain!</li>
    <li> These are my first Wahl clippers to own and I really like them and I like how the guard is color coded. The motor in these clippers feels much stronger than other hair clippers that I&#x27;ve used in the past. I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all using them to cut my hair and it never snagged my hair any. I did order the #12 guard but I haven&#x27;t received it yet as its still being shipped. I like my hair short on the sides and faded to the top. So I start with a #2 and work my way up to #8 and takes me about 30 minutes for me to cut my own hair. I will change out the #8 with the #12 as soon as I get it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned plenty of Wahl products over the last 20 years (both for people and pets) to know what I&#x27;d be getting. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and like the color-coding of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this so I could cut my 17 month old son&#x27;s hair. If his haircuts don&#x27;t come out well, I&#x27;ll have to endure the razzing from family members. But I looked at the instructions, and I also looked on YouTube for videos on how to cut a child&#x27;s hair with clippers, and I soon realized that if you go slow and conservative until you build confidence, that&#x27;s the best approach. Start with a larger attachment and work your way down, blending as you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut his hair today, and I think it came out better than the two times I took him to a shop where they used scissors to cut his hair. My son was nervous at first about the clippers, but I sat outside and held him in my lap as I trimmed, and when I started running the clipper through his hair, he relaxed and realized it wasn&#x27;t going to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has already paid for itself. I can&#x27;t wait to show off his new do -- and I won&#x27;t let on that I cut it myself.</li>
    <li> This product saved me from the trouble of going to the barber shop (which is a little far) and paying $16 for a haircut. The price of this item is almost equivalent to a professional haircut; however, you get to keep it and just use it again and again. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought about buying my own clippers before. This Wahl clipper comes in a nice carrying case, which you can use to store everything once you are done. The main picture of the item does a great job showing what&#x27;s inside the box. Everything is color coded so if you can&#x27;t read the numbers written on the guides (some of them are small), you can refer to the colors. The case also contains a \\&quot;Beginner&#x27;s Guide\\&quot; for cutting your hair at home for the first time. Although it shows you which guide to use where, I was a little afraid to cut it too short so I basically added 2 to the number that it gave me. The final outcome was great. In fact, I will stick to the numbers I used (#8 for the longer parts, #6 for the mids and #3 for the sides and back). However, I like my hair a little longer so if you like a more \\&quot;normal\\&quot; haircut, I&#x27;ll suggest you to follow the recommendations on the Beginner&#x27;s Guide. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. In the long run, this will save me at least a couple of hundreds of dollars. I recommend Wahl clippers to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love it. So cool to cut hairs in few min. Worth every penny. Disregard the negative review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too good. I got the hair cut as if I did it in salon. The different comb size will help to get the  desired result.</li>
    <li> Work very well and it does it quietly! The plastic guides are color coded and there is a legend on the trimmer; makes it extremly easy to quickly grab the right one.  overall very satisfied... and ofcourse the price was right!</li>
    <li> i cant really complain about these clippers. i currently deployed and all i can say is that these are make wonders out here. have to say best clippers ive use out here. easy to use with the color coding clips and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Despite cheap look good product I am using this to trim my beard and cut hair.</li>
    <li> Trimmed the hair myself for the first time. And didn&#x27;t turn out bad.  left and right ear trimmer work superb. must buy if you study in college and don&#x27;t want to pay 15$ everytime</li>
    <li> This is a great set. It&#x27;s cheap, sturdy, and stays cool even with a lot of use. I shaved my head with it with really long and thick hair (guy), and it stayed cool even after all the use. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing and I expect it to last for years.</li>
    <li> Great price for this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a professional set of clippers. I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t clip, and I have to go over a few times in a some sections.&lt;br /&gt;Overall seems well made and cheap price.</li>
    <li> Not the usual weak motor, light weight crappy trimmer. Its heavy, powerful and cuts really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and it glides right through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this trimmer and enjoy a clean cut every time.</li>
    <li> Great quality as expected from Whal. My 40 year old Whal just wore out. They last forever...</li>
    <li> Had a Wahl previously. Very satisfied with this new one.</li>
    <li> It is only ignorance heavy</li>
    <li> This product replaces a Wahl kit we bought more than 20 years ago.  We had to replace the original only because we dropped the clipper while cleaning it, after my wife finished cutting my hair.  We were a little concerned that the quality of the new unit would not equal that of the older one, but we were both pleased to see that if anything the quality has improved.  The new clipper has a solid feel in the hand, it is more easily adjustable, and the kit of plastic parts, combs, scissors, and case tops the paper box we got with the earlier product.  We paid a little more for this clipper than we did for the one we bought 20 years ago, but then isn&#x27;t everything more expensive now?  The  good news is that Wahl still offers an excellent, US-made product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this machine only a few times but is going very good so far! nothing to complain about, the package was as expected. Best Regards from Vzla!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.....I like it!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product in general, however, when I received the package, one of the comb is broken.</li>
    <li> for 20 bucks this product is awesome. It is heavy and feels very industrial..like something you&#x27;d find in a professional barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave myself a great haircut in 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with everything you need and then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pay 50+ for one when this one is just as good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 20 bucks! Awesome!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT I have owner 3 similar to this over 35 years this is the best every.. Very well made and not cheap looking ...</li>
    <li> Like the color coded guards. Clippers not as effective as my older set. This pair bogs down so I have to go slow.</li>
    <li> Very good product, easy to use with detailed instruction. I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair right after I got this kit. And after that, everybody says I can be a professional barber! haha.</li>
    <li> The color coding is extremely helpful when you are using it half asleep.  The only downside is that some of the colors do not match what is shown on the guide.  They are similar; however they are different shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I only use the smallest attachment for buzz cuts so it doesn&#x27;t really impact my operational use.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this, and well, so far, it&#x27;s still working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses it about once a week for chest, arms etc. I notice it is slightly heavy, which can tire your arms if using for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colour coded trimmers are a must have now because of this product....I love that feature! So far the trimmers stay on nicely, and don&#x27;t fall off. Comes with cleaning instructions and oil, this is one of the better trimmers my husband has had. Packages all into a nice container so it&#x27;s not strewn all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> GREAT! It has a very good quality and very cheap. You can save lots of money!&lt;br /&gt;The package contains everything you need for a haircut.</li>
    <li> Though I like the length of the cord as its longer than most, it could use another 24&amp;#34;. Excellent colour coded guards, nice solid feel and suredness of the blades makes this easy to achieve a groomed confident cut.</li>
    <li> good stuff here folks</li>
    <li> Too bad you have to plug it in.  I should have noticed.  but it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Works really great, and was budget friendly!</li>
    <li> We save $50 a month cutting hair at home.</li>
    <li> I bought this Wahl Clipper to replace a Remington Clipper I had bought a year ago. The comparison is unreal: The Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro Clipper set is amazing.  It has more power than that Remington clipper ever had.  I LOVE the different colored numbers, because I can easily just grab the one that I know I need since I use several different numbers within one haircut. Plus matching it up to the color guide is a neat feature.  ( I cut both my toddler&#x27;s hair and my husband&#x27;s hair every few weeks)  Also, it feels good in your hands, I like the rubber on the top, allows me to grip better. I also love that t fits easily back into it&#x27;s original case (unlike my old Remington one, which was a pain to fit back into the case every time).&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
    <li> it is loud noisy and i can see it&#x27;s used. bad experience....</li>
    <li> Machine doesn&#x27;t work properly when i try to cut my little hair i get my skin scratch</li>
    <li> Received item as advertized. Exceeded my expectation!</li>
    <li> I always purchase the &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; equipment. Superior product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are super loud and about make you go deaf. Had to use ear plugs when cutting my husbands hair. They also get really hot and cause your hand to vibrate a ton so you can&#x27;t use them for long. I was hardly able to get all my dogs hair cut (and he&#x27;s less than 20#) before it all became too much for my hand. They also effectivly stopped working after 3 human haircuts and 2 dog cuts.</li>
    <li> My second haircutting kit. My grandson wanted them when he moved. Great buy good clippers. We have used Wahl clippers for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> Cool design and excelent cut</li>
    <li> Wahls are one of the best</li>
    <li> Great value product! works excellent and the case is small and fits every accesory well.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in 2011 to keep my beard trimmed short and I really like it.  It has held up well to daily use and does a fine job of trimming the beard.  I have not had trouble with the guards at all, and have used several of them over the time I&#x27;ve owned it.  The case is nice to keep everything together.  This has been a low-maintenace and solid trimmer for me and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> For just a couple of dollars more than its competitors these clippers seem to have double the quality.  They are much sharper than ones I&#x27;ve tried by Conair and Remington.  The construction appears to be very heavy duty and the storage case is actually usable.</li>
    <li> Although a little heavy, this hair cutter is very powerful. A great buy at this price! I especially appreciate all the attachments included. The instructions included are very good and more ideas are available online. All in all, a very good product.</li>
    <li> bought to use on my dog she has a lot of hair worked fine.</li>
    <li> Great set for home use. I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Decent equipment for new users!!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! I was sick of paying $20 for the same haircut my male friends get for $10. It&#x27;s already paid for itself four or five times over. The combs are great, too--nothing has broken. I&#x27;ll keep this review updated if something does, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never cut anyone&#x27;s hair before, but my sons and I both dread getting their hair cut since our ancient and beloved barber retired. I managed a perfectly passable cut for my first grader with these, and I&#x27;m actually kind of looking forward to when he needs a trim.</li>
    <li> This is a real quality trimmer for almost no money!  You get everything you need in this pack, and the trimmer works really good.  It&#x27;s got a quality feel to it, it&#x27;s really heavy.    I had one small issue though. When cutting at the lowest taper setting the blade stopped because of hair that got stuck in between the blades. If I raised the taper just a little bit it worked though, so no issues finished off the haircut. It&#x27;s super easy to take off the blade and empty the hair.  Though it did say in instructions that if your hair is too long to cut it with a scissors first, something I didn&#x27;t do.    So overall, I am super happy with this purchase even though I don&#x27;t really look good in a buzz cut :-)</li>
    <li> Bit heavier but does the job well .</li>
    <li> this hair cutting is absolutely strong and made by high quality pieces. its heavy but nice though. it so worth the money</li>
    <li> I just wanted to start cutting my own hair rather than pay 15 bucks each time i wanted a buzz. Followed instructions and did a fine job. It&#x27;ll have paid for itself after one more cut in a couple weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Works well for my short haircut, I use the shortest guard (1/16th).  May or may not work as well for longer cuts.  Includes lots of guards, oil for maintenance, a brush, case etc--everything you&#x27;d need. Clipper is quite heavy and seems well built.  Paid for itself with just two uses.  Only negative is the case, everything kinda slides around.</li>
    <li> Prior to ordering these, my wife was using a small body clipper to cut my hair.  She loves these instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Price is fantastic for the quality you get&lt;br /&gt;-Lots of length options&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a couple passes to get almost every hair.  The day after a fresh cut, I can always see a few hairs that were missed.</li>
    <li> Great product! absolutely love it, super easy to use!</li>
    <li> Have used it couple of times and found it useful for home use. It works great. Lot of blade options.</li>
    <li> work great but sometimes it get very noisy, them it return to normal. I can&#x27;t figure out what causes it. Nothing appears to be loose???</li>
    <li> perfect for someone that wants to cut there hair at home to save money. these work great and I bought them because of the other reviews</li>
    <li> I bought these same clipper from a local supermarket like 5 years ago and they still work but I lost a lot of the sizes that i like to use so I decided I&#x27;d buy another one. The shavers arrived quickly, the new deign though does look smaller and cheaper, also the taper lever doesn&#x27;t move as smooth or feel as durable, but more flimsy. Also the Bottom blade was uneven upon arrival so that had to re-adjusted to make level with the top blade which wasn&#x27;t hard but just wanted to not that for both the seller and the potential buyers.&lt;br /&gt;They work fine for the price though, cant get clippers this cheep anywhere else that wont break in a week. I&#x27;ve even seen this model from Wahl in a couple barbershops believe it or not haha.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this clipper set, gave him as a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> It works well little noisy use to groom dogs the attachments works well.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair long in the winter and buzzed close in the summer. I have extremely thick hair, and my first cut this year was with my old Conair clippers. It took over an hour to buzz my hair. The Conair clippers would just bog down. So I bought these, and what a difference. The buzz took five minutes this time, and when I turned this pair of clippers on they had that satisfying click and powerful hum that you hear when the barber turns on their clippers. The sound that lets you know these clippers have power. I cannot be more happy with these clippers, and I can&#x27;t believe the low price. Awesome clippers.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Not great for shaving bald heads because the blade is so wide.</li>
    <li> I just cut my own hair last night and this thing has already paid for itself. It is very powerful and easy enough to follow the instructions for cutting hair. I&#x27;m sure I could have done an even better job if I wasn&#x27;t doing it on myself! At the moment, Wahl also has a $5 mail in rebate that this model qualifies for.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a rechargeable trimmer first. then i could not find a single item that did not have a lot of complaints. the ones without complaint were too costly. so, i decided to go for a non-battery operated powerful machine that will cut my dense hair easily.  very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> We had conairs before this... and they frustrated my husband and I sooo much! Had this for ~three months and I&#x27;ve given him 3 hair cuts already, no problems! Quick, too - all you need is 10-15 minutes for a nice, clean job. Sound is just a low hum, easy to clean... GET THIS SET, you won&#x27;t regret it..</li>
    <li> Wow! Is there a better hair cutter out there? No! Cheap, effective and powerful! I was not expecting this from a $20 product. I can cut my own hair and not pay a Barber every two weeks! 5/5</li>
    <li> These are some very good clippers....for the price. I love mine!!!. Whal has some of the best products on the market today.</li>
    <li> Not sure why out of all of the Wahl options I picked this puppy when my 20 year old Wahl clippers died on me.  It seems to have all oft the great qualities we expect from Wahl and that&#x27;s where it stops.  The clippers themselves don&#x27;t feel as sturdy - perhaps it&#x27;s the heavy plastic outer casing (reminiscent of dog groomers).  The array of multi-color clipper guides would be useful for a family of 10 or frequently changed your hair from office preppy to grunge mohawk.  The storage case (which is why I liked this model) is just a empty box without ANYTHING to neatly and safely store everything but is strategically designed so that when you put everything back inside and quickly slam the case, it is so full that nothing moves around.  I hope that my new Wahl poodle grooming large family hairstyle adaptable clippers with colorful accoutrements in a homeland security approved plastic kitchen zipper baggie inside of the black plastic box last for 20 years!!</li>
    <li> The reason to buy it was; for head and total body grooming. Everything is well, but it has 2 small weak points:&lt;br /&gt;1- when you use &amp;#34;soft touch grip for comfort and control&amp;#34; and adjust and set it at the highest one, after a short time by contacting the skin it comes back and the degree changes&lt;br /&gt;2- when it is used over the lowest degree the bald can hurt the skin, you must take care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, turning to the price and functionality it is OK to buy and use.</li>
    <li> Wife got it for a Christmas gift for me so I can cut my own hair since it grows so fast, was an awesome gift and works great!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Wahl to replace a 15 year old pair. I was amazed at the quality  for the price.The clippers did a great job and had all the attachments I needed.  The one thing I liked the best, it is made in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> I had this for 1 year and half now, at the begining, it is good enough to handle my kids hair, but after half year, it make so loud noise, my kid is so scard of it, so he hates hair cutting since then, besides, certain hair clipper falls off easily.  i deceide to go for another brand recently, hopfully i can get a better one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty ok, but i found that it is quite heavily</li>
    <li> On my 7th set of Wahl clippers. Ultra reliable and simple design. On my 7th set because they are so cheap instead of sharpening or replacement blades. I have yet to break one, been cutting my own hair since 1998. The attachment sizes and shapes keep changing by each product iteration, but I have a nice collection now and they all work so long as its this brand. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! I don&#x27;t use it often, but they&#x27;re well-made and I like that it comes with so many combs.</li>
    <li> Wish I had purchased this years ago.  I would have saved a lot of money on monthly hair cuts. Since I keep my hair very short, this high quality Wahl clipper with a #8 attachment lets me to go town on my head to cut it down to proper length every time.</li>
    <li> I bought these to cut my dogs hair and it works great so far</li>
    <li> I had been going to barbers since a kid, and this product gives me more flexibility and it saves money and I dictate when I use this product.  Overall, the benefits outweigh the costs in the long run.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer a year ago because it was cheap.  I would not buy this trimmer again.  It&#x27;s VERY loud.  It also pulls hair and hurts.  Get something a little more expensive that will be of better quality.</li>
    <li> My balls have never been smoother. Also great for maintaining my haircut every other week.</li>
    <li> bought for my dog, its pretty quiet and doesn&#x27;t scare her</li>
    <li> Really not the quality clipper this brand used to be</li>
    <li> good set for toddler haircut</li>
    <li> Very nice , just what i was looking for i like the attachments and the durability of all the attachments</li>
    <li> Excellent product as expected.  Sharp blades and less noise.</li>
    <li> This product is what we wanted and more.  It is light weight and with all the attachments it gives a variety of hair cuts.  It cut the time almost in half of what our old clippers did.  It also does a much better job in cutting hair</li>
    <li> Junk, Second one dead after light home service in two years, Don&#x27;t buy,</li>
    <li> Wow. This item arrived used. Ugh.</li>
    <li> My wife really love it. Now she can cut my hair and our children much better than before.</li>
    <li> it did not pull and works all over the male body.  i have to use this to shave as there is no effective cheap method to remove male body hair, especially if you have blond hair.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well, but difficult for a woman with small hands to work with for extended period of time... heavy duty vibrations.</li>
    <li> Had this product for many years with no maintenance besides clearing hair out of blades after each use.  Still works like a top.</li>
    <li> I bough this thinking that i would something nice to use to cut my hair. But when i got it and used it was clear that is was so much more than that. Its like i have my own personal barber. Its perfect since Im in the military and i just need a quick cut that looks stylish and professional. This is a really good purchase and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it compared to my old one this one cuts like my hair is silk I don&#x27;t have much hair and my old one burnt my head this one hardly evev got hot.</li>
    <li> Too loud!  This is by far the loudest set of clippers I have ever owned and I have owned several.  They are so loud that they hurt my ears when I turned them on.  They don&#x27;t cut very well either I had to go over my son&#x27;s hair a few times before I could get an even cut.</li>
    <li> My family and I are pleased with the haircutting kit.My grandson&#x27;s hair has been cut twice now and my son&#x27;s once.At ten dollars a haircut at the barber shop we have already saved thirty bucks.Now that we own a set of clippers they can maintain the length of their hair more often(they both keep it short).My husband asked us who was going to do his hair.I&#x27;m not that brave because his hair has some curl.So he still goes to the barber shop!Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this to cut my hair roughly every 4 weeks for over a year and I love this trimmer. It was a fantastic buy. I just do a #2 on the sides and #6 on top, clean things up a bit, blend as best I can in the back, and it comes out just fine every time.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace a less expensive brand that was getting erratic after 4 years of use. My wife trims my hair every 2-3 weeks, so it gets used regularly but not heavily. I&#x27;m 69 and my hair is nowhere near as thick as my younger days, but it still grows out steadily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time we used this Wahl trimmer it was immediately evident that it is a superior machine to our previous brand. Hardly any vibration or noise - just a quiet hum. The variety of attachments is also a plus - there is a snap-on trimmer head for most any purpose. Highly recommended for home use.</li>
    <li> not helpful in trimming facial hair. may be good for hair cut</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They are professional grade and have so many guards to choose from.</li>
    <li> got tired of wearing out the batteries in my cordless beard groomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this thing is great, more powerful, doesn&#x27;t need to be charged, and more consistent trimmed length.&lt;br /&gt;the two combs and the scissors are nice to have also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> Worth The money. I was replacing my Remington and was skeptical I would find clippers that would be as good as they were. These are a lot better. Good job to the makers of this one.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Shipped within a day. Good product</li>
    <li> Perfect for quick har cuts, there is no way ill pay 15dollars for a basic hair cut here in LA, so i bought these and plan on saving my money, easy to use and easy to clean, used it 3 times now and no issues</li>
    <li> I wish it was cordless- when I bought it I thought it was!</li>
    <li> Works right out of the box, very easy to use. I bought this and am saving tons of money on haircuts and can clean up my hair cut more frequently giving me a fresher look for my job. I buzz my hair fairly short and with the longest attachment it works out fine. I am going to be saving money for years to come with this product. Coincidentally my friend who is a hair stylist says that he uses this brand as well in the salon he works at.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. This is my 2nd Wahl set and would buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Works nice, for twenty bucks, what do you expect.  LOL  Ill be happy with a yrs use.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper!! Good quality.</li>
    <li> Really decent clippers. I use them to shave my head and they work really well. I&#x27;m going to take one star off purely because they don&#x27;t clip super super close without a guard (which they may not be designed to do), and they are a bit bulky/large for self use. But for cutting other people&#x27;s hair or something similar, it cuts clean and doesn&#x27;t get bogged down.&lt;br /&gt;They are very tough, not very noisy, and remain fairly cool to the touch for a while (they can get really warm if used for too long).&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, they come in a case that works very well for holding all the attachment and everything. It&#x27;s not super organized if you don&#x27;t take the time, but it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;These are great economical clippers.</li>
    <li> Had a few other Wahl Clippers over the years. . .  but this model is the best by far. Love the color coded guides.</li>
    <li> I love this new toy ;) It run smooth and sharp. The color coded guide comb make it even easier to use this product. I highly recommend this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It gets hot after 10 mins of usage other than that everything is great.</li>
    <li> Hair cutting just got a lot easier. I love the different attachments that tells you exactly how much hair is going to be shaved off. Very easy to clean as well. Pop off the attachment and blow a little compressed air on the blades, put a drop of oil on them and you&#x27;re ready for your next buzz! Would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone who gives hair cuts at home. It was a fair price paid for a Wahl, which IMHO, is the best electric shaver on the market! Shipping was pretty quick, too.</li>
    <li> I had an older model of this clipper and was quite pleased. They lasted for about 8 years and started to pull rather than cut my hair. I did some research and found it easier to replace with a new clipper as opposed to replacing hardware on the old one. I am glad I did, the included guides and clippers work well. The clippers do have some difficulty cutting the finer hair on my son&#x27;s head and it requires me to go over it more than I think should be needed, but overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer! Does a great job! I have not paid for my own haircut since I got it!</li>
    <li> Good quality. Good price. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this kit so that I could learn to cut my own hair.  The kit is perfect - It comes with everything you need (guards, comb, scissors), and the clippers are great.  They cut my hair evenly and didn&#x27;t pull any hair.  I tried using a cordless Norelco kit before and it was horrible.  I would highly recommend this kit, and for $20 it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great and the color coded size chart is actually really helpful.</li>
    <li> Its not for you if you shave your hair clean.I gues it woulod be ok for regular haircutting,. You get what you pay.. Returned</li>
    <li> I have never bought an electric razor before, but this product is great. It was cheap and does well to both trim a beard and a neckline. It comes with plenty of attachments and accessories for a great price. I am beyond happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great price and service</li>
    <li> These Wahl clippers are decent, but not as good as the Chrome version Wahl has for some reason. I did not like the power switch as they have changed that from a lever to a button, just my preference I suppose. Also did not feel as &#x27;heavy&#x27; in the hand. Comes with a variety of guards, oil, comb, scissors. It does have the blade slide lever, do not buy the clippers without this as those are made in China, these are made in USA.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected! Very good product, strongly recommended. Received today and already used it!</li>
    <li> This seems to have a lot of power. It cuts thick hair without any slowness. I would recommend this to someone who cuts a lot of hair. Great product and worth the money!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too noisy.i cannot stand any more.</li>
    <li> Excelent product. very good</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and absolutely love it! I use it to cut my husbands hair and it works out great. I am by no means a hair stylist so this makes it very easy to cut hair for a beginner. The haircuts look awesome.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a very complete kit and everything seems to work very well. Even the instructions are well done and even color coded. We tried it on my short hair and the haircut turned out quite nice for the first time we tried to use the kit. We recommend this hair cutting kit.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cutting hair and with all the different attachments it&#x27;s almost fool proof. There&#x27;s even attachments to cut around the left and right ears. Comes with a slanted comb, a small tube of clipper oil and nice instructions.</li>
    <li> I was long overdue for a new set of clippers as our current ones are very dull.  I do not like having to spend money on 2 males every 3-4 weeks and home hair cutting is something we have done for years.  This set of clippers has a great color coding system where each comb has a different color for each size.  The combs go from 1/2-8 so whether you are wanting to achieve the bald look, or shaggy you will get it.  This is a 20 piece kit which has everything to get you started on cutting hair at home.  My husband does the bald look and these have worked great.  The site also gives great video demonstrations.  You will also get written instructions in the kit with photos on how to cut hair, outline, blend, trim brows, taper and more.  The clippers aren&#x27;t very lightweight, but are not that heavy either.  The case is plastic and all the pieces just go inside, which leaves me wondering if the combs pieces will break while inside, but just be careful.  A great kit for home haircutting!</li>
    <li> The clipper looks sturdy and nice. It cuts my hair well but it vibrates a lot and also makes really loud noise. I adjusted the power screw as in the manual, but that wouldn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for a good set of guide combs.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Have had this for a while and does a great job!</li>
    <li> I use the Wahl to trim my facial hair on a regular basis, and the different guide combs are great for getting my hair just the length I am in the mood for.</li>
    <li> Nice clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I&#x27;ve had too many rechargeable clippers in the past that eventually lose the ability to hold a charge and become garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This one has NO dumb builtin batteries to die in a few months.  You just plug it in and it runs - WHAT A NOVEL CONCEPT!&lt;br /&gt;Cuts VERY well and quickly.  I use it to bald my own head and i have a thick shaggy mane.  No pulling or tugging - a nice comfy and quick cut.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a pretty storage case as well and even a decent pair of scissors - you could easily pay more just for the scissors at retail.&lt;br /&gt;Oh did I mention - it comes with a FIVE YEAR WARRANTY -&lt;br /&gt;lets see: if you cut your hair 6 times a year at $10 each time - thats $300 in haircuts over 5 years.  Looks like a steal, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Works nicly for a man&#x27;s haircut but takes some practice. No complaints so far, except my wife needs more practice:)</li>
    <li> These Clippers Work Fantastic. Once you line the head of the clippers up, your ready to cut. Their very Sharp. The package arrived on time no delays. I love the color coded guards.</li>
    <li> I got to use this only one time before it mysteriously stopped working.  It won&#x27;t turn on at all.  I had it in cool, dry storage for a few months since my last haircut.</li>
    <li> Husband and son have already used enough to more than pay for itself a few times over. Men&#x27;s haircuts are averaging about $15 a pop here, and this has been used for at least 7-10 haircuts to date. Has everything you need to do a haircut at home.</li>
    <li> Easy to use instructions. Durable case - nothing will get lost. Great product and service.  My son used it the day he got it and did a great job! He&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers at a great price.  I bought them to replace the exact clippers I had for years before the cord broke from being wound up.</li>
    <li> So far, this works great.  I use it to do my own hair.. I pretty much just use the #1 guide comb because I like to keep things simple and short all over.  I&#x27;m losing my hair on top, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about blending different lengths or anything.. I&#x27;d keep paying my barber to do that if I cared enough.  It felt a little big and clunky when using it on myself at first, but I got used to it by the end of my first cut.  Feels like a hefty, solid product.  Not too noisy.. does the job.. no pinching or snagging so far.  I would definitely recommend this, especially since it&#x27;s low-cost.</li>
    <li> One of the clips was broken when the order arrived. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for ny son and grandson to use.  They love this hair clipper because&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how this item holds up, but for how much the brand cites high quality I was surprised that some of the plastic accessories were broken when they arrived.  The hard plastic case shows no sign of damage, so it seems the way the manufacturer packages this combined with the quality of the accessories is insufficient to ensure safe delivery.  The main component works perfectly, and I won&#x27;t miss the broken accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broken parts were limited and not worth the hassle of a return.  My recommendation if buying is to leave extra time to return for replacement or account for purchasing replacement parts upon arrival.</li>
    <li> My Wahl clipper had several years of weekly use and sounded like it was going to die. My prior Wahl came from a big box retailer but Amazon had a nice price. Other than the color changes, it operates just like my prior model. An adjustable setting so I can give myself a 1.5mm cut all over.</li>
    <li> Good product we enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money using these clippers to cut my own hair.  Reliable and effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor boyfriend loved it</li>
    <li> *update* 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years in with it, and still chugging along. Saves me tons on haircuts.</li>
    <li> Almost everyone in my house uses it to cut their hair.</li>
    <li> This hair cutting kit is a much higher quality kit than the low price would indicate.  My wife cut my hair for the first time with it and did a better job than many barbers.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Years ago a good friend gave me his electric clippers and that changed my life.  I gave myself my first buzz cut with them and immediately found the only hair style that seemed to fit me.  Years later, I have since retired the original trimmer and after a short-lived experiment with another brand that fell apart too easily, I now have this Wahl kit.  I&#x27;ve been using this these clippers for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with their performance.  Although I only ever need one or two for specific tasks, the variety of attachments provides a range of options and unlike my previous unit, these are somewhat strongly constructed, as the plastic tines aren&#x27;t as flimsy and moving around as some lesser brands do.  The motor is strong and as long as this thing is properly maintained with a little bit of oil now and then, is relatively quiet.  I generally use NO attachments to shave my head and trim my facial stubble and never any issues or \\&quot;bites\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great, high quality, high value, kit that I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**One year update -- January 2013**&lt;br /&gt;-These clippers are still going strong!</li>
    <li> Great razor at a great deal. Left off one star because first one received had oil all over it and broken attachments.</li>
    <li> Was happy with another wahl electric razor i had received as a gift from a relative.so i bought this as an addition to my other one.i am very happy with the results of using this hair razor.</li>
    <li> I was excited to finally buy our own set of clippers.  I bought this as a starter set and honestly, I&#x27;m a little disappointed with it.  We have used this only a handful of times on hair that was already short to begin with and after the third or fourth use, it wasn&#x27;t cutting completely.  We even took the blades off and re adjusted it because I thought it was misaligned but it still was having an issue cutting.  Oh and we also clean it off after every use and put it back in the case but somehow there is a little rust on the flat part of the blade? Not sure what&#x27;s going on there.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m on a hunt for another set of clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wahl Color Pro for cutting my own hair.  I followed the instructions and got a pretty good hair cut out of it.  I did have to get help with trimming the nape of my neck, but I managed to do a pretty good job of the rest of it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is heavy and seems to be of good quality.  The items in the kit are great.  One reason I knocked off a star is that the guide combs supplied max out at a number 8, which means all you can do is a short haircut or shorter.  They should have really included the longer #10 and #12 guide combs so that some medium length cuts could be attempted.  Apparently you have to buy the extra combs ($8.00 for two combs) which seems excessive that 2 combs can cost more than one third the cost of the whole kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs at first seem stiff and take a little effort to clip them in place.  The items are just sort of piled into the case.  It would be nice if the case was larger and had spots where each items could fit into it&#x27;s own space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try cutting someone else&#x27;s hair with it, but it would have to be easier than cutting my own.  I&#x27;m pretty sure if you have some talent, within two or three efforts the cuts would be good enough that people couldn&#x27;t really tell you didn&#x27;t get them from a barbershop unless they are nit pickers.  Definitely watch some of the WAHL haircutting videos on their site.  Using the rocking motion really helps to blend each section/length of hair in with the next layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reckon I saved the cost of the clippers on my first cut.  A trip to the barber for me would be $15.00 plus $5.00 tip.  The kit cost me $20.00 so I&#x27;ve already broken even.  I suspect these clippers, as long as you don&#x27;t bang them around, would last 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m looking at buying some hair tonic so that I can get the whole &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34; effect at home.  I would recommend these clippers to anyone looking to cut their own or other&#x27;s hair.  The only two things that separated my giving this clipper five stars is the lack of including #10 and #12 (longer) guide combs, and maybe a case that could hold each item in their place rather than just piling all the bits and pieces into the case.</li>
    <li> It has to be positioned in a specific way or else it won&#x27;t turn/stay on. I know that&#x27;s normal among electronics but usually after dozens of uses or years of uses. I barely bought it and used it less than 5 times before this started.</li>
    <li> Very good, shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> Just got my first haircut and this baby worked like a charm. I&#x27;ve got a pretty thick head of hair still, and my old one kept getting stuck if I buzzed too much hair at once. Not this baby! It never choked up, and for the price I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe how good this is for the price.  I have used it for my boyfriend&#x27;s haircuts and my dog as well.  Works super well! Comes with all the guards, oil to keep it in good condition, a little brush for cleaning, scissors and a comb.  It all fits in the case for easy storage.</li>
    <li> Great clipper! it worked great for about 2 months then started to pull my hairs.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Nice little box.  Color coded combs.  What more could we ask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had Wahl before and expect this will be a handy tool for many years.</li>
    <li> My husband was impressed with all the gadgets with this.  Very well worth it! Would definitely recommend this for any man!</li>
    <li> This pays for itself with 1-2 haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sharp&lt;br /&gt;Fast&lt;br /&gt;Good guard selection&lt;br /&gt;Relatively quiet for a home model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> Out first pair were defective. Our second pair are incredibly loud. I know you can adjust the screw setting on the side, but then the clippers don&#x27;t have enough power to cut hair. Buy another product. This one is garbage.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use to trim my dog&#x27;s belly and butt.  They work, just not as easily as I thought they would.</li>
    <li> who needs great clips?when you got wahl color pro .got my money back wirh the first hair cut.a im 70 years old and my friends were telling me where i got my hair done,fells good in the hand ,well built.i think some of the guys are going to order also,thanks</li>
    <li> THE GOOD: the color key is very useful. easy to use and feels solid in the hand. great clipper if its your first one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD: some of the plastic pieces dont clip on easily. i feel like it vibrates abit more than my other clipper. maybe it just needs to be broken in.</li>
    <li> Works well. However after a few months starts making crazy loud noise when you turn it on, and then stops working. I guess that&#x27;s what you get for the price. :/ I would totally get a better quality one.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers yesterday as my 3 boys were in desperate need of a haircut and I am unable to afford their usual bi-weekly cuts at this time. This being my first time cutting their hair, I was pleasantly surprised. The motor is very strong and the clippers are easy to handle - not has heavy as many high quality clippers. Their cuts usually run $10-$12 each bi-wkly, and I purchased the clippers for $19.97 - I have already profited from the purchase as my bill for the boys is usually $60 per mos or $30 per mos. if their hair is cut on a monthly basis. The only issue that I have had is when I tape/outline their hair, the blade is not very friendly with my sons&#x27; hair grade (African American). I have been checking out You tube and am searching for a site to adjust the blade as I read on another comment, but overall, I am very pleased with my purchase (and shocked @ the high cutting quality of trimmers that are under $20.00). Hope that this helps :)</li>
    <li> great!!!  service of the merchant and the quality of the product are both excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TY&lt;br /&gt;g</li>
    <li> Omg this product... Really loud! It&#x27;s like construction noise and no way you can place it close to your ear. We has to cancel the order. Luckily we didn&#x27;t return the items as we live in Australia and amazon refunded money ..perhaps it was a faulty one but it&#x27;s quite heavy too.</li>
    <li> Does the job at a great price</li>
    <li> I gives a good cut and I have brought these in the past and they last a while.</li>
    <li> this clipper is really nice for the price. I was able to do the haircuts of my 4 kids during 1 1/2 year before the motor starts doing an horrible noise. I have just replaced it by the same model.</li>
    <li> Used this on my husband and son... worked well, missed a couple of hairs, but that could just be due to my inexperience also! :) Seemed to work great!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years on my family and I love the colored blade covers.  I can use these on the whole family and they last years!  Great quality and saves a ton of money on hair cuts</li>
    <li> Very good for what I needed.</li>
    <li> one iof the combs were broken.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not for short hair cuts, but it was not advertised as such so I won&#x27;t gripe about it.  Every other razor that I&#x27;ve owned cuts lower than this though.  This is good for the 2 or 3 after-shave look.  It is not good for cutting hair that is short either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging could be better--I&#x27;ve never purchased something like this with such bad packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it just me or does Wahl need to rethink the design of their brushes?  This is the 2nd product that I&#x27;ve purchase of Wahl&#x27;s and I just thought that the 1st had a defective brush, but then this arrived and I was like &amp;#34;not again&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I don&#x27;t get razor bumps anymore unless I eat something that I&#x27;m allergic to and then shave.&lt;br /&gt;Quality feels much better than any of the other cheap clippers that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy another one of these again, but I don&#x27;t hate it.  Just not for my hair type</li>
    <li> When shaving without attachment I cut my neck twice.  I&#x27;m leary about shaving head with it, which is why I bought this product.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like, does not cut low enough.</li>
    <li> I like the Ear attachments.  A little loud but works very well. Item as described. Fast Shipper. 10/10</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price</li>
    <li> Wahl is a brand I have always trusted and it is products like these that reinforce that every time!  You can save hundreds a year by cutting your own hair or your kids hair!  Out of the box and with proper and very little maintenance you can have perfect cuts every time.  The new color coding system is a nice touch so you don&#x27;t have to dig through the attachments and try to read the print or accidentally grab the wrong one and cut the hair too short.  As salons and barbers keep increasing their prices, you could try this unit out for about the price of a single haircut these days!  It is build solid and will last a long time!</li>
    <li> After a lifetime of paying to get my hair cut, I&#x27;ve surrendered this duty to my wife, who has become quite capable.  This Wahl set has made the job much easier because of the guards.  These guards allow for a much more uniform looking cut and the wife is able to use scissors to blend the differences between chosen lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second set of Wahls with the first lasting nearly a decade.  This model has performed very well so far, giving a smooth cut without pulling.  The clippers aren&#x27;t excessively noisy (which is really important when it comes to cutting our childrens&#x27; hair) and there&#x27;s really no maintenance necessary.  I&#x27;ve also used this set for beard trimming and it works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this model&#x27;s performance, and when you factor in the price, I doubt there&#x27;s a much better deal out there.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. To late now.</li>
    <li> I have always been impressed by the quality of the Wahl clippers.  This set came with more attachments than the previous ones I have owned.  The attachments have the size printed on them, as well as the color coding which is displayed on the cutter itself.  I have 3 boys and I cut their hair as well as mine.  I have only ever payed for a haircut once in my life, so I have used clippers like these for a long time and can say this is my favorite set, love the design on the handle as it fits more comfortably in my hand.</li>
    <li> great deal for the price..</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and plenty of power for a clean cut.</li>
    <li> edited: bought on 04/14/2015, and stopped working on 10/30/2016.  Bought it for my friend. He loves it, and said the (heavy) weight is a big plus. ( He throw away a very light clipper bought from walmart)</li>
    <li> Arrived early and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a set of hair clippers to cut my own hair, and I am very happy with this purchase. I start with a 3 at the bottom, then a 4 in the middle, then a 5 on top. It&#x27;s really easy to get a good looking haircut this this tool. It has never jammed on me, and it cuts so smoothly through my hair. Very pleased, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tired of the inconvenience and expense of haircuts I have been asking my wife to learn to cut our sons and my hair for years now. She told horror stories of botching a haircut for her brother as a child and kept putting it off. Finally a few weeks ago I went ahead and ordered this clipper. All in all it feels solid and contains a lot of attachments. As some other review mentioned it does vibrate a bit in your hand but at this price range I could not have asked for much more.  A few youtube videos later and she has cut both of our hair (and we still have our ears in tact to boot!).</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on Shepherds, FYI. I&#x27;m sure it would be fine on my husband, though. Wahl has always been a good brand.</li>
    <li> pleased with this purchase....will recommend</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s ok, but it doesn&#x27;t get everything the first or second or third pass.  If you&#x27;re patient, great.  I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> Works great and has lots of attachments...My wife gave me a nice haircut and she was thrilled.  She has cut hair for many years</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Great value.</li>
    <li> I do not advise.bad hair cuts. very loud noise. adjustment cannot be. &#x27;re wasting your money.I can not use for its intended purpose</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Cutting my own hair is super easy now!</li>
    <li> Great set I also got one from walmart same thing , does a great job. amazing value, already paid for itself a few times over</li>
    <li> Works very well! Got my money back with one haircut! Been paying $11.00 per haircut at &amp;#34;the McDonalds of haircuts&amp;#34; can&#x27;t mention the name!</li>
    <li> Works great and I love all the attachments. The only issue I have is with my sensitive wrists - the clipper vibrates pretty hard and I can&#x27;t seem to hold on to it for very long. I can buzz my son&#x27;s hair but need a break before I start on my boyfriend&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Super nice heavy duty clipper</li>
    <li> combs are plastic and feel a little flimsy, but no problems so far.  I&#x27;ve had this for about 8 months with no problems.  cuts well.</li>
    <li> Very well built. Cuts through thick hair with ease. Lots of size attachment. I have purchased a few of these in my lifetime but this one feels strong and durable.</li>
    <li> It was cracked &amp; not of the same voltage as the country of use. Hence, makes an irritating vibrating noise when Plugged in.</li>
    <li> Looks very nice and is a great price. I ordered 2 sets and both don&#x27;t work well. Have trouble cutting my beard.</li>
    <li> Ideal weight, balance and supportive for the job I use it for.</li>
    <li> Had these for about 6 months, moderate use and then they failed.  Moderate use is like 30 minutes a month in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They now turn off in the middle of a haircut.  Not exactly confidence building when you have half your hair cut and then your clippers won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers. All clipper heads are color coded for size. Very well made. The larger clipper heads size 4 and larger are a little flimsy being that they are so long. As long as you don&#x27;t press down hard with the larger clipper heads they work just as great as all the other clipper heads. Comes with a nice case that stores everything. Comes with clipper, 13 clipper heads, clipper oil, combs, clipper cleaning brush and scissors.</li>
    <li> I have no hair cutting experience at all. This one is really easy to use. The second time I use it, I can make a guy&#x27;s basic hair cut as good as a barber:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: noise, and the vibration makes my hand numb after a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used this twice and it does a really good job. I was paying $20 at the barber each time I went so it has already paid for itself. The packaging could&#x27;ve been a little better with everything pressed into the plastic case. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it yourself, My wife cuts my hair and if you follow the guide it is pretty easy to use. For the money I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love my new Wahl Color Pro Clippers.  The set comes with a lot of nice extras/accessories too.  This set is all you need to cut your hair - saves a lot of $$$ by not going to a barber!  Love the variable blade length option.</li>
    <li> It costs me $5 to get a trim at Sport Clips.  This pays for itself after 4 visits.  My older, hairier brother gave me a quick tutorial and I&#x27;m looking as good as when I leave the barber.  Thanks bro.  Thanks Wahl.</li>
    <li> Work very well, especially the price. I was surprised by the quality of the parts. I usually keep my head buzzed down to 3/8ths, and after a few months of growth (2+inches), it only took about 15 minutes of doing it myself. Much faster than clippers of higher quality/value that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This works really well and I think the color-coded blades are helpful and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and stores nicely.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for a few years now, and have purchased 2 other clippers; One from Target and one from Ross, just cheapy $20 clippers. My first pair lasted around 2 years, but wore out to the point that I burned it out and it stopped working. I replaced it with a Remington clipper set from Target and that was a HUGE mistake and a waste of $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this from Amazon and was eager to try it out.. I am speechless at how good this set of clippers is! Especially for only $20! This thing mowed down my very thick, very coarse hair with ZERO issues.  I don&#x27;t need or use the 20 piece hair cutting set since I always cut with no guard, so I have no review on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to updating this in a year and I hope that I&#x27;m just as pleased with it as I am now!! I wish there was a 6th star just to show how much more I love this than only 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this.</li>
    <li> I use this every three weeks and save tons on hair cuts.  They work great with plenty of power, no pulling.  So good and reasonable I purchased a second set for travel.  I am amazed how much better these work compared to an equally priced kit from another brand that I tried prior.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my own hair. It works and is easy to use, however the lengths seem longer than the lengths my barber uses.</li>
    <li> i like the cliper and its been working great. for that price i think it is a good bargaina aand buying</li>
    <li> I bought similar priced clippers from Conair and paid around 18 dollars. Never had a problem and they got the job done. I got them to save money by cutting my own hair. Problem is when I moved to Las Vegas I left them at my hotel and they said they did not have them. So figured I would try these ones since they came up around the same price and last time I was inbetween the Conair and Wahl brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these have a leg up from the Conair ones I owned because these feel heavier (like they are made of metal and good quality parts), the attachments are color coordinated for quick and easy size choices (vs the Conair where they were all one color so you had to search), also these parts said made in USA so we support our own country&#x27;s economy by purchasing this set. I have only used them once so far and they worked similar to the other pair I had. No issues and they cut just like they were supposed to. I reccommend you save the money and get this set.</li>
    <li> Great deal, serves it&#x27;s purpose perfectly</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Does job well</li>
    <li> Easy to use and actually works right.</li>
    <li> My husband cuts his own hair each week and this is a great kit! We had a Wahl that got lost in the move, so we replaced it with this kit and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I purchased a Wahl clipper about 12 years ago and it finally died 2 years ago.  I used that thing pretty hard, hair is VERY thick in our family.  Shopping locally, I couldn&#x27;t find a good deal on another Wahl, so I let the lady talk me into an Andis.  Since this is not a review for Andis, I will summarize by saying it was a waste of money.  After fighting with it for 2 years, I went shopping online and found this Wahl Color Pro clipper for an incredible price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have a Wahl again!  The clipper itself is a little heavier than I remember it, but I only do up to 2 haircuts in a row and my hand doesn&#x27;t fatigue.  It cuts very thick hair without having to make several passes.  Went I first bought it, I thought the colored guards were silly but whatever, couldn&#x27;t hurt.  Now that I have used it, I really like having the color guide right on the clipper so when I go to switch, it really is easier; no squinting to read black raised print on black to make sure I grab the right guard which actually makes changing guards faster.  A fast switch buys you valuable time when cutting a wiggly kid&#x27;s hair.  The cord length is adequate for cutting hair in the kitchen, but it&#x27;s easier to let my child watch TV while I cut hair and I do have to use an extension cord when cutting hair in the living room.  I haven&#x27;t used the scissors yet because I have a pair of my own I prefer, but they aren&#x27;t what I bought the clippers for anyway.  The set contains enough guards to give you a variety of cuts.  The hard case is a nice bonus, everything fits in it easily.  This purchase was an excellent value, especially for the quality of Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set to anyone who needs a good clipper for home use.</li>
    <li> All in all a very good unit for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Was a bit disappointed at how loud it is, even after I adjusted the power screw.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the way it cuts which is the most important part.</li>
    <li> Very good it 9W Powerful</li>
    <li> great way to save money! works great too.</li>
    <li> Feels like a good heavy piece of machinery.  I use it to trim down my beard before I shave, it does a fine job.  Good price very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Very loud sound on switch on</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am losing my hair on top so I keep it real short. I use the 1/16 attachment for my whole head. It is a quick job. Also works good on chest hair. It uses a fixed power cord with no battery inside unlike some other Wahls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Wahl 9918-6171 which is intended for beards but have used on my head. That one cuts slightly closer with the 1/16 attachment but it takes longer since the blade is not as wide or motor as strong. This one runs on a battery which has lasted for years unlike the Wahl Groomsman T-Pro (#9860-1101) which I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> As described...attachments are kind of flimsy but expected this as it&#x27;s a lower priced model....only time will tell on how it holds up.</li>
    <li> This works. I had tried Wahl&#x27;s cordless version and was disappointed, but this one has the power needed to actually trim a beard.</li>
    <li> Worked fine but  seems like you have to add oil to the tip every time you use it. It only comes with a small amount of oil in the package for lubricant.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers to cut my dogs hair &amp; perfect.  Came in fast &amp; packaged great!  I recomend this porduct!</li>
    <li> This thing (made in America) can really cut hair! So much so, that you have to use a guard on it, elsewise, you may cut your skin. Well built, and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> its makes too much noise</li>
    <li> Nice unit, love the size ranges.</li>
    <li> This machine does what it says, it is really reliable, efficient. Blades are sharp,well aligned. If you use it twice it pays the price.I have 3 son so hair cut is a business in my place. My old shaver was very dull and less powerful. I choose this corded model because even though being cordless gives you enough space to move around during hair cut I find that corded models always more powerful and does the job smoothly without making you stop few times and clean the blades. Color guide is good for beginners but since I do this long time I didn&#x27;t need  the colors, I even fit my old machine&#x27;s( Con air-cordless) black attachments to this one. It fit perfectly, gave me couple of other cutting lengths I didn&#x27;t have. A good, powerful very well priced hair cutter.</li>
    <li> The haircutting kit works fine so far.  I did part of it myself around the ears and had my wife do areas I couldn&#x27;t see.  I doubt if I&#x27;ll go to a barber again.  The different height attachments are great--you don&#x27;t have to know what you&#x27;re doing and it comes out fine anyway as long as you go from long hair to short.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper set so I could save a few bucks every month at the barber shop by doing essentially what the barber does with his set of clippers.  My two main concerns prior to purchase were: (1) Is the motor powerful enough to get the job done well? and (2) Are there enough attachments to cover the various lengths of cutting needed?      The answer to both concerns are YES.  My haircuts look just as good as what I&#x27;ve been getting done at the barber each month.  Plus, I&#x27;m saving over $100 per year in haircuts as it only took two haircuts to break even on this purchase.  There is also a $5 rebate available on Wahl&#x27;s web site for this model in addition to other similar models, thereby making this purchase an even greater value!    So for the performance at this value, you can&#x27;t beat it and why I am rating it as 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Perfect 100%. will give you 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> Bought these to cut my son&#x27;s hair. I have no complaints. They did a good job. The instructional guide with the colored combs were helpful. I save money by cutting my son&#x27;s hair versus going to the barbershop. They paid for themselves on the first cut.</li>
    <li> It works.  Wahl makes good clippers.  I like that it comes with .5 and 1.5 gauges.  My only complaint is that it does not have a built in trimmer like my previous version.</li>
    <li> I expected this trimmer to be a low quality option for quick haircuts. I&#x27;ve purchased various hair trimmers previously from different manufacturers, and they are always light plastic cheap devices that break within a few months, even under moderate use.  Puny.  Puny!  It&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t designed to handle a man&#x27;s glorious mane.   But this trimmer, THIS trimmer, however, is sturdy and solid, with a heavy metal casing that really gives it some weight.  I feel like I could crack open walnuts with it, or defend the realm from invading armies.  When you look at the packaging, you have an expectation of a glorified beard trimmer in a festive mood.  That is to say, it&#x27;s bright and colorful and curvy, which suggests it&#x27;s going to be underpowered or fragile.  But no - this thing has gravitas, and you know it from the moment you pick it up, and then proceed to hammer in nails through hardened steel.  I turned it on and was pleased with the roaring, powerful warcry it emitted.  Yes, it is a little on the loud side, but lots of awesome things are.  Like television, and LIONS.  Lions are awesome.  What do you people have against lions?  Nothing, that&#x27;s what.    I then ran it through the brutal obstacle course of my head, throwing endless armies of brambled follicles, the kind with mean streaks and meaner grins, who drink straight from the milk jug and don&#x27;t wash their hands enough, and have tattoos with the names of all their enemies and ex-lovers.  Hair with tattoos, you heard it here first.  The trimmer took one look and mowed them down with relaxed fury, literally cutting them down to size (eight available with this set, create your own style today!) in crisp, uniform lengths.  I was so impressed that I went out and trimmed the lawn and some tree branches (which work best with the 3/4\\&quot; attachment).  Note: Product not authorized for landscaping work, I playfully made that up.  Doublenote: OR WAS I?  Because you certainly wouldn&#x27;t know once you fire this baby up and watch it bring on the POWER.  I would caution using this without an attachment/guard on it, as you are liable to cut yourself if you press it directly.  So do use some caution.  If you&#x27;re a wimp, that is.  Not me though, but I feel the need to warn all the other wimps out there.  You wimps, you.  You can also pair this up with different attachments from Wahl, including [[ASIN:B000UZEQK0 Wahl #12 clipper guide comb, 1&amp;1/2.]] for longer style cuts.  They snap right on without issue, useful for those wanting heftier styles.  This does lend some useful versatility to the product, which I appreciate.  You will appreciate it too.  The case gets the job done, but it does lack any kind of internal organization - there&#x27;s nothing to slot the attachments into, for example.  Things will jumble around and get disorganized, but this is a minor complaint.  There is enough room for another few attachments in addition to the included stock, as it is roomy enough to accommodate a few added accessories.   The cord could probably bit a tiny bit longer.  Most things are better longer.  Except for hair, which is why you are buying this thing in the first place.  In short: highly recommended.  Manly recommended.  Grab you one and unleash the wonderful mightiness.  Hold it high above your newly clean-cut head and watch lighting bolts dance behind you as you part the heavens in your magnificence.</li>
    <li> Great product to use at home. Slightly heavy and vibrates a bit but still does the job. The different color coded clippers are also great. Easy to clean. I like it so far... I have used it 3-4 times since my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very good product i buy for a gift to my husband and is real nice ! I recommended</li>
    <li> This kit is amazing and works super well on my boyfriends hair. Has so many cool parts and gets the job done easy and quick. Such a cheap steal</li>
    <li> This thing simply stop working half way cutting my husband&#x27;s hair. He adjust the power screw, and even when the power setting is max, the thing still wasn&#x27;t vibrating enough to even it was making very loud noise. We also notice that the thing that supposed to be vibrating and attached to the blade was not aligned properly.   Don&#x27;t waste your time, get a better one. Returned.</li>
    <li> Works well, it blows my previous haircutter out of water.</li>
    <li> So I decided to start cutting my own hair to save some money and just to learn a new thing. I bought this after reading all the good reviews. The clipper works great and my hair looks good. The instruction are really good. They helped me a lot. The only con is the case. The case doesn&#x27;t have sections to keep the kit organize.</li>
    <li> it heats up very quickly</li>
    <li> i tried a different brand before that had a weak motor. total waste of money.  this one has a powerful motor.  plenty of attachments for the entire family.  no grabbing/pulling.  good price especially with the mail in rebate.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Hair cutting\\&quot; hasn&#x27;t been an issue for years (I wish the little that&#x27;s left on top would just go away) but this machine is powerful enough to easily handle a thick beard, &amp; comes with enough attachments (combs from 1/16 to 1\\&quot;) to handle anything you might want to do w/ it. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work as well on the top of someone&#x27;s head as it works on my beard. Previous clipper (NOT a Wahl) used to trip moisture-resistant circuit in bathroom several times while trimming beard. This clipper doesn&#x27;t. Couldn&#x27;t be happier w/ it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to cut my own hair. I hate paying for and getting haircuts. This works real well. I just leave the dark blue comb guide and have no problems. Edit: Now I just use it without a comb. It also works on beards very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hint: before starting the cutter up the first time, I highly recommend oiling the blades. The factory may not have oiled the blades and if started they may freeze up. Place the unused oil straight up on an out-of-the-way shelf, so it does not leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how wide and powerful this was. Cutting my hair for the first time was a breeze!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, cuts like a dream, and pretty quiet. Amazing price for what you get!</li>
    <li> Wahl getting a little cheaper with the product but still better than most brands.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace some old clippers that jammed when they got hot. after reading the reviews I thought I had a winner with these clippers. These clippers where heavy, loud and didn&#x27;t cut my hair it instead pulled on it. I adjusted the power screw but at the setting that will actually cut my hair the noise in unbearable. I guess its back to my old clippers.</li>
    <li> WAHL has been a great brand for years!  Works great and seems quality.  The color coded &amp;#34;cheat sheet&amp;#34; on the handle is really convenient for grabbing the right length head.</li>
    <li> That hair cutter , not sharp</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  However, it has in a year now broken.  The motor now just hums but it doesn&#x27;t clip anything.  Maybe this is just because I paid $20 for it, however I have read reviews where it has lasted people years.  This is my second wahl because I love how it clips my hair and trips facial hair.  I thought the first one was just bad luck, but now this is two.  I do not drop them, get them wet, leave it plugged in, and I clean them regularly.  Maybe I have had just bad luck?  I have also tried contacting them via e-mail on both of them, and never heard anything back.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> I did my first hair cut on myself within minutes of delivery and could not be happier with my first attempt. I am confident I will only  get better with practice and this hair cutting kit is up to the task. The number of tools you get with this kit for very little money and the quality of the trimmer is exceptional! It will pay for itself after 1 1/2 haircuts. Lastly, after always having to trim or re-do mistakes from paid stylist, it will be a nice bonus not to have to engage in short talk and keep my $ in my wallet. Thank you very much WAHL and Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I love the Walh brand and will never say anything to hurt their reputation. This particular product, however, just isn&#x27;t suitable to my hair type, and because I ordered it from Japan, I am mostly stuck with it and don&#x27;t want to bother re-sending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My have short, straight hair, and wrongly believed this item could shave my head bald. At first, I thought it was the blades that needed oiling or adjustment. Took it apart and readjusted it according to the manual, but I realized quickly that this is not the kind I needed. Maybe this was my mistake for not reading the description properly, but I purchased a Walh balding product before and it lasted me for 10 years (left it before my travel to Japan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wrongly assumed I guess, that all Walh items could do a really close cut, but that&#x27;s not the case with this one. I wish they had written on it (NOT a BALDING shaver, oh well)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought another one and it&#x27;s arriving in two weeks. I will be happy with that one, for now, I have a useless product on my hands.</li>
    <li> Just got tired of paying so much for a \\&quot;crew cut\\&quot; I now just cut my own hair with a #1 all around! The clippers paid for itself the first month \\&quot;sorry barbers...\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Great working cutter for price.  Replaced worn  Wahl and wife is pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been able to save the money from 4 or 5 haircuts using this, which has more than paid for it.</li>
    <li> I buzz my head to the lowest setting every week or so. I also trim other areas of body hair, mostly b/c no one needs to be a big hairy beast. This works well for any body hair. To be fair, I have straight, thin blondish hair, so not tough for these types of things to cut. I&#x27;ve had it for like a year now and keep it clean quickly and it hasn&#x27;t gotten stuck, rusty, or stopped working. Good quality and has a bunch of stuff with it. I use two things, so it&#x27;s mostly wasted on me, but nice to know that I could start cutting other ppl&#x27;s hair if I want. Though that would be weird.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Great value.  Replaceable and available cutting blades.</li>
    <li> came quicker than expected gotta love that now just gotta test it&lt;br /&gt;great deal for what your paying!!!! hopefully it will last me a few months i&#x27;ll come back and update with results after a few weeks</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an old Conair kit that was on its last legs. The quality of this kit is great. I don&#x27;t really use the color-coding since it&#x27;s just my husband&#x27;s hair that I cut, but I figure it&#x27;s a good option in case I ever have a son whose hair I need to cut! The motor is VERY powerful and loud, so powerful that it numbs my hand after only a minute or two of using it! It&#x27;s not a problem since I only do that step for a couple of minutes, but it&#x27;s kind of annoying. The scissors, comb, etc. are standard. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with this kit! I think it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
    <li> A year later, I&#x27;m still using it. Great for the hair, good on the beard. So easy to use and so under 20 bucks it has already paid for itself 10 times over in saved money from hair cuts. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I love the fact I can cut my own hair!  Not only do I save some money, but I don&#x27;t need to worry about some sketchy barber asking me if I like sports while he appears to grind his pelvis on my arms in the chair.  I&#x27;d give six stars if i could...5 for quality plus 1 for personal comfort.</li>
    <li> great product I used it both for my husband and my dog... shhhhh.  don&#x27;t tell the dog.. LOL... has all the guards you need.  great power.  easy clean up. perfect to just trim my husband&#x27;s hair...</li>
    <li> They work good, didn&#x27;t notice any pulling of hair, they are a little on the big side compared to what I was used to, had been using the cordless ones. But they cut good and fast and well worth the price especially with all the included attachments. I however splurged and purchased the Oster Fast Feed and I am extremely happy with the Oster.</li>
    <li> Have 2 other Wahl Clipper sets and I like this best because it is smaller/lighter than the others. Only complaint is that the 1&amp;#34; Comb was broken but I can use one from the other sets.</li>
    <li> Really good value for the price. Motor is very strong and can cut even a Poodles hair without pulling or snagging. If Ihe dogs will sit still, your kids will also.</li>
    <li> Our old one petered out~!  We bought this and it is amazing the difference.  They are exactly what we wanted</li>
    <li> Love that it comes with tracers, my brother wanted one really bad but has never used it, very easy to use and learn.</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to go to the barber shop anymore</li>
    <li> I normally sport a buzz cut that I get at a local shop for about $15.00, I bought this item for about $5.00 dollars more than the haircut!!!  It gives me the same result and saved me a lot of money not to mention the gas it takes to get there.  The device has a good amount of power, and has a comb length legend right on the device so no chance of loosing that.  Also it comes in a reusable case!(Unique in this day of selling less for more) A must buy for anyone who sports a simple haircut.</li>
    <li> As always I can never get that longer look im going for, I do wish they made slightly longer guards. other then that for the price and the way it cuts its an over all deal i can live with.</li>
    <li> Had these for over a year now, great power and no signs of dulling.</li>
    <li> The clippers meet my needs. I wanted a 1&amp;#34; guard and this fit the bill. I really wanted a rechargeable clipper prior to reviewing the cost. This item does the trick.</li>
    <li> Great Product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> On time delivery and worked great.</li>
    <li> My father in law is a barber and I have gotten used to his $300 clippers being used on my kids.  So when he went on an extended vacation, I was VERY nervous about clipping my boy&#x27;s hair with crappy clippers.  (He happened to take his with him.)  I have a 15 month old who is VERY active and I was terrified to clip it because I just KNEW he&#x27;d be fighting to see/feel/lick them.  Finally I caved.  I did TONS of research and decided on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time, perfect condition, and get this... they were so quiet, my son almost didn&#x27;t even notice I was cutting his hair!!  Holy crap.  I was blown away!  I&#x27;m no longer going to wait for someone else to cut my kid&#x27;s hair now that I have these.  PHEW!  What a relief.</li>
    <li> Too heavy, too noisy and vibrates too roughly. Have dropped it in the Salvation Army Thrift bag and hope it will be able to find service with someone, but I will never attempt to use it again.</li>
    <li> I love these I cut my hair without any help due to the easy to use guards.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after first time using it</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and cuts my hair perfectly.  Update: Just wanted to add that I have very short (close/caesar cut) hair, so it may or not be good for those with longer hair.</li>
    <li> So far ive only used once to cut my own hair nothing fancy just a quick number 5 all over worked good and experienced no problems ill update if anything comes up</li>
    <li> The clippers work perfectly and my husbands cut looks great!</li>
    <li> When haircuts are going for $12 to $20 a piece (plus tip), this little unit is worth three times what they are charging for it. This is the old-school model (with a genuine old fashioned electrical cord attached). For a basic no frills hair-cut, anybody can learn to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice, forget about using the mirror and just go by feel--check the mirror afterwards to identify areas where a touch-up might be needed.</li>
    <li> the cutter is very nice and still working after 3 years, even on a heavy duty use. nice colors and no issues with.</li>
    <li> Probably five stars with more practice. I cut my own hair to include a hand held mirror to do the back of my head. It&#x27;s well built, and definitely enough accessories right down to step by step pictures how to cut each section of the head. If you just want to trim, I&#x27;d go with something else. This is for regular haircuts. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver, coming with all the trimming lengths it has it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
    <li> I bought a clipper set many years ago (long lost) but never used it. The woman I was with didnt want to try using it and mess my hair up. I never imagained trying to cut my own hair. - - Well I bought this color coded clipper set and followed the well illustrated instructions. Using it the very first time was easy and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I paid for these clippers on the first haircut.</li>
    <li> Solid build. Sharp blades. Feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years, and have been using these clippers for the last 4 or 5 years. They still work great, but I just ordered a second set, in case they do eventually wear out on me. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. The color coded various sized attachments are nice too, to help you keep them straight.</li>
    <li> Great cheap hair cutter. Comes with many attachments, more than enough functionality for my hair cutting needs. It has saved me a lot of money and time over the past year of use, and feels very well built and durable.   Comes with a handy bag and is portable. Most of all, it is very easy to use, even for people who do not have experience cutting hair. The different snap on combs are color coded and super simple to use.  No complaints, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It is a great deal, it is worth its price!</li>
    <li> I was nervous as these were so inexpensive.  I&#x27;ve used them for a few months and these things are awesome.  Much nicer than my old ones.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military and prefers to shave his head due to the heat. It helps keep his head cooler. He used to have to get his head shaved 2 or 3 times during the summer. With this clipper, I am able to shave his head for him instead of my husband paying a barber to shave his hear 2 or 3 times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very powerful clipper and runs smoothly. It took me a few tries to figure out the perfect speed so I do not have to go over it a second time. The clippers are easy to clean and I high recommend you find some Andis 12750 Cool Care Plus on Amazon to disinfect and lube those clippers to extend the life of the clippers!</li>
    <li> Hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and this product has turned out to be very good, easy to handle and excellent quality. You can really feel the quality. We are pleased with the quality of this product as well as all the accessories that were included. Would buy again. quiet and smooth operation.I have been very happy with this. Now I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and this unit is a professional haircutting Kit.  The cut is very tight and quick to finish. great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get this.  Happy it is made in the USA!  No complaints here!!!! SOOOOO much better than the &#x27;Conair&#x27; or other brands I&#x27;ve purchased before!</li>
    <li> Cheaper then the &amp;#34;pet trimmers&amp;#34; and basically the same thing. Works great, very satisfied thus far. The quality is strong and I&#x27;m sure it will last as long as our dog.</li>
    <li> I bought this today after reading reviews that it has a powerful motor. I usually get a #2 on the side, and #5 on top. I haven&#x27;t had a haircut in 4 months, so my hair was a long and thick. This clipper cut right through it, no problems. Only bogged down twice.     This is the first time I cut my own hair. It turned out as good as the barber. This comes with good instructions, and links to Wahl&#x27;s website with videos showing how to give different haircuts. It says to start with a thick guide. But, since I knew I always get #2 and #5, I did that, using #3 &amp; 4 to blend the side and top. Turned out fine.    I usually pay $15 (including tip), but save money by delaying haircuts for 3-4. If this thing lasts 2-3 years, I&#x27;m going to save $120-$180. Plus, I&#x27;ll cut my hair more often.    For the price, I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of the clipper. It&#x27;s heavy and the motor feels powerful. The plastic case leaves a little to be desired. Everything&#x27;s loose in it. And, I worry the plastic guides won&#x27;t last long. But, for $20, it almost paid for itself with the first cut.    I&#x27;m usually leery of cheap products. I was going to spend $120-$150 for a professional-grade Oster Classic 76. But, since I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair before, I was worried about making that kind of investment. Based on the positive reviews, I gambled on this Wahl. I&#x27;m glad I did. The quality is definitely worth more than the $20 price. And, the instructional materials were valuable for a first-timer like me.    I was thinking when this breaks (after the experience I would have obtained at a low price) I might invest in a professional clipper. But, I don&#x27;t know. If it lasts 2-3 years it&#x27;s probably a better value to pay $20 for that length of use compared to a more expensive pro model requiring blade sharpening, replaced motor brushes, etc.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and started cutting my children&#x27;s (boys) hair myself.  The younger one was easy because his curls are so tight that any mistakes I made with be sucked into his head.  I just did his whole head in the longest length, then used one 3 levels down for the sides and just went from bottom to top and stopped when it felt right.  It worked out pretty well.  Just need to keep the blades clean and lubricated and it is like cutting through butter.</li>
    <li> My first shaver came defective, would not turn on. Amazon sent me a new one in no time. Very easy process... Anyways, I have used the other Wahl hair trimmer that is black and chrome but it was getting old so I bought this one. This one is cooler looking and the colors are great. Not sure if it is really any different, but it works astonishingly well and on top of it was cheaper than the black and chrome one. Great trimmer, great value. I have had it for about a month and still running smooth. I could see this thing lasting a long time, but of course I have not had the shaver long enough to submit a review of its durability over time. It&#x27;s only a 20 dollar trimmer. If it last a year, I have no complaints. I could see it lasting up to 5 years easily as long as it is kept clean</li>
    <li> Well-built...excellent value!  Not too clumsy, or too heavy, where I cannot cut my own hair.  Professional job from first use!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be when I ordered.  I&#x27;m sure that this is a great product for the people who need it, but I did not need it and was looking for a product to trim my beard.  I guess I&#x27;ll read the product description better next time.</li>
    <li> Bought this set about 7 years ago to remove unwanted body hair. About 2 1/2 years ago, I finally used it to give myself a haircut. Excellent results first time so I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair ever since. I&#x27;m always happy with the results-unlike most trips to the salon or barber shop. This clipper set has literally saved me $100s of dollars in mediocre barber shop cuts and I&#x27;m still using the original blade. Very high quality tool!!</li>
    <li> It Works Very Good But I Got A Older Model That I Like Better That Is What I Thought I Was Buying.But My Grandson Keeps Borrowing My Older Model And I Wanted Something Personal To Trim My Beard.</li>
    <li> works very loudly as drill drills on concrete, so I can not Stritch it ... very scary sound .. certainly would return, but proshol time until I unpacked it ... waste of money</li>
    <li> Very nice, I&#x27;ve bought these at the base before and they last a long time</li>
    <li> This product came well packed and in a nice case it cut very well and has been a Real delight to use vs. an electric razor with hair clipping attachments I would certainly recommend is for an at home haircut</li>
    <li> good, is so strong. easy use.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Does not work properly</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend. She loves it. Works great for her, and had great guides.</li>
    <li> Not for commercial use</li>
    <li> I was badly in need of a simple to use, but good beard and hair trimmer. Most trimmers only have certain guards and are not great for beards, while some get clogged with hair and really fail to give a decent haircut. I must say though that this trimmer has been great. The color coded blades make finding and keeping a length easy, while the trimmer itself does a fantastic job of getting a close hair cut and a good beard trim. The only negative, which does not really affect the trimmer&#x27;s quality, is that the adjustment bar on the side of the trimmer can be a bit stiff. I really do not use it though, and I am able to use it when I need it as well. I def. recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very good clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> ...but this has saved me a lot on hair cuts. The attachments are easy to use, and these clippers have already paid for themselves.</li>
    <li> I received the product, and everything was flawless, except for the fact the ONE clipper I wanted to use (the 1inch) was broken. Now, while I used it and achieved a good hair style for myself, I&#x27;m just upset one of the plastic head pieces for the clipper was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll change my rating should I get a new one.</li>
    <li> Good product and helps the job done well.</li>
    <li> I liked this product so well for trimming my beard that I bought this one for my son.&lt;br /&gt;My son liked how well my beard always looked.&lt;br /&gt;I experimented with the various cutter attachments to find the right one for keeping&lt;br /&gt;my beard trimmed to the right length.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re both very happy with unit for our beard trimming.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; well made clippers. I bought these to save on money in going to the hair dresser all the time. They have been working great. I have my wife cut my hair every two weeks to keep my hair looking nice and short. So far we have had no problems with these clippers.</li>
    <li> Love this...cut hair really great, has a heavy weigh to it and just a very professional clippers for the price with all the attachments, and the case that came with it is great also.</li>
    <li> Cuts my hair better than my 10 year old Vidal Sassoon (which to be fair is 10 years old and still cuts).  I like the color coded guide combs and the instruction manual tips on cutting hair.  I plan on having this clipper for another 10 years or so!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. No battery means needing a power outlet. Perfectly works. a little bit short power cord, recommend buyers should have a extended cord.</li>
    <li> Just used for my 2nd cut and I must say it works great. I still need  practice with the blending the sides and top, but that should come with more use. Considering every haircut was $15 -$20 it already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the color-coded, different length attachments. Makes it easy to quickly grab the right length for each of us who want a different length cut. A great family hair cutting kit.</li>
    <li> I had another what for 25 years. My dog chewed the combs. I though I would get another one that might be better. It seems to cut the same. I like the container and the colored combs. It does a good job on my hair, which is probably average hair (what is left of it anyway). However, it does not do a very good job on my boy, who has ultra fine very curly hair.</li>
    <li> I use this haircutting kit to do my hubby&#x27;s hair. It has everything in one kit. This kit is super easy to handle. The color comb system is very informative. I can choose different color comb to achieve satisfying length of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really cute to include left/right ear area comb as well. The ear area combs are dedicated to cutting hairs around ears, meanwhile generating protections to ears. I really like the ear comb design. Very smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also comes with lubricant and tiny comb for lubricating the cutter. The whole kit has everything I need and is quite compact. Easy to store. My hubby likes the best hair length after about 1 month of one fresh cut. We&#x27;ll stick to this kit now.</li>
    <li> Excellent for what I payed I like easy to use, comes with a manual handy not al bulky. You have to clean I though it can get tricky.</li>
    <li> I have used the Wahl clippers 4 times already and they work really well.  The blades are sharp and cut beautifully.  There are a number of cutting options and Wahl tells you how to get started.  I am very happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> Best price 4 easy 2 use buzz</li>
    <li> This is a nice little clipper which is very sharp and easy to use.  It will work well for my husband and son&#x27;s summer buzz cuts.  Great price.  It will pay for itself after just a few haircuts.</li>
    <li> Clippers work great and made in the USA.</li>
    <li> It does the job great, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs. It&#x27;s difficult to fade with, personally, but it delivers clean cuts with great power. For the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LIVE IN VENEZUELA AND IT CAME BROKE, I CAN´T RETURN IT SO I LOSE MY MONEY ..</li>
    <li> I liked it, still work to this day</li>
    <li> Works fine.. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good thing, my son liked it very much</li>
    <li> Very heavy clippers. More of a professional use than @ home styling.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy product. It seems durable and easy to use. Just one of the plastic that is used to cover the blade while stationary was damaged in the box. But it&#x27;s not really that important. Other attachments are good, but I haven&#x27;t used it that much so don&#x27;t know if it would sturdy enough for a professional barber. For a single hand use, it is a perfect product.</li>
    <li> I have to leave this here. Item just arrived, and upon inspection, it looks like the clippers themselves have been dropped or are otherwise used. On top of there being some sort of debris caught in the trimmer heads, there are scuff marks on the body of it and the lever is visibly banged up. Photo attached. Not sure whether to proceed with a return or what, but it would be nice to have an explanation... ???</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. Not great. It misses hair the first 10 times you pass through. Not nearly good enough for professional use though. Next time I buy a clipper, I&#x27;ll spend the money on a high quality one.</li>
    <li> The clippers arrived on time and in good condition. I have cut mine, and my boys hair for years and I have not found a product better than Wahl. I was pleasantly surprised at the assortment of attachments, especially the angled comb that tapers the hair around the ear. Also, the material that makes up the grip on the clippers makes holding them very comfortable. I believe these were appropriately priced and would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm on our dogs</li>
    <li> Great price and cut good.</li>
    <li> This product performed as expected. It is a good value at this price point.</li>
    <li> Worked great on long-haired cats</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers. I use these to trim my beard and they work well. Not very loud and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Quality product.  Works great</li>
    <li> Really Really Disappointed with this product. It stopped working after 3-4 months of use. I might have used hardly 4-5 times so far, Motor runs too slowly and can&#x27;t be used. I wrote to customer care before writing this review. But no one has even acknowledged my mail - forget about attending my plea.</li>
    <li> works great! scissors that come with it are stiff and had to buy others.</li>
    <li> A great pair of clippers with every length guard imaginable, color coded which is nice.  I would recommend to anyone needing hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great.  It comes with instructions on how to trim men&#x27;s hair which is very helpful.  The number of attachments that it comes with makes it very versatile.</li>
    <li> First ever home haircut. The Wahl did great! Easy to read and follow instructions made cutting my hair simple and it looks like a barber cut it!</li>
    <li> Wow!!! These are the best clippers I have ever had! I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband and boys&#x27; hair for 25+ years and these clippers have the most attachment sizes, best power, and easiest to handle of any set.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years and think they work great!  I cut my hair weekly being in the Marine Corps and I get a solid 6 months out of these things before I buy a new set cause they are so cheap.</li>
    <li> great hair clippers for anyone that cuts hair at home- great product and lots of guides to help  and great directions</li>
    <li> The gloves arrived quickly and the fit was correct.  Able to work easily with the gloves and providing good use of the fingers to grip tools, etc.</li>
    <li> Snagged hair terribly no matter what I did. Had to return it. Good news is the motor was not loud as some other reviews suggest.</li>
    <li> I WANTED A TRIMMER NOT A BARBER SHOP SET OF CLIPPERS</li>
    <li> Very good clipper, I like it.</li>
    <li> been cutting my own hair for years - and these do a good job and have/will order again.</li>
    <li> so far so good though only used it once my 2 year old is quiet content with it as well!</li>
    <li> All very good, responsible and punctual, I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> quality and professional product, very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my toddlers hair. Its not too long, i can quickly cut and then fade the hair. And i am NOT a professional. A couple of youtube videos and the instructions included helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this product because of the name, the pricing, and because I thought it was a pet haircutting kit. Needless to say, I found out that it was for humans but I still used it to shave down my cat. It worked flawlessly and I&#x27;d definitely recommend purchasing this product and with all the accessories that come with it, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying for a haircut on an older head that was loosing a lot of its hair.  I decided that I could cut my own hair, with the help of my wife, and save a few bucks.  This piece of equipment works well and It has already paid for itself in free haircuts.</li>
    <li> still have it 2 years and working</li>
    <li> Since I bought it a month and a half ago, I have used it 2 times for shaving my beard, the second time I was in the middle of my shaving and suddenly an explosion and the light of my house start to flicking. It was toasted, on my second shaved, may be it was a non usual failed machine, but I have finished with beautiful paperweights.</li>
    <li> I used it once for haircutting. The two pieces of clippers are very convenient. A little noisy. But it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
    <li> .. my old Wahl had a more mechanical flip-style switch instead of this light-switch style.  It works as well (in terms as being a shaver) and I think the switch will hold up better (the old one developed a short pretty quickly.)</li>
    <li> First one came broken....second one is working like a champ.  If your clipper makes an extremely loud sound and is poor at cutting; return it.  This clipper works great.  I thought i was wasting my money after the first one came defective.  Boy i was wrong!!  Great deal at $20.</li>
    <li> we purchased this particular clipper based off of ratings.  we enjoy our purchase and meets the needs of our home.  it cuts our boys hair no problem and have only used a couple times.  no problem with shipping.</li>
    <li> Best set of $20 clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Plus in one hair cut I basically made my money right back, considering I&#x27;d be going to a barber anyways, every cut after that is a save.</li>
    <li> This Wahl clippers works very good and all of the pieces that came with it was a really nice surprise. I am not experienced at cutting my dogs hair but I would recommend this to everyone</li>
    <li> My son has been terrified of clippers since he was 12 months old. We decided to wait until he was older to try again. He is 4 now, and we just needed to get rid of all that hair! He was apprehensive when he first saw them, but they were not loud at all, and I didn&#x27;t notice any tugging or pulling when I cut his hair. They made his first REAL haircut (not just a trim with scissors) a breeze!</li>
    <li> Quit working after just a few months. Other than that issue and now having to buy a new set, they were good. Won&#x27;t buy them again though due to how quick they quit.</li>
    <li> This hair cutting kit has everything you need to do a decent job cutting someone&#x27;s hair. All the attachments are clearly marked and color coordinated. With a little practice, the included instructions should allow most people to achieve decent results. Had no issues with the quality of the cutter and included accessories. If anyone would like to save some money form the barber shop they should give this a try.</li>
    <li> for this price it&#x27;s the best you can get...noise is not noticeable clippers are really useful..it&#x27;s just the design that i didn&#x27;t like otherwise i was very satisfied with this product and by the way it&#x27;s probably the best haircut kit from Wahl so far</li>
    <li> Good product, great price.  Have only used it a couple times on my son and husband but its powerful and fast.  It came with many attachments and some blade oil, carry case and scissors which is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Been using it for many months now and LOVE it...easy to use, easy to clean, and just keeps on cutting.  No regrets on this buy!</li>
    <li> Honestly was not expecting much for the price, but was pleasantly surprised! Not the best clippers on the market, but they are far better then my previous set of clippers. They cut great and have plenty of attachments that I will never use, haha. They are not too loud when on and it has a nice feel to it, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, feels very well built. Only things I don&#x27;t like is the case it comes in, everything is loose and there is no organization, all the pieces just kind of sit in it. That, and I am not wild about the power switch, but hey, for $25 these two quips are not enough to justify anything lower then a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Great product for us guys that like to keep our hair short.  Why pay a barber $10.00 when you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I cut my son&#x27;s hair.  Over the years I&#x27;ve been through 2 Conair&#x27;s which weren&#x27;t too bad.  However, he always complained of it pulling his hair really hard.  I decided to spend more money this time and get a more professional model.  I&#x27;ve used it twice already and it cuts smoothly and he hasn&#x27;t complained about it pulling his hair.  Be careful the first time you use it though.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s different but the first time I used it I used the same # length guard as I used with the Conair and it cut a lot shorter.  So to be safe you may want to err on the side of starting with a higher # and moving down if you need to.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gets the job done, Comes wii ugh ask the attachments you need. Quality product for the right price.</li>
    <li> Have had many sets of clippers, these ones are cheap but work as good or better than any of the others I have had.  Way better than the last set which was a different brand.  Wahl clippers are the best by far!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;On/off&amp;#34; switch is poorly designed and broke right away. Buy another product. This is a waste of money. Also cuts poorly.</li>
    <li> 1.It looks really wonderful .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.But what confused me is that Why it heats and smokes at my first using?</li>
    <li> Like everything else made in China don&#x27;t drop it on a hard surface or the metal pins will snap right off - &amp;#34;tempered steel&amp;#34; means something else apparently nowadays like um &amp;#34;cheap cast random alloy almost steel&amp;#34; you like?</li>
    <li> works great, has everything in it.  Recommend great price too.</li>
    <li> Work great, just like our old Wahls.</li>
    <li> its nice, but if you will use it out of the usa, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I thought but it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
    <li> I get my hair cut every 3-4 weeks at Great Clips for $22. So on average I spend close to $300/yr on getting my hair cut, and that&#x27;s a cheap cut that starts looking funky. I used to go to a barbershop that charged $46 for a basic haircut, but after three months I realized it wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second pair of Wahl clippers. I had gotten a more expensive set a few years ago, but could never get myself to do the first cut (I was going to cut it myself). Ended up gifting it to a friend who promptly began cutting his own hair, and very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally picked this up in lieu of going to GC, and after briefly looking at the cutting instructions, began cutting my own hair. (I wear glasses that I had to remove, which was also pretty terrifying). I used #4 for the bottom section of my hair, #5 for the middle, and the top #8 for the top of my head. I haven&#x27;t gotten to doing the ears myself yet, but seeing how I did it myself with no glasses on (-5/-5.25 vision, so it&#x27;s pretty bad!) and got good results, I don&#x27;t see it being too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think making the decision to cut my own hair is one of the best cost cutting methods that&#x27;ll save me hundreds each year. If I do need a good quality haircut, I&#x27;ll just go into the barbershop and cough up the extra money, but otherwise, now that I&#x27;ve taken the first step to cut my own hair, I&#x27;ll just do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, until you&#x27;re really comfortable with how you like your hair, use the largest guards and work your way down until you&#x27;re satisfied with the length!</li>
    <li> I love this clipper, this powerhouse definitely gets the job done day in and day out!!!</li>
    <li> Good value, I don&#x27;t know what more I&#x27;d need for trimming hair.</li>
    <li> These work amazingly well for the price. I love the color coded guards, it makes it very easy to see which one you are looking for. I was able to give haircuts to my husband and 3 sons very quickly and easily. They look great and the money I saved on taking them to the Haircut place more than pays for the set.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. As always, very happy with this purchase from Amazon - I am usually very happy with almost all of my Amazon purchases as this is where I do my research first and buy the items with the best reviews! We live, work and travel full-time from our motorhome and my hubby was getting sick and tired of having to go out and find a reasonably priced place to get his hair cut every month from a new location. He suggested we get one of these and I cut his hair! I was a bit scared of stuffing it up as I have never cut hair before - on anyone - but figured at such a cheap price it was worth a try. I have to say, following the instructions they provide and using the different comb lengths provided, my first attempt turned out very well! I was a bit braver the second time and cut it a bit shorter and it looks great on him. For the cost of just one haircut with tip at Great Clips or similar, hubby now has a new hairdresser (me) and I am confident using these powerful clippers, They do a good job! I was surprised they are not cordless so I have to cut his hair close to an electrical outlet but no big deal... it&#x27;s powerful, does the job and is now saving us about $250 a year - above all, it&#x27;s super convenient for me to be able to cut his hair anytime, amy place we like - saving time, hassle, driving, finding new places etc. Can&#x27;t believe the value for money being under $20! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This arrived as promised and works well, however  the first one I received had a broken blade guard so after contacting Amazon they sent me a second one and it is broken too. I&#x27;m not sure why these are broken but quality control might need to be checking a little further since we received two in a row that were broken.</li>
    <li> Oh man does this thing cut you down the size.  Or, cut you up, depending on where you place it.  Jeez, I likely wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I have known how sharp it truly is.  I will say that the adapters don&#x27;t really do much, and never cut very close.  So, you&#x27;re crap outta luck if you don&#x27;t have a huge Brian Wilson beard.  You will put this thing on your face, and you will feel it.  In fact, if you cut your hair with it, you will feel it if it even touches your skin.  You will be left with a scrape or two, here and there, regarding cutting hair on the scalp with it.  Your neck will not take too kindly to it, and you will be left with welts, etc.  They sting like hell, when it&#x27;s all said and done.  But, if you want a clean shave, here it is.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> I use one of these for cutting my fiances hair and then I also purchased one to trim my yorkies and it works perfectly for my needs.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to for a good price.</li>
    <li> great clippers .. i love them i am old and it don&#x27;t matter how good they cut.. as long as i can cut the hair from my face</li>
    <li> Works well, but it seems that the large combs are easy to break.</li>
    <li> stopped working after a month !</li>
    <li> Works really well but vibrates excessively, to the point of irritating my hand.</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Great value.  Really like the color coded guards.</li>
    <li> The shortest it goes is without any guards which would be just like a shaver for your face that leaves a slight stubble.  This is what i use it for as I&#x27;m bald!</li>
    <li> Just used the clippers for the first time.  They were plenty powerful and surprisingly quiet.  The length guides seem like they might be prone to breaking (the plastic feels brittle), but they&#x27;ve held up so far.  Heck, for the price, if I get two hair cuts out of these I&#x27;ll break even.  My first impression is that this handy set will hold up for much, much longer.  Definitely a worthwhile investment for anyone sick of paying $10 for a simple short back and sides.</li>
    <li> My Mom purchased a Wahl clipper hair cutting kit back in 1994. She used the same clippers up until last week. She uses them one time a month during the time that she had them, and loved the way they cut her husband and grandson&#x27;s hair. They&#x27;re very easy to use even for a beginner, which she was back in 1994. I purchased a new kit and she received it today. Everything that is in the box; is the same as when she purchased one 18 years ago. Lets say, she got her moneys worth from them. You can&#x27;t bet the price compare to other retail stores.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this trimmer. It is powerful enough to cut through my very thick hair, and comes with short enough guards to handle my beard trimming in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my last Wahl for 5 years before I broke my most commonly used guards, so I decided to buy this instead of simply replacing the guards. I am glad that I did as this set comes with a #1/2 guard, which is perfect for trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect this trimmer to last as long as my last Wahl trimmer (5+ years).</li>
    <li> Works just as it should and I cannot find 1 complaint about this haircutting kit.  I ordered additional sizes from the Wahl website which was $2-$4 including shipping for additional sizes not included in this package which in my opinion is a great price and isn&#x27;t necessary for everyone to order additional sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cut great and have no issues whatsoever while cutting.  Great power and speed to this buzzer.  Large and has a quality feel to it.  Pays for itself in just a couple cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Includes:&lt;br /&gt;A lot of &amp;#34;guards&amp;#34; which determine what length your hair will be, combs, scissors, and other items.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t touch these to your skin though as they can cause irritation from the heavy-duty blades but that is my only warning.  Great product.</li>
    <li> great clippers....they are more powerful than my last WAHL clippers.....i just wanted a new pair....i even used these to cut my dogs thick hair...they worked fine...NO,they are not the \\&quot;multi-speed\\&quot; $150 pet trimmers but they cut as good as the $100 ANDIS barber clippers with the steel guards....these guards #1-#8 and are plastic, but snap on tightly...my only suggestion is if you have longer hair on the top of your head...buy the extra #10 &amp; #12 WAHL blades on AMAZON....it does make cutting your hair even faster....the point is for $20 these work great for everyday needs...you wont be dissapointed</li>
    <li> after reading some of the reviews I was afraid it would not be so good but it totally is!!! Who rated badly this item has just been very unlucky</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer makes it easy to become your own hair stylist. It has enough power to cut and is comfortable in your hand. It comes with a wealth of trim guides and equipment. It seems well made and durable.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend cuts my hair now and i have saved hundreds doing it at home. This product pays for itself after one use!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that grows very fast, and getting a hair cut every 2-3 months was costing a lot of money.  These clippers work great for me.  I had no problem cutting through my thick hair. It comes with many different guards and other usefull accessories as well.  For this price, it is a great investment.</li>
    <li> Buy it right away if you are looking for saving some bucks on hair-cuts and want to learn doing it yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this attractive-looking, well-stocked haircutting kit as a present for my husband. When I looked it over, I myself found it rather intimidating, and I was not willing to use it to cut his hair for fear I&#x27;d mess it up. Fortunately, he figured out how to use the clippers with the perfect setting for his hair after only a few minutes of fiddling with it and barely glancing at the directions. Then, after several tries, he managed to cut his own hair, with me guiding him to only a couple of rough spots that needed a little bit of refining to match the rest of his hair. He likes a very short, military-type haircut, and this works very well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was probably overkill getting a kit this fancy for only my husband&#x27;s use, but the price wasn&#x27;t all that high compared to what it will save him over time in the cost of professional haircuts--not to mention the convenience of not having to drive to the barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> excellent, no problems</li>
    <li> The cutting machine did not had screws so the machine was open so I had to buy some for it and well other than that it is really good and cuts really nice.</li>
    <li> We bought this to save money by cutting my husbands hair whenever he needs it. Works great...only problem I have is that everything was packed so tightly that it&#x27;s hard to get everything back into the little case.</li>
    <li> Great. Went on Youtube to learn how to use.  There was a bit of a learning curve and some trial and error, but after 2 uses am now able to cut my husbands hair perfectly in about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> We kept buying those cordless junk trimmers that are $50 or less based solely on the fact that they&#x27;re wireless. We bought one about a year ago, and was meticulous in cleaning it out and oiling it appropriately. I&#x27;ve since grew my beard out, which made the razer fail in that short amount of time, so I decided to see what I could find on Amazon.    My beard is pretty thick, so maybe these wimpy cordless devices were just not strong enough...    I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks for my beard with the smallest attachment and it has performed FLAWLESSLY.    It cleans extremely easily, and doesn&#x27;t bog down at all. Best of all, it was half the cost of the cordless trimmers and came with more and better attachments. Very happy with this purchase!    Jan 14, 2015 update:  The box the trimmer guards are housed in has already broken. I have opened it three times... the trimmers still function flawlessly, but I&#x27;m hoping this doesn&#x27;t mean the trimmer is made with the same quality :\</li>
    <li> I bought this kit just to shave my head clean, but my friend actually used it, too. I have to say that it is pretty versatile in how you can use it.</li>
    <li> Bought the clipper to save money during the summer months when haircut is short. I&#x27;m sure there are higher-end products out there for professionals but as far as I could tell this works and feels the same as the barbershop. The kit comes with an assortment of clipping guards for different sizes, combs, scissors and even a packet of lubricant. All these are stores in an easy to carry hard case, which has plenty of space so you don&#x27;t need to arrange every piece inside perfectly just to get it to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haircut turnout great. At this purchase price even if it lasts only one year you have already broke even and gotten your money&#x27;s worth. The only negative I can think of is the clipper guards only go up to one inch which is still pretty short, the longest length that Wahl offers is 1.5\\&quot; (sold separately).</li>
    <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great- lots of various options, sturdy, well constructed, cuts well &amp; I love the tidy case it all fits in. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I was wildly impressed by this! I bought this expecting a pretty cheaply made product that worked well (and I wouldn&#x27;t have be overly disappointed because of how cheap it cost!), but this seriously surprised me. The trimmer itself is really well made, has a good weight to it, and works really well! I can&#x27;t imagine how well the more expensive ones are if this one was already made this well.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried yet on hubby, he has marine cut.  For $20 I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This thing works great for at-home hair cuts and beard trimming.  Have had it about 2 years now, has saved me a bunch of money from having to go to supercuts.  The included hair cutting tips are great for convincing other people they can cut your hair.  Turns out good enough for me!</li>
    <li> This is the item that I ordered. Very happy with this item. It was a gift for my wife and she is happy with it. Great job.</li>
    <li> Looks well built.  Bought for a gift.</li>
    <li> Got as gift and had to promptly return them.  You need ear plugs for these clippers and it plucks your hair instead of cutting it.  We have a more expensive pair of Wahl clippers and they work fine but the blades are dull.</li>
    <li> Best Hair cutter I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used! I love the guides.. really makes it very easy even for the non-experienced hair stylist. Nice smooth, even cuts.. I&#x27;ll keep this one handy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I cut my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair with these.  They are not too loud and with all the attachments, it makes the job easy!  The tilt is great too and the instructions help a novice understand what they are doing.</li>
    <li> This has saved us so much money!  Totally worth it.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems.  It even comes with a little sample of oil for the blades.  I&#x27;ve been using this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair probably twice a month for 3 years - these clippers are still going strong!</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product, I did a lot of research on selecting a relatively inexpensive hair clipper set.  After reading through many reviews, I knew Wahl was a brand to consider. Problem is, most of the Wahl sets were at least $[...] or more. I actually did not even purchase this item through amazon, but at Target.  I never even saw reviews for it, but the color coded pieces of the Color Pro seemed to give me the clue this was intended for the first time user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my home, I am the mother of two young boys, and a husband who often needs to get his hair cut.  We try to look often to getting cuts no more than $[...].  I figured if I just give each of them a cut once with this, I will get my money&#x27;s worth and savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I tested it out for the first time on my 1 year old son.  I actually used scissors to cut his hair a week ago and completely ruined his long hair.  With the Color Pro, today I was able to fix the mistake I made by giving him a nice boy cut which wasn&#x27;t too short.  My son was a little curious about the vibrating device Mommy was putting near his head, but I had his father playing with a toy in front of him so he wouldn&#x27;t be too concerned.  After about 5 minutes, and a ton of hair later, I was finished and so impressed!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good his hair looked, and how easy it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, here&#x27;s the details.  This kit comes with over 9 attachments for different hair lengths, including ear pieces.  The machine itself is heavy enough to know its quality, but not so heavy your arm will ache while using it.  It has a cool maroon case that holds all the essentials, which includes scissors, cleaning oil, mini brush, and combs.  For $[...] is a bargain.. I purchased it for a little more at $[...], but again, after 2 more haircuts, it will have paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Perfect weight, perfect cutting. Left and Right Ear Trims deliver very smart look!</li>
    <li> Home haircuts are easy and fun</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t loud and didn&#x27;t hurt my sons head</li>
    <li> better quality than the conair I just through out.</li>
    <li> Excellent, received right away and it exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Nice . Now my dog gets my old clippers , also wahl  clippers</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend who is a cosmetologist for her job and to cut my hair at home and she loves it! :) doesn&#x27;t pull on hair or hurt at all.</li>
    <li> It works so well. The only issue I have is the odd on/off switch but that&#x27;s not even a big deal because the thing is amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> Really great unit. The great thing about buying this is that it pays for itself after one haircut. My wife was initially hesitant to give me a haircut with this, until I told her that I would do it myself...and I think she understood the social repercussions of being with a guy with a bad haircut would be. It really is easy to use. What I really like about this unit is that the length attachments are color coded and clearly labelled (I had a set from another manufacturer before...they were all black, but were not nicely numbered and every time I used them I would have to spend a few minutes reminding me which ones were the right ones). All in all, very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews on it....WTH? THIS THING IS SO LOUD! I CANT FIX IT AND CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT QUIETER! i have been all over the web and it is still so loud! i hate it. i cant work with it, it scares the crap out of me, and sounds like im about to cut down a tree with a chainsaw it is that loud!!!</li>
    <li> The best hair cutting machine and the best quality ever..I recommend this product. It cuts so smooth and good. I give it five stars.</li>
    <li> im kind of a diy person so one day i decided i wanted to learn how to cut my hair wow this machine is great the kit brings everything you need and it makes it so simple it even has a guidline just watch some youtube videos and your ready to go after about like 4 times cutting my own hair now i feel i can do pretty much what the barber used to do it and i save a lot of money great buy</li>
    <li> Clipper is very quiet and sharp compared to my old one. Gave my husband a shock though when I used the #! blade--next time will use the #2. Good thing hair grows quickly.</li>
    <li> They delivered yesterday on perfect schedule. I used it immediately to cut my hair and it worked out great. Very satisfied by this haircutting kit</li>
    <li> What a great kit especially at such a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dogs -- specifically for the \\&quot;sanitary area.\\&quot; It works well on the one pomeranian who has a thinner coat, but the one with a super dense undercoat cannot stand these clippers. His fur is just too thick. The clippers pull more than they cut. I cannot speak to the job it does on human hair because I can&#x27;t find anyone who will let me try it on their hair, especially after using it on the dogs&#x27; behinds. It is sturdy, not overly loud, and everything fits into the hard case it came with (but not easily -- it takes some arranging to get everything in so that it closes).</li>
    <li> Good product, save $$ on the barber and pays for itself!  Variety of blades and adjustable height are excellent components not included with most other clippers (you might get three heights where this wahl gives you 20!)</li>
    <li> nice product it feels great works great my client is please and i happy i choose this supplier looking forward to more products</li>
    <li> Love the set its easy to carry around and has everything needed ! Machine works great</li>
    <li> works well, second purchase of this product</li>
    <li> Good clippers!! I got them for my fianc&amp;eacute; because he was having issues with his other clippers actually cutting the hair smoothly and evenly, without having to go over the same spot a few times. He was raving over the difference between his old clippers and the Wahl color pro. The Wahl Color Pro comes with a black plastic carrying case, the clippers, a pair of scissors, 2 combs and 11 clipper guards. Great deal!!</li>
    <li> As a broke college student, I couldn&#x27;t afford to go out every 2 weeks and pay $18 (plus tip) for a haircut. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy the cheapest pair of clippers out there, expecting to get what I pay for. I was more than surprised when I received my set. The clippers cut very cleanly, the set is complete (guards, scissors, combs, clipper oil) and I&#x27;ve saved so much money cutting my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers, to an amateur, are no different from the professional clippers costing upwards of 100 dollars. Awesome purchase.</li>
    <li> I just got this and it looks really nice and genuine. Hopefully this one lasts for a while. The product looked just exactly as pictured in the listing.</li>
    <li> Unbeatable price for the quality</li>
    <li> Cuts hair well! What else could expect from a pair of clippers that arrives at your house for less than a $20 note.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace an older Wahl trimmer that was extremely reliable over the last twelve years. This one cuts great and I have already experienced Wahl quality. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three sets of these. They work really well. I cut hair 5-6 times a month and these hit the spot. The blades get dull quick but they are cheap enough where you just buy another set.</li>
    <li> I bought this to groom my dog. 1 trip to the groomers &#x3D; the price of 3 of these things. Such a good value and built like a tank.</li>
    <li> These clippers are a very good value. Most people will not need anything better. They are powerful and cut through hair quickly, without pulling. If you are in a hurry, or don&#x27;t like standing around forever, you don&#x27;t have to worry about taking extra care to get a better cut/avoid pain. They cut well enough to accomodate all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color coded attachments work well enough and make it very easy to quickly identify what size you are grabbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the only reason to get something better than this, for cutting human hair, is if you need a SUPER CLOSE &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34; trim. However, These will clip plenty short, for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also happily use this thing to trim and clean up large sections of facial hair. It is &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; enough to not cut or irritate your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative I can say is the blade setup usually doesn&#x27;t survive a direct hit from being dropped. These are easy to hold onto, but I have dropped two different sets. With one, the mounting sysem became permanently loose. With another, a few teeth from one of the blades snapped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another slight negative is that the blades do eventually rust/tarnish a bit. IT&#x27;s not major, but it will happen at some point. It usually takes several months for this to happen, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to purchase my third set, since 2010. As stated, both only became unusable, after dropping. I use them to trim my head every week. Something that would cost $10 - $20 at a professional hair place. for the price of these clippers, I can cut my hair every week, for about two years, before needing a new set. That&#x27;s great value.</li>
    <li> I like this clipper set, and the color coded guards make it easier to remember your favorite length for your next haircut.</li>
    <li> These clippers are definitley made to last. It came with various attachments for just about any hairstyle. I also use for my beard and moustache. The cord is long enough and sure beats waiting for the cheap cordless trimmers to charge.</li>
    <li> I was more than just a little bit skeptical when I purchased this product, I was worried about the quality, I was worried about the attachments, I was worried about it being corded.&lt;br /&gt;But opening up the case and holding the the clipper, its quite heavy, in a very good way. It uses very strong construction, and you can be sure it&#x27;ll work, every single time.&lt;br /&gt;The cord doesn&#x27;t really get in the way and its pretty long and I&#x27;m sure it allows the trimmer to use much more power than batteries would.&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly the attachments, I cut my hair pretty short but I didn&#x27;t realize how short til I had to keep going the next size down on the attachments. These attachments give ample room for error if you&#x27;re doing short hair, but if it&#x27;s still too short, you can purchase a few of the bigger attachments separately. Speaking of attachments, they have quite solid construction as well. A similar Norelco trimmer had such poor construction for both clipper and attachments, the Wahl seems like a $200 clipper in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl is the company you should trust for your hair clipper needs.</li>
    <li> Prefect product to cut your families hair and you can not beat the price. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this item every month to cut my husbands hair. It cuts hair very well. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is very heavy for me. I&#x27;m a strong person and after 5 mins my hands are aching from holding it. Other then that this tool saves us a ton of money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat Wahl. Always been the best value out there. This one will last me 10 years like the last one.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great. The guards fit snugly onto the body, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since I got them. I have used them a couple times. They are plastic, and will probably not stand up to abuse, but for the price, and when I am planning on just using them when I need a trim they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Well made product...Great for home use.... Easy to use.... Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> But you can cut your own hair with it no problem. I give myself/ others fades all the time and it works wonderfully. This is the second one I bought because I lost my first one...I think I left it somewhere in a Turkish hostel....but the first one I had for like 5 years. I cleaned the blades every month, and oiled them well. Never rusted and the motor never failed.</li>
    <li> It paid for itself the first haircut. I like the color coded attachments w/ diversity of length. If I am going for a short haircut, as I often do in the summer I can do so without paying a fortune. That is a beautiful thing.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, works on very wiry, thick hair. Don&#x27;t forget to oil it after each use, and don&#x27;t use on wet hair - the blades rust immediately!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know the longevity of this product, but it works like a charm and the color coding was a stroke of genius--much easier to find what you need quickly.</li>
    <li> Even after reading the reviews here, I was still taken aback by how sturdy and solid this clipper is. For the low price I would expect a far more inferior product. The casing is cheaper plastic, sure, but feels quite sturdy and durable. The clippers have an excellent weighted feel to them and hum very appealingly. And the addition of the 10 different sized guides make this package a no brainer must buy to anyone thinking about cutting their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a parting note, i&#x27;d recommend getting an extra bottle of clipper oil with this, as i feel it will extend the longevity of these clippers by a large margin.</li>
    <li> Best part is that it is not as noisy as previous one. Excellent accessories - can be used for many different hair lengths. Trims nicely. Sorry I waited so long to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit because I am a college student and it is cheaper to simply give myself a buzz fade. My mother used to cut my hair with the same clippers so I knew what to expect. For such a good price, one can&#x27;t really go wrong with these. It&#x27;s smooth and has all kinds of sizes and a couple of tapers. I just used them for my first haircut with them and they work way better than the ones I borrowed from my buddy. One word of caution would be to make sure you don&#x27;t drop it. The previous Wahl I had experienced would have the power switch get jammed or work weird, but that was after two years of use and being dropped all the time (wasn&#x27;t me I swear). If you take care of them, these should last you along time and do anything you need to do with your haircut.</li>
    <li> To be truthful, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot for this price.  I just wanted to experiment with cutting my own hair, and my son&#x27;s, without a hefty investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself was solid, and had a latch for cleaning - big plus.  This is not a disposable trimmer - better quality than I figured for the price.  Maybe a little heavier than other models/brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the height level attachments worked, and even used the left and right clips for my son&#x27;s head.  Worked perfectly the first time.  I like to use a #1 on myself, so I&#x27;m trimming every couple of weeks without any pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it definitely exceeded my expectations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: all the components, solid trimmer, carry case, scissors, combs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: weight (gotta switch hands every once in a while)</li>
    <li> This is probably the most powerful trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had - and one of the least expensive ones. This isn&#x27;t a little travel trimmer with rechargeable battery, this is more like what you might find in a barber shop. It&#x27;s much stronger/heavier.sturdy than your basic travel trimmer and it requires that you plug it in. Also comes with a plastic case, tons of levels and two pairs of scissors. Well worth $20.</li>
    <li> It was amazing...I couldnt believe the product would be so cute and beautiful. It works very good. Thanks Amazon...Am gonna love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the kit for several months and through several haircuts and I love it.  It works great, just as if I was paying someone at a salon.  The trimmer is durable and provides a good cut.  The color coded guide combs also work great and makes your job even easier, especially if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.  I&#x27;m happy and would recommend this kit to anyone.  I have been thinking about buying one of these kits for a long time and never got around to it until recently.  I regret not buying one a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for a few months now and they have been working well.  I am far from an expert, but am able to give my son a good looking haircut.  He has a bit of a phobia about going to the barber, so I decided to give doing it myself a whirl, the angled guards work well for the sides. We have only had one issue with it.  I put the largerst guide on (I believe it was the #8) and couldn&#x27;t get it off.  I had my husband help me with it and he ended up breaking one of the clasps off it.  Sort of a bummer because I like my son&#x27;s hair a little longer on the top.  I might have to look into ordering it separately to replace the broken guide.</li>
    <li> Have to say I am very disappointed. I had read some reviews before buying with mostly positives in the comments and in particular how relatively quiet the clippers where.  When I first plugged them into mains power using an always previously successful and still currently working well converter I was amazed at how these sounded like a petrol powered lawn mower. First impression not good at all, then in less than six strokes through my beard smoke began to rise off the bladed end of the clippers and the handle became quickly and dangerously warm.  Having since purchased the same kit at a retail outlet I can assure that they are indeed quiet and have no issues.  After paying AUD 22.76 for the item as well as AUD 41.82 for a faster delivery giving a total of AUD 64.58 to Amazon and then in the process of claiming a refund paying a further AUD 46.50 in order to post the item back to Amazon, I can only hope that Amazon will do the right thing in terms of reimbursing me.  As I mentioned, with all the positive reviews, I can only suppose that I was unlucky to say the least, however with differences in packaging and the ridiculously loud noise omitted by this clipper set I have my doubts about the genuine status of the item I was sent.  I have sent the clippers back and will update this review in regard to the outcome of the refunding to me.  UPDATE : Amazon has refunded me in total and I will consider further purchases given this excellent policy attitude.</li>
    <li> I think I cannot use it all by myself after I failed to cut my hair. Can I return it back?</li>
    <li> Ive been through several hair cutting kits in my life, and this is by far the best one. Very durable (have used it every 3-4 weeks for 3 years now. Different color coding makes it very simple switching between blades. Cant beat it, especially for this price. Would have spent easily $20 more for this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for well over 25 years, but they were lost in a move so I purchased these from Amazon. The price was excellent, but I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews saying that they felt cheaply made. I really needed a haircut so I bought them. After all, it would pay for itself pretty quickly.   When I received my order, I was pleasantly surprised. They felt very well made, not at all cheap or loud. They have more than enough combs to cut hair for all the family, and for this price I can afford a second set to groom the dogs. I am more than satisfied with these clippers. I&#x27;ll gladly buy these again if I need another set.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Wahl clippers and this one is perhaps the best of the bunch. This clipper runs cool and quiet. The clipping guides are depth color coded as to length of cut. I am enjoying this clipper...</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome set of clippers. I&#x27;ve used it two or three times already, and it works very well. It is very very user friendly. The multi color front of the clippers matches the clips of the guides. Pretty much, it is idiot proof. I only gave it four stars because I haven&#x27;t used it too much, and I don&#x27;t want to give a five star rating prematurely. Give it some time, and there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that I will give it five stars.</li>
    <li> Got this set for my dad for Xmas and he loves it but I wish I would have bought a cordless set instead.</li>
    <li> Works really well, comes with everything you need and directions for a few simple styles.</li>
    <li> Second one I have bought, my first one stopped working after having it for 10 years.  Wahl Clippers hold up over time and give you more attachments then other clippers give....clipper is does not make a loud sound either.  I will always buy Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> it seemed okay, until the first time I Used the scissors the plastic handle to the scissors fell off making the product unusable. Haven&#x27;t tried the clippers yet. But I bought a nicer pair of hair scissors.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t loud. Heavy and well built. Cut better than my previous 2. Will probably be the last i buy. They feel THAT sturdy. It cuts very smooth and is so quiet you mostly just hear the hair being cut. Im happy with it for sure.</li>
    <li> Sent on time. Worked the first several times I used it. Then the screw loosened on the adjuster. Have to tighten it back up. I will let you know if that works.</li>
    <li> The products are very good to be used. It is very nice.</li>
    <li> Very nice trimmer.  I was getting tired of telling them my number, then pay up to $20.  We have been keeping my son and myself neat and trim all summer.  Unit paid for itself the very first trim and no more waiting around or dealing with long hair!</li>
    <li> i can honestly say that this is one of the best hair trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used and if/when this finally does break I will most likely be buying another one just like it. The quality build, however, makes me feel that time shouldn&#x27;t come too soon if I continue to take care of the set.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. For the money you just can&#x27;t beat it. All of the accessories are well made, very durable. Never use a rechargeable again.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the last few months and it works great. The guards are color coded and easy to mount. I have been saving a lot of money since buying this product.</li>
    <li> Not happy at all. I took my clipper all excited to the barber shop and the barber noticed that the blades were not properly aligned and didn&#x27;t lap well on each other.&lt;br /&gt;As if that wasn&#x27;t enough he noticed that the clipper voltage says 120V.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me We use 230-250V here in Nigeria.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using the barbers razor to shave&lt;br /&gt;Whose fault?&lt;br /&gt;I still feel sad.</li>
    <li> I had long shoulder length hair (im a boy). Bought this kit, chopped it all off (with help from my girlfriend). Product buzzed but it wasnt too bad, seemed normal. It did start to heat up when I was half way done, I set it down for awhile and came back to finish my haircut. It turned out great. I have even started using it to trim my beard. And if I ever need a touch up, I know itll be quick and easy with this product.</li>
    <li> I can give to my hair the shape I need it to have. All because of this machine. I like it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for what i need, i cut all my friends hair as well as my own at college</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Nice color coding, easy to find the right one and then use.  Clips quick and strong, no pulled hairs.</li>
    <li> My hair grows back really fast. I mean fast! For me, a haircut lasts for about a week and a half. Being a broke college student isn&#x27;t compatible with shelling out $20 twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where my Wahl comes to the rescue. Get a haircut. Keep it looking great with this clipper for as long as you can. It pays for itself really fast. Of late, I&#x27;ve been using it to cut my hair on my own and now rarely ever need to go to the barber. Great for trimming body hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that it tends to get really hot if used for more than 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Has a very professional quality to it.  Works very well</li>
    <li> good for beard trimming as well</li>
    <li> Great trimmer love the color coding for the guards.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my son was looking for to begin his life long shaving/hair cutting journey. Several different length guards that will come in handy when he wasn&#x27;t his hair to grow but keep it neatly cut</li>
    <li> Great machine now I can do it myself...</li>
    <li> Was hoping the &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; attachment would allow for a longer haircut. Otherwise great product!</li>
    <li> This clipper is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Wow! You cannot beat the price on this!  I got these for my husband because his last Wahl clippers gave out after 12 years of use!  The come with guards for cutting different lengths and a  pair of hair cutting scissors in  nice case where you can put away all the attachments with the clippers and keep them all in one place.  I&#x27;m going to purchase another pair just to have on hand!  These are great!</li>
    <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I bought this when I decided to start cutting my own hair.  It held up to monthly uses for a little over a year, and was with me as I learned to fade and grew in confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, last month I removed the metal plate to clean it, and although I only removed the plate and blade, reassembled it carefully, and made sure to tighten the screws; it has never been the same.  it is now considerably louder, and the blades never seem to stay lined up, no matter how carefully I adjust them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded to the 8470-500, which uses the same color-coded combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is a great starter unit, to see if home hair-cutting is for you.  But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My son taught himself to cut his hair.  After a few  youtube videos he was cutting hair on campus. Great shaver for the amateur barber.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl hair clipper, the last one was the same model, and lasted me 12 years. This one seems to be manufactured slightly different than my last pair. It feels slightly lighter (almost cheaper) but thats not surprising, seems like you can say that about everything these days. They work tremendously, and I will buy another Wahl when these die out.</li>
    <li> this is a great product.  I have cut my husbands hair for 20 years with our old Wahl.  it really needed to be sharpened, so we sent it out, then gave it to our grandson.  the Wahl is a great product</li>
    <li> good quality at a low cost.</li>
    <li> Everything came I&#x27;ve used it several times it is a great clipper I&#x27;m enjoying learning how to be a hair stylist.</li>
    <li> used it two times till now ... very easy didnt have to go to the saloon .. money saver</li>
    <li> Been using for over a year usually a couple times per week to shave my head and face and still runs great.... Oiled once or twice and that&#x27;s about it. Solid product. Will buy again at this price if I ever need to.</li>
    <li> Shaves hair down so well</li>
    <li> For the price and the accessories given, I can&#x27;t see giving any rating under 5 stars. AND, the motor on this clipper is powerful!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because i was tired of going to the barer every two weeks to get a cut. I save so much money with this item and i use it to trim my beard works really good cant beat the price on this</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair. This set replaced one that pulling as much hair out as it was cutting. From the first time we turned it on you could tell by the sound that this was what a set of clippers was supposed to be. It had that sound of the units used by barbers. It is solid and glides through my hair, cutting easily. I am very satisfied with this purchase after many uses.</li>
    <li> too many parts and it was difficult for me  trying to use it as instructed. takes practice. found all the parts annoying</li>
    <li> It works.... and the color coded guards really do help. The only bad thing would be, if you&#x27;re a guy, some may think the clipper is not &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; enough, in terms of color. But whatever. I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> These are the same ones they use in my beauty salon so I knew they must be good.  They&#x27;re the old fashioned kind, nice and heavy and sharp.  They did an excellent job on my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: sharp edge can actually cut/hurt skin</li>
    <li> It has a good performance and is has the necessary accesories. It&#x27;s a good deal for the price. The haircut require enough experience per se, so a second person to help would be best.</li>
    <li> As a senior male, with little hair, saves a lot of  money for just a 5  minuet clip and the barber</li>
    <li> I bought this item for self use. The first time I use it, it made huge noises. I cannot use it after work. Otherwise I will disturb my neighbors. I tried to adjust the vibration but once I reduced the noise into acceptable range, it cannot cut anything. I tried to operate it under huge noise, after 5 mins, the motor was burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to rush out and spent $20 to cut my half-way cut hair! So bad experience!</li>
    <li> Excellent and easy to use! You can save much haircut $$$!</li>
    <li> My other Wahl clippers stopped working after about 10 years so I found this one that was similar.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as good and I am happy to have it.&lt;br /&gt;I trim my hair at least twice a month, so I am sure I have saved a lot of money from not having to go to a barber.</li>
    <li> I have bought many electric buzzers through and this is the best I&#x27;ve gotten BY FAR. It&#x27;s very very well designed and built. It feels very solid, yet not too heavy. I use it to trim y beard and it&#x27;s fantastic. Also, not that I need them, but the accessories are extremely varied and good for any kind of hair cut you are thinking of doing. I can&#x27;t believe something this good, and made in the US, is this inexpensive. Buy one, two, three, give it to your dad!</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and this is one of the better haircutting products I&#x27;ve tried. The only disappointment is that the maximum length guide is only 1 inch. I didn&#x27;t realize how SHORT the 1 inch would cut. I ended up having to purchase the 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 inch guides separately, but luckily these can be purchased. Amazon also sells this product with more guides, so you may want to checks the different sets available to see which one suits you best. For longer lengths, it works best if you take your time and comb a small section of hair away from the head while bending over, then slowly and without force glide the clipper across the hair section. I finish up my haircut with thinning shears and a razor cutter so it doesn&#x27;t look too choppy. It saves me hundreds $$$ every year by doing it myself.</li>
    <li> I use this to cute my husband&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s a great product- easy to use, sturdy, and has lasted a long time. It can be used to cut hair in many different lengths so it&#x27;s versatile for more than one member of the family.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as designed. Easy to use and clean. I would recommend this kit to anyone seeking a comparable product.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. Cuts the hairs exactly like it should.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers for the price. We are now saving $100&#x27;s of dollars a year for three boys haircuts.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair cutting kit&lt;br /&gt;Because of this buzzer i save money by not having to go to the barber</li>
    <li> I bought it from South Korea and everything was just perfect and as described... (I bought a converter..)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, powerful motor and soft buzzing sound, no big noise at all as people complained..&lt;br /&gt;I just had a self haircut today and it went so good!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to cut hair with no getting stuck or anything...&lt;br /&gt;Not a single content was broken when I got this.. :)&lt;br /&gt;Fully satisfied!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;GOD BLESS AMERICA AND KOREA!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product, it never work for once. It&#x27;s just making a irritating noise.</li>
    <li> Quality clippers delivered to my doorstep for $17!  Wow!</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well. I use it to shave the side of my head and it has no issue shaving through coarse, thick hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, makes hair cutting easy. Adjustable.  Better quality similarly priced comparable brand models.</li>
    <li> Nice design but only works on 120V and there&#x27;s no mention of this fact in the product&#x27;s description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year mainly to trim my beard. Despite the fact that I&#x27;m not cutting through much hair, it has had quite a few problems. At first, one of the screws on the back shot out, so I put it back in. It&#x27;s difficult to get the screws in exactly right to have the blade even and loose enough to run. That worked for a while, but then it started getting stuck all the time. I tried adjusting the back screws some more, but that didn&#x27;t seem to work. The answer seems to be to tighten the side screw, although that it is not intuitive, and I don&#x27;t see why it should be necessary.</li>
    <li> Good option than going to the salon, where they use the similar machine. Good price. Seems to be good performance. I thought it was would be easier to use it, But need practice to use it effectively. I would probably give 3.5 stars now.</li>
    <li> Really, interesting as I won&#x27;t pay for my hair cut any long. Works perfectly for me. I know how to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for clean-up grooming for my dog. Not a lot of use will be required (not the kind of breek you would ever shave down) but so far it&#x27;s worked perfectly for my needs. It&#x27;s also quieter than another product I had bought and returned several years ago, and works much better too.The kit is a great value and if I were buying this for human use I can see that it is a great value and product for that too.</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic clipper for the money and it comes with great accessories. I have had it for a year now and it has saved me a FORTUNE in haircuts. I would say this is the absolute best for your money, or really if money isn&#x27;t an object. It never pulls, extremely adjustable, and overall pretty quiet.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; problem people complain about is just their own ignorance to the adjustment screw on the side. Just get a screwdriver and turn it slowly clock-wise until it stops. It happens to ALL clippers.</li>
    <li> amazingly super great. comes with lots of attachments and a nice (NOT oversized) case to keep it all. Its super powerful, and fairly quiet for the amount of power it puts out. This is my first upgrade in about 25 years. I didnt know that advancements in hair clipper technology had gone this far. Color me impressed!</li>
    <li> I was nervous about buying these clippers because they looked kind of cheap and they were only $20, but based on the reviews I got them and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. They&#x27;re powerful, they&#x27;re sturdy and the colored attachments do make it somewhat easier to quickly find the number you need.</li>
    <li> i bought this for beard trimming , but it is not easy to do this with this product. its heavy &amp; vibrates because of the high power motor. trimming quality is lesser than other products.</li>
    <li> My husband buzzes his head 2 times a month, and I have used it on my son several times. We&#x27;ve owned it for a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. It&#x27;s sturdy and the blades stay sharp. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> when I test the clipper, just to check the sound, after 5 minutes, damage already..totally useless..amazon dot com don&#x27;t have any branch or agent at malaysia to check the damage clipper..if I send back to amazon dot com, it is another shipping cost to pay..all time is an extra cost to pay..USELESS..should be when I purchase a product, it is in goog condition</li>
    <li> Works very well!  It&#x27;s a little scary to use in one one&#x27;s own hair the first time, but easier to use than I expected.  The price is right on... it&#x27;s easy to find a barber that will charge more than the price of this kit for just one haircut.</li>
    <li> Color coded length guides are nice, unit fires up and cuts good. I&#x27;m liking it so far and plan on saving plenty of money with home hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Bought this for my husband and he has had absolutely NO problems with it. He has gone through soooo many trimmers and they have all jammed or ended up breaking. This is the only one we have found that actually works!</li>
    <li> Had purchased an cordless clipper about two years ago and it wouldn&#x27;t really cut hair, we thought we didn&#x27;t know how to use it so we didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to replace it with this corded one. It is perfect, zooms through the cut. Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out the old one was so underpowered, being cordless, that it was useless. You can hear the difference in power right from the get go.&lt;br /&gt;Having a cord is a bit of a pain but well worth it. Because it works!!</li>
    <li> For the price, it is excellent. The kit is complete with combs and clipper attachments. It even comes with oil for cleaning the blades. I&#x27;ve only used it once and it did a first rate job. You can get some good advice from You Tube on how to cut properly. I followed the advice, used a no. 3 for the first cut and a number 2 for the final cut. It even does eyebrows --- use the comb without a clipper attachment. I left the top alone and only did the sides and back. I go back every other haircut to a professional so I can cover up my mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: January 2016.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper refused to latch down. It won&#x27;t cut hair and makes a horrible buzzing sound. I took it apart with a screw driver and could not repair it. All told, the clippers provided about 4 hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the more expensive version of these clippers and threw out this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review was helpful, please add your vote.</li>
    <li> I got tired of taking my toddler to get his hair cut because he would cry the whole time and I&#x27;d still have to fix a missed spot when we got home after paying someone else to do it. So I started cutting his hair myself. I can&#x27;t do it with scissors because he doesn&#x27;t sit still so it won&#x27;t come out even, so the buzzer is perfect. I let my 3 year old help my pick out the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and attach it to the buzzer and turn it on, so it isn&#x27;t scary for him if he gets to help. The cost of one haircut is almost as much as this kit, so it pays for itself in one or two uses. No more crying, no more uneven cuts, and no more missed spots. :)</li>
    <li> This item appears to have a very good build quality overall and especially for the price. The little case it comes in is similar to what you would keep a cordless drill or other such tools in - hard plastic. The cutting and buzzing and all that is first rate and it has a good feel and grip. Don&#x27;t know what more you would need. Be aware that when you switch the power on, you may feel it kind of &amp;#34;engage&amp;#34; when the blades first snap into motion. Then it is smooth as can be from there on.</li>
    <li> For the cost of one haircut (plus tip), this clipper does just as good a job as any barber&#x27;s would.  I used it today with a size 3 on the sides, 5 on top, and 4 to fade the middle.  It took less than 15&amp;#34;, and my hair looks great, or at least as good as possible considering the graying on top.  We bought this set to replace one of our older Wahl models that had started to get dull after several years of extensive use.  Definitely worth the money, and at just under $18, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> Comes with everything you need! Took a friend from long hair to a nice fade with no experience in cutting hair. Very satisfied with what I got for the price!</li>
    <li> Great clippers for a great price.  Will save me lots of money in the future.</li>
    <li> Got for my son for Christmas and he just loves it.  Perfect for him to use on his own to cut his hair.  Simple to use with attachments that are provided with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper set.  It&#x27;s used weekly here without an issue.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is when I use it to cut my fiance&#x27;s hair, the vibration can be bothersome in my hand.  I can feel it a lot more than his old clipper set.  He works with power tools regularly and can still feel the vibration but it doesn&#x27;t bother him as much.</li>
    <li> This vibrates so strong that it would be better suited on the Howard Stern show. It&#x27;s a bit clunky and not as good as my old Conair.   Update: It&#x27;s now a few months down the road and the unit blade is failing as well as the power switch. Sometimes it turns on, other times not. It&#x27;s moody, annoying and vibrate like a... Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Bought to use for my horse when he needs trimming. He has a very thick mane, and I wanted to thin it by half because he was getting heat sores under it. This worked perfectly as long as I took my time and did small passes. It would probably work even better for hair that was not so dense as a horse&#x27;s mane, but in small passes, it did the job just fine. It makes a sharp noise when you start it, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for horses that are skittish unless you do some work getting them used to it.</li>
    <li> awesome ..exactly what im looking for ..the only thing that bothers me is the loud sound of it ..other than that perfect .</li>
    <li> zero level trimming is not that great</li>
    <li> Work great. I cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair every other week with them.</li>
    <li> Great price but it tends to &#x27;catch&#x27; your hair as it is cutting.  Alignment of the blades looks good so I&#x27;m assuming they weren&#x27;t ground correctly and thus don&#x27;t cut that well.  A disappointment from Wahl, I&#x27;ve had better products from them in the past.</li>
    <li> one of the best and least expensive trimmers that i have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Second set of these for me. Last set was bought when I still had hair...a loooong time ago!&lt;br /&gt;Expect these to last at least 10 years and cut my boys&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it rips his hair out. Literally pulls the hair from his scalp.. He winces in pain every time he cuts his hair.. I have no idea why this has such good reviews but please let me know if you know of a better brand I need to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck</li>
    <li> Works well,  Well made product.  I use it just to trim my beard.</li>
    <li> Excellent Clipper, does a great job. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to trim your side burns or mustache/beard then look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;m able to cut my 3yo &amp; 5yo&#x27;s hair in between visits to the barber. Super easy to use</li>
    <li> this is a great clipper it would have gotten 5 stars except it&#x27;s extremely heavy</li>
    <li> The 20 piece set offers plenty of options for cutting hair and the clippers themselves are durable and will last a while. The blades stayed sharp for me for about 5 years although I only used the clippers to give 2-3 haircuts about every 2 months. The color coded system makes it easy to pick out the guard you need and the ability to adjust the blade comes in handy when my hair gets long. For the price i will stick with this combo as long as they make it and when the time comes to order a new pair.</li>
    <li> Love the color coded attachments. Works amazing and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair. We have also used this on our dogs! It&#x27;s quiet enough not to spook them. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really love the Wahl trimmer. Very complete haircutting kit and a very smooth shave. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> These are the greatest investment. Use them to cut my husband&#x27;s hair every two weeks. Last pair lasted 2 years and purchased them again. These are 6 months old and still doing great.</li>
    <li> This item works well. All the parts attach easily. It is light weight and easy to manipulate through the hair.</li>
    <li> Does not provide a close shave. I shave my head bald and I have to go over my head with a trimmer because these clippers are not that great. My last pair lasted 10 years and provided a very close shave. Save your money or buy something better.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, very powerful and super quiet! can&#x27;t find much to complain about. it does it&#x27;s job pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id say maybe be careful in using it in southeast asia. I had a hard time because it uses more power than the plugs over there let you use, or the other way around i don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> 5 stars because I can give my husband salon haircuts at home, very easily. Also the multi-colored guards are very helpful. We love this product and recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> The product works very well. It is very reliable and powerfull. The only thing it is that it vibrates a lot. Apart from that it is excellent</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd wahl 79300-400 I keep buying them because they are cheap but the blades do dull quickly even with oiling them. One day I&#x27;ll break down and buy a higher quality but for now these work</li>
    <li> I got tired of my husband coming home with weird haircuts, so when I saw all the awesome reviews for this kit, buying it was a no-brainer. The kit is geared for short cuts. It takes some practice to find the &amp;#34;numbers&amp;#34; to use on your particular husband&#x27;s head - or your kid&#x27;s, or your own! But I got the hang of it after a few tentative tries. I do not like the ear guides - for some reason I can&#x27;t get the result I want with those, so I just buzz around the ears with a regular guide, then use the scissors to finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more weird husband-hair! And it is so fast and convenient to do at home. I bought the Betty Dain Classic Stripe Barber Cutting Cape also, and it completes the home-barber setup.</li>
    <li> Have purchased Wahl products before and I am Very Pleased good product and made right here in America , keep buying american products!</li>
    <li> one dislike was that the comb was flimsy&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it performed flawlessly and will recommend this to anyone that asks</li>
    <li> I broke the hell out of my roommates old clippers and bought these as a replacement, haircuts be ballin yo. Great at cutting hair, smooth, never had to oil it, no problems.</li>
    <li> Good clipper for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The hair cutting kit is everything that you need for a great haircut. The kit comes with a variety for sizes for the buzzer for any style of hair. The buzzer moves through even the thickest head of hair easily and feels very heavy duty in your hands. The kit come s in a travel case that makes it easy to store and contain all the utensils that it comes with. All of this for $20, easily the best deal for hair products.</li>
    <li> More impressed than i thought i would be with this.  Very heavy and quite impressed with the quality of workmanship and cut.</li>
    <li> Bought with the Wahl 9686 Power Pro Corded Wahl Clipper and now give myself perfect haircuts every time. Good bye barbershop.</li>
    <li> my product arived earlier than expected. when the machine cut my hair, it went through the strands like a mower to weeds.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, and some would call &amp;#34;steel wool&amp;#34; hair. Hair clippers I have got in the past have done well but nothing compared to these. They cut like butta baby. I&#x27;m going to get another set just to have as backup because they&#x27;re priced well and are the best clippers I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 10 years now, totally legit set of clippers.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased these clippers.  I bought my first pair 6 or 7 years ago and I was super pleased to see they were still available.  My husband uses them on a weekly basis and then I sneak them and use them on the dog.  Hee hee.  They are durable and last a long time.</li>
    <li> It came fast and everything looks in one piece. I bought it for my husband and he hasn&#x27;t tried yet,but eveything looks in perfect shape and I hope it works</li>
    <li> Great value. Love the self-sharpening feature.</li>
    <li> Bought these clippers to cut my son&#x27;s hair.  It is extremely easy to use.  They feel very solid and heavy duty.  I am very happy with them so far.  We&#x27;ve cut his hair, it looks super, was easy to use, easy to clean, and is all packaged neatly in a storage box.  I believe this product will last.  I&#x27;m very satisfied, especially considering how inexpensive it was.</li>
    <li> it works nice. the box is really nice and easy to store.  the power cord is only like 5 ft which is annoying but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all the parts came as they were advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it came with some special liquid to grease the blades which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will be using this for years to come.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail the other day. Gave my head and beard a nice buzz. Works great. Already recommended to a few people. Honestly, you can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
    <li> I have many options which are good for professional persons, but not good for me. besides, it is really heavy.</li>
    <li> Way easier than I thought. I should be able to save a lot of money now. Very easy to use and the guide that comes with them is very helpful for those that have never cut their own hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> This clipper has very good power, the attachments work well, and the price is right. A slight complaint is that the case is non-fitted. It&#x27;s just a space, and the kit rattles around inside, assuming you can get it all crammed in there. Still, glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Broke down just after 5 minutes of work. Turned off itself and died.</li>
    <li> I am a college student, and I bought these hair clippers so I wouldn&#x27;t have to mess with finding a barber who I can trust to cut my own hair. I had no experience whatsoever with cutting hair, and I&#x27;ve found that it is really easy with these clippers. They come with a number of different attachments that makes the very easy to use without worrying about completely ruining my hair. They also have instructions which aid in learning how to cut, and a nice plastic cape so you don&#x27;t get hair all over yourself. &lt;br /&gt;Everything works properly, and it works well. Best of all, it is cheaper than most comperable products out there. &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. i was the first one to get a haircut and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Great quality for only $17.</li>
    <li> 4 haircuts in and I am getting more efficient at using it. I can do it all myself - even the back of my neck. Great instructions. Sturdy construction. It&#x27;s paid for itself and is still like new. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> Love it. very strong and easy to handle, good quality product.</li>
    <li> Solid pair of clippers for the price.</li>
    <li> good price. good clippers</li>
    <li> Work great. Lots of accessories to get the right hairstyle.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl clipper and the first one (different model) was a total disaster that took forever to trim my hair across. This one cuts smoothly and I love the color coding: no more digging through the combs to find the right size :)</li>
    <li> Works great on my husband and son&#x27;s hair.  We love Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, excellent quality, the result is what I expected</li>
    <li> I really do not appreciate being sent a used product.  I was not under the impression that this is what I was paying for.  The box is all bent up and the materials have smeary fingerprints on them.  Gross.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I&#x27;ve purchased in three years. Liked the first one enough to purchase the second one. Why only four stars? Frankly, all of the extra doodads are worthless. It&#x27;s a solid trimmer that doesn&#x27;t need all of the extra garbage</li>
    <li> Solid Clippers.  Work well.  Clean cut.  Very good for price.  I would certainly recommend these to someone who is just looking to do trimming and cutting of your own.  I saved a ton of money giving myself buzz cuts!  Also, a great way to keep your hair looking fresh!  Nice color codes to help distinguish the links. Solid buy.  They actually stay pretty cool temperature wise as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save money and cut your own hair!  Or help a friend or family member.  Solid buy.</li>
    <li> Awesome. It comes with a guide which really comes in handy. :* It comes with all the accessories needed. A+</li>
    <li> Easy to use, well-built, time and money saver... period. it has already paid off in less than 2 months.</li>
    <li> My only use of a haircutter is to trim my beard.  Previously I had a durable Wahl cutter which lasted for some 25 years.  It finally died, due in part because at the end I never would oil it.  So I purchased this model, expecting it would be comparable to the previous one.  My disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as I&#x27;d prefer, and the motor doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.  (Note I make sure the small lever is pushed up.)  Included in the box are sundry attachments I&#x27;ll never use.</li>
    <li> Love the color coding of the guards.  We&#x27;ve gotten this one before, and I&#x27;ll get it again.  We even use this for the thick undercoat of my corgi - that definitely strains it, but amazingly enough it can do it!</li>
    <li> Amazon is always helpful in everyway you cannot ignore it but i&#x27;ll save that story for another day.&lt;br /&gt;This kit does the job but the only issue I have is that it may be missing clips that may possibly have to be bought separate or come with a similar kit because it does not include the eye brow clips and the burgundy colored clip and I think another which is 4 total. So do your homework and see if the illustrations of the clips are truly included in this kit.</li>
    <li> You find yourself swimming in little attachments and looking closely thinking \\&quot;dang, where is the 4!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not a bad problem, but still i wish a magical fairy would come along and make my hair look sauve for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe include simpler care instructions. like 3-step \\&quot;do this, this and this after every use\\&quot; as of now i&#x27;ll have to google.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for about 4 years now, and they are still running great.  I probably don&#x27;t oil them as often as I should, but they still have no trouble giving a nice quick haircut.  Really can&#x27;t say enough about these, they have been a great investment.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> just like it is says it is for, price is great, i would recomend it, can not go wrong. use it my dog too</li>
    <li> Great high quality cutter! My fiancé loved it, he has a thick beard that destroys razors quickly. This one is doing great!</li>
    <li> Because the hair clippers worked great, I used a #1 foot and cut my own hair, only after two more times, it will have paid for itself, thanks Wahl.</li>
    <li> This clipper works better than any clipper I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s powerful, hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in it, and it cuts neck hair well. I haven&#x27;t had to use oil on it yet, and I&#x27;ve used it three times.</li>
    <li> The clippers were good , nice weight to them happy with what I paid and got I guess. But the accessories were horrible. None off the guards stayed straight.( they move to the left and right) this caused uneven heights.  I put the  #3 guard on and wow worst guard iv ever used. It looked like a lawmower got me half was a 3 and gaps were 2( since the guard blades do not stay straight. My cheap clippers worked way better.  I can only uses these clipper for right before I shave super waste.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. It comes with guided comb with different length which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who give 1 star complain that it&#x27;s too loud. Well, it is kinda loud but who cares anyway? It is totally bearable and you can&#x27;t judge its functionality solely by the sounds it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality-wise, very well-built. It does its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a conair $10 clipper, it broke after the third use. I could clearly tell the difference.</li>
    <li> well for what it is supposed to do.... value and efficient device... bought one for my dear old dad who uses constantly</li>
    <li> Saving those extra pennies. I started cutting my grandsons hear. now his whole class of teenagers want me to be their  barber.  So I Guess these clippers are pretty good.</li>
    <li> This works really well.  I love the color coded attachments.  I can finally easily find the ones I use the most.  I think it is so worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great close cut. A solid product. Comes with storage case and lots of attachments.  The best clipper that I have purchased.</li>
    <li> holds up well&lt;br /&gt;had it for about a year or more, great quality.&lt;br /&gt;a lot of different sizes and also comes with the 1/16 size that is hard to find</li>
    <li> Works well and has plenty of attachments that fit properly. I do my own hair in the mirror and I need the power so I don&#x27;t have to guess if the back is done. This covers it.</li>
    <li> It has worked fantastic so far!  It cuts well and doesn&#x27;t pull and has good written instructions on hair cutting for the novice.  The only slight disappointment was that all the clips and the clippers are just piled in the case making it a tangled mess every time you open it.</li>
    <li> It works great. But there is one minor thing: When I turn it on, it jumps right to the high speed and creates a somewhat annoying noise and vibration in the first second (or less). The scissors  do the job but seems to be in low quality. I think it is going to be useless soon.</li>
    <li> I wore out the first ones so I bought another one. made in USA and very nice for the price</li>
    <li> Very good quality, heavy duty clippers. The color coded guards are quick and easy to use. Great price, highly recommend</li>
    <li> well, i use this just for cut my chest hair and others parts but the performer its very very good,</li>
    <li> My wife has used the clippers to cut my hair a couple of times.  The Wahl&lt;br /&gt; does a good job and seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair that needed trimming. This product cut my hair quickly and easily. I liked that it did not hurt, and that the guards are color coded for easy use.</li>
    <li> I bought these after buying different brands of clippers to try to cut through my husband&#x27;s thick head of hair. Nothing worked. I found these and this was actually going to be my last resort. These glide through his hair with no effort. I wish I had found these before I wasted money on other ones. All the attachment pieces are color coded. Comb and scissors are included. A little hint... I dampen his hair first and the cut comes out much better.</li>
    <li> I like the colored clips.  A breeze to use and it cuts my hubby&#x27;s hair very well.</li>
    <li> Works just like it should and the price is right where you want it. Good feel, high quality, no problems here.</li>
    <li> I bought this item, today it has been delivered. when i opened the package, i plugged into the current to see how it worked, but it was burnt immediately. the whole room was full of it&#x27;s smoke. when i touched the clipper it was very hot.  i haven&#x27;t even had a chanse to cut my hair and understand how it worked. It was spoiled delivered to me!!! what can you tell me about this situation?????&lt;br /&gt;I AM VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED......</li>
    <li> half the time when you turn it on it makes an extraordinarily loud noise. you have to keep turning it off and on until it starts up &amp;#34;right.&amp;#34; very frustrating</li>
    <li> My older Wahl shaver finally died.  RIP.  So I looked online and liked the price and reviews on this one.  I used it for the first time and liked the job it did.  Wasn&#x27;t as heavy as my old one and more quieter.  I always used the shorter attachment on the old one and the shorter attachment  on this one was a bit shorter than my old one (which didn&#x27;t fit this new shaver) but still did a nice job.  Not crazy with all the wild colors but again I only use one attachment.  However, the ear attachment was interesting.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Clearly not your top notch shop clipper.&lt;br /&gt;But what do you expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbeatable and the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for those who cut friends hair, their own hair or child&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> this is my third time buying this set of clippers. my first one got jacked, but it was already falling apart then. the second one broke. I buy it again because it is priced real low and it works fine for a solid year or two.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> They do not jam, they cut evenly and well, and the side adjustment is very good for any kind of texture or fade you could want to do on your hair.</li>
    <li> New, in case; great price.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is a really good set for someone that is just getting started cutting hair or looking to replace a junky clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with a cordless Conair unit in shiny cheap plastic chrome, it fell apart pretty quick and started making a lot of noise, the kind of noise that makes you feel like you&#x27;re going to give someone a bald spot by continuing to operate it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We switched to the Wahl 79300 Kit shortly after and we&#x27;re impressed with it. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, the guide combs are pretty sturdy but make sure to always remove them afterwards or they begin to warp and loose their grip to the clipper head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a Wahl Mini Pro for more precision in tighter areas like the neckline and around the ears, both of these are FANTASTIC products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest watching some videos to get comfortable using this, there are tons of videos on how to cut hair on Youtube now, you seriously can save tons of money if you&#x27;re a guy that likes to regularly get haircuts.</li>
    <li> For the price you get so much carrying case, razor, all sizes of heads, oil brush for cleaning. Has plenty of power cuts good. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers. When you read the product description just be wary of the fact it is a true description -- not all parts shown come with every clipper. This was no big deal to me, even to the point I can&#x27;t remember which part I saw on the instructions didn&#x27;t come with my clippers.  I got an awesome clipper and many combs to choose from.  And the price was right and Wahl is a good brand name.</li>
    <li> I actually bought a second one of these because I ended up using the first one on my animals a lot because the product is awesome! for the price it works great and overall don&#x27;t have any problems with it both for pets and for my husband&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for animals and great for humans as well!</li>
    <li> Clean cuts and good attachments for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on my son&#x27;s hair, to keep his hair trimmed up between haircuts. He has really thick hair and these work great and moves through his hair very smoothly. I really like all of the attachments as well. They allow you to tailor your cut according to your style. The clippers feel well-made, not too light and plastic-like. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cool, I&#x27;m pleased it serves it&#x27;s purpose, just wish the motor was more powerful,  I wish it came with a T head trimmer</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my husbands clippers are so old they&#x27;ve seen their last day! I was a little skeptical, but for the price I thought I&#x27;d order them to try them out and my oh my was I wonderfully surprised to find that they work great! So happy and on another note, I like how the different settings have different colors. It&#x27;s fun (:</li>
    <li> This product is TOO NOISY, can be compare to a boeing 373 (meter by an application on iPhone). I&#x27;m sorry but it is totally USELESS with that noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars for Amazon service.</li>
    <li> Product has broken and is not usable after only 5 months and approximately six haircuts.  Would choose a different Clipper if I had it to do over.</li>
    <li> I only used it for a small trim so far and it did good.  I only have a problem with one attachment--the largest-- it wont snap on, I think I have to file some of the clip down.</li>
    <li> Unlimited haircuts for the price of one.</li>
    <li> This is an entry price point that gives you many accessories to learn as you use it.  The unit is quiet, light weight and ergonomic to hold.  Being corded means you&#x27;ll never run out of battery.  If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer this may fill the needs of a more expensive alternative.</li>
    <li> Broke after a month. Very upset. Never again.</li>
    <li> Our family does monthly hair cuts for two males, both have short hair. One adult, one boy. The motor gave out just today after less than 90 days of use. Unfortunately, it is beyond the return policy and not under warranty. I would not recommend this product. However, considering that we paid $20.00, it did save us $40 the last two months, but now I am stuck with having to buy a new one. Essentially, it cost us $5 per haircut and died after 4, well, actually it died during the 5th haircut halfway. Had to complete the rest with scissors. I think I will look for a new product in the $50-80 range that will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the final recommendation is DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor - Extremely Poor&lt;br /&gt;Price - Very good, except it is not economical when it only lasts for 4 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Very good thank you..</li>
    <li> Love the color coded length attatchments! Great product!</li>
    <li> I was searching adamantly for clippers for my boyfriend and was delighted to read reviews about this set. It&#x27;s super affordable, shipped really fast and looks fantastic! He loves them! Thanks to the reviewers that helped me find this product. I love all the guards and the color coding is the best!!!</li>
    <li> I think this is a good one. It was the first time I used this to cut my huband&#x27;s hair and I didn&#x27;t find any problem. A little bit too much niosy but I guess all the same. good one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used is a few times so far, cuts hair great and is easy to choose the best length. My hair is very think and it hasn&#x27;t pulled my hair once. Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Though the price is low, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it. It does the job pretty well. I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> My first pair of clippers and I love it!  I was looking for something to shave the back of my cats legs.  She didn&#x27;t like it much, but they did the trick!</li>
    <li> This hair cutting kit is great for in between barber shop appointments cleanup. Lots of attachments make it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have never cut hair before and my husband convinced me to buy this. His haircut look great. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> A sturdy unit that comes with quite a few guides to let you choose how close it will clip.  It makes looking neat easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by a hairdresser to clip from the bottom up, and that I might want to use a different guide on the blade when clipping my sides than when clipping my top; many people like their top a bit longer.  She told me what guide(s) to use if using two, and what guide to use if using one.  Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this clipper does not get hot even if you&#x27;re fussing about with it for quite a while.  The ones I used on the dogs when I was a kid got uncomfortably hot, and were also very loud.  This one is unexpectedly nice by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative I&#x27;d note is not a matter of build quality or design flaw, but is about how you intend to use the clipper.  This one has a cord, so you&#x27;d better be close by an outlet.  You&#x27;ll pay extra for ones without a cord, but for some it may be worth it.  With a clipper, you can do a lot of your cut by feel, just doing some touch-ups in front of a mirror.  For a close-cut style, you&#x27;ll have to clip your hair a lot to keep a consistent length, and it would be nice to just wander outside or into the garage and let my hair fall where it might, then sweep up afterward.  With a corded clipper, I am bound to the sink, and my falling hair gets into every crack and crevice of the floor and countertop and sink.  This is a good and sturdy unit, but I&#x27;d seriously consider spending extra for a cordless if I were to buy one again.</li>
    <li> It is highly customizable with different blades, also contains free scissors and a comb to help with the haircut. I was able to give myself a haircut which was pretty much the same, which I used to get at supercuts.</li>
    <li> This is quiet but powerful. It has a lot of attachments but I just use one for a buzzcut. Works just fine for my needs.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price very happy.</li>
    <li> I like the carrying case- color coordinating system is a little different then the all back- should make things easier after a few times- would by again :)</li>
    <li> got it for my friend ... works charm!</li>
    <li> These are by far the worst clippers I have ever owned.  I have owned Wahl brand before and liked them, but this one is GARBAGE!  It is very heavy, and cuts like they are dull and ready to be replaced.  The clippers I just threw out when I bought these were 4 years old and still gave a more consistent cut.  Very disappointed, I guess you get what you pay for.  The Wahl clippers I owned before were very pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Was a christmas gift to my uncle and he loves it. He, himself uses on his self and others. Good quality</li>
    <li> The length adjustment level is a bit flimsy, however, for the price I have to give this the full 5 stars.  If you are looking for a highest quality clipper it is probably worth going with a higher end model.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I used a friend&#x27;s and had to buy my own. Fast, color coordinated, long cord, awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a power house with everything you need except a hairdresser. so be prepared to learn the hard way</li>
    <li> Quality product. Works great.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use all purpose hair trimmer.  The color coded blade guards are a nice touch.  Great value for the money</li>
    <li> Works well with my poochies. Need to save money for my dogs grooming and I have been trying them out and they have been good little models for mom. Going for full body soon! Cross fingers they turn out well, lol these haven&#x27;t stopped yet. now i am doing other dogs. the shipment was great too btw. if i ever need to rebuy i will come here. just wish i can get the cordless kind. that would be much better and easier to use. the tips are hard to put on at 1st. you really have to push ( place them on top of the blade and line them up well then push down toward the end and they should snap in place) when taking them off just lift up on the tab it gives. it does get hot often not a huge problem, but they really need to correct that as you really don&#x27;t want to stop in the middle and let it cool. hopefully in the other models that isn&#x27;t a problem. on the pups though after half way we do cause it gets to hot for me and them.</li>
    <li> This is really great ... It is not noisy and cuts very well.. It Also arrived very fast.. Great item to buy for anyone.</li>
    <li> This  Haircutting Kit is much more than I expected as a matter of fact I have already cut my hair.  This Wahl product payed for it self already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT GREAT!!</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
    <li> I have a 20 year old son and lots of male friends who always seem to need a hair cut. I have been looking for a really good set of clipper to use for a price i could afford. These were the ones. This set comes with a complete guide on which guard to use for the ideal length u want to cut and the packaging is perfect for putting in my carry all to take with me on any trip. The blades are plenty sharp and my sons hair cut looks great. Thank u, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an older Wahl model which we had been using for more than 15 years.  Is more lightweight and easier to handle.  For the price, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> This is fun to use. I got tired of paying $30 for a Manhattan haircut. Instead I persuaded The Wife to cut my hair. I sit in a chair with a towel over my body and she clips away using the Wahl 79300. The Wife does not charge me for doing this though I will pay her in other ways. Meanwhile the Barber Shop must wonder where I have disappeared to. I know they are sad.</li>
    <li> The noise is  large, I think. Whatever I tune it, the noise is large, if tune to no noise, it can&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s not exactly the intended purpose but I&#x27;m using this to shave body hair. I cant stand my body hair so for the last year or so I&#x27;ve been shaving. If I don&#x27;t shave for a while and my hair gets long, this is great to get everything down low again so that I can go through with an old fashioned razor and shaving cream</li>
    <li> Reason why I gave it a 3 star is because it arrived with a center tooth chipped and the clear protector guard, when not in used, arrived broken. Its okay, I&#x27;ll just use one of the other guards. These things are not a deal breaker for me to return it. As long as all the other guards are here and in functioning condition, Im okay with it.</li>
    <li> This works well and comes with lots of blades for adjusting, as well as a little oil vial and a small brush for cleaning. It&#x27;s working great so far!</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement for my old set of clippers.  I really did not realize how dull my old ones were.  These were super sharp, and the price was great.  I picked this one, because it specifically had the &amp;#34;1/2&amp;#34; guard.  Love the color coding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair to save money and this has really worked well, especially when I keep it oiled. The varying length settings are nice as well, though I don&#x27;t think I need as many as it comes with.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to cut his hair, so far it has been fine, can not say anything bad about it.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair about once a month. It&#x27;s a simple no-fuss cut back to the &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; size guards. We&#x27;d been using some Wal-Mart brand clipper that I paid $12 for until it got to be so dull and temperamental that it was no longer worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl comes highly rated. I can&#x27;t speak to doing anything complicated with these, but for my application -- they work just fine. Given the price, they&#x27;re a great value.</li>
    <li> The machine is great. The attachments and the cover are plastic and rather flimsy.  The cover and two attachments were broken but decided to keep it anyway.  I can do without those two attachments.  The machine works great.</li>
    <li> My husband had high hopes for these clippers (based on reviews)  but they&#x27;re just not as sharp as he was hoping. He&#x27;s keeping them, cause he just needs something to cut our sons hair but he&#x27;s not in love with em..</li>
    <li> This is a deal that just can&#x27;t be beat. Heavy-duty, great selection of guards - and it works well. My wife wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair with it, so a friend of ours did - after a couple months, the second round of haircutting was today, and it went well enough that her husband was the next customer! Faster than going to the barber, and certainly cheaper by now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting the hair of my husband for sometime now, and always - I have used Wahl, but we&#x27;ve recently moved to US, and I am in need of a new hair clipper.     I bought this recently - as it was cheap but I was really disappointed the first time I used it.  Firstly, the attachements are of poor quality that it feels like it will break easily and the ends of the attachments were sharp that it can hurt your head if you are not careful; secondly, the noise it makes when you used it;  and thirdly, most of the time it pulls the hair out instead of cutting it.  And the thing that bothers me most is that it gets so hot while you use it and it shakes a lot too! And I&#x27;ve been using Wahl for a long time now as I&#x27;ve always got an impression that they provide the consumers with excellent quality clippers, but not this one though :-(, I am really disappointed that I&#x27;ve returned it to the shop.  Perhaps, I was given a damaged one and I hope that people who will buy this will not have the same disappointment I&#x27;ve had...</li>
    <li> Being saving me money i would&#x27;ve spent in a saloon</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok. It&#x27;s heavy, compared to other units I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> It is verry good, My wife use it to do hair cut for me, and it was made from USA</li>
    <li> This hair color piece set is really nice for me. Don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s colorful design fool you though, this thing is powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -Cuts really nice&lt;br /&gt;-Colors to distinguish each size(yea sure colorful, but useful)&lt;br /&gt;-1/2&amp;#34; adjustable for a longer cut&lt;br /&gt;-Instructions pretty nice&lt;br /&gt;-case to hold everything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -Pretty Loud(some people would probably love the loudness tho)&lt;br /&gt;-short cable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: I don&#x27;t think my set came with the eyebrow piece, oh well. I haven&#x27;t tried the scissors though, they do look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other clippers I&#x27;ve used were my brother&#x27;s, which was wireless, much smaller, and the adjustable(only one) clip kept breaking, but the *colorful* pieces for THIS clipper is really durable for this price. But all in all this is a great product for regular use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, instructions are very understandable the product is well made. Ever since i purchased these clippers 4 months ago, i have never went to a barber again; neither has my cousin lol</li>
    <li> The last time I tried one of these, it kept bogging down in my hair and I ended up looking like I&#x27;d been forcibly deloused. But I was tired of trying to convince stylists that yes, I really did want my hair that short. This thing worked like a charm. It&#x27;s going to take a little practice to get the bit over the ears right, but I went over my entire head several times with the 1\\&quot; comb and the motor didn&#x27;t get stuck once. I ended up with a nice even cut at the length I was going for.</li>
    <li> I bought this cause I hated going to go get my hair cut &amp; spend $15 + tip. I cut my hair down to 1/4 of a inch, looks great. Clippers preformed great had very long thick hair before. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good cheap way to cut hair. I love it</li>
    <li> Recommendation: Buy a trimmer with this clipper.  You will need it to do your hair edge lines and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got tired of waiting at haircut places and bought this clipper. My wife used this product four times now to cut my hair... so far it&#x27;s been great!  Worked as described.  No pinching or no pulling.  Easy to use with the guides.</li>
    <li> The clippers arrived a day earlier which we were thrilled about. Unfortunately, as soon as we took it out of the amazon box it was obvious that the item had been used and returned. The box was scraped, worn, and poorly taped. We crossed our fingers that just the packaging was damaged, etc and the clippers would be new and unused....Not the case, in fact it was quiet the opposite. The body of the clippers (plastic) was dinged and scratched, and the blades were absolutely filthy and disgusting full of hair and God only knows what else! The seller should NOT be allowed to resell clippers, or other items that have been returned USED! To say that we were offended by this would be putting it lightly! I wish that I could write a positive review or add some feedback as to how the clippers work, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t do that until we receive new unused clippers.</li>
    <li> Easy use nice sharp clippers, quit. Has all the necessities you need. I would recommend for any one to use.</li>
    <li> Works great! I recently purchased (and returned) a much more expansive model due to the noise. This one isn&#x27;t very loud and cuts through my thick hair easily. I do feel the hair clippings sometimes stick to this more than other clippers I&#x27;ve owned. I also feel like the plastic feels incredibly cheap and fragile. I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last a year but we will see.</li>
    <li> This is ridiculous..i got this and might have used it like twice and it just stopped working. And i am not able to return it as well. Its so stupid ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad product. Even the thought of buying this product is not recommended .</li>
    <li> PRO: I love the myriad of attachments. The clippers look and feel very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The clippers often make a VERY loud noise, and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s not simply loud in general - only sometimes. One minute it&#x27;s quietly buzzing away, and the next it sounds like it&#x27;s eating itself. This started either the first or second time I used it. Maybe something got caught in the moving parts? Maybe it&#x27;s defective? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s loud enough that I no longer use it, choosing my 20+ year old clippers found at goodwill instead.</li>
    <li> When I look at its packing, no big surprise, the colorful combs looks good; when I turn the switch on, the motor sounds like the one used at the barber; when I do the first-time cut, OMG, this clipper is for professional usage, so QUICK and POWERFUL with NO stuck through hair!</li>
    <li> The place that I used to go to for a haircut upped their pricing to $17 (for a men&#x27;s cut), and I decided to finally give it a try cutting my own hair. A haircut for me only takes about 10 minutes, and it&#x27;s all clippers. I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of getting my own set of clippers and doing it myself for a long time now, but I thought that a decent set of clippers would be expensive. After reading all the helpful reviews on Amazon about this set, I decided to go ahead and give them a try. I&#x27;ve just finished my second haircut with these and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The quality of this set goes way beyond the low price. I have no doubt that I&#x27;ll get many years of use out of this set.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to replace my clippers. The quality of these clippers is particularly high considering the lower price and being made in America.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap yet if you were to hold it and use it you would think other wise. I&#x27;ve already saved a lot of money, time and frustration doing my hair myself. I am very happy with this purchase. Wahl proves to make good products and this is one of them.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair so smoothly, very powerful clipper. I have had less expensive brands that leave the hair choppy and don&#x27;t have enough horse power to really get through the hair, this clipper is different. I love the color coordinated guards as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this today (not from Amazon, but from a Fry&#x27;s nearby) based on all the good reviews, so was surprised to find some obvious, annoying drawbacks. I think the unit has a motor much stronger than the body that houses it, with the result that the body vibrates uncomfortably and gets annoyingly warm. If the plastic guide is not seated right, you hear this very loud noise that will make your heart skip a beat. And last but not least, the rocker switch button offers a lot of resistance. If you frequently turn it on-off during a 10-15 minute cut, as you adjust, change guides, and take pauses, your thumb will start hurting.&lt;br /&gt;I had a 5 year old Remington, ten dollars more expensive, that never had these issues. Of course, it&#x27;s motor was probably not as powerful, but I did not find it needing any more than what it already had.&lt;br /&gt;One plus for this Wahl unit is that the blades feel a bit sharper - but I cannot tell for sure, and in any case, it is too early to say if it will stay that way.</li>
    <li> They cut okay most of the time, (often freeze up/just need a little oil).  They are heavier and not as comfortable to hold as a previous set of clippers I owned, (but cannot find anymore).  As stated these need oiled, (a lot more than any previous clippers I&#x27;ve owned).  They do not trim as neatly around my facial hair as I had hoped, but I also use them, (without attachments), to cut my hair, and I am very pleased with how they function for this job.  They are a bit sharp, so be careful.  They are durable and well constructed.</li>
    <li> You wont regret buying it. Very efficient and impressive. Doesn&#x27;t require much effort to get a good haircut. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through lots of hair trimmers, and this is my favorite to date.&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;- It cuts hair well and the lengths are accurate. I don&#x27;t need to keep going back over the same spots time after time, like I have had to with many other trimmers (I have fine hair, but my son has thick hair, and it handles both well).&lt;br /&gt;- It is quiet. No need to deafen yourself when cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not get too hot. The last one I had became difficult to handle after around five minutes of use. This one keeps its cool.&lt;br /&gt;- The color coding, which I thought of as a very minor feature - comes in really handy. It&#x27;s so easy to find the right length, and the key is right there on the unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;- A really good range of lengths. I was able to give myself a haircut that looked like it was done by a barber with scissors and a professional trimmer, including tapering on the sides, all with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t come across anything negative about this product and would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift two years ago, they cut the same now as they did two years ago. Comes with a lot of guards and even shears. I have thick straight hair and it cuts through my hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to clean and oil after or before every use, I bought some wahls 3-1 spray @ Wal-Mart. It keeps it running smooth as I something cut friends hair. The blade of it, is thinner than a wahl Senior and a Andis Master, which cuts closer out the box. The motor is strong but not as strong as the two stated but doesn&#x27;t get hot. When I cut my own hair it does take me time about an hour and it still runs cool.&lt;br /&gt;So, in my conclusion I figured after numerous haircuts and it still running strong I can give it the 5 stars. I see these at local department stores like Marshalls or TJ Maxx for cheap and would def get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an old weak buzzer I had to cut my boys&#x27; hair. I thought for the price it might be an inferior product but I was very wrong. This buzzer is extremely strong yet very very quiet. It also comes with amazing instructions step by step to help you buzz/cut hair, a comb, and a scissor. I was very impressed. I am not professional at cutting hair but my boys&#x27; haircuts came out amazing with this buzzer as opposed to my old one. One son I buzzed short with a fade (like the instructions demonstrated) and the other son I kept long on the top and buzzed on the bottom a fade. I was very impressed. It paid for itself in just one haircut for them both. I like how the add on clips are very clearly indicated with inches and sizes so you know which one you need to use next in sequence to get that perfect fade. And they were strong enough to buzz through my older son&#x27;s thick hair which tends to get stuck in my old buzzer. Overall 5+++ stars.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  This is my second pair of wahl clippers.  Saving $15 every hair cut.  Excellent product; excellent very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Every other month for the last ten years I cringe every time I have to pay $20 for my hubby&#x27;s hair to be cut. I was always sure that I could do it if he&#x27;d let me try. I put in a long search through amazon reviews for a quality product that he could not complain about, and came across the reviews for this item. So far it has lived up to its good reviews, easy to use, has not caught/pulled any of his hairs like a cheap trimmer would, and he is thrilled that he can use it on his beard too! This is a good buy, definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Feels like very solid quality, works great so far</li>
    <li> my wife an I are disabled an the shaver FAR Exceeds my needs. GREAT ! !</li>
    <li> Works great fast shipping</li>
    <li> Bought this about 2 years ago and still works fine.</li>
    <li> These are great. The case sucks and arrived broken, but I didn&#x27;t care about the case. It&#x27;s a great price, and it works perfectly. Buy a better pair of scissors to go with it. I cut my boys&#x27; and my husband&#x27;s hair with these. Love them.</li>
    <li> Works great! I actually bought this to use on my dog and cat to groom them. It does just what I need it to do. Product is great, price is great!</li>
    <li> Nice set of clippers. Husband wanted me to learn how to give him a flat top and these made it easy. We save a bunch of money doing it ourselves. These have paid for themselves many times over...</li>
    <li> Excellent would recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> Great product at an affordable price and an appearances lifesaver!</li>
    <li> Bought the kit to give my two boys haircuts and have given them each two which has saved me over $50 already. Easy to use and attachments work well</li>
    <li> Seriously, haircuts here in the Bay Area are way more expensive than they should be, but hey! This nifty tool cut down the costs! It has more than 8 configurations, and even a gradient for the side hair. Really loved it, and my coworkers were impressed that I did it myself.</li>
    <li> Good tool for boys hair cuts, but the trimming scissors are not very sharp. I give it 4 stars because the trimmers are great and the scissors were just a bonus. After 3 haircuts for my daughter they are dull.</li>
    <li> Really like this razor, except for one thing. The motor is so powerful that it vibrates my hands almost to the point of numbness. Otherwise, it really does  a fantastic job. Just wish it didn&#x27;t feel like using a lawnmower.</li>
    <li> Super dependable and worth every cent, this kit can save you so much money in the long run...and by long run I mean 2-3 self or assisted haircuts. Just keep it clean and oil it here and there and it will saw through hair like a chainsaw to a tree, while leaving a nice smooth finish to your hair. Nothing beats a Wahl! Whether you have kids, are kids, or just don&#x27;t want to waste time traveling to get your hair done. *If you are in the profession and what a relatively cheap and superb shaver, nothing beats this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I never go to the barber now. I get the same result every time. I would recommend the wahl hair cutting kit to anyone.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far but very good bargain.  Wife gave me a professional style cut despite never trying before</li>
    <li> satisfied not a bad product its My second one My first one was my fault i droped it and broke.</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy clippers that do a great job of all kinds of grooming because of the variety of guards, sharp blades, long flexible cord  and ease of operation  Excellent quality for a good price!</li>
    <li> Really easy to use, once you get the adjustment pieces on.  I&#x27;ve had a little bit of a hard time with popping them on and off and pieces breaking, but once the piece is on the clippers work great.</li>
    <li> Works good  so far. ....but have had bad experience with this brand</li>
    <li> If I were to buy again, I would choose another model that has a different material finish for the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white material on the clipper is of a smooth plastic that statically attracts loose hair. A lot of hair can cling onto the clipper during/after use, and annoying to remove. Cannot shake loose hair off of the white material; will require a bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the hairbrushes also arrived broken. Wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble of returning the whole package for a hairbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cord has to be wrapped neatly enable to fit everything back into the box. There is no easy way to organize all the accessories in the tight box, unless you buy another container.</li>
    <li> We bought this because we lost the #2 guard to our other pair of clippers (that my husband likes on the top of his head) and we really like them.  I really like having a case to put everything, because our last set of clippers only had a mesh bag.  I&#x27;m even more impressed with the ear guide as my 4yo son doesn&#x27;t always like to sit still when I cut his hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too noisy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t the disturber noise that it makes! I wanted to return the item, but I can&#x27;t because I am not in the US anymore.</li>
    <li> It is terrific in every way.</li>
    <li> Nice unit.  Works well.  Love the color coded attachments.</li>
    <li> Great price! And it came with all  the accessories and a case.  Great for keeping in shape between hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product</li>
    <li> Although the combs (not the guards) included are of the cheapest make everything else about this package is great. Wahl has a history, with me, of products that wear quickly and breakdown in years past so the jury is still out on whether this one will fulfill it&#x27;s high rating.</li>
    <li> I have owned several brands over the years including a Wahl and when it finally wore out I bought another because I was so pleased with the brand and all I can say is they have done an excellent job on the creation of this one.  I would suggest it to a beginner or an expert.</li>
    <li> Nothing more and nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is the length of the power cords, wish it were longer so it would be more comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> exactly what i needed and as described.</li>
    <li> I bought it new and it came used....yuck</li>
    <li> This one works great right out of the box. As someone with a buzz cut, I make frequent use of these little shavers, and I find they get clogged and start giving less than perfect cuts without constant maintenance. At this reasonable price, I may stop maintaining and start replacing more frequently -- nothing cuts better than a fresh new unit. Will certainly be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> We love this haircutting trimmer.  It not only does great on my husbands thick hair but it also worked on my yorkie dogs hair.  its very quiet and smooth.  Shipped quickly and would never buy a different brand after this one.  So many different level attachments we would never need anything other one.  It also came with a great pair of hair cutting scissors.  Highly recommend this</li>
    <li> It was a very good buy.  It worked great.</li>
    <li> Really powerful. Love it, should have bought it early. Saves more money.</li>
    <li> I use it alot. I really like the different colors to show the sizes.it works well and is a nice clipper.</li>
    <li> Great hair clipper. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I can cut hair with this. I trim my beard with it too.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking I would just cut my own hair. However, after I attempted doing so once, I realized it wouldn&#x27;t be so easy. Luckily, my girlfriend cuts it, and even with a minimal amount of experience, it looks pretty good. Saves a ton of money from having to go to the barber. I&#x27;ve gone back a few times since buying this, and they definitely give a better cut, but their cuts also cost as much as this device. For me, it was money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have these as a gift. They were really happy about it.  They tell me the clippers are smooth and extremely well balanced. Very controllable.</li>
    <li> Love it, works good and doesn&#x27;t get jammed and many different lengths. Good quality name it should last for years.</li>
    <li> This is a good haircutting kit. I bought it as a newer version of a similar one. Lets me cut my husband&#x27;s hair in half the time - good, sharp blades and the right attachments. The price was amazing.</li>
    <li> I swear I was so skeptical &amp; afraid to buy even with all the good reviews. I haven&#x27;t had good success buying clippers until these. Great cost, does not get hot, comes with alot of accessories that I like, one being the color coded guards. They cut so smooth no pulling or snagging. You wont need to adjust the power as they should already be set up at the perfect level. They were a great buy I and would definitely recommend these to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> very happy with it. love the color code. makes things easier for me. price was fabulous. Thank you for your prompt service and for such a wonderful product..</li>
    <li> I took it out of the box and I got what I deserved. I got a hair cutter that cuts!</li>
    <li> This machine works great and comes with everything you need. This is my second time purchasing something from Wahl, and this machine works better than the $40 one I bought previously.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair with these just now and I love them. They dont jam and the guards are color coded. Great product. Amazing price.</li>
    <li> Cheap and comes with good accessories. Works perfectly for my hairstyle. The longest attachment is 1&amp;#34; though so don&#x27;t expect to be able to do longer hairstyles with ease.</li>
    <li> This worked great even for the amateur hair cutter.  I will save a lot of money on hair cuts with the kids.  One trip to the barber saved and it has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, product works very well. Good quality for good price, great buy. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the blade guard came broken, but it&#x27;s something I can live with</li>
    <li> This I like.  It cuts hair real well.  Performs much better than expected.</li>
    <li> One of the only sets that has a 1/2 guide. I like to keep a really close cut on my sons sides and back and I can use the smallest guard and have a nice even cut. They work great on thick hair. These will likely be the last set I will ever need to buy.</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first three weeks or so, but some orange substance started accumulating around the razor (maybe rust, maybe not?) and the razor then ceased to continue working. This may have been my fault for not taking proper maintenance care, but I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to? For the time it did work though, it was a fantastic razor, and I love that it came with so many differently sized clippers.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It was easy to use.:)</li>
    <li> Three boys means a lot of hair, and haircuts were a battle. Lines, screaming, constantly changing staff, and of course, ridiculous costs. I found myself waiting until some well intentioned family member or teacher commented on how fast their hair grew before finally biting the bullet and taking them in to get a cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this clipper set. I&#x27;d never cut hair before in my life, but with young boys I figured any style mishaps would be unnoticed and would grow back quickly. Besides, for this price, I&#x27;d try it a couple times and if it didn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;m really not out anything. This clipper set couldn&#x27;t be easier to use, and it paid for itself after just a couple uses. It comes with a variety of guards which give you plenty of length options. Cuts are consistent and even, and can be done quickly. Of course there is a hum and vibration, but neither has bothered my sons much (not any more than the stylist of the day at the local franchise, anyway). I just follow the simple included instructions and voila, free haircuts in minutes. I&#x27;ve been using this set for close to a year now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s a set of clippers.  It does what clippers do.  The two things that stand out to me about this particular one is that it&#x27;s inexpensive, and surprisingly quiet - possibly the quietest clippers I&#x27;ve owned.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price</li>
    <li> just getting started. Think it will work o.k. a new and different experience for me  Delivery was fine. Thanks for your help.</li>
    <li> Works great. Many many attachments are included, more than I can ever possibly use. A comb and scissors are included which is very convenient.</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit was more than we were expecting. The clippers are definitely high quality, and they feel very solid and well constructed. The color coded cutting guide attachments make the whole process VERY easy, and they fit rather snug ... but then you want them to, so they don&#x27;t come loose when in use. The unit does come with a itsy bitsy, very tiny bottle of oil (I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a 4 oz bottle of the Wahl clipper oil ... for home use, a 4 oz bottle should last a LONG time, and is only about $4 here on Amazon.com ... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B9SFQG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1), so be sure to oil the blades before your first use, after every cleaning (which should be after every use, IMHO), and before each subsequent use to help keep the blades sharp and running cool and quiet. Speaking of quiet, these clippers are as quiet -- if not more quiet -- than the ones used in the haircutting salons that I&#x27;ve frequented over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We should be able to save some cash during these strapped financial times by having my wife give me my relatively simple haircut at home, instead of the $15 to $20 I spent every six to eight weeks. Plus, the more of my very hard earned cash I can keep, rather than handing it over to the filthy rich 1% to make them even richer, the better.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and my first one last for 3-4 years before I bent one of its teeth.</li>
    <li> The included instructions are helpful and it comes with a lot of different attachments for hair length/style.  Bought another one shortly after for travelling.</li>
    <li> I got this to use to groom my yorkie.  It&#x27;s a wonderful set, just the scissors alone in the kit is well wroth the money when you look at the prices of hair cutting scissors.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly to cut my own hair at home and found it to be pretty good for that purpose. Comes with many attachments and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> cut smooth and clean without any pinching am loving it so far and have already cut my hear twice as well as other member of the family at this price, people you cant go wrong excellent machine for the price</li>
    <li> It is made solid and it cuts with no problem whatsoever.  Cool fast and efficient - what more could you really ask for.</li>
    <li> ok 1st of all when i opened the box i noticed there was still hair on the clippers!!  and im missing 1 of the attachments. I had 2 clean it and everything before I used it (like Duhh!)  besides that its works fine still i shouldn&#x27;t have 2 pay full price for something that iz used....</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this trimmer very long but it seems to cut my hair well, it sin&#x27;t cheaply made or cumbersome, and the color coded length attachments are easy to attach and convenient.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly well made. Works great. Super value. Definitely will recommend it to my friends. Much better than I expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have a 17 lb schnauzer so her hair grows out pretty quickly. She doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair cut but these particular clippers are quiet enough so they don&#x27;t stress her out too much and I can get it done VERY quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working after 5 months of life, and a lot of noise. I try to fix it but failed.</li>
    <li> It is cheaper than other brand but it looks like a used one. The mechine looks not very new. It can work well so I till feel happy.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with a Wahl trimmer. My last one has lasted me for year and still works but the blade was getting dull because I forgot to oil it, but that was my fault. Great quality trimmer and a Great price.</li>
    <li> wahl hands down never ever disappoints me. Love their clippers. always last and nice and smooth cut every time. not loud either which is great for the little ones</li>
    <li> works great, be sure to read the information about the clipper sizing charge for the guards.  great deal for the price</li>
    <li> This has enough attachments to do a good job and is very reasonably priced.  I actually used it as a gift.</li>
    <li> learn to use the hair guides right, and you will have the power over your own haircuts.  if you like yours short. If you have the top over an inch, then you have to hand cut that with scissors. But if you want the simple buzz it and forget it, this is for you. Reliable, quiet, doesn&#x27;t get hot, case is nice</li>
    <li> I have had this for several months now and was worked well. The blades are still sharp and cuts well. The color makes it easier for me to locate the right clip size.</li>
    <li> I had this razor for several uses and find it is very capable at it&#x27;s job.  The accessories are complete and for the most part useful.  A minor discount of the hair cutting cape which shouldn&#x27;t really be included--it was torn after the second use.  This is not a loss if one is getting a buzz cut as the clippings are very much attracted to cape due to static cling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism is strong and reliable for dry hair.  It has not been tested for damp or wet hair for effectiveness on that front.</li>
    <li> I am a huge of these as I have had them for quite some time and they have not failed me yet.  They cut good and fast plus the attachments are fairly thick so as they do not break so easy.  I do wish they would have come with a 1.5 guard as I once had one but broke it.  Bummer.  Oh well, still a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> Not the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned but it works alright and the price is right.  I recommend.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I thought the price for this kit seemed quite low for all it had but decided to purchase because of all the great reviews.  To my surprise this trimmer works very well and feels of a better quality than expected.  The color coded attachments for selecting hair length make it easy to identify and snap on and off easily.  The case it comes in is a little flimsy and hard to get everything back into it but it will fit.  Overall a good product so far.</li>
    <li> We have had an old Wahl that we have been cutting with for almost 20 years. One of the plastic guides broke and found we could get a new set for not much more. So glad we did it, excellent quality with 3 times as many guides.</li>
    <li> These are great. I have 3 young boys and refuse to pay for someone else to cut there hair so I went for it. Took me a few times before there hair came out perfect but I think I&#x27;ve got it now</li>
    <li> Not bad for light using.</li>
    <li> This is a standard Wahl clipper with attachments.Included as well is a set of scissors, a comb and also comes with instructions on a few hairstyles, clipping tips and care for the clippers on a sheet. All of this in a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star because the attachment clips are very hard to attached and remove from the clipper. At first I thought it was only the one but it&#x27;s all of mine. I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, maybe in time they&#x27;ll loosen up? I was afraid I was going to snap the attachment or have one of those incidents when you&#x27;re forcing something and then it gives all at once and everything flies out of your hands crashing about. So far that&#x27;s been avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked another star because while it&#x27;s nice to have a case, putting everything back in, so it fits and it can snap closed reminds me of doing a 500 piece puzzle. The case is very tight for all the components that fit in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I paid about $18, I think it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Fine clipper. Just that its a little loud</li>
    <li> Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Just want I wanted</li>
    <li> These things pack a lot of power for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair that grows fast and needs to be clipped often to keep up with the hairstyle that I like, these are great.</li>
    <li> Great clippers. No tug or pull. Color coded attachments are nice. The instructions that are included will give you a hoorah hair cut.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses it every week and loves it!</li>
    <li> I have cut my own hair for years and have used Remington clippers.  Decided to try Wahl&#x27;s and I am won over.  Best clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it, he started to cut his own hair. It does exactly what it suppose to do... Thumbs up to the seller also</li>
    <li> Great clippers professional quality no snag smooth cuts</li>
    <li> I have had Wahl products in the past, this one does not cut well, I recommend purchasing a better quality model</li>
    <li> Wonderful clippers for our family!</li>
    <li> great inexpensive clippers and they have many attachments for different hair lengths.  I started cutting my own hair after going to the hair stylist for years but getting an appt is always a pain.  After all the years of watching I can do it myself and it looks exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars if the instructions were a little better.</li>
    <li> The best invertions i made, faster shipping and the item comes exactly has describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice one guys!!</li>
    <li> For $20, quite a good value.  Lots of different snap-on clips that vary the height of the trim, cleverly color-coded so you can tell the different heights.  Carrying case as well.  Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> this product worth its value.&lt;br /&gt;Although cheap but i really like it and does more than its value.&lt;br /&gt;Dont think cos it is cheap it cannt serve.&lt;br /&gt;It perform excellent the two times i have used it</li>
    <li> The first time i turned it on it made an unbearable noise, so i read the instructions and realized i had to adjust the power screw.&lt;br /&gt;I adjusted the power screw until the clipper became silent, but then I realised that the blade wasn&#x27;t cutting my beard anymore. Worst trimmer i ever had</li>
    <li> This clipper paid for itself after about the second time of using it. Works great for haircuts, beard trimming and clipping hair between our dogs toes.  For $25, it could break right now and still be worth the cost.  However, it is a very sturdy clippers and I anticipate it is going to last for quite a while yet.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, meets all the requirements, comes with several options for cuts combs, and very economical in price. I recommend it widely</li>
    <li> Works as intended but try the other higher priced models that have the clip on which gets the hair around the ears.</li>
    <li> looks good，but i can not use it now for the diffirent voltage.It is my fault.</li>
    <li> Works great love the color coded attachments. It is quite heavy and I was kind of surprised it didn&#x27;t have a cordless option- my fault for not reading the description .</li>
    <li> I really needed a haircut and didn&#x27;t want to pay for a cut that my wife can do.  We got this and it is perfect, she loved the attachments let her be a bit fancier with  my hair.  I have very thick curly hair and this had enough power to cut 6-8&amp;#34; of with no problem.</li>
    <li> Much different from the one I owned previously, but I found it to be much better I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Quality so far - just with the cutting head could be more comfortable on the scalp - they need to come up with a smooth plastic guide that touches your skin vs the metal guard.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers in May 2011 and they&#x27;re still going strong. I haven&#x27;t taken care of them for the past 2 years and they&#x27;re still just as good as ever. I&#x27;m shocked by their durability despite my negligence. I&#x27;ll forever be a Wahl customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I cut my hair every 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve saved myself over $2,000 by buying these clippers. You don&#x27;t find a return on your money like that often.</li>
    <li> Love the color coded guards no sorting every time I cut my hair just to find the only ones I need to use. Blades are sharp, cut great, very sturdy high quality device. Kinda loud tho could be a little quieter that&#x27;s the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Got this to give my self haircuts..buzzcut...fades..whatever&#x27;s easy. Quality of this product is off the charts. I take this s*** seriously...  Look no further</li>
    <li> This is very heavy duty.  We&#x27;ve only used it once, but it does a great job.  My only complaint is that it is heavier than my last razor. But over-all, I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Owned multiples of this same model for years; great clippers for the money</li>
    <li> good quality. i wish it included the 1.5 attachment.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers for the price</li>
    <li> Shaved all the fuzzy&#x27;s off of curly mini dachshund and she abided it quite well.  Our golden retriever also got  trimmed up a bit and she is happy to have a few less feathers.</li>
    <li> 1. I give 5 stars to the brand and its good quality&lt;br /&gt;2. Have a very good build and feels very durable&lt;br /&gt;3. I recommend it for everybody</li>
    <li> I use it to cut 92 year old fathers hair. Does a nice job, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair cutting machine does the trick.  Lightweight and easy to use,  there are several attachments that are very useful.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. It may be a lower priced clipper, but it is high on Wahl quality.</li>
    <li> Will be a good bid of you and lower your monthly budget. Just love. ...... you should try it. cheap price and I get my money back after the third cut.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Pulls most of your hair off . I literally had to go pay 10 bux for my haircut at an actual barber shop!  Contacting amazon and hoping for a full refund .</li>
    <li> I am not a pro at cutting hair. My husband likes his shaved off so I just take a number 3 all the way around his head. I found these to work very easy and cut his hair very well. I highly recommend for a simple home cut.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best (and only) set of hair clippers that I have owned. I love the design and the ease in switching guards/etc. and it gives a consistent cut every time. I have used this for years. It is also great for beard trimming and other body grooming. You won&#x27;t be let down if you go with this set!</li>
    <li> 2 of the guards immediately broke</li>
    <li> I imagine this would get dull pretty quickly if used everyday in a salon, but giving my 2 boys haircuts at home it lasted 3 years until I dropped it and bought another to replace it. The blades were getting a little dull after 3 years, but it worked so well for so cheap that I bought another.</li>
    <li> As a college student, I try to find ANY WAY to save money. I invested in this Wahl shaving kit to cut my own hair as my hair style is simple... 4 on the sides and 3 on the top... I have been doing this myself for 12 months and saved $180 from the local Supercuts! No regrets.</li>
    <li> Great clipper set.  My wife has cut my son and my hair twice now - paid for itself the first time.  Compare a $20 cutter set to a ~$30 visit for the two of us to the barber.</li>
    <li> I used to cut my son&#x27;s hair with a comb and a scissors, and it would come out well, if I do say so myself! My cousin suggested some clippers and I found thess on another website for the same price, but purchased it here along with other things. My son still cries when he gets a haircut, mainly from me combing his tangled hair out, but cutting is much easier and I can do a different style. No one would know his mommy cut his hair!</li>
    <li> We ordered this and it came on time, well packaged. Ordered this so we could trim some of the dog&#x27;s hair. Well needless to say I ended up learning how to cut my husband&#x27;s hair for the military. Does an amazing job, doesn&#x27;t overheat, been staying sharp, and easy to clean. I use this weekly, sometimes bi-weekly. It hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble at all. The guides are numbered and colored so you know what length you are cutting at. Easy to use even for a beginner. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good hair cutting kit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for.  A reasonably priced, self contained kit with all the attachments.  Using this is just like going to the barber shop.  Cord is long enough and the clipper is of substantial construction.  The attachments clip on and off easily.  I just wanted a &amp;#34;#6 buzz cut&amp;#34; like I get at the barber shop.  2 haircuts and this will pay for itself!  Good quality for a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice pair of inexpensive clippers. I used to send my son to get his hair cut, but being as though I have steady and artistic hands and eyes...I figured save time and money...cut it myself! This set worked out perfect! And my son was happy with his hair cut! Only thing is, it&#x27;s a little to big and bulky for me doing his edge-ups so I plan on getting a smaller trimmer for that! Otherwise it&#x27;s a win win over here!</li>
    <li> Work great ! Gave my son a Mohawk with this. The color guides are nice.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Awesome for the price. Have given several haircuts with these and I have no complaints</li>
    <li> My second clipper set of this model...gave the first set (8 years of use) to my son. Excellent set...no need to buy the more expensive clippers. The color code on the handle for the various length clipper combs is very helpful. Clear and understandable instructions included. The only thing I&#x27;d change is the size of the kit carrying case. Once you remove the tie strap from the cord it is difficult to get all the pieces and cord back into its carrying case. Just a minor inconvenience so I keep my set in a small shoe box. I would recommend this clipper kit having owned 2.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. The best out there at a very competitive price.</li>
    <li> Works well. Older model seemed better quality (as in 15 yrs ago)</li>
    <li> Works nicely, feels solid, can give myself my own haircut now.  Even better when a family member does the cutting for me with these.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful instructions.  Solves the problem well.  I have less hair to cut now, and cut what I do have short and simple.  #3 on the sides and back, #5 on top.</li>
    <li> Item heavy, and  hard to use for every day! If I buy another, It would be cordless​.</li>
    <li> Still using this.  Color coded clip guides help keep track of which guide to use.  Keep it oiled and take it apart annually to clean.</li>
    <li> Great attachments and very good price. I only gave four stars because I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;ll last for very long....still for the price of one haircut....</li>
    <li> These work great! I&#x27;ve already saved money cutting my husbands &amp; sons hair. I just watch a few you tube videos so I knew what to do, there is also a pamphlet in the box. I don&#x27;t recommend using the &amp;#34;ear guards&amp;#34; they cause me to mess up my sons hair a little, but I was able to fix it.</li>
    <li> Edges of the blades are very painful when cutting.</li>
    <li> The Wahl clippers have been what I expected</li>
    <li> Great piece of hardware for hair cutting, can dull quite quickly though. Make sure you keep up on the maintenance.</li>
    <li> It works fine for 6 months after that it makes lot of noise. You need to loosen the top screws and it will be fine</li>
    <li> Nice Quality Product feels like a Professional Tool and works very well</li>
    <li> Have always had Wahl..never disappointed with quality.</li>
    <li> My son says it works good.</li>
    <li> Only used this a few times to trim my unwieldy sideburns. Works well and comes with a ton of accessories.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my cats. I was surprised that they like the sound and the vibration of it</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for a Wahl unit I&#x27;d been using for YEARS. After the 2nd use, this thing was vibrating like a jackhammer and sounds like a racoon in heat. They definitely outsourced some part of production with these new models and it shows.</li>
    <li> perfect haircut every time. it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, and is very well made.  if you cut your own hair, this is the only kit you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Worked great initially but the performance got worse as time went on.  Finally died about 9 months in with minimal usage ( twice a month).  Second time this has happened with a Wahl product.  Going to spend the money and get something good this time.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 6/29/2019&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit over two years or use and this clipper is still going strong. I have now a routine of cutting my hair every six weeks. That is about 8 - 9 times per year. I used to pay $15 per cut... that is about $ 260 savings... this thing paid itself already about ten times...&lt;br /&gt; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;Long time ago I had a a Wahl made hair clipper I bought at my local CVS, it served me well for over three years, my ex kept it when we split. So last time  I handed my barber a $20 and he gave me $2 back was the crossing line for me.&lt;br /&gt;Did some research and found this little clipper, it had the most positive reviews of any, at the time well over 1,400.  How can I go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the case I found an assortment of color coded comb/attachments that proven very handy and make hair cutting much easier, the included scissors (although not the best) are adequate for the job;  but the clippers was the jewel of all. it feels very sturdy, strong, well made, this thing is very well designed, ergonomically correct as it fits my right and left hand easily and I can do the back of my head with no problem.  I did one hair cut so far (not the best haircut ever but I blame the barber for that), now I can get a hair cut every 2 weeks  and not wait 4 as it was my case. All I need is two hair cuts and this unit will pay for itself and I also made some money on it.  Needless say it I am very pleased with this product and I highly recommend, keep in mind is not for professional use but for home. Also my unit never got hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it cost me $26.51 delivered to my front door.</li>
    <li> Works very well!! We&#x27;ve had it for over a year and still going strong!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great build quality. Amazing price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to feel the vibration so much, but that&#x27;s more my own fault as I have never worked with a device like this before. It definitely gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is your average standerd home clipper&#x27;s.Im not to fond of the plastic color step&#x27;s,but they&#x27;re just clipper&#x27;s,nice desent carrying/storage case.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Handsome design and good price. I gave it four stars because it came with one broken clip.</li>
    <li> Great product. A bargain.</li>
    <li> Buys you time in between hair cut visits. Nothing more unprofessional than a guys hair growth running down the back of his neck.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to have for his own when I found out he was manscaping with mine lol (should have given him those I guess). Great reliable clippers I still have a one from 1999 still running strong that I use on the dog now, another one of my own, and this pair I just purchased. My wife who&#x27;s a beautician/stylist says she prefers the Oster when comparing the commercial line, but the consumer level product is great!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price. The trend now is to have rechargeable cordless clippers, but this is a top of the line corded model.</li>
    <li> This Wahl kit comes with 20 pieces. I love it! It&#x27;s really not very noisy. Comes with a booklet to help you with your first attempts at haircutting.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and easy to follow illustrated instructions. Lots of attachments. Bang for the buck for less that $20. Would have given this a 5 star if it had a dual voltage feature.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this after reading some bad reviews, but decided to give it a go.  The clippers are very easy to use and I have no problems with using it.  I&#x27;ve cut my boys hair for 8 years now, and this clipper is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  Other clippers would pull my son&#x27;s thick hair, but it just zoomed right through and he didn&#x27;t complain once.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the vibration.  Although it is very quiet compared to others, the vibration is the worst!  My hand is tinkling by the end of cutting 3 boy&#x27;s hair.  Overall, great clippers, and I can deal with the tinkling since it gives such an effortless cut!</li>
    <li> Just got it today, I think for the money it&#x27;s a hit.I cut my own hair for the first time today and it went very well. I think the second time will be great, already paid for it self with one self hair cut.</li>
    <li> As a person who cuts his hair by himself and at home. This is really an outstanding product. Cuts quickly and is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> very nice and useable perfectly, I like it a lot, will try to buy the same whenever I wanted, thanks</li>
    <li> this machine is a beast and it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;only downside i saw is, it is wired but other than that it works well</li>
    <li> Works great, I cut my own hair now.</li>
    <li> I can cut my own hair now and this works very well and will save me lots of money.</li>
    <li> Works great, no complaints</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost unbelievable; the combination of low cost and high quality. And, it&#x27;s made in the USA. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I have used clipper very long time but this one is the best. Good quality no to noise and a lot of endings. 5stars only for this product. And very important - it is made in  USA !</li>
    <li> This feels like a solid set of clippers, especially at this price point.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one, in my opinion.  It comes with plenty of length adjusting combs, and the blending lever is a nice idea, though I usually just blend manually because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to.  My only criticisms are very minor: The power switch is not that easy to manipulate by feel, due to its location and rigidity.  Also, some of the combs are unnecessarily sharp and have the tendency to cause a bit of pain if they catch your skin while you&#x27;re guiding them up the scalp.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, but other clippers I&#x27;ve used had more rounded comb tips, not sharp points at the ends.  Again, these are very minor points.  I would buy this again without reservation.</li>
    <li> This is a very professional haircutting kit.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of one haircut you can have this entire, durable, sensible and easy to use kit.&lt;br /&gt;This is the one!</li>
    <li> NOT a piece of s*** like the Remington I wasted $20 on.</li>
    <li> It is powerful enough to cut well and not pull as the cordless one I tried from the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and keeps you well groomed everyday. It comes with plenty of sized attachments for the perfect length cut.</li>
    <li> The clippers melt through hair and don&#x27;t clog, they are very affordable and a great value, i recommend these clippers to anyone looking to not have to spend fifteen dollars a pop on a buzz cut.</li>
    <li> Great item i use to cut my son hair and it works good highly recommend</li>
    <li> Awesome exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price, far better than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for quality, and attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair short (about a 1/2&amp;#34;) so I found the right attachment and went to work on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It turned out very nice, Needed help to even the back up, but every thing else was easily done by myself.&lt;br /&gt;It has attachments to taper the sides around your ears.&lt;br /&gt;If I kept my hair longer or in any style I probably would need someone else to cut it .&lt;br /&gt;But hey, how can you screw up what&#x27;s basically a crew cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister used the same Wahl clippers on her three sons as they were growing up. Kept all of them in short hair until they were old enough to pay for their own haircut,</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th set. I buy a new one every 2 years and use them to cut my hair every 2 weeks. Average cost of a haircut for me would be $10-$12, minimum which would make 52 haircuts cost $520-$624. I pay &amp;#60;$20 after taxes for two years worth of haircuts. I&#x27;ve bought similar (different brands) sets from Wal-Mart, CVS, &amp; Target, ranging from $30-$45, none of them lasted longer than 8 months (16 haircuts). Don&#x27;t waste your money with them. Buy this set, spend 20 seconds cleaning it after every use, and another 5 seconds oiling it before each use. You can thank me later.</li>
    <li> Great instructions - works great... now I can cut my husband&#x27;s hair the way I want it!</li>
    <li> Worth the money thousand times to cut my kids hair. He is 3.5 year old, it was a pain to take him for hair cut, now it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the price. I have used others in the same price range and this blows them away. Powerful motor without being annoyingly loud. Good, consistent cuts. Give it a shot if you&#x27;re considering it.</li>
    <li> This thing has some serious heft and power to it.  As soon as you turn it on you can feel it jolt into your palm.</li>
    <li> I noticed all the great reviews for this and that&#x27;s the biggest reason i decided to order it. &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; I have used it once (probably last) and it was so loud that when i turned it on it scared me!! It bit into my mom&#x27;s neck and brought blood. I really should have returned it but i procrastinated and never did. *** I HAD to give it a star just to be able to review!!</li>
    <li> Very sturdy clippers!  I was quite impressed with these right out of the package.  They are somewhat heavy which means quality motor to me and strong parts.  I was also happy to see that it&#x27;s made in the USA.  The color coded attachments are great, it makes it really easy to find the one you want because the increments are printed on the clippers.</li>
    <li> I used it to cut a friends long curly hair, and there was no resistance. I thought I was going to use scissors to trim his hair first, but decided to try the clippers for fun, and they worked perfectly. It was shipped on time, and everything was there. I&#x27;ve only used them twice, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Walh Hiarcutting kit and its been 5 years never gave .me hard time, make shure u clean the head from time to time</li>
    <li> This product has great length options for cutting multiple hair styles on different aged males. However, the ear guards do not work well with younger children as they cut too far up above the ear.</li>
    <li> it does work properly, it comes perfect, you dont need anything else, because it has all you need in the box</li>
    <li> Easy to use, tools feel better than paying $20 for every time I go to the barber....</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my husbands hair every 2 or 3 weeks.  Works great, gets the job done and I like the fact that the guards are different colors.  His hair turns out amazing if I do say so myself.  Good price for the buy.  Could you buy better quality clippers?  Yes I am sure you could, but for the money these work great.</li>
    <li> It almost contains every thing you need for a simple hair cut, including a nice instruction paper telling you how to do it.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, and lot&#x27;s of length guide options! Also comes with instructions for cutting hair at home.</li>
    <li> We used a great set of Conair clippers for 12 years until they finally stopped working.  I really wanted another Conair, but bought this because of the reviews. Quiet and very effective these are  even better than the previous clippers.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the fence on what to buy for the past couple of months. I&#x27;ve read review after review, looked through various products. I kept coming back to this one. I just used it for the first time and I am in love already. First off, it payed itself off in nearly one use. That&#x27;s obviously a huge plus. Being a guy there&#x27;s nothing more annoying then paying $13 for a simple hair cut that I could do myself. This unit is not at all noisy and does a good clean cut. I&#x27;m so thrilled! No more haircuts! No more tips! No more annoying small talk! I&#x27;m free!</li>
    <li> The clipper is nice and quiet and works very well. The shipping was quick also. Easy to use &amp; does the job in a snap.</li>
    <li> Works as well as I expected. I&#x27;ve never tried any other clippers but it gets the job done and has basically everything I need to cut my hair and keep it nice and trimmed when I need to. Also bought some clipper oil separately but realized this already comes with some so I was able to get a refund on the oil I bought and not even have to return it! I see my current barber uses this too and he&#x27;s really good, it just depends how well you use it! Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far. Also, I&#x27;m a college student and frequent trips to the barber can get pricey so this is a nice way to save some money between those trips to get a cut.</li>
    <li> The actual clipper is sturdy well built and durable.  Unfortunately, the attachment plastic combs which clip on to control hair length were flimsy and arrived with two broken clips.  The clip is the weakest part of the comb yet receives the most stress so I expect to experience additional clip brakeage with continued use.  The cost to return the item would exceed the price of the combs.  The small thin combs would have been much sturdier if made out of some other material like metal.  All in all a satisfactory purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> I cut my sons hair with it the other day. He loved how it didn&#x27;t pull his thick hair. I loved how the pieces show sizes by color. The instructions easy to read. I love that it all comes in carry case.</li>
    <li> This tool feels solid and is heavier. Built like a tank!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the complete Wahl Clipper kit that I&#x27;ve purchased. It came with a nice user friendly manual that gives great advice to people wanting to do their own haircuts. Easy to use and includes everything you need.</li>
    <li> Good for giving yourself or others a buzz-cut.  The hair guards are color-coded, which combined with the provided color chart makes selecting the correct guard size easy.  It also comes with clips for use near ears, to make layering easier.  This buzzer is salon-grade.  Buy it once, save money over time.</li>
    <li> I gave this clipper to my son, so I have no information on it, but I would like to think he is satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it only two times yet but it&#x27;s vibration is more than I had before and also it is a little heavy</li>
    <li> Bought this for my once a year hair cut. Arrived promptly. Appropriately packaged. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Item works very well and is exactly as described. I would buy this item again but I would go wireless next time.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m so happy when I got this item. The item really good for someone wants to cut hair at home.</li>
    <li> it does its job and didnt have any problems with it.  I actually look forward to getting my hair cut again from it as I didnt have any problems at all. I dont really need those 100$ hair clippers because ones like these do a perfect job</li>
    <li> I just recently started to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and this trimmer works perfect! I love how easy it is to use and it comes with a lot of size guides in a nice case.  I use it every 2 weeks and my husband&#x27;s hair comes out great.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Got this for my paps and he loved it! Economic and complete! Totally satisfied, good shipping, no damage, and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> It working very good.</li>
    <li> I usually paid $16 for my haircut every month, including tip, and my son&#x27;s hair cut probably cost around $10.  Now my wife cut hairs of both me and my son pretty decently, we saved $7 just for this time, after I paid $19 for it.  Since everyone in my family is satisfied with the haircut, we will keep using it, and definitely it will keep saving money for us.  Of course if the final result were not looking good, it would have been waste of money and disaster on my hair style and my son&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact trimmer about three years ago, and have cut my hair every 2 weeks with it. It has worked perfectly the whole time. It has saved me hundreds of dollars in haircuts (usually about $15 a pop) and keeps me looking good because I can cut my hair on my own time. I keep it short (#1 on the sides and #2 on the top), so it only take me 5-10 minutes to cut it. Very happy with the purchase, especially since it has already lasted so long.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with these new clippers.  One trimming of my son&#x27;s hair completly paid for the set.  Good quality and Prime was a bonus.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very quiet and trim the hair very well . ,</li>
    <li> Another great Norelco product. I have used their haircutting kits for years. I do my wife and she does me. We are very pleased with Norelco products.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time and works great !!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!!! Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice.  It takes a little bit of getting used to.  It cuts fast and can easily go through my husband&#x27;s very thick hair, which is good.  But I just have not used it enough to feel really comfortable with it.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircuttting Kit arrived in the mail in a timely manner. The haircutter works great.  I am very pleased with this product and can recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a would have liked it to be. If your looking for some quality clippers, i would suggest spending a bit more than on these. The entire package is nice, but i felt that the quality in the blades were lacking, Had to go over some areas a few times, not impressed with the overall quality.</li>
    <li> Great for haircuts and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but I have a very big sound and vibration. When you press the fingers decreases the sound and vibration. Sharp knife moves and gaining excessive vibration if you do not have a finger caught! What the hell should I know? Instructions states that have settled bolts but I could not understand it! Could you help me somehow.. Thanks !      PLEASE SEE IMAGE.. [...]</li>
    <li> I cannot speak to thu quality of hair cuts because i use it to maintain my shaved head but it works well to keep my scalp hair free.</li>
    <li> Worth every money. I wanted to cut my own hair, and this helped me to save a lot of money. This also come with different colors to show difference in which level you want to cut your hair. I think this is pretty solid item. It also comes with case! I recommend purchasing one if your gonna cut your own hair.</li>
    <li> Great clipper and the price is amazing! We used to buy expensive clippers, but not anymore. We also bought a pair to groom our dogs.</li>
    <li> I have like a month using it, pretty much for me. I cut my own hair and other members of my family.&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for to use it at home. I can recomended and also very ergonomic</li>
    <li> Works great and nice selection of settings.</li>
    <li> This is a great haircutting kit!  The color combs are fine, but they still have the numbers on them so I felt like that was redundant.  It works great and we love it!</li>
    <li> These clippers work great for cutting my husband&#x27;s hair! My old pair (a different brand) did not cut close when I did not have a guard on, these work great when trimming around the edges and neck! The only downfall is that it is a little loud.</li>
    <li> Work as expected. Many extra gadgets.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Powerful motor, lots of attachments color coated for easy identification. Mine came with a silver pair of scissors that are better than the ones on the picture though. Over all everything included feels like good quality to me. I&#x27;ve owned these clippers for about 8 months now, and should they ever break I&#x27;d buy again. Although I can&#x27;t see them breaking anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Great product. Cuts much better than more expensive ones that I have purchased before.</li>
    <li> Worked great have used it once without any problems. Comes with all the extras and for those with a lot of hair that&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really believe it when I read the other reviews here saying that you could use this even if you had no experience cutting your own hair. I bought it because (a) wth it&#x27;s only 17 bucks and (b) I have this long-standing desire of growing a lush and luxuriant beard* and if that ever panned I could at least use this to trim the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it really is very easy to use and I dare say my own haircuts are way better than what my barbers used to impose upon me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Not really because each time I&#x27;ve actually tried growing the beard, the beard-itch has trampled all over my desires very very quickly.</li>
    <li> I used the clippers no more than 6 times in less than a year; it worked well.  I cleaned and oiled it after each use.  Nevertheless, yesterday, it died.  I&#x27;ll call the mfr (Wahl) tomorrow and tell them about my experience.  Maybe they&#x27;ll tell me to send  it in and they&#x27;ll fix or replace it.  For $17 I can buy a new clipper.  Not happy!</li>
    <li> Overall, it does a good job but It starts to vibrate after 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is very useful item. I think this was good choice.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair cutting with power electricity, comfortable to hold, and multiple mode to use. The kit is very comprehensively. You can choose different size, and it is easy to put kits on. The only problem is the size on kits may not match the actual length. I feel it cuts a little bit shorter than I thought.</li>
    <li> Very Noisy!! The product itself works fine..has many adjustable blade options and attachments. comes with scissors and all the usual suspects...but VERY NOISY!!! Probably would not have bought if i knew it was so loud.</li>
    <li> Works well and have to purchase a step down transformer because my country&#x27;s nominal voltage is 220V.</li>
    <li> I do not claim to be an expert or anything of the sort when it comes to buzzers. I&#x27;m just a guy who decided to start cutting his own hair to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheapest buzzer I could find that is almost name brand&lt;br /&gt;2. Cuts very well&lt;br /&gt;3. Wide assortment of sizes that make using scissors a thing of the past for myself&lt;br /&gt;4. Color coded for very easy use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sometimes it can be quite loud&lt;br /&gt;2. If in use for more than 30 minutes (with constant turning off and on) it begins to overheat and get very loud and somewhat hot to hold&lt;br /&gt;3. Not very durable. My sister accidentally dropped her&#x27;s (she has gone through 3 or 4 I think) by setting it on a 3 ft tall table, and it fell and broke, all 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL:&lt;br /&gt;1. Power flip switch sometimes gets stuck, so you have to use both hands to shut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All - in - all, a very good product, and I will be happy to buy more whenever mine wears out. :)</li>
    <li> It comes with all kinds of different attachments. This is a great get up. I give it the green light to buy.</li>
    <li> Ive been buzzing my own hair for years and i&#x27;ve always used Wahl. This is a good powerful unit, its just a little louder than most other Wahl clippers ive owned in the past. Doesnt bother me though.</li>
    <li> Third pair of clippers of this type I have owned, so far so good, each seems to last around 3 or 4 years cutting my hair twice a month and 3 boy&#x27;s once a month.  last pair most likely would have lasted longer if the kids had not lost the Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is 2 of the combs were broken during shipping.. tho not an issue as i have 2 full sets anyway</li>
    <li> I started shaving my own head with this little device. It works great, seems durable and is reasonably priced. I would buy it again in  a heart beat!</li>
    <li> Through the first few cuts I have no complaint. It has all the necessary parts and pieces to do a wide variety of cuts right out of the box. I have no complaints and for the price I think I will get far more than my money&#x27;s worth. It isn&#x27;t a professional level clipper but it sure gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This thing rocks performance wise and price wise. Something happened with mine where the blade wouldn&#x27;t really oscillate, so I called Wahl customer support and A PERSON PICKED UP IN 2 RINGS and solved the problem for me in 30 seconds. I could have done it myself but I had misplaced (read: thrown out) the manual and all you need to do is use a screwdriver and adjust the power via the screw on the side of it. wow.</li>
    <li> Only had it a few months and is already starting to pull hair out. Even when brand new it would miss hairs.</li>
    <li> Sound, the motor kicks when you start, but they cut dang good.  It&#x27;s a little big to to detail trim work on yourself, but they do manage to cut through my megaswarthyness.</li>
    <li> For the price is fine, it brings variety of accessories, a very practical case, but the cable is that it is not good quality, but the price is right.</li>
    <li> I shave my entire body with this from head to toe. It works really, really well.</li>
    <li> So good on human hair that I bought a second one for dog grooming.  Dogs are much more sensitive then men.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl razor, and the only reason why the first one broke was due to me dropping it on the tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does what you need it to and the clippers are color coded so you don&#x27;t have to strain your eyes trying to find the length on black plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;- Color coded clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Small cheap case&lt;br /&gt;- My first one broke, could have been from being dropped&lt;br /&gt;- On/off switch feels very cheap</li>
    <li> I love this clipper.  It is powerful and comes with a great  selection of guards.  I would be happy with this for twice what I paid for it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like it the case; it is basically just a box that quickly turn into an unruly mess.  Besides that, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers overall.  It is comfortable in the hand.  Heavy enough to not feel cheap and light enough to not fatigue the hand and arm.  Sharp enough to make an almost effortless cut but not enough to nick the ear.  Good for a buzzcut but no so much if you’re looking to get as close to bald as possible without being bald.  This clipper will leave peach fuzz (at least for those that have hair that is of wool-like texture).  Even though it doesn’t cut as close as I would like it is still a good product.</li>
    <li> Definitely already have gotten the money&#x27;s worth out of this kit! Saves so much money and works great! :) Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Pretty solid design and very easy to maintain. Only drawback is that if you have a lot of hair to be cutting with this, the blades seem to start to yank some hair once they&#x27;re hot from consecutive uses (the oil it comes with helps though, kind of messy to apply).</li>
    <li> Already paying for itself! I love that I no longer have to pay for the haircuts done by the same technique.</li>
    <li> I bought this so my husband and i could cut my 3 year old&#x27;s hair. It works perfectly and gives a great haircut. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it to primarily cut my husbands hair. The blades stay sharp and cut flawlessly. My only complaint would be that it is very noisy. Other than that, I love it! (written by my wife)</li>
    <li> I bought these to maintain my short haircut without spending over $100 every month at a salon. They have already paid for themselves and I love cutting my own hair. The guides are very helpful for an amateur like me, they&#x27;re lightweight, and stylish looking. I love them! Good investment!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for cutting hair. Was able to give myself a decent-looking haircut with these clippers. For the price (paid for themselves after skipping two trips to the barber), these are a great deal.</li>
    <li> My Dad was a licensed barber and used Wahl.  I bought this model with reservations because the price was so low in comparison to pro models.  But the ratings on Amazon were stellar, so I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice weight to the clipper, felt good in my hand- then came the moment of starting the haircut.  In one word:  DULL!  The dullest blade I had ever used!!  Of course I&#x27;d oiled lightly as instructed, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  This clipper arrived in horrible condition!  It pulled unbelievably and I&#x27;ve never been in so much pain over a haircut.  (To add insult to injury, I was only trimming off about 1/8th of an inch of hair- hardly a test!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was just bad luck, but I won&#x27;t order another to find out!</li>
    <li> If you are the kind of person that likes getting a lot of bang for your buck then you are going to love these clippers. The blast-proof carry case that contains these clippers is brimming with all kinds of accessories, add-ons, and who-gives-a-twos. In fact there are so many clipper attachments, combs, and cleaning oils you&#x27;ll never, ever, EVER get this SOB closed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers though, nice and heavy, feels good in your hand, the don&#x27;t jam up or anything. My cat looks great.</li>
    <li> I have another brand of clippers that look similar and the quality of the Wahl clippers didn&#x27;t stand out to me till I mistook the other clippers for these.  Compared to that other un-named brand (which uses similar color-coded clipper guards), these clippers are much more powerful and capable at cutting hair.  The only thing is that they are a bit more harsh and less comfortable when cutting against skin and not using a clipper guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper guards are color coded with a guide on the back of the clipper itself.  This makes finding the size you want in a box full of these quite easy compared to finding the correct size in a box full of all black ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic box that these come with is easy enough to fit the clippers back into along with all the included parts.</li>
    <li> My last Wahl hair cutting system lasted me over 15 years and I can tell already that this one is built to last as well. Thanks Wahl for saving me thousands of dollars in haircuts over the years.</li>
    <li> This is a great haircutting kit. It&#x27;s easy to use, and it even comes with a guide. I wish it came with mirrors, but otherwise, this is incredibly awesome.</li>
    <li> I already used this hair clipper and its price is a steal compared to how much does hair cut cost these days?&lt;br /&gt;The color codes for different length cuts is a definite plus!</li>
    <li> Shitsu hair is no match for this machine, cuts fast and straight, love all the various attachments. cut hair like a pro now, save money on grooming</li>
    <li> my boyfiend need clippers to do his own hair cuts and i figure to do my research on Amazon and saw this one and i thought that the colors would help him as well to achieve the cut he wanted. he told me really loves the clippers and this makes me one happy individual :-)</li>
    <li> Bough this after a ten year gap in technology, and I was not disappointed at all. Works just like the one the barber had when I used to waste money on a haircut. Very nice unit.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a good buy because it seems like a trusted brand and many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying a lot of things online for many years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten a faulty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked fine, no problem. Turned it on and it was&lt;br /&gt;VERY NOISY&lt;br /&gt;I had to plug my ears up with tissuepaper and it was still very loud.&lt;br /&gt;Then the blade snapped off, which is very dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;And it started smelling bad, then smoke came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Amazon, and as amazing as always, they gave me a full refund ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much Amazon, and terrible item Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;Going with Phillips</li>
    <li> I was excited at first. The color coding is handy. I started with the 1&amp;#34; thinking that is what the barbers did when I asked for &amp;#34;1 on the side,&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t even cut any hair. So I went down until I found the correct length. Once I got the hang of it, it worked well. However, the clipper is so LOUD!  My left ear had a buzz in it for a couple hours afterwards. So I will be returning this and trying to find something quieter.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It everything that i expected and I do not have any regret. I recomended it.</li>
    <li> This machine get the job done but after a couple of months using it is just not what I expected. It vibrate too hard in your hands and really make a lot of noise as other views claim it to be. To my surprise the blade and the silver part what doing the cutting have turn brown, yes, rusty but it still cuts. Oh well get what I paid for I guess.</li>
    <li> Since the first time I turned on my brand new haircutting machine, it did not work properly.&lt;br /&gt;It is producing a strong noise together with strong vibration and cannot be used, so if you do not want to waste your time and money, do not buy this item.</li>
    <li> Purchased these clippers to replace our other Wahl clippers that just stopped working. They work like they are suppose to. The only problem is with the case. The hinge broke the first time I opened it. Good thing I still kept my old Remington case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple months now and am very pleased. I cut my hair pretty simple so I didn&#x27;t require anything fancy. These work great and are a great price. I actually really like that the guides are colored to make it easy to pick out the one you want.</li>
    <li> The blade comes separate and to install it. Its just a hassle.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and is very quiet.  The color coded guide combs make it easy to select length.  Saving a lot of money not going to the barber shop.</li>
    <li> I would reccomend this product to anyone considering cutting hair at home.  This product is professional quality and has an easy to follow guide with great tips.  My husband and two sons were going in for a haircut every 3 weeks which became super expensive so for me this product paid for itself with the first haircuts.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been getting my hair cut every month for so long. Never again. In one cut, it has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> this is great product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how well my wife would do at my children&#x27;s and my hair without any training, but it turned out pretty good.  After the very first use we have already saved money.</li>
    <li> My wife used it one me once a month for 4 years now. Great build quality but it&#x27;s time to replace the blade.</li>
    <li> Good price, good stuff, i went everywhere but just now found what i was looking for. Specially if you have curly hair like me&lt;br /&gt;this is what you need honest.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price. I have been using these for about a month now and so far they have been great. I did a lot of searching before settling for these. I feel like these clippers were the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these just around to house to cut my families hair and it does a great job. Hair cuts easily and evenly. I would definitely purchase again. Here are the highlights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lots of accessories for the price&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as some of the higher end models&lt;br /&gt;Hair takes a few passes before it&#x27;s all even</li>
    <li> Well made with enough accessories to cut most any hair style.  I can even get an acceptable cut doing myself.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well good price. Nice attachments an carrying case.  Only used twice so far but it sounds like it is buily powerfullly to last.</li>
    <li> Been using it for the last two years to shave my head on weekly basis and groom my mustache and beard 3 to 4 times a week and it&#x27;s been working perfectly. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Work great - are they really sharp or what.  They do a great job just as promised.  It was nice to get some new sharp ones.</li>
    <li> This clipper is just as good as any Wahl clipper I have owned in the past.  With most things, their quality has seemed to deteriorate over the years as businesses look for lower expenditures and higher profit margins.. If Wahl has done this, it doesn&#x27;t show.  This clipper is great, I love the color coding, I can pick the correct one just by color, which is faster.  My old Wahl, I had to pick up every clipper comb to see how long or short a cut it would give.. But not with this.. This also saves me loads of money, my son has a Mohawk, which is more high maintenance than people would expect (unless you&#x27;ve had a Mohawk), I have to re-shave his sides at least once a week to keep it clean and fresh looking.  If I had to take him to a barber, that would be about 20.00USD a time here.. But, with my Wahl, it&#x27;s already paid for itself.  Which is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband so I can cut his I hair.  I am not a professional stylist but this is easy to use, and the instructions are easy to follow. We like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m almost completely bald, but I have a little in the back so, I must visit the barber about once every couple of months.At $20 a cut this little baby is gone a save me $60 buck-a-roos a year. This thing works like a charm!</li>
    <li> The clippers work beautifully and love all the attachments that were included.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who cuts their own kids hair at home!!</li>
    <li> Who needs two clippers?  I do... bought two of these in different parts of the world (220V and 110V versions).  220V one came first as a replacement for a 5-year-old Wahl which was breathing its last.  This is heavy, solid, and obviously a quality item - the colored guides are a nice touch.  Moved to a 110V country, had to buy new clippers, bought the same one again but in the 110V version.</li>
    <li> Even if we only used this twice, it would save us money instead of getting a $20 hair cut. It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and cuts well. The color coded system is pretty helpful as well.</li>
    <li> I had to watch lots of Youtube videos because I was really nervous about cutting hair with these clippers!  But they&#x27;re easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had any problems yet.  I don&#x27;t use them that often but the kit comes with a lot of the tools you&#x27;d need to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Great product and professional cuts every time. I cut my kids hair and they love having the latest styles and this little handy clipper gets it right without all the snagging and pinching other clippers torture heads with. If this every breaks I will definitely buy another. Quiet and effectice.</li>
    <li> After paying for several truly terrible haircuts from local barbers, my wife offered to cut my hair the next time.  I was skeptical but figured what have I got to loose, so I bought this clipper kit.  It arrived two days later via Amazon Prime, my wife read the instruction booklet, I told her which guards (clipper combs) thicknesses I normally request at the barber (#7 on top and #4 on the sides) and she went to work.  The haircut turned out really great!  This kit had everything we needed.  The special guards for tapering around the ears are very helpful.  Overall the clippers and guards seem to be of high quality.  The storage case is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> Wahl still has the unit to beat. I do wish it had the flip over close trimmer that my older one had. The color code is nice as you can see right away which comb you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT GO TO THE BARBER SHOP ANYMORE... I&#x27;m saving my money with this wonderful choice!</li>
    <li> Has been working without any issues.... clearly a well built product</li>
    <li> For the price.. 6 stars. For using heavy water-rusting bottom? -1 Star.</li>
    <li> I just need a simple hair cutter for myself to use to do my own haircust and save myself big bucks.  So here it is.. for the price of one cut I have a tool I can use every two weeks.  I give  a simple buzz cut so not much is needed.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and the color coding for clips is great. Quiet and all the accessories are pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> A Good Price for a quality product.  I Use this product once a week and have not had any issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for over a year now and they&#x27;re still kicking. I&#x27;ve been using them for buzzing my hair once a month and the very occasional manscape. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Used once a week</li>
    <li> Our old Wahl clippers died after about 10-12 years of very heavy use so we bought these as a replacement.  I love the new design, comfort grip body of the clippers and most importantly, all of the clipper guards are now color coded.  Makes it SO easy to find the ones I need.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I just received my new clippers and after using it one time I am very pleased. The motor hums and it is obviously a well-built clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The clip-ons clip to fit snugly, they will not come off while using them. The color coding was a neat idea to help remember which  clip-ons you use normally. I expect to get years of service from this kit. Count me as a very satisfied customer. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors. It works well.</li>
    <li> The kit was a little sparse compared to the last Wahl kit we bought but this one was also cheaper. The trimmers still feel sturdy but are lighter.  The added rubberized grips are a smart addition.</li>
    <li> Also great for beard trimming etc. I bought the previous model 10-15 years ago and it still works as good as ever after weekly usage. Make sure to put a couple drops of oil on the blades, then run it for a second to spread the oil, and cover them with the plastic protector thing before putting it away. I only bought this new one because my most frequently used plastic &amp;#34;guides&amp;#34; have broken. These guides can break if dropped, but break during normal attaching and detaching as well. They are the only problem, particularly because they are evidently irreplaceable. I do not know why Wahl doesn&#x27;t offer replacements, and at a reasonable cost. Actually there are some guides for sale, but they&#x27;re very expensive and there is no telling if they will really fit since they do not appear to be genuine. So, I bought this because it was cheaper to buy the guides, which come with a razor, this way than trying to replace a couple of broken guides. The new guides are now designed slightly differently than before, but they fit they old razor fine. So I haven&#x27;t used the new razor, and maybe never will as long as the old one works and stays sharp. New Wahl replacement blades are available, and generally cost less than a whole razor (imagine that).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  Got it when my friend used his to cut my hair and have used it multiple times since I got it in mail</li>
    <li> got tired of paying a barber for buzzing hubbys head...we travel a lot so this has been a good buy...very easy to use scissors are sharp. Lots of different blade sizes.  It&#x27;s paid for itself already</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive clipper set that would still be good quality and this one fits the bill!  I even showed it to a barber and he said I had done very well.  The color coding makes it so easy to know which blade to use.  A+!</li>
    <li> This product works well and costs little! I didn&#x27;t have experience before with cutting hair and I found this product really easy to use.</li>
    <li> Cannot beat it for the price. Good shipping. Good power. Good product. Buy it or not, have a great day/night.</li>
    <li> Not rue best but it definitely gets the job done</li>
    <li> great trimmer if you want to keep your hair short , etc.</li>
    <li> Got these clippers for my first pair -- they were a great price on sale. The guides are super helpful. I&#x27;ll be saving a lot of money cutting my husband&#x27;s hair and he gets a lot of compliments on his cuts now. They feel well made and I expect them to be around for a while.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with these clippers. Very solid and substantial. Well made. Lots of guides....I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would need more than what comes with this set. I&lt;br /&gt;I have used these to cut my own hair....for the first time ever. I actually had good results.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing negative to say about them and would definitely recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Good power and many accessories. I like it. Handles good and is easy to adjust and clean. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The clipper works well, better than the previous model I had.  The color coding of the combs is really helpful -- you don&#x27;t have to peer at embossed numbers in black plastic.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, almost half the price of what Walmart or Target was selling for. These clippers are great. They feel like they will last for a long time and do not feel cheap at all. I cut my two boy&#x27;s hair, ages 6 and 9 and needed a new set of clippers due to the others starting to become unreliable. The only think I would have liked to see included in this set is a &amp;#34;Wahl Standard Fitting Attachment Comb Number 1.5 4.5mm Plum&amp;#34;, the jump from the number 1 guard to the number 2 is a little too much for the adjustment built in to the clippers. I ordered the Wahl Standard Fitting Attachment Comb Number 1.5 4.5mm Plum from amazon for $4.00 so no complaints now. I have the chrome Wahl clippers that cost twice this set and this set operates much better and feels more durable/well built.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers.  My fiancee used these to give me haircuts every month or so.  They work like a charm.  They have never snagged my hair like some other clippers have.  Even after two years, they still cut great.  Just make sure to lube them up like you are supposed to, and they will last you a good long time.</li>
    <li> Great transaction, best clippers for all around use.</li>
    <li> It worked nicely for about 2 minutes that I was shaving my pubic hair.  I went to switch to a shorter piece and turned the thing on again and it was as loud as a jackhammer!  I tried to adjust the &amp;#34;power screw&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t cut when it&#x27;s very quiet.  I concluded it&#x27;s a faulty product and will try a different brand.  I looked at the one star reviews and they all complain about the same thing.  Sorry Wahl!  If it had worked like the first 2 minutes while I was shaving my pubes, I would have kept it!  Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy.</li>
    <li> Works great motor seems strong and blades came sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ear tapers....I dislike them as they both put lines in my hair so it looks like I notched my hair like a thug.  Otherwise great little kit, and insanely cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought the first one and it had a bad smell and smoke comes out of it, As well in the second machine.</li>
    <li> Good set. Clippers work great. I cut my own hair and the multiple gaurds have made it a breeze to use</li>
    <li> This poor thing has been dropped, thrown, beaten, and been through a few moves. Still works as good as the day we bought it. Can&#x27;t say anything else about it. Colors are nice, if you can&#x27;t figure out the numbers on the length.</li>
    <li> So funny story, I only bought these because I lost 3 of the guards from my old one. I have had the exact some model for 10 years and it works fine, I have never oiled it and have not had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cheaper for me to buy the whole kit again then to replace the individual guards separately. I haven&#x27;t even used the new one yet and I ordered this a year ago, these will last forever!</li>
    <li> I do my husband&#x27;s haircut and gave this a part of my husband&#x27;s father&#x27;s day presents. I could also say I am most benefited by it because it makes the job a lot easier and giving hair cutting a more professional look  With ample number of cutting length options, its really a wonderful product! complete with a number of useful accessories! Truly recommended. I love it so much i will buy a couple more to give as Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> great product. it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> First haircut came out the same as my barber would have given me great price and will save me many dollars in the future. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Had one for over ten years and still works. Had to get another one because it is making a loud noise after i dropped it. My son and my nephews grew up with it. i have used other ones, but nothing compare to this one. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Seems strong and durable. Lots of different options for the size guards. Simple and easy to use, there is basically one switch (on and off) anyone can handle this thing. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I just got my new Wah 79300-400 hair trimmer a few days ago and, yesterday gave myself a haircut :) LOVE IT!! It is simple and easy to use even one handed!  Definitely a recomendation from me.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it is very versatile and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend decided that he was going to spend the $20 he would have spent on a haircut and buy this trimmer so I can cut his hair. This clipper works great and I love all the attachments that come with it. There are so many blade lengths that I can easily cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair and his 2 friend&#x27;s hair. I am a huge fan of the ear trimmer guides and included scissors as they make it much easier to do touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this clipper. It is very simple to cut men&#x27;s hair. It takes 15-30 minutes to do and saves so much money in the long run.  If you plan on doing home haircuts, you should look into buying a neck brush and a barber&#x27;s cape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My dad, 3 brothers, and grandfather have all been using this clipper for the past 7 years without any complaints.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved it! Great product,  I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Wahl has always been a great brand for hair clipping/trimming/cutting so we knew we wanted a Wahl and after reading about it, decided on this one. It works great for us and have not had any problems with it. It gives a nice clean cut even without the different sized clip-ons. It has required very little maintenance, just be sure to keep it clean after each use. Very pleased with this one.</li>
    <li> Works great,  no problems!</li>
    <li> I really love this wahl haircutting kit is awesome it has all the accessories that I need to cut my kids hair this brand is well known for making excellent products that last long so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This Wahls is not very good at all. This clippers is very inferior to the Oster line. The head on this was very small(like seriously small) and will take about double the time to shave your head. Secondly, it does not seem very powerful and struggles to cut on the first time. I would have sent this back yet like a dummy I had thrown away the package.</li>
    <li> Wow, for the price, shoot...for any price.  This is a really high-quality​ razor.  It&#x27;s heavy and solid, very capable. Love the different guards and how plain and clear they make the process of getting different lengths of hair, as it&#x27;s much simpler than I&#x27;ve ever experienced before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;d been using an older Conair that I&#x27;ve had since college and it left multiple patches uncut during any single pass on the head.  Which made a simple home cut a time-consuming affair repeatedly going over and over the same areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Wahl clipper thing plows through my hair like a lawnmower! It&#x27;s relatively quiet as well, I&#x27;m not experienced  with too many clippers, but I&#x27;d not list noise as any type of complaint whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product vigorously to anyone on the hunt for clippers.</li>
    <li> It feels a little heavy in hand but it cuts beautifully and precisely. The color-coded trim attachments are a sensible design and the product seems well-made. It&#x27;s head and shoulders better than my Remington which lasted only a year with infrequent use but we&#x27;ll have to see how it fare over time.</li>
    <li> After 10 minutes I swear my hand was going to fall off due to the vibration that this thing generated, but for less than $20 what should I have expected?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is powerful and I do like the color coding of the different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In time I may step up to a more expensive model, but I only cut my hair every few months, so I may live with it for a few years.</li>
    <li> I had a Oster cutter before this one.  I was cleaning it one time after having it for about a year and a half  -- the inside blade seemed to break and I couldn&#x27;t but it back together.  This one seems much more well built and has the blade adjustment lever that mine did not have.  My son and I have used it for about 4 months and really like it.  I did not know much about Wahl cutters before getting this one -- I am sold and am a Wahl customer now.  I will buy another Wahl when this one is no longer working.  But I expect it to last several years.  I also like the great color coded selection of attachments.</li>
    <li> I was tired after paying for my husbands hair cuts, I decided to do them myself! Great razor! Comes in a convenient plastic carry container along with everything you need to do a great haircut! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Is this the most amazing clippers out there?  Obviously not.  But for $20, it&#x27;s excellent.  Very solid, works very well.  I&#x27;d say I like these even more than my last pair of Wahl clippers that were over twice as expensive.  If I can get several years of use out of it, I&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
    <li> If you buzz your head regularly, I do not recommend these. Very bulky and difficult to use for what I use them for but they still work without much issue.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described.  I just used it for the first time on my Shih Tzu.  My only complaint is that you have to constantly clean it or it will not cut the hair.</li>
    <li> Got this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay 10 bucks to buzz my head, works great. Came with different sizes. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> When I got the product it appeared to have been damaged by the shipping. When you turn it on it makes a terrible noise like it&#x27;s eating itself from the inside out. I read that is has to do with misalignment of the springs.</li>
    <li> The machine started making this incredibly loud noise after the third time I&#x27;ve used it. It was really disappointing to see it become defective. I tried adjusting the power on the side but too low power and it stops working correctly. I can&#x27;t force myself to use it because the noise is incredibly loud and it hurts my ears.</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my son’s hair in between the haircuts. Product is very loud, It does the job but I would not by it again.</li>
    <li> This item works great.  And all the attachments make using it very easy.  I like the color coded combs.  I can cut my hair easily with this product</li>
    <li> I use these clippers to cut hair. They work very well. Seems like what professionals use in my barbershop. I recommend them!</li>
    <li> It works, great and the color coded guards are a great idea.  I just wish you could know what the 20 pieces were, as I could really use the 1.5 guard instead of some of the larger ones.</li>
    <li> It does the job really well, it&#x27;s just very loud. I&#x27;ve had my hair professionally shaved a few times, so I know it&#x27;s not normally so loud, but quality had to dip somewhere for this insane price! Definitely recommend it for first time buyers; the color-coded bits make it hard to mess anything up or mix up the lengths.</li>
    <li> These clippers are the worst. I&#x27;ve (regrettably) been using them for 2 years and they regularly give me bald stripes when I shave my head. No matter how delicate I am or how carefully I shave my head, it&#x27;s always an uneven cut. I imagine it&#x27;s because of the flimsy plastic attachments, but an not totally sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s got to be a better set of clippers out there.</li>
    <li> Ever since I got this item I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair. This was over a year ago and it&#x27;s still working great. I&#x27;ve saved so much money not getting my hair cut from a barber. I just wish I bought this item sooner. Great price too, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it works rather well and comes with a lot of attachments and accessories, but it is rather heavy compared to the one I replaced it with. You wouldn&#x27;t think it would matter, but honestly it is much heavier compared to the light weight one I had. However, if you don&#x27;t mind it being heavier than most, and you&#x27;re just looking for one that works rather well, then this would be a great item to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product worked to my satisfaction. If a haircut costs $20, this hair cutting system pays for itself. It was color coded and easy to use. Good instructions.</li>
    <li> I used  Whal Color Pro Clipper for cutting my dog. But Our country&#x27;s electricity supply is different from U.S.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased additional trans equipment and I performed my duty for my pet.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is 9 Watt and has strong motor in it. It is easy and comfortable to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is possible to cut the pet&#x27;s hair with this machine . But somebody can be disappointed in somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest it is needed to include hair cutting kit for pet.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair short and can cut at my convenience. The red comb does a good job on the eyebrows. Very Pleased</li>
    <li> Great clipper.  Great Price.  Mine was missing one of the combs that attaches to the clipper itself.. but since I use the closest comb.. it didn&#x27;t matter.  Quality is great and at this price is was a no brainer.</li>
    <li> number 5 guard was broken but still great deal.</li>
    <li> Cut my hair no issue. Owned the chrome version in past and only difference I can tell are the attachments are cheaper made but that&#x27;s it</li>
    <li> When I received the trimmer and turned it on the noise of the trimmer was so loud it could have made you go deaf. After further inspection turns out the blades didn&#x27;t even move. so took the blades off to find that the mechanism that moves the blades didn&#x27;t work at all. would have sent it back for a refund if postage wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. I use them to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair occasionally and it works as intended. They are kind of heavy but very sturdy and hardy. We dropped them off of the porch (6 feet high) once onto the cement below and it still worked perfectly. Even after almost two years, they are still going strong. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> meets my needs perfectly</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a family member who caught an infection from a barbershop.  This set of clippers is still going strong for them.  It has been durable and when they take it to the barber with them, the barber is able to do everything they are able to do with their own clippers.</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with Wahl trimmers. I like the  fact the they used the colors for the numbers.</li>
    <li> This item was a joke.  We love Wahl products, but this thing will barely cut the hair off you arm, much less your face.  No power. Totally disappointed with this purchase and was returned asap..........</li>
    <li> So far so good! I would call this &amp;#34;the beginer&#x27;s tier clipper&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are already a Pro, get something fancier. This baby is good for us who begin to experiment on buzzcuts done by ourselves or a friend (my wife helped me with my last buzzcut and it was great!). I can&#x27;t comment on reliability yet because I&#x27;ve got like 4 buzzcuts until now, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to break anytime soon. Go for it, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Best clippers for the crazy low price.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit for use around the home. Comes with scissors and all the numbered clipper guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cord is long enough for comfortable movement. And with proper clipper lubricant and cleaner it will last for years!</li>
    <li> great product at a great price. It works perfectly. I highly recommend it. In fact, i have already sent others to the website so thatthey could purchase it themselves.</li>
    <li> seems to work perfectly.  Have only used it once so far.  I am glad I went w/ powered - my old one was cordless and had no harumph even while plugged in.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something relatively cheap so my wife could cut my hair for me. The price for these hair clippers was right so I decided I would give them a try. These cut the hair perfect and come with a lot of attachments for different lengths. The first time we used this I had extremely thick and long hair, but this had no problem cutting through it! Now if I could only get my wife to be a little better at cutting hair I would be all set!</li>
    <li> This thing is priced right.  The container is too small for you to just &amp;#34;throw the stuff into.&amp;#34;  You have to neatly plan out how you&#x27;ll manage the space.  The clips could fit much better.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, exactly what I ordered and still cheaper than Walmart! And that makes me happy for sure.</li>
    <li> Love this for giving  my son his hair cuts, cuts really sharp and smooth and is very quiet so he doesnt freak out like he does with other clippers</li>
    <li> I have had an old Wahl trimmer that has been going fine for 4 years. Unfortunately the prongs broke on the one head that I use, so I bought this one just for the prongs and a back up unit.  It arrived with broken prongs on a comb that I don&#x27;t need anyway.  I have now put it in a case with the trimmer head and no other items so hopefully I won&#x27;t snag this one!  Still, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> It cuts the hair okay. But I returned it as I prefer cordless clippers. Not the best bag in the world either.</li>
    <li> Heck of a selection with guards and an adjustable head. Comfortable grip, and they aren&#x27;t soo loud that you cant hear whats going on around you. &amp;#34;Buyer beware&amp;#34;, these clippers are high quality and sharp!</li>
    <li> Had this for over a year now and I&#x27;m just getting around to writing a review. The product works great and has never broken or needed repair. They give a wide selection of sizes to cut your hair from and even comes with a small pair of scissors and a comb. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to save money on haircuts. It&#x27;s saved me a fortune over time.</li>
    <li> Nothing much to be said.  Been using this for almost a year and it cuts my hair just fine.  Old clippers I had would get stuck and pull.  No such thing with these clippers.  Everything fits in the case well.</li>
    <li> Very good kit at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed manual and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remind me of my grandmother and her haircutting chair.</li>
    <li> it needs the second person to do the job for a decent result. In general it is a ok product at this price!</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper with all the confidence of someone who owned an $18 Wahl clipper he bought 18 years ago.  Literally.  My old one worked great and now I wish I&#x27;d have held on to it and bought a new blade or something.  Anything but buy this piece of [...].  I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  As in, get the moving part to move with the blade in harmony.  So to fast forward through all the struggles I had with the binding up of the blades, it too wound up in the trash, and not for lack of trying to make it work.  I&#x27;m very good at fixing things.  Searching hard now to find something that won&#x27;t disappoint and just ordered another Wahl hoping for the best.  I have fleeting thin hair, keep it tight and do not require much of a clipper except to make a clean cut with a 1/4\\&quot; comb attached.  Dear Wahl, this is your last chance.  Deep down, I just don&#x27;t think \\&quot;they make &#x27;em like they use to.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This unit replaced another model that died after minimal use.  This model was cheaper, and is far more powerful.  I&#x27;m able to trim my husband&#x27;s hair in no time with good results.</li>
    <li> If you do a lot of haircutting, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product. It works very well and is a step up from many clippers you can find at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Loved the product! It is very easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use on my beard since I&#x27;d grown it out quite long and my old trimmer wouldn&#x27;t cut it.  It&#x27;s been working great.  It has a wide blade, so it may not be ideal for precision trimming.  But I use it regularly to keep my beard consistently short.  And the shorter guides work well for the beard length I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> we really like this kind of little machine. When I began using it, I know the money I paid is worth it.</li>
    <li> Powers through wet hair without bogging. The adjustment lever works great and the 20 pieces are a nice compliment. I think this haircutting kit is unbeatable when combining price and quality.</li>
    <li> These are definitely a clipper that you get what you pay for. Not the best available, but I would say they&#x27;re not the worst either. I would bump the rating up a half star for the haircuts it has already provided saving me about $20 a pop. The product seems to be holding up okay, and the cuts hair okay. Just okay.</li>
    <li> it worth its price, easy to use. I like it very much. I definately consider to recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Cuts great, feels solid, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem cutting thick hair.  No problems with shipping, everything come arrived in great shape, no broken hair guards.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  I use this on my teenage son.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot while you hold it like others I have had in the past.  Worked well for him.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a nice clipper and appeared reasonable with the price at $20 at the time. However, I had to deduct a star as it did not contain a cover to prevent hair falling onto your clothing. There were other clippers advertised at a similar price, albeit a bit more, but they contained the cover and a trimmer. It would have also been nice if the storage case was a bit bigger or made of a more flexible material such as a bag, that way everything could fit inside easily when being repackaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all is said and done, I would still purchase it again if I had to and if you&#x27;re trying to pinch those extra few dollars like I was, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It was a last minute decision to buy this haircutter online.  Usually, if I need things like this I go into the store so I can check it out personally.  I am so glad I bought this.  It comes with lots of attachments that make it easy to get the desired results.  I was happily surprised that such a nice little product would be so reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about 5 months, and I really do feel it&#x27;s a quality hair trimmer. I haven&#x27;t experienced any hair snagging and it&#x27;s quite the robust product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only weird things I notice is that sometimes when you turn it on, if you don&#x27;t exert enough pressure on the switch, it&#x27;ll sometimes get &#x27;stuck&#x27; and alternate from being on and off and it&#x27;s a little scary until you realized your not being attacked by your hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color guides are a great plus for convenience, even though it makes it look a little tacky.</li>
    <li> got it for my boyfriend. he said its only ok. didn&#x27;t want to go through returning so we kept it.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic and has everything you need.  Comes in a very nice case. Great value for the money. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I cut my boyfriends hair all the time and cut my own occasionally, these are amazing. I use to use clippers that I bough elsewhere by a different brand and they were awful.  When I used the old ones we always had long hairs that wouldn&#x27;t get cut, and just made your hair look sloppy.  These ones are so easy to use, all of the sizes are color coded for ease of use. You have all the size guards that you will ever need plus the ear and trimming guard for eyebrows ext. Always clean looking cuts!</li>
    <li> This kit is the best deal ever. The clippers feel super well built and strong. All the sizes of guards you&#x27;ll ever need and some nice scissors and combs. And it all actually fits back in the case! THANKS</li>
    <li> i have owned this model since 2003/4; have cleaned it 3-4times a year, and oiled it two to three times in ten years, and it has finally started to &amp;#34;rattle and hum&amp;#34;.  I have ordered the oil to break down and clean and sharpen thoroughly, as it still works; but recently upgraded to the Pro edition (yellow), so this will just be a spare...  but for it to operate mostly for 10yrs with little or no maintenance gives it the 5star rating (plus it doesn&#x27;t hurt to be built in America)!  thank you Wahl; I will be a dedicated purchaser and supporter of you products.</li>
    <li> Have had this for over a year and it works perfectly. I don&#x27;t have thick hair, so I haven&#x27;t even had to oil it more than once. Really a great kit and a great price (it is the price of a haircut!).</li>
    <li> This clippers are bang for your buc.  They cut well and they come with a ton of guards.  The only problem I have is that the tiny guards become lodged in the blade when cutting; however, it still cuts properly.  I strongly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Works longer and better than i would ever have expected.</li>
    <li> the brand speaks for itself plus there is a lot of features for the price. execellent product for the cost and gives a great haircut even if a person does not have the professional skills.</li>
    <li> 18 dollars right now? Wow. I got ripped off back in February...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set and the blades work really well. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one complaint.. The box they give you is tiny! You have to play Tetris to put all this stuff away it&#x27;s really annoying :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, buy it. So worth it cause it&#x27;s an awesome set. Maybe get another box/kit for it to store it when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. Excellent value for money product. I strongly recommend this product for all. Great for regular hair cut for kid/boys/mens.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of clips and the power is pretty good. Thanks! Highly recommended for any hair stylist or someone just looking for a good buzz cut.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair. Didn&#x27;t expect much else. It gets used for my adult head and my young boys. It does the job. I wouldn&#x27;t think it would be good enough for a professional barber, but the few times a month I use it, it works fine. It didn&#x27;t come with all the accessories shown in the picture and once out of the original container it didn&#x27;t all fit back in. I got a cheap small bin from Walmart to put it all in. The color coded accessories are convenient.</li>
    <li> This is a great unit, worth many times what I paid for it. My dog loves his new hairdo ;)</li>
    <li> Work great! I use them to shave my long haired cat in the summer. All the combs are great, I even love the scissors it came with because they have a blunt point so I don&#x27;t have to worry about Julius Caesaring my cat&lt;br /&gt;Feels sturdy, is powerful, and didn&#x27;t cost me a lot! Love it</li>
    <li> This is my husbands 2nd one of these. The only reason it&#x27;s his second one is because I friend the cord of his other one with my hot straightener.</li>
    <li> Pulls. Not very sharp and sometimes with attachments they cut</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my husband and families&#x27; hair for many, many years. I had been using a cheaper model of clipper and finally decided to buy a new one. I am so glad I did!! I absolutely love this clipper!!! It is very durable and cuts hair precisely. It is easy to find the correct size with the color code system. I would buy again in a heartbeat!! Very happy with it and you will be too!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of others ratings and am satisfied. It is louder than the previous &amp;#34; remington &amp;#34; one I used. Seems to be more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. Am satisfied and think it will last for years.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and comes with a great little case.  I used these on my toddler and they worked great.  Looking forward to saving money with at-home haircuts!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair clipper, I will not  pay for a haircut ever again in my life. High quality, powerful motor. Very easy to use, my seven years old daughter cut my hair the first time with this clipper, and it came out very good. Don&#x27;t look no more, go for it, you wont be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> motor became irregular after only 3 uses.  do not buy!</li>
    <li> IT IS A GREAT BRAND AND PRODUCT! IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT JUST CHECK THE RETAIL STORES. THEY HAVE IT  FOR A REASON. PLUS YOU WILL NEVER FIND THIS PRICE FOR THIS KIT! IT IS A WIN-WIN!</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79300-400 was sharper then the previous haircutting kit I had before But when I use it, it doesn&#x27;t leave an even cut. Some hairs are left poking out and it takes way to long to fix that issue. I was disappointed from all the other reviews that said how great it was but its okay.  the blades are uneven because I noticed one of the sides of the blades is poking out</li>
    <li> Cheap but practical. Good item.</li>
    <li> Clogs, jams, and can&#x27;t cut worth a damn. I have a number of other electric cutters that work 10x better. Steer clear.</li>
    <li> just used it today very sharp</li>
    <li> Great product. Powerful machine. Combs are great, easy to find the sizes. Set comes with combs and scissors. Amazing price.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting you&#x27;re own hair</li>
    <li> Works great, the taper lever is invaluable. I like the color coded guards also. Best part, made in the U.S.A. It definitely feels like a well made quality clipper, very surprising for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the item, however the number 4 guide comb is broke</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, cuts quick and seriously saved me a ton of money because my hair grows so fast.</li>
    <li> its very product,perfect cut pressition, iam glad to have it, the store is very eficient,thanks alot</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for home use. We have three boys and one male who use this product regulary. It is easy and simple. It is smooth even without the blade on. It is kind of loud compared to others which scares the youngest child. It appears to be relaible and easy to clean from what I have done with it thus far.</li>
    <li> A great product. Feels sturdy and like it will last.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a wide variety of clippers. I use this most often to trim hair around my ears and maintain my sideburns and beard. Recommended for those who wish to cut their own hair, have their SO cut their hair, or those just doing maintenance on their barber cut hair (like myself).</li>
    <li> So far, we love this.  It&#x27;s priced at the cost of a haircut, so we already feel like we got our moneys worth. It feels strong, cuts really clean and is pretty quiet, considering.  What more could you want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, a smock-- it would be nice to have a smock included with this kit.  But at the price-- maybe that&#x27;s asking too much.</li>
    <li> Cut my son&#x27;s hair like a pro. A great set of clipper for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent home haircut kit, all the attachments and tools you could possible need. Highly recommend this. Seems to be very high quality, cleans easily, color coding on the face make selecting your trim length a snap.</li>
    <li> It totally worth it! i am really happy with my purchase, cutting my hair has been really easy with guide combs, and it takes less than 15 mins for me to cut my hair now! Love it!</li>
    <li> It broke after using it 3 times, very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works as expected.</li>
    <li> Want to feel like a real hairstylist without actually going to cosmetology school? By all means, purchase this, fire it up, and just go to town on the nearest male head you can find. Sure, the instructions provided offer a detailed guide to strategically cutting hair, but if you&#x27;re feeling creative, snap on any one of the many clip-on guides they provide and start trimming. The soothing vibrations will no doubt lull your unsuspecting client into believing that you are actually trained at this. If things go awry and the client is less than pleased with the result, quickly brush off remaining hair (with small brush provided!) and put the clippers and covers into the nifty storage box and run as fast as you can.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and using these clippers for a closer buzz cut works just fine.</li>
    <li> these last 5-8 yrs my last one lasted almost 7 yrs use wahl oil or wahl spray also wd40 works in moderation save allot of $ when you cut your own this brand is used in the professional industry as well the wahl chrome plated you will see there but i used both the last 20 yrs their both the same great holding box and attachments are included</li>
    <li> I got my husband a new set, and it was just a disappointment when this is his favorite brand and swears by the name. I order him the exact same model that he&#x27;s had for Years and the new one pulls his hairs as bad as the old one. And my husband does Not have long hair, he barely has any hair, he&#x27;s Marine plus Law Enforcement and has always had a short cut.. other than that it&#x27;s good, shipping time was fast..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t like putting negative things just disappointed. .&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Lassman-Mendoza</li>
    <li> Nice blades and power. If you wish to have something to last for more than 1 year, buy this one. Excellent quality for the price. Sharp blades, nice weight and great power.</li>
    <li> Great quality! I had bought other razors before and this is by far the best. It is also not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> Good but shipping expensive</li>
    <li> These replaced a14 year old Wahl clipper. They work great</li>
    <li> Used this cutter for a couple dozen times now and it&#x27;s performing quite well. There is a loud click when it starts but afterwards it&#x27;s surprisingly quiet.I had been cleaning and oiling it after each use and it cuts well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using wireless clippers all this time. This thing is a beast, easily on par with anything you&#x27;ll find in a barbershop. It has a lot of attachments, very easy to operate (I didn&#x27;t care for the color-coding until I needed it. No more digging around looking for the size you want), very easy to clean and maintain. It comes with a plastic storage case that&#x27;s nothing special, but gets the job done. The taper function is very useful and solidly engineered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have someone cut your hair for you at home I can&#x27;t imagine anything better than this.</li>
    <li> I liked the product. It has a good cost-benefit.</li>
    <li> Had for a few years now.  Working great.  Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because I can tell its starting to go and my one before seems like it will have lasted for a couple years longer.  Overall, very nice.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with these clippers. They work great, have plenty of attachments, scissors, everything you need, and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality, very easy to use, very clearly by the colors. Excellent brand, excellent accessories. Recommended</li>
    <li> There have been a few quirks where I&#x27;ve had to line up and tighten the blades, but that&#x27;s to be expected at this price point.  I&#x27;m just now after over 2 years buying replacement blades, and I&#x27;m using it monthly on my 2 kids and husband.  Works great!</li>
    <li> We purchased this haircutting kit to use with the #12 (1.5&amp;#34;)  Wahl cutting guide which we purchased separately. I can give my son longer hair cuts with this set-up. The cutter works well, but it does vibrate quite a bit more than the equivalent Conair cutter we have been previously using. I will use this Wahl cutter when using the #12 guide, but will continue to use the Conair for all other hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Paid for itself with the first two hair cuts.  I keep my hair very short (a number 1/2 all over) so this was an ideal substitute for the bi-weekly trips to my barbers.  It is heavy duty and the accessories that come in the kit are extensive.  While I would never claim to be able to cut like a pro, I don&#x27;t need to with my preferred style.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. My wife cuts my hair and she likes this cutter alot. Our old Wahl finally gave up after many years so we just replaced it with another Wahl. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> works very well. i have very thick hair and it trims it nicely. The color coding helps too. I saw this same exact model at Ulta on sale for $24.99 which is still more expensive than on here, so it is definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Loved it, i got it cheap and excelent quality.</li>
    <li> It looks like it will probably be okay, because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but all of the equipment looks to be of real good quality.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Many lengths to choose from. My partner loves it. He says it&#x27;s one of the best he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works great and I love the colored guards!</li>
    <li> It was smooth for the first 2 minutes of usage, but shortly after a very annoying and loud rattling vibration started at the blades.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was broken or not but I decided not to use anymore for safety precaution.</li>
    <li> Works great. My sister still uses it for her son without complaints</li>
    <li> works wonderfully, very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great clippers - the large selection of attachments makes it very easy to give a good haircut.  One home haircut will just about pay for the clippers.</li>
    <li> Use this every 8 weeks to cut my husbands hair. Works great with easy to remember, color coded attachments for different lengths.</li>
    <li> GREAT! i cut my own hair now, i broke even the first time!</li>
    <li> LIKE THEM ,BUT NOT AS WELL AS OLDER VERSION,</li>
    <li> It works with big voice. And it is very uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Its amazing to me they can make these so inexpensivley. These are really well made and will last forever. My last one I bought 10 years ago but it slipped out of my hand and and broke. Only cost $17 to replace. Hope they make a cordless someday. I have learned to cut my own hair better then the pros cut it. I don&#x27;t care about saving the cost of a hair cut as much as I like having the control of how it turns out.</li>
    <li> Good item, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It startet to make a really loud and annoying noise with almost no use! Bad quality!</li>
    <li> I used this as dog clipper. Worth it! Hah! Because  dog clippers breaks down easily for oned under 50 bucks. So i love this clippers for that.</li>
    <li> Works well . . . lots of accessories to use which I do use . . . easy to handle and cleans up fast.</li>
    <li> there was not set that it works only 110 volt</li>
    <li> I wanted the more classic silver/white Wahl found in salons, but this colour-coded one was much cheaper. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, because the colour-coded guards are really, really, really, really, really, REALLY, did I say really, really useful. The build-quality is classic Wahl: built like a tank.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from New Zealand... I bought this product from Amazon few weeks ago &amp; it seems like i&#x27;m going to return this asap.its really loud.... &amp; scary to hold on to ut coz it vibrates soo hard..this is the 1st time i bought a WAHL product &amp; it seems like this honna bd the last as well... Dissapointed about the product..!!!</li>
    <li> Does the work as mentioned. Go for it.</li>
    <li> It was ok. I looked at videos on Youtube on cutting Toddler&#x27;s hair. My son still freaks out since it is so noisy. I say pass if you have a toddler.</li>
    <li> I have only had this a short time, but it operates as advertised, and the reviews of the product were accurate. All accessories needed for a haircut were included. At it&#x27;s reasonable price I am already saving money after only two haircuts at home.</li>
    <li> Not loud at all. Directions very easy to understand. The clipper are kind of heavy but that&#x27;s expected to be normal. The guide for them are very easy to use. I used them on mine and cousin ms head no complain. Easy to handle too. I would recommend anyone to buy.</li>
    <li> Amazing clipper, this one is just as nice as the pro grade clipper that it has replaced.</li>
    <li> You can never get it wrong with a Wahl clipper. When I read some bad reviews about this clipper I was worried but I went ahead to buy it. I am so happy I bought it. I wonder how people say this is noisy. This has an electric motor for crying out loud. The cut is something else. This is soooooo good. I am enjoying mine. In fact I have had like 6 hair cuts with this and still going. It has long paid for itself. People at home this is your clipper.</li>
    <li> Wall Hair Clipper with attachments; different sized combs for different length hair.  Item as described.</li>
    <li> Good device, I&#x27;m loving it. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth mentioning is that this device is not heating up after using for 10-20 minutes. I had other product before which had the heating issue.</li>
    <li> We bought this to try and do haircuts for our kids at home and about a year later we still use it without any problems. However, the unit does get quite hot fairly quickly which makes the kids wary of getting burned. Also, it comes with about 15 different pieces including different size heads, combs, scissors, cleaning brush, etc, but all in one plastic container without any compartments. So it&#x27;s just one big jumbled mess making it difficult to put away when finished. I guess it one of those &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; scenarios!</li>
    <li> So far so good. The clippers do pull my hair sometimes which doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad but, will wake you up in the morning. Otherwise, cuts straight but, I like the older models more.</li>
    <li> Love that it is color coded. So far, great clippers, used it for approximately 6 months now. Even hair cuts for my husband, and quick too.</li>
    <li> Works good, these just never last a real long time.  Lots of hair to cut in our home though, so what can you expect?</li>
    <li> Excellent product for an even better price. This is perfect for the do it yourself haircutter. Zero complaints after several hair cuts. Cheap and works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this item two months ago for $19.00, sold and shipped by Amazon.  The unit itself is very well made, and the attachments are also durable.  The power cord has sufficient length.  The no-slip grip is an added benefit... you don&#x27;t want an &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; in your hair.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done as advertised.  It&#x27;s lasted over six weeks of using it two-times daily and still works great.</li>
    <li> These work great! We love the quality of them. it made cutting hair a breeze!</li>
    <li> I love it, it is very comfortable and ergonomic, it is not too heavy, doesn&#x27;t has vibrations. I used it to cut my hair and beard by myself. The manual is very useful and intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, it is a great product and the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> WARNING:  don&#x27;t have time to write a lengthy review but this POS isn&#x27;t worth a dollar....it broke first time trimming my hair and I was not allowed a refund cause the window period closed....it&#x27;s in the garbage....very cheaply made product</li>
    <li> Everything we expected. Advice would be to use the largest attachment at first until you get used to using it.</li>
    <li> My dad bought me my first pair of clippers years ago. I keep my hair pretty short and figured it would be a great way to save money I would otherwise spend on those bi-monthly haircuts. When my first trimmer stopped working I bought this Wahl and I have been satisfied. Plenty of settings and they are color coded so you don&#x27;t spend 5 minutes fumbling around in the container for the right size. Great for personal grooming too... a must have for men!</li>
    <li> Clippers have a nice and smooth operation. Color guides and learn how to book make it easy for beginners to learn how to cut your own hair. Comes with a nice little carrying case also</li>
    <li> These Hair Clippers are really nice.  They are heavy-duty, strong, really good power and have more than enough attachments...really satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. Hopefully lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Its an ok product. My previous clipper was  a Conair. Had it for 8years then it finally gave out. Well, the motor was still fine but the blade surrendered. Anyways, this clipper would cut you if youre not careful around the edges. Would only happen if you shave your head to 0. Meaning no attachments. Otherwise, a solid, quiet-er clipper so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to groom my dog myself. He&#x27;s a rescue and he gets very violent when being groomed and I&#x27;d rather him bite me than someone else.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good my son used it on his hair because it has so many more lengths than the one for humans.</li>
    <li> They cut my sons hair well.  No complaints for an inexpensive pair of sheers...</li>
    <li> No need to go to the barber shop anymore... It is just perfect, easy to use, to clean and to store.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who was always disgusted with the barbers who would not listen to what he wanted.  Now...he is the barber and he loves it!</li>
    <li> Powerful clippers with budget price . Easy to use for hair cutting.</li>
    <li> This clipper stopped working after one month. Avoid buying this item at all costs!</li>
    <li> the quality and price are excellent. the kit of clips and assorted items are comprehensive. the low noise and solid feel of the clippers speak of the quality!</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly on my dog... It was exactly what I wanted and more than what I expected for the price... There are so many options for lengths and it even came with hair scissors! I could trim areas with them that were more sensitive (like around her ears) which was so nice. I&#x27;m sure it would work wonderfully on people as well! Very nice product.</li>
    <li> An inexpensive yet smooth running hair clippers. I haven&#x27;t had them long yet, so I can&#x27;t vouch for their longevity.</li>
    <li> My husband loves these! They are easy to use and it seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I used it twice. I usually do a buzz cut #2 and #1. I need to practice how to do my hair line. it does get hot if you take long with it, and it&#x27;s pretty much quiet compare to the old one I had.</li>
    <li> Great quality clippers (and cutting adjustment attachments)!  Cuts smooth and painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy the Conair haircutting clippers!  These wahl ones are similarly priced and the conair ones actually hurt, the conair ones pulled and tugged more than they actually cut.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Great vendor!</li>
    <li> This item is great!!! It came with everything as it was described and now I&#x27;m cutting my own hair and saving time and money by not going to the barbershop! I can always stay fresh at my own convenience.</li>
    <li> Works the best. and the price is cheap.I noticed its better to buy these cheap ones that last about a year and keep buying the same one than purchase the expensive ones that never cut good even from the start. FYI its still works after a year, just the blade does cut that well as it did before. Im on my second pair, and will continue to purchase this model.</li>
    <li> Because our 2-yr-old son cut up so badly at the barber shop, we had to settle for taking him every 4-6 weeks to clear the length of his hair without any fancy blending or taping. It was always an unfinished look but better than no cut at all. Buying these clippers has absolutely solved the problem. They are relatively quiet and don&#x27;t heat up much. The guides are easy to change. Instead of a half hour of struggling with our son, we can do a few 10-min sessions over an afternoon--cut most of the hair, even it out, edge for completion--all while watching cartoons. At this price, the set would have paid for itself by saving us two trips to the barber. However, it&#x27;s proven to be an incredible investment after just one use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really take the color coding into consideration when buying this, but when I was scrambling around for the different sizes, it made it easier than the typical search for number.&lt;br /&gt;I used to own a clipper when I was younger but it wasn&#x27;t a very good one.  I know Wahl has a good reputation so I opted to try this one out.  I had a full head of hair which I buzzed completely.  I was thinking I might have to start with a higher number and go down, but I started with a 2 and went through.  It cut through my hair so easily.  I was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;The case is a little small and ghetto, but it&#x27;s free.  And it does its job of holding the stuff, it&#x27;s just kinda jumbled in there.  I am actually happy to have my hair grow out again so I can buzz it back down</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! I am amazed that they are so cheap. I have been using these for a while now, and if they ever break, I will certainly buy them again.</li>
    <li> Our old buzzer was getting so old and just wouldn&#x27;t cut anymore, so we had to replace, glad we made the switch, cuts very well, lots of accessories, very nice system, and the box makes it easy to keep organized.</li>
    <li> the smallest guide comb is broken at the first use.&lt;br /&gt;clipper itself is very firm and strong but the accessories are just for the price.</li>
    <li> Works fine and especially for the price, but if you have used a better quality clipper before you will be aware of the difference.</li>
    <li> Works well. Guards a little flimsy, but a very good value.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what was said for a great price! No complaints whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I do all the home haircuts for the men and boys in our family. This barber is sharp and cut easily. Like the colorful attachments and the choice of so many. They are also marked so you know exactly what you are using.</li>
    <li> One word: Best of the best. Actually 4 words. I have used all the sophisticated brand names and paid 1000 of dollars but this one does the job without any problem. If the problem is wth the wire and you&#x27;re te type of people who doesnt want his gf to say oh it is not cordless then go to an electronic shop and let them transform it to a wireless one;) the price will still be less than what you pay for a classy one.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me you dont need a brand name one.</li>
    <li> great stuff. Just like the pro&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Considering that a haircut at a barber can run you $14-$17 plus a tip, ending up around $20, this will save you lots of money over time. Great product, works well.</li>
    <li> Good quality,simple to use</li>
    <li> Used them for the first time today.they worked very well and the instructions were right on.If I had known it was this easy to cut my own hair I&#x27;d have bought these clippers years ago and saved a bunch of bucks!!!</li>
    <li> Well built and exceptionally quiet and smooth running. I strongly recommend this Wahl Haircutting Kit to anyone looking for a quality product.</li>
    <li> Great kit for doing mens / boys hair. I have my girlfriend cut my hair with this and it came out looking very good. Lots of options for lengths and various attachments. Not sure how it&#x27;s all supposed to fit back into the case.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips:&lt;br /&gt;Only use the ear-guides if you&#x27;re going for SHORT hair, like a 1-3 all around. I went for a 4-6 and the ear trimmers were way too short for that length. You would be better off doing it manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers tend to get a little warm in thicker hair, so lube them often. Some oster cooling lube / spray / cleaner could also be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for how noisy these are. You might jump the first time you turn them on.</li>
    <li> The best unit I have ever purchased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rather pleased with this haircutting kit. It&#x27;s good quality and a pleasure to use, and overall feels like it could&#x27;ve easily been a $50 product. The only negative point is that the case is a little small so it can be annoying to repack everything back in its case, but that&#x27;s really a minor quibble.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this to cut my dog&#x27;s hair, and though I know it&#x27;ll only last a couple years (8 cuts), it is still cheaper to buy this every few years then to pay for him to get it cut.  It works great until the blade starts dulling, but that is due to my dog&#x27;s coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I got tired of buying battery-powered beard/mustache trimmers which always suffer the same fate--the rechargeable battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore (which usually happens within a year or two) and the whole thing becomes useless.  Actually I now refuse to buy anything with a rechargeable battery that cannot be replaced by the consumer.  I use rechargeable batteries for everything, but many devices have a hard-wired rechargeable battery that cannot easily be replaced, so now such devices are off my shopping list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making sure this trimmer was suitable for trimming my beard and mustache I ordered it, at that reasonable price it didn&#x27;t seem like much of a risk.  I was immediately impressed by the weight and feel of quality, it just doesn&#x27;t feel like a disposable plastic item that will only last a couple of years.  It&#x27;s quiet too, and works like a charm.  The plastic depth combs are too long to use on a mustache so I carefully use just the basic blades for that area.  Since there is no vacuum as on my previous trimmer there is a little more cleanup of the bathroom sink, but that only takes a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in America quality, a very reasonable price, what more could I ask for?  I cannot comment on the use of this product to cut hair, but when it comes to trimming beards and mustaches I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> For the price , I am pleasantly surprised at the quality and the amount of accessories that come with the Wahl 79300-4000 color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit. Although I was looking for a lighter weight model, I can not complain. This model works excellent and is an awesome value for the price.</li>
    <li> Since the fits time i used makes a terrible noise, sounds like its gonna break apart every time, but i think its something wrong with mine</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper especially for the price. It glided right through my husband&#x27;s thick hair. It gave a short cut and ran pretty quietly. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple of clippers in the past and these compare very well. It is much quieter and not as wearing on your hands from the rumbling. I also use one of the lower-mid attachments for my beard with ease! I have not yet used it for my nether regions so I can&#x27;t rate it in that regard.</li>
    <li> My bedridden husband hasn&#x27;t had a decent haircut in years.  We decided to order the WAHL Complete Haircutting Kit.  His sister was visiting from out-of-state, and wanted to be the first to use the kit.  It&#x27;s ease of use, and multi-colored length clips, made it easy to choose from to give him the best haircut.  He not only got a great haircut, but it lifted his spirits and made him feel better.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79300-400 is my first set of clippers for personal use. Good quality for the price. Recommended for anyone looking for an inexpensive haircutting kit.</li>
    <li> My husband started cutting his own hair and this shaver is great for the short- short style he prefers.  It has multiple heads so the perfect length can be achieved easily.  Much more cost efficient than going to the barber every 2-3 weeks.  Yes, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Arrive at the scheduled time,  all parts come complete, good presentation and quality, I ready use and I liked the cut, smooth cut. Let&#x27;s wait how it behaves over time.</li>
    <li> What a great product. Especially for the price. I&#x27;d have expected to pay 4-5x more for the quality of these!</li>
    <li> this trimmer is one of the best purchases i&#x27;ve made on amazon, i use it a lot, it is very high quality and will last me a very long time, i use it often, and it has saved me a ton of money from regular haircuts, it is very safe to use and the attachments and well built</li>
    <li> Wahl has been in my family for at least 5 years. My boyfriend was introduced to Wahl by me as a Christmas gift and he will not stay out of the bathroom. He talks non stop of the different guards and how it&#x27;s affordable and delivers quality as well.</li>
    <li> My dad hasn&#x27;t had to go to the barber shop since I bought this for him. We paid for the cost of the clippers with about two haircuts and he&#x27;s had several more than that. The color guides are useful, as are the guides that help me go around his ears on the left or right. Cuts great.</li>
    <li> When I purchased the kit, it arrived on time. I like the fact that the device is color coded. It makes it easier to cut hair. It is easy to clean too</li>
    <li> It cuts my hair neatly but it doesn&#x27;t trip the edges. I would have prefered one the could trim also.</li>
    <li> Comes with everything including how to shave yourself. I wish I had more hair to play around with. I got it just in time for the Fort Collins pube fair.</li>
    <li> An amazing pair of clippers for the price.  The clipper guards feel a little flimsy but have not broke yet.</li>
    <li> Been cutting my own hair on and off for about 6-8 years. Always bought cheap clippers because i only used them once or month or so. Well this set was as cheap as those others but was much much higher quality when I used them. Very solid feeling, very powerful and overall just a much higher quality feeling set than I&#x27;ve ever had. I honestly was shocked that for $20 I could get something that worked so well. Cut thick and thin hair very well. Have no concern about buying this product, you&#x27;ll be extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to do my hair.  It&#x27;s a nice comfy design, with a full set of cutters, and it even looks a bit stylish.</li>
    <li> the clipper works well, so my I&#x27;m satisfied with my haircut, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the blade plastic protector arrived broken because the case is too small for the clipper, and because of it if the combs are stored with the clipper they have high risk of break them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the power cord is too thin so become hot after a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so the clipper work well but I have to store it  separately from the addons so the kit occupies more space</li>
    <li> My hair grows fairly quickly so ever 4-5 weeks I HAVE to get a haircut as it is out of control. Where I go charges $14 a haircut and I usually tip about $3-4. Rough calculations: For the price of ONE of these clippers (which comes with oil for the blades, a brush to dust of hair from shears and guards when finished, two different combs for trimming, a pair of shears, and about a dozen guards), I will be saving around $180 my first year of using these.&lt;br /&gt;The clippers feel very solid, as does almost all Wahl products. The guards feel very solid, so much so that I thought I would break them by trying to put them on the clipper. After a little bit of force, the guards popped right on and came off very easily. They did fit very snug to the clippers and had ZERO movement when on the clipper. Very good product as I got the same results (if not better, since Great Clips people very seldom give a damn about how you think your hair should be and just want to get you out of the chair as fast as possible) as going and having someone else cut my hair. If you like great products that are inexpensive but NOT cheaply made, pick up one of these. You will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I am new to haircutting on my own but I have an older kit and this new one is quite better. The only problem is the vibration.</li>
    <li> It does a great hair cut. Comes with all you need to cut and trim your hair, beard and mustage</li>
    <li> Husband mentioned needing to replace his old clippers. With Christmas moving in I looked online and eventually came across this brand name. After browsing for a bit, this model came up with well over 1000 reviews with a 4.5 rating. I don&#x27;t know crap about clippers but for 17 bucks I took a chance. I really set myself up to spend about $60 so I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose if he hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, he used it recently and is very impressed. He smiles at me as though I did spend a fortune of on these clippers. I showed him what I paid for it and he smiled even harder. We&#x27;re suckers for affordable quality merchandise lol. No complaints what so ever in these parts. Husband is particular about his hair and this product passed.</li>
    <li> Seems sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts Well. Color coded clipper guards are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that the blue face plate seems a little loose from the body, so small hair clippings could slip behind it. Not sure if that will cause problems in the long term.</li>
    <li> I have clipper I paid four times the price for, and these work better.  Listen, I&#x27;m not a professional stylist, but to give kids and myself haircuts?  well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought it. I have used it many times. It is really useful. The machine is smooth and everything is ok.</li>
    <li> Such a sturdy build. it feels great in the hand and comes with many different options which is needed. definitely a great purchase. very fast shipping as well. A+</li>
    <li> I have only used it once to cut my boys hair. It got the job done and I have not complaints. The only suggestion is a a bit longer cord. That would make it easier for me to use; for others it may be fine.</li>
    <li> Great quality....no complaints!  Does a great job shaving my head!  Lots of attachments and a nice case included!  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> These work great. Our last set lasted 8 years. Just got the new one and we are very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works well. The clippers are sharp &amp; easy to use. I like the instruction manual too - it taught me how to cut hair better. 😊</li>
    <li> Clippers Came Broken And Wouldn&#x27;t Turn On At All. Complete Waste Of Money. But You Get What You Pay For I Guess.</li>
    <li> I just wished it would shave my head cleaner. Good product overall I looked the color coded clip extensions made it easy to find what length is appropriate .</li>
    <li> Has many different lengths and pieces to clip on.  The clippers itself is really sturdy and runs like a dream.  No problems with it at all, never slows down or gets jammed.</li>
    <li> This is the second razor i owned and it is superior to the previous one. The razor does a nice job of cutting my sons hair. The product arrived promptly and without problems.</li>
    <li> I used a professional Wahl cutter for 6 years and it had finally worn out on me.  I spent about $30 back then, and I was looking for a high quality replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl 79300-400 was a cheap replacement, at best.  The whole unit felt cheap, sounded cheap, and did a cheap job of cutting my beard and grooming other body areas - that&#x27;s all I really use a hair cutter for. This hair cutter felt like it would break once if dropped, or that the blades would wear out in a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very SURPRISED and disappointed that the 79300 got so many rave reviews. I would recommend this product for cutting small children&#x27;s hair, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product after one use and bought the Wahl Professional 8355 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDNCJO/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8355 was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  A high quality product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy shopping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for 7 years and I absolutely recommend it. It&#x27;s very high quality, and in addition to a whole lot of use, it&#x27;s survived being packed and jostled through no less than 6 moves (possibly more) between condos and apartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple, effective, and durable. There&#x27;s not much more to say about it. For the price, this is a brilliant deal.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair super short.  This one does a good job and is better quality than any battery ones out there that I have tried.  As for those who complain that it takes more than one pass - DUH? -  They all do. If you go to a salon where they use $300 clippers, they make several passes over each area.</li>
    <li> For the home it&#x27;s a nice clipper, solid, feels well built and plenty of power.  Lots of attachments.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve been through a few different clippers.  These are solid, well made, and surprisingly cheap.  Worth it.</li>
    <li> A very good quality electric razor.  Has tons of different length guards, all intact and clearly labled + color coded.  Perfect for shaving heads in my opinion.  Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time and worked as expected. With the next haircut it will have paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I never had to do haircuts before, but my husband works long hours and sometimes he&#x27;s too lazy to go to the barber&#x27;s so he suggested if I can do his hair cuts since he has a simple one. I looked up amazon and found everybody talking about this kit so I had to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful and it&#x27;s easy to use. I learnt how to do his haircut from the first time. it has many pieces for the haircut grade you&#x27;d like to have. I also love the ear pieces. they&#x27;re very helpful to cut the back of ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this kit it&#x27;s very useful, easy and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Wahl has made the best clippers and kit since I&#x27;ve known it. I bought another clipper from another manufacturer and it did not work out the box. Great clippers that cut so smoothly. The kit is nice. The only thing is that you have to buy the cutting apron that goes around you. Awesome pair of clippers that prompt other men to say, who cuts your hair? I want to go to that person. Do not hesitate, go for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s bristle-brush hair and my son&#x27;s thick-but-flat hair for 9 years, and we have tried at least 6 different clippers from other companies. This is our first Wahl and the only hair cutter that has fulfilled all of our criteria, including lots of power, guards up to 1\\&quot; long and self-sharpening blades. Less powerful cutters take twice as long to cut thick hair, and rechargeable ones run out of steam too quickly. The blade guard, color-coded system and ear/eyebrow guides are added bonuses that we haven&#x27;t seen with other systems. It&#x27;s great to buy an American-made product again that upholds high standards of quality and price.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a replacement for one that eventually died. Seems to do the job well though it is early days yet. Didn&#x27;t need all the combs.</li>
    <li> My husband has very THICK black hair. It starts growing within 2.4 seconds  after seeing the barber save 12 bucks or more and do it yourself i thought to myself oh jeez my husband is gonna look crazy if i did his hair. but nope ....all is well.. very easy to do..and they are very durable ..they have a nice weight in your hand ...You cannot mess it up they have the sizes and you get a nice variety and even gives you some oil and a brush everything you see you get. very happy :) WORTH THE CASH! BEST 20 BUCKS EVER</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Have used it for many cuts and it&#x27;s still working fine.  I like all the attachments.</li>
    <li> I bought this haircutting kit because my beard trimmer was not working properly any more and trimming my beard was an impossible task with it, so after searching for a while, I found this inexpensive kit and I thought it was worth to give it a chance. The only use I have for it, is for trimming my beard, maybe in the future I will cut my hair, but not for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days (Which is today) I received it and I have to say that the quality surprised me. It&#x27;s really sturdy and well made, when I pressed the switch button, I was amazed with the potency of the razor. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect so much for 20 bucks, let alone all the accessories (Including scissors, two brushes, some oil and a brush for the razor) and a plastic box that come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just used it once, however I&#x27;m really happy with the result.  The only con I can think of is that you cannot choose the speed of the razor, other than that, I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> The first time my (nerdy) boyfriend used this, he said, \\&quot;If my other clippers are orc-made, these are like elven blades!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, he was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color coding is fantastic and the clippers work great. They&#x27;re quiet and get the job done quickly and easily. Perfect for a home haircut. Can&#x27;t believe they were only $20!!!</li>
    <li> I just oiled it and turned it on. It scared the hell out of my wife. It is so loud, with such vibration, I thought it was about to take off.  We looked at each other and could not believe the amount of shock to hold it in your hand.  I handed it to my wife take it to cut my hair and the shock of the noise, the unbelievable shaking and oscillating, she immediately put it down. I grant you It is powerful ! Use it to cut your hedges ! Mow the lawn, anything but your head. After going back and reading reviews, especially about the metal shards imbeded in a buyers head we trashed it. What a JOKE !  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT waste your time and money on this &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; Clipper. If my Barber had had this machine I would not of let him even near me... Forget children, it will scar them for life.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty clippers.  Very good set of clippers for the price.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> WAHL MAKES QUALITY PRODUCTS AND THESE CLIPPERS ARE NO EXCEPTION.NIICE SMOOTH EVEN CUT,PLENTY OF COMBS AND ACCESSORIES. THIS UNIT IS WHISPER QUIET.I BOUGHT MY NEPHEW A SET ALSO.HE LOVES THEM.</li>
    <li> Works great and has enough attachments to get the job done.  It is quieter than some models we have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my barber with this thing. It is so easy to use and idiot proof (imo). I love the quality and everything comes in a really nice and compact case. I&#x27;ve been told that these will last for years as long as you clean and oil them regularly.</li>
    <li> works great! seems good so far and quieter then the last one i had</li>
    <li> What can I say for the price you pay it the best &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34; worth every penny especially for beginner&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve successfully given myself two haircuts. My old clippers used to make me mess up quite a bit. These clippers get the job done, and feel really sturdy. Lots of different heads to mess with. I&#x27;m sure I haven&#x27;t used it to it&#x27;s full potential yet.</li>
    <li> attachments are not good.</li>
    <li> Extremely high quality product and for its price its definitely a bargain. The supplied accessories are sufficient for good quality home cuts. If you price the average salon hair cut at $15, this item will pay for itself and more with 2 haircuts.</li>
    <li> Love out new wahl razor. Color coded combs make it easy to use.</li>
    <li> the great price..work great..i love them..</li>
    <li> Great clipper. We got it (~$20) and have saved money since I have given my husband several haircuts. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and I immediately use it. Now I don&#x27;t need to go and have my hair cut by ores and used their clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Only thin is that the oil for the clipper should have been free.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works perfectly. You can use profecional way, it has a lot of power.</li>
    <li> They get the job done.</li>
    <li> This stopped working for me a week after I started using it.</li>
    <li> Gets a little hot if on for a bit. But works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 20 years. This is a good hair trimmer. It feels sturdy. The motor is powerful and cuts thick beard as well as head hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull. Having a lot of attachments is nice, though I suggest taking the ones you know you won&#x27;t use and storing them someplace so they don&#x27;t get lost or get in the way. There are a lot of trifling criticisms of this trimmer here in the reviews, and I suggest you don&#x27;t think too much on them unless you are a professional who does many haircuts every day.</li>
    <li> does the trick to shave the beard, happy with the product</li>
    <li> Great and beauty product!!!</li>
    <li> Product literally paid for itself in one use.  Very good quality and easy to use.  I run the buzzer under the sink sometimes and have no problems so far.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Makes cutting my son&#x27;s hair easy!</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper at a very reasonable price. Quiet running with a good assortment of comb lengths.&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase a couple combs not included with the kit for longer cuts ( 1 1/4 and 1 1/2 ).&lt;br /&gt;Would like to see them in the kit, but then the price would be higher. Also, I don&#x27;t believe most people&lt;br /&gt;really need the longer combs.</li>
    <li> These clippers are large and extremely loud and they vibrate a lot in your hands. They work okay.</li>
    <li> Yes, they are loud but they cut good for home haircuts. There clips will sometimes be positioned wrong and cause the blade to stop cutting. The clips are so cheap and thin. It&#x27;s ok for beginners but with experience they are okay. PLEASE REMEMBER TO PUT OIL ON THE BLADE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Price is right for what you good. Motor works really well. Love the options for different lengths. Overall good, strong product.</li>
    <li> The only issue we have with this item is the container that holds the Pro 20 Piece product was broken when we opened it. It is made with a thin plastic and was broken at the hinge. I would pay extra for a quality made carrying case. We used packaging tape to hold it together for now. We don&#x27;t want to take the time to re-package and return and wait for another one. My son&#x27;s girlfriend bought him one for the holiday&#x27;s last year and he really likes it. We tried it and liked it to. We used the new one as soon as it arrived, it  worked fine. It arrived on time and packaged nicely. We would recommend this product to other people, just have a backup carrying case incase this one breaks.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Does everything I wanted and had a much more powerful Motor than my wireless ones!!</li>
    <li> I wanted some clippers for myself.  Found these on Amazon and ordered them.  My wife who is a professional hair stylist told me &amp;#34;No way that it could be very good at this price point.&amp;#34;  I really enjoyed seeing her take back her words.  One for the Husband. :)</li>
    <li> Its well made heavy clipper but it its loud and not as smooth while using.</li>
    <li> The best you can get. Really durable and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> Very nice package and everything looks professonal ... very happy ...</li>
    <li> Slighly bulky, I&#x27;ve never owned one but seemed to get hot after a while. I would guess it&#x27;s to be expected. Did not heat up to the point that I could not use it.  Worked well. Used it on my dog, for the price.... can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Razor premium for your hair is the best company in electrical machine. !00 % recommendable.</li>
    <li> Great price works great</li>
    <li> good. but cannot wash by water directly</li>
    <li> This thing is great for being under $20. It&#x27;s got a hefty weight to it and the quality is superb.</li>
    <li> it is what it is.  Good luck trying to cut your own hair though...</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked well for the first few times i used it. after 2-3 months though, the switch to turn it would not work all the time and the blades would jam constantly. Eventually it got to the point where it would not turn on, even if it did turn on the blades would not move at all but you could still hear that it was on. I have tried cleaning it many times and nothing, it doesnt works anymore. I purchased this product in january 2015</li>
    <li> well made quality  product</li>
    <li> timely arrival, as advertised, good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in June 13 2015; it was working perfect til last weekend, and now it is making a strong and horrible noise. And for my bad luck, I cannot return the item because according to the policy return I should contact the seller within 30 days.</li>
    <li> Nice, excellent price, I use this every two weeks and give myself a 1 all over, would definitely recommend, this has saved me probably hundreds of dollars in haircuts so far.  Feels very durable with lots of accessories.  I had a Wahl before for years but eventually the blades lost there edge, but all trimmers eventually will I suppose.</li>
    <li> Best hair cutter/trimmer for an excellent price</li>
    <li> So far so good. Compared to our last one, this one gets up and goes! My wife loves it for cutting my hair. Lots of options and for someone who doesn&#x27;t like cutting my hair well, Happy wife happy life! and hair!</li>
    <li> Loved if it been cordless. The buttons are hard to operate</li>
    <li> Only used it once, but is much quieter than the one I am replacing. I like the handy hard plastic carrying case. Will get back to you after I have used this item for several months, but no news is good news if you don&#x27;t see anything. Posting this mid-February. Great assortment of attachments, as well.</li>
    <li> Juat kidin.  This works great and can&#x27;t be easier- Classic buzzer does what the have been doing to poor recruits for 70 plus years!&lt;br /&gt;Nice case, great accessories and the thing seems industrial grade built!  When you switch it on, you swear the lights dim in the neighborhood!</li>
    <li> I love my clippers! I wish they got a little closer to the skin, but I can&#x27;t complain considering the price and it does the job. I suspect they will last a long time, as well. I appreciate all of the settings and the ability to get creative with them.</li>
    <li> I cut multiple family members hair and needed a strong pair of clippers. I have always used Remington clippers but they go out after a few months to a year and was tired of replacing them so much. I&#x27;ve never used this brand before and so far they are great! Strong clippers allow me to cut what I need in one swipe, no more having to stop or getting hair caught/pulled in the clippers, and all the length varieties make it super easy and fast!</li>
    <li> Just used these for some manscaping and they seem to work just fine. They are plenty powerful and have a lot of attachments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to shave my head for a few months now and it gives fantastic results! Comes with all the length guides you need and costs about the same as one haircut here in LA. I&#x27;m sure it can be used for fancier fades and other haircuts too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the WAHL several months ago because my husband was constantly complaining about the back of his hair getting unruly and long before it was time to get another haircut.  This was just the bottom edge that tended to curl and go in every which direction and yet didn&#x27;t require another trip to the hairdresser so soon.  So I did a little research and latched onto this Wahl clippers.  I didn&#x27;t want a large outlay of dollars as this was just going to be used a couple of times a month on a very small area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of cautious attempts, I&#x27;ve become quite good at trimming up the errant hair and my husband is quite pleased with the results.  I will never attempt to cut his entire head as he is just way too picky with his hair but for his neck area this quite fills the bill.  I&#x27;m delighted with the performance of the clippers and happier, too, with the economical price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for her job cutting children&#x27;s hair.  It works really well for her and she said the kids like that it is fairly quiet. It gets alot of use doing 50+ cuts a week.  I bought another one for my home because she likes hers so much.  She also said that with the Wahls all the guards are interchangeable with other Wahls.  Recommend this for home and work.</li>
    <li> I was a bit suspicious of the quality at this price, but I need not have been.  I have used them several times before writing this review in case any problems might have shown up.  There has been no problems at all with the kit.  It did feel a little heavy at first, but I have found that is actually a good thing as it seems to help you cut more evenly.  At this price, I have NO regrets about buying it!</li>
    <li> These are the best that money can buy and the colours make it simpler to organise the accessories.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a great hair cut, don&#x27;t look anywhere else but Wahl for the best quality Hair Cutting Equipment I have ever seen and used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this kit for more few years. It is very user-friendly and my husband loves his haircuts I do with this kit. The set is so good that I got another one for my friend. Plus it is made in USA.</li>
    <li> I bought this and waited too long so I cannot return it. I just used it and It won&#x27;t even cut my hair!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I figured out what the problem was. My hair is so thin or I guess you call it \\&quot;fine\\&quot;!  It is difficult for a lot of clippers to cut it. These are good so i have changed this review. If you have very fine hair, they will not work.&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for any lost sales due to my previous rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nuf said, Bill</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for years, as I pretty much hate getting my hair cut at a Barber or Salon. No matter what I specifically ask for, the barber or stylist never gets it right. After a little practice and learning how to blend and taper, I&#x27;m going to be the only one that cuts my hair from now on.</li>
    <li> The instructions were clear with plenty of pictures.  It has a variety of different comb attachments to try and sculpt that perfect haircut.  I started with the longest cut and made my way shorter until I got what I liked.  The hardest part was getting the confidence to start, knowing I would have to wait until it grew back to start over.  But it came out alright. I think each time it will just get easier.  I definetly like this haircutter kit.</li>
    <li> I like the clippers and it is quite nice to have the colors, I can jot down a man&#x27;s haircut and note the color I used.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Can&#x27;t believe how well it works for how affordable it is (and made in the USA!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of my friends have bought them based on my recommendation and we all love them. You can have your wife/girlfriend/roommate cut your hair in a a matter of minutes with the easy picture instructions and different length guides.</li>
    <li> Wanted a clipper to help me cut my hair by myself and this is the one. Just learnt to do that with this great product.</li>
    <li> It trims well but nearly everytime it&#x27;s been used I&#x27;ve gotten a nick here and there - a hair pulled.  This was replacing a Conair we bought in store, it never had that issue.  So just use caution :). Bonus that the hair attachment pieces are brightly colored,,each different, so no more accidentally grabbing the wrong attachment when doing a haircut :)</li>
    <li> And will save much more, I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clip on the #2 plastic thingie and 5 minutes later you have a nice, short, perfect haircut. Not having to spend 2hrs doing the barber shop routine - priceless! Plenty of power .</li>
    <li> Used this the day I got it, didn&#x27;t get hot at all using it. Should hold up for years to come and will save me tons of money by giving myself haircuts.</li>
    <li> Great price, quality, and lots of accessories. I cut mine and my kids hair with this. and we all have different styles</li>
    <li> Gave our 20 month old his first haircut and it turned our great! We ended up getting a really good price and there are a ton of guards to help mix it up. If I can cut my son&#x27;s hair anyone should be able to use these things.</li>
    <li> I must of got a previously returned pair of clippers because the handle on the clippers was full of oil.  So its a greasy mess and that oil does not clean off very well.  The blades were not lined up and uneven.  Looked like someone hit the blades or dropped it.  And I&#x27;m not going through the hassle of paying return shipping fees, and having to reship it for a 17 dollar clippers.  I&#x27;m about over amazon to many bad experiences.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this kit and he&#x27;s happy with it. The kit comes with a lot of stuff, pretty much everything you need to start cutting hair with.</li>
    <li> Great tool for the price.  I have an expensive trimmer that I use for my dogs, and it operates so smoothly compared to this one that I just couldn&#x27;t give this one five stars.  However, my son uses this to keep his hair very short and he says that it works very well.</li>
    <li> I got these clippers for less that $18, for the price they&#x27;re great. Sturdy build and good cut (6.5 out of 10). But, I got use to some higher end clippers that were much quieter, so when I first used these if felt like an earth quake shaking my head with a deafening buzz noise. I only use them about once every 2 month so it&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a while. I got this to try to go close cropped. I ended up shaving a la Mr Clean. That was a mistake. A head full of razor burn has been hell. The clipper is OK.</li>
    <li> It does the job but if you want to cut your hair in a fraction of what it takes using this entry level wahl than upgrade to a stronger motor, otherwise it&#x27;s just ok at best. I live in Peru and certainly it&#x27;s better than anything out here for the price but the motor just seems too weak, I ran it through the same part of my head evenly and consciously numerous times and it still didn&#x27;t cut equally all around, not perfect but for the price what do you expect. In my opinion why sell a product that sucks to any degree? Why not just sell a good product with greater upgraded products.</li>
    <li> Very strong and they have some weight behind them.. which makes them even better. Quality product, would recommend all day.</li>
    <li> This product works just as advertised.  Good build quality.  I would buy this product  again.  I highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This gives a very good cut.My son loves to have his own trimmer &amp; he enjoys getting his hair cut.  We have this before &amp; it was good so that&#x27;s why we got back the same thing.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old Wahl razor. Almost identical except for the color. The case is nice and compact, comes with everything you need to cut hair. Nicely color coded for ease of use. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price. Works well. I like the color coded system for the different adapters. If you don&#x27;t want to spend much but want quality. This is the one for you</li>
    <li> This clipper system worked great to cut my young nephew&#x27;s (a 1 year old and a 2 year old) hair. It was easy to switch clipper sizes to cut slightly shorter on the sides and back than the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to do their own hair cuts at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only addition you may need is longer size guides if you want a longer length than about an inch at the longest.</li>
    <li> works great love the color coordinated heads for convience.  they are a really nice set of clippers glad we made the purchase</li>
    <li> I would rate this five stars, but Amazon labels five stars \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t love things. This works fine, as do all Wahl US made stuff. I discarded my chinese made POS set that this replaced as it got hot and pulled at hairs. There was a good assortment of attachments. My wife has cut my hair six times now, making this item sorta free as I don&#x27;t have to pay her!</li>
    <li> The quality is not top notch.  They have cut corners, for example, there is no brush and the clipper in not professional grade.  The last Wahl I had was heavier and the cutter was heftier (it lasted 7 years!). the performance is nice and quite.  does what it should.  recommended.</li>
    <li> Not disappointed in this item at all. It does the job and appears to be very durable. I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a balding dude with a beard.  I have simple grooming needs.  I purchased this to simply buzz my head and trim my beard.  It does both very well. Very even cut all the way around, both up top and on the face.  Blades are still sharp after frequent usage.  Doesn&#x27;t overheat.  It comes with a variety of color coded sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s say you pay $15/cut at the barber to do the same thing.  In two uses this has paid for itself already.  I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it&#x27;s still going strong.  If it breaks, spend another $30 and get a new one.  Thanks Wahl!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and was very useful with all the pieces for you to cut.</li>
    <li> Very convinient and quality product. Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Best product for 1st time users. How to use instructions are very clear with proper description and pictures. I love it. I recommend this for my friends.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is easy to use and comes with all of the length attachments you could ever need. It cuts hair quickly and reliably, and has proved durable thus far. It certainly doesn&#x27;t leave me wanting a more expensive model, as there isn&#x27;t anything to improve on in my eyes. It pays for itself after only two or three uses!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Conair I had been using for years.  I couldn&#x27;t believe I waited this long to replace it with this Wahl.  This trimmer has a much heavier, better made feel.  I&#x27;ve cut my boys hair for years and this has made it much easier.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and as long as they continue to me made here in the great USA, I will continue to be a buyer.  I owned a previous set that lasted about 8 years and finally needed to be replaced due to chord issues.  I find that to be a reasonable lifespan for this product.  Especially when considering I probably saved hundreds if not more cutting my own hair.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying $20 for a haircut, so my wife offered to cut my hair for me.  Paid for itself in the first use.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time but it works great, really pleased with it, feels well made, not cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this for a very long time for my husband.  Apparently he loves the ease of using it all the attachments tht comes with it.  The color coding attachments makes it so easy along with the case.  He even used it on our Schnauzer and it worked perfectly.  Its like killing 2 birds with one stone, so to speak :).  Definately will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for almost 20 years with cheap, store bought clippers that often would get stuck in my thick hair.  The Wahl clippers are far superior at a similar price.  These are strong clippers that glide through thick hair without slowing down.  Awesome. Great assortment of guards, which are made of sturdier, thicker plastic than I&#x27;ve had before. The carrying case isn&#x27;t designed well, but who cares - the clippers are fantastic, and they&#x27;re made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for my dogs. I really like the product itself. It works really well and I imagine that I will be able to use this item for a very long time. However, when I got the item I could tell it had been used before. There was some flakes on it as well as fingerprints, and some kind of goop? Since I was using this items for my dogs and not a person, I decided to just disinfect the item and use it any way instead of return them. I really like them. Just wish they came new (not used) like they were supposed to.</li>
    <li> What a GREAT Haircutting Kit... This product exceeded my expectations... I wasn&#x27;t expecting such a good product for such a low price... But I&#x27;ve got to say that I´m very pleased with this purchase... Everything is good about this kit... Especially the quality... 100% Recommended.</li>
    <li> Louder than the others and cuts poorly.  This pair of clippers just scares the heck out of everyone.  I just needed a pair of clippers that would provide a decently low cut and after reading the other reviews here on this pair of clippers, I can only imagine that they are using these clippers in a secluded place or they are wearing ear plugs or they are related to the company and falsifying entries here to try and promote what is obviously a pair of crappy clippers.  Wahl usually have decent to good clippers but this pair....not one of those at all.</li>
    <li> Saves so much money on expensive haircuts for my husband and son!</li>
    <li> These clippers are so quiet. The colored guides make cutting my hair 10x easier. I now cut my own hair every 2 weeks with these clippers. For the price you&#x27;d think these would be a piece of crap but so far they&#x27;ve been great.</li>
    <li> Super heavy and sharp. I cut myself a few times.</li>
    <li> Works very smoothly and cut excellent..  I like the way it works...  I bought this product because I knew that  Wahl Products are well made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the kit for about 2 years now, it&#x27;s still going strong. The trimmer itself feels hefty, solid, and sturdy. Everything else in the kit feels cheap and plastic, but nothing&#x27;s broken in 2 years, so I suppose it must be okay. The trimmer still cuts through hair easily with no pulling, and the noise level is about average for a trimmer, I think (not sure, I don&#x27;t pay that much attention to how much noise other trimmers make). I use it every 3-4 weeks or so. This was definitely a good buy that paid off in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the instruction pamphlet is probably the most valuable accessory in this kit -- I kid you not, every single time I go to use this kit, I refer to the instructions again. For some reason I have not been able to remember how to do a haircut yet, after having done at least a few dozen cuts. (I think that scares my victim/husband a little.) The instructions are super clear, come with color photos and diagrams, and are broken down in a way that makes it easy to find and reference specific tasks (i.e. easy to scan and find the section specifically pertaining to trimming around the ears when I&#x27;m at that stage in the haircut, etc etc). We&#x27;ve not had a bad haircut with this kit yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite thing about using this kit is cramming everything back into the plastic case. I&#x27;ve removed all the clipper attachments that we don&#x27;t usually use so that there&#x27;s more room, and I still hate it. Everything rattles around, the cord just goes in whichever way, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;everything in its place\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this kit is great. It gets the job done easily, great bang for the buck, it&#x27;s reliable and durable. If you&#x27;ve never given a haircut before and you&#x27;re considering it in order to save some $$...do it!</li>
    <li> brand new items good stuff, start cutting my own hair prety strong blade prety smooth will def buy again if needed</li>
    <li> Cuts pretty good. Had to re-align the blades after one use. This might be a problem that reoccurs because of the plastic mount on the movable blade. The blade height  lever is attached on one side only and is easily moved by a touch of the finger, For the $19 price, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. Compared to other, similarly priced clippers, these are a steel and have worked flawlessly so far. For the price of one haircut, you get as many as you can stand with a reliable set of clippers that are actually enjoyable to use. The color coded guards seems like a great idea, but I usually go without the guard anyways. They are obviously really solid quality, and hopefully will provide me with many more years of use in the future. Can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
    <li> it trim very good&lt;br /&gt;but when i used it for the first time it hurt my neck. it is very sharp. And it is too heavy to carry. I had old wahl it is more better than this new one</li>
    <li> We have had this for about a month and are very pleased so far. It moves well, is not too loud, and the colors interest my kids so it is easier to get them to agree to a haircut. The different guards fit on nicely as well.</li>
    <li> This works great!  The color coding is invaluable.  I just wish it had a slight longer cord.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set of clippers for years.  I use these on 5 people so I do replace them yearly and then use the old pair for light grooming for our pets.  That said the clippers are less then one round of haircuts, so it is well worth the money.  The color coded guides are clearly marked making it easy to remember preferred lengths.</li>
    <li> during the cutting process, it suddenly lose power and could not turn on again. Disappointed about this thing, it did not work well.</li>
    <li> My hair grows fast so I cut it every 1-2 weeks (often, I know). Therefore, it&#x27;s really important I get a quality buzzer. I had been putting off on purchasing one for the longest time while the barbers were cutting my hair and I so wish I had bought this sooner. Has all kinds of sizes and is smooth, does not bite or operate inconsistently. Very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;It has different sizes (almost all of which I use since my head is a funny shape), and can do some great work on very bad hair. It also comes with two specialized sizes for left and right areas above the ear which allow you to taper the area from the top of your ear up to the higher side of your head.&lt;br /&gt;Have had it for nearly two years and it&#x27;s still going strong. Haven&#x27;t had to sharpen or do any real maintenance except oil the blade once in a while. And the product comes with oil thank God.&lt;br /&gt;I seriously have saved hundreds of dollars since I got this, since each haircut costs about $14. Do the math, let&#x27;s say $14 every 3 weeks (that was the rate I&#x27;d get my haircuts at) for a year minus the $20 cost of this product. That&#x27;s a lot of money.</li>
    <li> It has been great to use this product and I was quite surprised that it arrived in record time. I look forward to ordering other items&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from amazon in the future and getting them almost as effortlessly as the click of the mouse. You can experience this too.</li>
    <li> The best part about this kit versus many others I have purchased in the past is the instructions that comes with the kit. I &#x27;ve never cut my own hair before in my life. With the simple instructions I&#x27;ve customized my own haircut with great success time and time again. Granted, my haircut is not perfect, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to use with color coded attachments. Paid for itself by second use</li>
    <li> My husband who has thick hair and shaves a number 2 on a weekly basis is a big advocate of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst it is bulky unit, it is his preference to have a solid product in his hands throughout the process. The quality of the cut is extremely good, he has commented on this repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of the product, it is an absolute steal. For those who do not like the vibration or noise, then perhaps they should stick to those personal grooming attachments.</li>
    <li> I like the clear instructions and the color coding for the length of the haircut.  My kids like the result as well.</li>
    <li> This kit has already paid for itself! It&#x27;s so easy to use and the back of the neck is super easy to do yourself without a mirror. Just use an old ball cap as a guide for trimming the neck.</li>
    <li> This hair cutting kit was perfect for me and is much more affordable (and just as good) as more expensive kits.  Everything you need is in this kit for cutting your own hair or just keeping trimmed up between visits to the barber shop.  The quality is great as I&#x27;ve used this kit several times since purchase and it is still going strong.  If it were to only last 3 haircuts it would still save you money from paying a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also instructions on how to cut your own hair and a color code to make it even easier for you to choose the right length.  You can use these instructions or just do as I do and use the same length attachment for your whole head and then trim the back and around the ears with another attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with this model before the more expensive ones and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect. Easy to follow instructions and i got a hair cut like i would get at great clips, without the wait. love it.</li>
    <li> It is definitely worth the money. I cut my own hair and this little machine is sharp and smooth. It may be a little loud but I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box saw that the booklet was not folded properly and it had been apparently read by someone else before. That moment, I suspected that I had a used product in my hands. When I checked the clipper, the plastic blade cover obviously had many scratches! The clipper itself had some sort of use damage on its grip and lots of fingerprints visible on the black part. When I swiped my finger in the plastic case, I found some hair inside! The box was probably cleaned but some hair was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not acceptable. I paid for a new product, not someone&#x27;s used clipper. Although the price is good, you will have the risk of being sent a used product. This is going back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> What a great deal. I&#x27;ve been using this set to cut my hair for years. Bought another for my brother in law. This thing is great.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for around 6 years now and have never oiled it.  It still gives a great trim every time.  The attachments are strong and never snap or break.  Bought another one a few months back for my son and will buy another when the time comes to replace this one.  Works great!</li>
    <li> The clippers cut great and there are sufficient guides for all jobs. High quality. The only problem is it&#x27;s tremendously loud and vibrates at a very high rate. I wouldnt want to use it for too long at one time.</li>
    <li> It is so easy to operate it! The quality is quite good and my roommate has successfully help me cut the hair once. That his first time to cut other&#x27;s hair and with this kit, he did a good job</li>
    <li> We bought this razor so that we would not have to keep going to a hair salon to have my husband&#x27;s hair cut. We&#x27;re saving money after buying this razor! Works great!</li>
    <li> Good tools, easy to use</li>
    <li> They cut amazingly. Colored guards are easy to use &amp; recognize. Best value for the money!</li>
    <li> For the cost, I have no complaints.  Seems sturdy and does a great job.  I would recommend this product.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> 100% recommend excellent, it is very economical. -</li>
    <li> After borrowing a friend&#x27;s old clippers for months, we finally ordered these for ourselves. They work amazingly well and come with a ton of accessories. For the price, I was very impressed with the product I recieved.</li>
    <li> This replaced a set that were well over 40 years old. I never noticed a difference in the quality and having all the extra guides was a big plus. They are excellent for keeping the hair on your head cut, as well as trimming beard hair.</li>
    <li> Cuts well, has an excellent warranty and is an incredible value here. Not quite as stylish as the chromed versions, but a better value. The colors, though playful, do help with selecting the correct guard.</li>
    <li> Shortly after we married, my husband came home from the barber a very unhappy man. He hated his hair cut. He announced that he had made his last trip to the barber shop. That was about 53 years ago that he started cutting his own hair. He has worn out several Clippers in that time, and was, again, in need of a new set. He was very happy to see this complete set in a reliable brand for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s well made and comes with many different combs.  Does a super job.</li>
    <li> Just got it today and already did it. I shaved all my side, so that my top looks very thick. I really can&#x27;t see my back, so I may need my dad to help me finish it tomorrow. I didn&#x27;t know it would&#x27;ve came soo early even with free shipping. But at least it&#x27;s short now, but just messy. I still can&#x27;t figure out how to do it myself and clean efficiently. The stress is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I will just go out without doing the back of my hair and let people laugh at my back. You got to bring happiness to people around you. HAHA.</li>
    <li> Unlike my old cordless trimmer that I struggled with for years, this one is substantial and does the job. I use it mainly for trimming my beard, which I keep close-cropped. I should have bought this trimmer long ago. And as other reviewers have noted, at this price, if it lasts a couple of years I&#x27;ll be ahead of the game.</li>
    <li> these work great for those college kids needed some clippers on a budget (such as myself). there not the top of the line but they work great for buzz cuts.</li>
    <li> So far is all good, no complaints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Barely makes noise.&lt;br /&gt;. Cuts smoothly throughout the hair.&lt;br /&gt;. Good grip.</li>
    <li> I used to get &amp;#34;bald fades&amp;#34; on a bi-weekly basis as did my son which meant $45 biweekly. Unfortunately barber quality was inconsistent and I got tired of driving around looking for another decent one. Now for the price of one week&#x27;s worth of hair cuts I have unlimited buzz cuts at any time. The kit is pretty complete for what I need and the machine has not failed me, I have regularly oiled it and keep it clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive hair cutting kit. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I like the color coding of the guards, easy to see and grab, rather than having to read each one.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> High quality inexpensive clippers. What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and last for a while. Comes with everything you need for basic hair cuts.</li>
    <li> used 1 time--makes horrific noise-poor job of trimming body hair</li>
    <li> It broke after 2 months of use. saddddd</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly. While it is a hefty tool, it fits the hand perfectly. Color coded attachments do save time sorting thru the various attachments to locate the needed one.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use. I never tried one before. This is the first one I bought and it is very good. The color code helps a lot. Wish I had went for more extra blades model. Then we can leave back long length hair if we need so</li>
    <li> Like the different sizes but makes a weird, loud noise sometimes when I first turn it on. Stops when I turn it off and back on again</li>
    <li> The clipper is very solid-feeling and comfortable to use, and comes with a good set of Combs.  They are in whole sizes only, so I had to make a style adjustment, but great for the price.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair without clogging easily or pulling on your beautiful scalp.</li>
    <li> Does its job, easy to use, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to follow instructions. Definitely paid for it&#x27;s self several times over in what my husband used to pay for haircut and tip.</li>
    <li> great clippers for  the price</li>
    <li> easy to use, cuts neat and clean, I have no problem with them. Had it for a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered in a taped box. Upon opening the trimmer has been used. Other items have not been used. Looks like someone bought the product and then returned it after using it a few times.</li>
    <li> After my favorite clippers died I have been looking for a new pair. I had high-end clippers that have pulled hair instead so I was a little skeptical about these considering the price. My first use though was GREAT! I would highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> man these clippers are great, the is the best investment for keeping my head and facial hair trim, it beats spending 30 bucks a month at the barbers. don&#x27;t look at the price just buy it and you will save money threw out the year..</li>
    <li> very good quality at a very low price. You will need to purchase thinning shears in addition.</li>
    <li> Cut my hair great, however i dont recommend using the left and right ear fade guards, they cut stairsteps into my hair which looked pretty funny. O well though, other than that they work like a charm. I give my self haircuts with them.</li>
    <li> Great price for what you get</li>
    <li> I had an old one which I used for many years and replaced it with the new one. Only after using it for a couple of times, now it makes a very loud noise and vibrates extremely to the point that cut the skin. Contacted warranty service, needed to send it to Illinois from the west coast and pay for the shipments. It is going to be cheaper if I buy a new one but definitely won&#x27;t try again. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll be the loser for the company&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers, been using this type for years, having a little problem with the 1/4 inch adjustment arm on the blade this time around, and the clipper attachments don&#x27;t seem to fit tight, fall off of clippers when using. I have my old set though maybe the others will fit better.</li>
    <li> Fantastic clippers.  I bought these to replace a Remington set that I wasn&#x27;t happy with.  Boy is this an improvement.  Fantastic item and a great price.</li>
    <li> Glad I tried this. One of the rare inexpensive trimmers I have tried that actually seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> It came  when they said and it works great</li>
    <li> My favorite set; my previous one of these lasted me like 4 years with 2x/month use and absolutely no care (except lubricant once in a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set, they have slightly different attachments... the tips are sharper than my older set, so it kinda scrapes your scalp more at the typical angle (I was using the 1x so no hair to pad it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I swear by these things. Will last for years and never dulls, doesn&#x27;t rust easy, never gets stuck/caught on thick hair.</li>
    <li> This machine pulls my hair and the cut isnt perfect bought since its wahl but its no good</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with many combs for different shades and even a few combs used specifically for the area around your ears. Also comes with a nice pair of scissors, a small bottle of razor oil, and a plastic carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;- Quality razor. It does not feel cheap or anything. I am not a professional barber but I do know that I do not get a feeling of lackluster material when I hold it.&lt;br /&gt;- The blue area of the razor is a rubber grip that is useful while cutting.&lt;br /&gt;- Does a great job of cutting hair. I use it mainly on my beard but I know that if this were used on hair it would have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- EXTREMELY loud. Louder than you would expect a razor to be. It sounds like a lawnmower motor in a razor&#x27;s body. In addition to the loud noise, the vibrations are very noticeable too. This is not a dull buzz, this is a loud noise.&lt;br /&gt;- While it does a very good job at cutting hair using the combs, the base razor without the combs is actually pretty lackluster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a razor that I could use mainly for my beard (and my hair when getting to a barber was not an option) and for the money I spent, this razor does a good job at filling those roles. Although it can be extremely loud, it does do a very nice job at cutting hair. Even my own personal barber made a comment on how good a deal this kit is for it&#x27;s price. If you&#x27;re looking to cut your own hair, or to start cutting others hair on the side, this is definitely a good place to start if you are not looking to break the bank for a professional razor.</li>
    <li> very good quality for that price..less expensive but very dependable and sturdy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent piece. Very powerful and love it !!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful clipper. Super price.</li>
    <li> Ugh.  I bought these to cut hair for my two little boys (2 and 4 years old) and I never even used them.  They were way too loud and either would have scared them out of haircuts forever, or deafened them.  Total waste of money.  I don&#x27;t understand the high rating with this amount of noise.</li>
    <li> This was by far the worst clipper purchase I have ever made. The #2 and #3 were both bent and would not retain their shape when bent back. They cut on a slope. Used once and threw away.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent deal. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> Overall great quality clippers, cuts hair well and is not loud at all. I&#x27;m on deployment, bought these to start cutting hair in my shop on the ship, they do great. Only issue I have with them is that the blades are crooked. The right side sits lower than the left side, so you have to pay more attention to where you cut. I would definitely buy again, if I knew the blades were right. Thank you!</li>
    <li> we were in a pickle because we moved from NY to FL and we forgot his clippers at my moms house so I wanted to find the best quality for the lowest price since I knew he&#x27;d eventually get his from NY and these definitely helped out! The precision is very good and we love the color coded guards! It makes it so much easier for me when I am helping to cut his hair!!</li>
    <li> Such a great deal for the price</li>
    <li> Great quality, comes with many attachments, really good buy!!</li>
    <li> Could be a bit sharper</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers. Wife loves them.</li>
    <li> Product from this vendor arrived used with gooey thumb prints with hair! Returned was talked by agent into trying again and again came used! Returned again for good.</li>
    <li> Came a few days before it was suppose to. Works really well and I love all of the pieces it comes with I bought two of them and if I ever need to buy more I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Only used twice so far but works great and pretty quiet. I cut my 1 and 1/2 yr Ike&#x27;s hair ans the old one I had was so loud that he hated getting it cut. He doesn&#x27;t mind this one as much. Also this one had many attachments which I love. Only problem is the case. It&#x27;s cheaply made ans broke the first time we were putting everything away. Otherwise, I&#x27;d have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> completely outstanding.....cuts smooth and clean...one of the best buys on amazon...i used it 4 times alreay...at 12 bucks a haircut...you do the math!...dont walk...run to buy it</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Wahl trimmer after it suffered one too many drops on the floor and was pleasantly surprised to hear how much quieter the new models are.  Color-coding the accessories is a really nice touch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do two haircuts and this&#x27;ll more than pay for itself.  Considering that my last one lasted 10+ years this is a big win.</li>
    <li> Cuts smooth and evenly.  Used to cut my sons&#x27; hair along within mine.  By the second use it had already paid for itself</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I can cut my little one&#x27;s hair back in August and I have used it 3 times total, technically 6 since I had to go back each time to &#x27;fix&#x27; the bad DIY haircut (I will get it right the first time at some point!).  The buzzing sound is definitely low, just as low if not lower than the one my barber uses.  My 2 year old was not scared of the noise and I just handed him a few of the guards and that kept him occupied the whole time.  The storage box is a nice touch, everything fits in there neatly and is convenient to carry everything around in it.  The no cape might be an issue for some but I just took an old button down shirt and used that as a cape.  I only gave it 4 stars since some of the smaller guards provided (1/4 and 1/8) have too big of gap between the cut sizes.  Maybe it&#x27;s me and once i get the blending down that rating will change.</li>
    <li> The kit works great on my dog and on my man&#x27;s beard.  The dog is okay thanks to it&#x27;s fairly quiet motor and the man is happy that it can trim his beard in half the time his regular beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my expectations and the price was so right!</li>
    <li> Good set of clippers, like the color coding</li>
    <li> Great. Professional results every time. Cuts well, powerful, wide range of accessories, good price. Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> Good buy good for for home use. I normally go for a number one all around and this works well.</li>
    <li> good. but no bigger brush included. and ear trimmer, which I will never use... just give us the main stuff and stop trying to be fancy without the essentials. and we don&#x27;t need color coding guards, the numbers on the guards is sufficient.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable deal! I&#x27;m not quite sure how they can make such a solidly built set of clippers for less than $20.</li>
    <li> very heavy and can be used for hand massaging too,has lots of clippers very confusing and very sharp and dangerous but ok for the cost</li>
    <li> very good product and very friendly seller</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  Great Price.  I wish I had purchased these sooner.  They are very sharp and easy to use on my husband and three sons.  Love the reference color guide on the clippers.  Makes it easy to find the correct size. My friend who is a hair dresser recommended this style and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Clippers work well on my hair and my beard.  the attachments are easy to attach and balde assembly seem ssturdy.</li>
    <li> Very good. I like it . I strongly recommend it. I use it to cut hair for my friends. Very convenient.</li>
    <li> I figured I would wait to review this product after it had been used it a couple of times but so far it is definitely worth the price. My husband has really thick hair that tends to put most clippers through the wringer. So far, we have gotten about four haircuts out of them and they still work really well. They essentially paid for themselves after one or two haircuts so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for awhile, and I&#x27;ve not paid for a hair cut since I bought the thing.  It works great, has ALL the accessories I could want (except for, perhaps, a hand mirror - pick one up to help with getting the back of your head), and it&#x27;s saved me a lot of money on hair cuts.</li>
    <li> -Solid build and somewhat heavy which usually means it comes with durable parts (at least for electric clippers in my experience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lots and lots of clipper attachments and they&#x27;re all color coded for easy sorting.  Also has clips for Left and Right Ear trimming. No more awkward time with the mirror when trimming hair near ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Strong motor: Cuts hair appropriately and doesn&#x27;t jam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for half price. Excellent deal.</li>
    <li> The thing I received works fine.  But the noise is too loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use it until the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay attention to the noise.</li>
    <li> At first it was hard to use on my dog. It tends to leave a uneven rake pattern but after a week of growth it is no longer noticeable. Snags on hair sometimes so I just clean it and oil it up. it doesn&#x27;t get the soft hair as well. Overall dog is getting used to it and the noise isn&#x27;t horrible. Its nice to have during the hot summer months. My dog is a maltese mix.</li>
    <li> We have had this for over a year.  The clippers still work like the first time I used them!</li>
    <li> Although the the clippers vibration is quite high and sounds a little annoying. I still gave this product five stars. It arrived in predicted time. Works well, and was priced great. I was a little worried that because of such the low price that the item would fail after a few uses and since i had never cut my own hair before i did not want to pay hundreds of dollars on super popular clippers. But I&#x27;m hear to say after months of constant use they are still running strong, still sharp, and work well i am so glad i bought this product and i will def get more by the manufacture.</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  I use it often.</li>
    <li> bought this for my son. It is very easy to use, good product. If you like to have short hair, it is a good one to buy.</li>
    <li> Saving lots of cash cutting my own hair.This Wahl clipper is what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> The haircutter works intermittently. As the electrical cord twists during use, the electricity to the mechanism shuts down and the haircutter stops. Some of the attachments don&#x27;t stay on. I should have this item replaced.</li>
    <li> My husband dropped the other haircutting clippers that we had &amp; we needed a similar replacement. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> very easy to use, does nice job, this is the second kit I bought. The first one bought at walmart and was not sharp enough after 3 years of use. however this kit seems to miss a cleaning piece</li>
    <li> Im an a experienced barber and i bought These cause i was out of town and had left my clippers at at my barber shop i bought them and they were making a loud buzzing sound and i adjusted the power on the side and same thing was still happening i took them back and same thing happened don&#x27;t buy these there a waist of money spend money on andis or oster</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m going bald I hate spending money on haircuts so I bought this to cut what hair I have left. Easy to use if you have plenty of mirrors or someone to cut it for you.</li>
    <li> Terrible! it is pulling hair more than cutting them. I had several hair clippers but this one is the worse ever! &amp;#34;The brand used by professionals&amp;#34;??? what... professional sheep shearers?</li>
    <li> This is by far the best clipper i have owned.  I have been cutting my hair for 15 yrs and wish i would have found this a long time ago</li>
    <li> Have had many other quality Wahl cutters. I would highly recommend paying a little more to get something that will actually cut hair. Was hoping to get a better quality product, but this unit just DOES NOT do the job. Even with no sizing guards on, this unit still struggles to cut. Could be a blade sharpness issue, but I would expect a new product out of the box to work way better than this crap. Had to go back to my older Wahl device to finish up my cut. Just pay a little more and get the quality you want.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used it twice and already it has paid for itself on money saved from the barber&#x27;s. Comes with instructions, so you (or your in-house amateur barber) can cut your hair and have it look decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, too, because now I can keep my hair trim and tidy. Usually I&#x27;d wait to get it cut to save money. Now I can get it cut every 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> great, I like it, complete haircutting kit is very great, i try it, it has good performance. i can easily get access to. the equipment was wonderful</li>
    <li> We previously had a peanut clipper and are pleased we move up and purchased the Wahl Color Pro.  Much more power and larger clipper area has cut down the time needed to give my hubby a haircut with better more even results.  There are several you-tube videos on how to use the clipper for the best results....worth watching.  At less than $20 for the kit, it has paid for itself in just 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year to cut down on the number of times I have to go to the barber.  These work and have held up well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these clippers twice now. The first time was 8 years ago. I took poor care of my first pair so I suspect the new ones will last much longer with more regular cleaning and oiling.&lt;br /&gt;I just use them with no guard so I can&#x27;t speak to the guards but I would recommend these clippers with no hesitations.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid - this haricutting kit was exceptional.  If I made my living cutting hair, I would probably want a heavy duty commercial quality cutter, but for me to use at home, its exceptional.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for when I have my winter beard. I wanted one with a cord as opposed to a rechargeable battery. It has a nice long cord. It comes with lots of different lengths for the clippers. I use it clean the beard up about once a month. It gets used every two weeks in early spring to keep the beard shorter. Works great and easy to clean up!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and a great price. Well made, sturdy. I only use it at its shortest setting so don&#x27;t know about the other features, but very glad I tossed my old one and replaced it with this one.</li>
    <li> I am a bit overwhelmed with all of the attachments, but the razor works great. I will probably figure out how to use it better as I work with it, but I haven&#x27;t mastered it yet. I wish there were pictures in the instructions of people&#x27;s hair using each attachment so that i could have a visual on how long or short the attachment would cut the hair. As I said, once I figure it out, it should be fine.</li>
    <li> the clippers themselves are really nice and definitely worth the investment, but forget the guide combs, the guide combs are flimsy and in my first order most of them we&#x27;re broken, thankfully amazons customer supports kicks butt</li>
    <li> Wahl Color Pro Complete Hair Cutting Kit is a good kit for amateurs.  I have been using these clippers to cut my own hair for over two months and I think I am doing a better job with them than most barbers I have paid in the past to cut my hair. These clippers are easy to use. The clipper guards are colored and just match the color to the clippers and it takes the guess work out of what size guard your using. so far are working like they should. I have saved $60.00 so far on cutting my own hair. They have already paid for themselves so I consider them a good investment.  Update 9/16/16 I have since upgraded to a better set off clippers but have saved several hundred dollars as I am still cutting my own hair and thus set helped me get started.</li>
    <li> I paid $28.99 at Rite aid. Damit! I am happy with the clippers though. I like the color coded attachments.</li>
    <li> Has many attachments for beard and hair trimming up to 2 inches. Would love to find attachments for longer hair</li>
    <li> These clipper work great, come with a lot of attachments, I recommend it. The price is the same as the ones I bought 20 years ago when I was stationed in Germany.</li>
    <li> I gave away my old razors, which didn&#x27;t work well, after using this unit the very first time.  Thin hair and irregular growth are a problem at seventy-four, and the adapters for hair length work beautifully evening things out every now and then.  Don&#x27;t like the scalped look that seems popular these days, which this haircutter will do that as well, but short hair is just fine.  Haven&#x27;t had a barber cut my hair since &#x27;65, and the cost of those cuts these days makes me cringe at the waste of resources ... but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I gave it five stars because it passed my every expectation. For what I paid for this, it&#x27;s worth every penny, and some. I would recommend this to anyone who likes doing their on hair.</li>
    <li> Used it on the poodle to groom her and get rid of Matt she had accumulated near her tummy. She did great. Wasn&#x27;t too loud and didn&#x27;t vibrate too much like others we have tried. It&#x27;s easy to clean and necessarily gentle on their skin.</li>
    <li> I had only seen one other review complaining of the noise but I could hardly hold this device.  It was horrifically noisy, I&#x27;m sure my neighbors could hear it and it vibrated so hard it felt like I was holding a jackhammer in my hand.  I hope I can return this without a problem.</li>
    <li> My old clippers we just worn out and having a hard time cutting my hair. These cut through my hair so much more easily. Plenty of combs for different lengths. It&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
    <li> We are happy with our wahl,the price and performance are great. My daughter borrows it for her sons hair.I googled the top highest rated clippers&lt;br /&gt;and the wahl was in there with a much better price. Thank you  from our family</li>
    <li> great set of clips for the price..good investment..does a great job</li>
    <li> sidenote: get someone else to shave the back of your head the first few times.....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wanna talk about it</li>
    <li> This clipper is well built, and works really well. It operates quietly without vibration.</li>
    <li> They are not very good compared to my Oster fast feed pair. They just do not cut as fast or as good. Spend the extra $ and but a better pair.</li>
    <li> I needed a new set of clippers to cut my and my sons hair. Great quality, not too loud,not to heavy, and cuts great. We both had thick hair and cut right through with no jams.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is nice, smooth and sleek and it is basically a beginners clippers for those who want to know about the different sizes and all. I normally use the clippers for my Lower Waist area and chest hair. I am a guy who loves to be clean and groomed properly so having too much hair makes me feel disgusting. Sor of like an OCD. One thing I can say is that it def great for sensative areas and will not cut your skin or anything of that nature. Absolutely phenominal.</li>
    <li> I am new to hair trimmers.  I had bought a cheap one a Walmart that barely worked at all.  This one was a huge step up.  I do have to stop frequently due to hairs getting stuck between the teeth blades.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this kit for the money.</li>
    <li> We found a good deal on this right around the time our old one died.  It had great reviews and was less than what it would cost to buy a lesser brand at Target.  Since my husband had to go elsewhere to finish getting his hair cut after the old one died part way through, we didn&#x27;t use this right away.  When we finally did, I was amazed at how quickly it buzzed all his hair.  I don&#x27;t know for sure if it worked better due to being a better quality razor or if it is the fact that it is new.  Either way, we love how quickly and easily it buzzes hair.  The color coded attachments are a nice feature/addition but not a selling point for us.  It does include two (left &amp; right) ear attachments that we&#x27;d never used before.  They are nice in concept or for getting started, but I found that I couldn&#x27;t get close enough to get all of the hairs around the ear that we wanted to trim, so had to finish with no attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in need of a good razor, I would highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Looks good and works good</li>
    <li> Very good quality, easy to use, lots of clip on attachments, I use a #5 on top and the right and left taper attachments on the sides, and a #2 for the back, and trim it ever two weeks, hair looks better than ever, should of done this years ago, its so easy.</li>
    <li> Horrible hair clipper. Very very noisy! I can&#x27;t use it at home my neighbors will call the police.  Vibrates like a perforator I can&#x27;t hold it in my hands. Very disappointed. And there were someone&#x27;s hair on this clipper. Very disappointed:(((((</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of poorly made compared to a older one I have. Cuts good but is a little harder to clean.</li>
    <li> Greatest clippers I bought....EVER...or at least in 2015.  So good, I even cut the neighbor kids hair.</li>
    <li> The price for this was hard to beat and the options for this one is unbelievable! Really good kit for price and works really good too. No disappointment here!</li>
    <li> best value ever, cut all the grandchildrens hair and in a few weeks time have recouped the purchase price many times over. The clippers do an excellent job</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer for the money. Comes with plenty of guards at different lengths. Seems very solid.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived on time! I love this thing and use it to cut my boyfriends hair and comes with everything you could possibly need! We are saving a lot of money and it works great.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers for the price.  We just use them for basic use and they seem to work out great.</li>
    <li> Works very good for price.</li>
    <li> The shortest guard is long for my taste but I&#x27;m used to cutting without a guard anyway</li>
    <li> I wore out my Wahl clippers after using them for 10 plus years, so I ordered this new set. This set is super awesome, and comes in a solid storage case and does a wonderful job. with my hair. Thanks to Wahl, I haven&#x27;t paid for a hair cut in a decade. This set is even more awesome due to the colored guide of clipper guard ratings.</li>
    <li> Broke after a year. I only used it about once a month to cut my hair, with my haircut being a #8 all over, so it basically broke after 12 easy uses</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair and she loves the new clippers.</li>
    <li> Does what it should, don&#x27;t use it on your face without guards.</li>
    <li> Cut through thick hair like cutting through melted butter. These are amazing clippers. I didn&#x27;t believe they would work so great since the price was so low, but I&#x27;m glad I read other reviews and gave them a shot. I&#x27;ve tried so many other clippers that were way more expensive and these definitely are my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Priced well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it oiled, clean, and make sure to keep it properly tightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw it out if the blade becomes misaligned. (Happened to me after 2 years of ownership).</li>
    <li> I got this to trim my beard because it looks like its smaller in the picture but it is for your head. I did trim my beard with it and it came out nice, very quick because its so wide but hard to get any details. I am very happy with it and even though I have been going to 1 barber my entire life you never know when you need to cut out something from your hair late at night or need to trim a friends hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to cut my own hair for 5 years!  Just think of all the savings as this costs the price of one haircut!  I&#x27;ve never had to sharpen the blades or anything.  I keep thinking it&#x27;s going to die since nothing this cheap should last this long.  But it keeps going and going like that battery bunny.  When and if this finally decides to die, I will definitely buy a new one.  Stop reading and just buy it already.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 10+ year old wahl clipper.  This clipper is as good as my old one, and includes more attachments.  The delivery very quick.</li>
    <li> These clippers are s***ty</li>
    <li> Does a good job.  I use it solely for buzzing my head.  My wife has become a pro!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised at the durability and quality of this product.  For the price, it&#x27;s a heavy and sturdy product.  I have no doubt that it will last me a long time if I take care of it!</li>
    <li> This is a great device, works as described, cuts well.  Color coded combs are really nice.  Well worth the bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely made, quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. No issues whatsoever and the number blades are very handy.</li>
    <li> These clippers work very well but they&#x27;re so loud, they&#x27;re almost unusable! The power and sturdiness speak to a high quality product, but you have to wear ear protection in order to use it. My husband has avoided and postponed his haircuts since we got these clippers, simply because he dreads the intrusive noise they make!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely caution against buying these, especially if you plan to use them on or near children. Wahl makes great quality products but needs to keep in mind the comfort and safety of the people using them. Maybe some of their other models are quieter, but this most certainly is not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 20+ years, and I&#x27;ve gone through a number of clippers over the years.  I bought these based on the large number of good Amazon reviews.  So far, I&#x27;m very impressed.  They work great for my hair and my beard, and seem to have plenty of power.  I haven&#x27;t run into any issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are probably better clippers out there - for a much higher price - but these are excellent, especially considering the price.  The attachments are made of very cheap, brittle plastic, but they work fine.  I wanted to keep the attachments from any older clipper set which seemed to be better made, but they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. I&#x27;d say, too powerful. Has a sound of a jet engine and mighty vibration.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all kinds of hair grooming. Professional quality. Great selection of trim lengths.</li>
    <li> It does do the job. Just too noisy.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this gift... Very good product,very good seller.. l recommended this.</li>
    <li> A sturdy shaver, does what it says.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, just what I expected.</li>
    <li> These clippers are well made in the USA.  The clipper works smoothly and quietly. The ergonomically designed body is comfortable to hold and the grip is secure.  The additional multiple cutting heads that come with this product are a real bonus.  Many other useful extras also come with these clippers.  This item replaces my original Wahl clipper that I had been using for over fifteen years.  Still works but getting noisy.  I believe I got my monies worth with Wahl and this is the reason I went with Wahl again.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is your entry level hair clippers.  Very good value.  Trimmer head needed some adjusting when i got it.</li>
    <li> BECAUSE OUR GRANDSON IS A COLLEGE WRESTLER HE KEEPS HIS HAIR CUT VERY SHORT.  WE GOT THESE CLIPPERS FOR HIM SO THAT HE CAN CUT HIS OWN HAIR AND PERHAPS CUT THE HAIR OF HIS TEAMMATES WHO LIKE THEIR HAIR CUT SHORT AS WELL.  WE RECOMMENT THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY.  WE HAVE A SET FOR OUR OWN USE FOR MY HUSBAND&#x27;S HAIRCUTS.  IT PAYS FOR ITSELF IN JUST A FEW CUTS AS WELL.</li>
    <li> It works well and has all the necessary attachments for a good haircut.  It would be helpful if it had more instruction as to how to cut hair. For the novice without the knack or the know-how it can be tricky!</li>
    <li> We have owned the Wahl clipper set for over 13 years and have used it weekly. It is dull but I like the way it operates so have been reluctant to replace it. When I discovered the cutting heads can be replaced I immediately ordered and set, installed then when they came, and love it. Cuts like a new clipper set!</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months so far and no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has not used one of these before, it is a little startling when it is first turned on (there is a loud click). But I have not been cut by this product, even when no guard is used. It has a range of guards ranging from 1 inch down to 3/16 of an inch (maybe it was 1/16 of an inch?). Anyway, I only have positive things to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not pull your hair, it cuts painlessly.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts evenly.&lt;br /&gt;It is manufactured in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;While it arrived with one broken piece, which Wahl quickly sent me a replacement free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;It saves me money when getting my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;It saves me time because I do not have to drive somewhere to wait in line to get a haircut.</li>
    <li> Extremely loud, after using for 1 minute it got very hot and started smoking.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible purchase that i will be returning</li>
    <li> These are good quality clippers and worth the money.  I wish I had spent the extra $10 and bought the set with the battery powered clippers included.  The only thing missing from this set is apron to wrap the neck.</li>
    <li> My husband shaves his head once a week and this works just as good as the expensive ones we&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Ok so I ordered this last night and got it delivered this afternoon!  I cut my hair with it, and WOW--It cuts better than any clipper I ever had.  I didn&#x27;t realize how easy it is to cut my own hair until I used this.  Other clippers make me do several passes and still doesn&#x27;t pick up everything.  These clippers are super.  Ok it&#x27;s not top of the line like the ones barbers use, but you can hardly tell the difference.  Where you can tell the difference is the price which is a steal since all the other lesser quality ones cost about the same or more.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve always been a weird dude who always holds off on haircuts just because I don&#x27;t like dealing with it. The problem is that my hair grows very quickly and I&#x27;ve grown to like it in a certain style. Enter this haircutting kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, probably much like you, was looking between this and other kits, and I ultimately went with this one due to the color coding. This was a great call. It allows me to very quickly find the attachment I was looking for and get a-snippin&#x27; in no time. I may have been a little overzealous the first time and ended up with a bit of a buzz cut, but sacrifices must be made in the name of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying the kit, I&#x27;ve probably given myself six haircuts or so (each much nicer than the last). It runs like a charm, and if you look at the cost versus a cheap haircut, it&#x27;s already paid for itself four times over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I&#x27;ve just come to find that it&#x27;s really entertaining to cut my hair, so there&#x27;s that. New hobby sort of!</li>
    <li> Our old one works as good as this new one.  Not special, but alright.  Heavy.  color coding good feature.  Good to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair in a breeze and easy clean up. Colored combs for thickness make it easy to tell. Great instructions inside!</li>
    <li> This was very good for the price.It is easy to cut your hair using this.They have provided clear instruction on how to cut your hair and what kind of comb to use. So far i did not find any issues with this</li>
    <li> First of all, this trimmer has a lot of power. It easily cuts through even the thickest hair. They give you twelve color coded guide combs in a variety of lengths, including ear trimmers. The rubber base makes it easy to use, as it shouldn&#x27;t slip out of your hand. It even includes two combs, styling scissors, blade guard, a cleaning brush, blade oil and a convenient case. The high carbon steel blades should stay sharp for a good while. This is perfect for shaving my beard and trimming my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair-cutting kit really works well.It is durably made with quality products. Easy guide color clips for a smooth haircut!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to cut his own hair. He shaves his head for ROTC and this was perfect for keeping him in uniform. Great quality, quick delivery, and great price. Great for anyone wanting to cut hair at home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 20 years and this by far has been the best clippers. For the price this is the best, has all the accessories you need.</li>
    <li> It works easily and was the best acquisition I made. I can even cut my hair by myself because it so easy.</li>
    <li> It has runs down and does not get bogged down during cutting of hair.  The attachments are excellent.  The directions are very easy to follow.</li>
    <li> Quality product and easy to use. Very worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> First clippers ive bought and for the price its amazing. I use it to cut the sides of my hair. I get the top cut at the barbers but my sides usually grow a lot faster so its good for trims vs going to the barber every few weeks</li>
    <li> This trimmer replaced one I had for over 10 yrs and I am satisfied with it so far but I feel like it&#x27;s more noisy and vibrates more than my previous one.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  I am glad I found this online. I like the instruction booklet it came with.  I like the various colors do attachments.  It works very well for cutting hair.  I cut my sons and husbands hair.</li>
    <li> This kit is exactly what I was looking for.  Price is great too.  The price is about what one haircut cost me,  so now I&#x27;ve saved almost 5 haircuts.  The case is fairly sturdy and fine for storage on a shelf, but nothing is secured inside so I would caution against rough handling.  The clippers are quiet and do a really good job.  Some reviews mention Wahl clippers getting hot.  These do not get hot, maybe a very slight warming by the end of the cut, but nothing I wouldn&#x27;t expect from running them.  Only 4 stars because they include just about every guard size - except the most popular 1.5.  Overall, very happy with this kit and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes these. Glad we bought them.</li>
    <li> Bought this after the battery on my previous hair clippers stopped working (even when plugged in). I really need a good pair of clippers since I love keeping my hair buzzed. That and a hair cut at my local barber is $15 a visit anyway. Fortunately, these clippers worked awesome! Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed whatsoever in how easy it was to cut my hair with this. Definitely was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair fast and precise. Willbsave you a lot on your grandkids cuts.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Wahl Color Pro and all of it&#x27;s pieces. Runs quietly and great so far. Cuts perfect. Carrying case fell apart less than a week after I got it, but no big deal. I was able to use an older case that I still had. I&#x27;m able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair in just a few minutes and save loads of money. Hoping it will last a long while.</li>
    <li> 17 bucks.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  My previous one lasted 17 years.  The guides are a little flimsy.  Especially the smaller ones that have less material.</li>
    <li> Gave myself an awesome wiffle.</li>
    <li> Really nice, a little heavier than my last Wahl clipper but it handles well and is comfortable in my hand. I think it is just more heavy duty than my last one. I have always used the Wahl clippers and have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers - it has already paid for itself. Wish the storage box had a better way to store attachments.</li>
    <li> Good quality, easy to use and priced right!!</li>
    <li> good buy!! have it for over a year and still works fine</li>
    <li> Awesome price, great buy. Would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> My boyfriend just loves this product. Does a great job on clipping his hair.Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Mom of three boys. Very professional quality and money saver in between taking them to a barber.</li>
    <li> Finally had to replace my 25+ year old Wahl clippers and these are wonderful.  I worried that they might not be made as well but they are!!  Fit nicely in the hand and cut beautifully.  MADE IN AMERICA - the main reason, other than being a Wahl, that I purchased them.  I fully expect them to last just as long as my first pair.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my boyfriend, definitely powerful clippers with pretty much all you need for do it yourself</li>
    <li> This product makes it very easy to do at home &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; looking cuts.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for 3 1/2 years, just long enough for me to forget how to cut my husband&#x27;s hair with scissors!  Today it stopped working (motor cuts in and out). Too much trouble for me to send it back and my husband, who is home bound, needs his hair cut right away.  Can&#x27;t wait for it to go back and forth.  Too bad.  It was a lot easier than cutting with scissors.</li>
    <li> Order # 114-9965720-5716207&lt;br /&gt;totally disappointing . above is my order # and i was lat month  and now the blades are rusted. I just used it once and didnt wash it in water. Used a couple of days before and cleaned it with a  clean tissue and now i see that the blades are rusted.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! You can&#x27;t beat this deal. I adjusted a little and its smoother.</li>
    <li> No more charging needed.</li>
    <li> The trimmer for price is really good.Height attachments are flexible if a bit cheap.The comb and scissor are a joke but if you supplemnt those and it&#x27;s not ued comercially you be pleased.</li>
    <li> GREAT, CLEAN AND SNAPS ON WELL</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a beard trimmer and, although it works well for this purpose, it&#x27;s a little heavy and bulky. It cuts hair cleanly without pulling (a common complaint for trimmers in the price range).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great value, quality construction, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Heavy, too bulky for detail work (e.g. trimming a moustache)</li>
    <li> works well, use it for my hubbys hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this clipper set! I bought it to replace a set I have been using for years and I&#x27;m so happy with it. Very easy to use/figure out if you have never used clippers before. Everything fits very nicely in the carrying case so pieces don&#x27;t need to be stored separately. Good quality and great price. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> After giving my husband haircuts for the past 28yrs, I decided to buy one of these. It&#x27;s so easy to use! I was a bit scared the first time I used it, but the instructions for all of the attachments are easy to follow &amp; both of us were very pleased with the results. Threw out the scissors and will use this all of the time! Love it!</li>
    <li> Cannot beat for the price!  Cut my husband&#x27;s hair and my son&#x27;s hair.  Colors makes it easier to remember I&#x27;m sure, but I often refer to the number, lol.  Great clipper!</li>
    <li> This came quickly enough but the trimmer did not work at all when I plugged it in and flipped the switch. So I emailed the one I purchased it from and he promptly sent me another which worked as it should. Good service and the product is good when it works (used it once so far) is all I can say.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item new from Amazon. Before using it, I checked the calibration of the blades according to the manual, and ensured it was ready for use. For the first 10 minutes of use it worked great and made a nice clean shave. I really liked the selection of blade guards and comfort of the clippers in my hand. I turned off the clippers to swap the guard to something smaller and when I turned it on again the clippers began making an incredibly loud vibration noise and would continue doing so until pressure was applied to the plastic body or it was bumped gently with the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept using them but the sound would return after turning it off or if bumped. My room mate heard it from across the house and was spooked by it. Clearly something was wrong so I returned them.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair cutting kit. We have used Wahl for years and they last forever. I actually got this one as a Christmas present. It&#x27;s all nicely color coded and everything.</li>
    <li> The Shit Keeps On Cutting Me Up &amp; It&#x27;s Too Loud</li>
    <li> This product has a great quality blade, and therefore gives a brilliant cut. Has every necessary fitting and has a very ergonomic design.</li>
    <li> unit died after two uses!  are you serious!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT...</li>
    <li> Great!  Easy to use and does a fantastic job.</li>
    <li> My son is happy with this clipper set.  It has made cutting his own hair a lot easier.  I have no clue how he does it but he does.  He did say he wish there was a larger size guide available.</li>
    <li> I shave my head weekly and this is a great clipper. It has worked really well for a few months and comes with plenty of different sized guards.</li>
    <li> Item as described.  I received them very quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased these clippers last year and it&#x27;s still running strong. The precision and comfort these clippers deliver are a must for anyone.</li>
    <li> The clipper makes noise, I believe that the good ones or professional (wahl red color clips) cost more so this definitely a home clip not for a pro usages...2 ☆ for the price.</li>
    <li> This has waaaaaayyy made up for its price so far.. I have a buzz cut every 2 weeks and it has performed flawlessly for the past few months... It comes with a great carry case and color coded attachments.. I personally dont use more than just one but I know if I ever had to use them they&#x27;d perform just as well.. Great price.. Great product..</li>
    <li> I am a professional hair stylist and was in need of cheap clippers in a hurry. These are a little heavy and a little loud but for the price these work great. They get a lot of use and have held up well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Super easy to use and feels very sturdy/ solid. The kit has everything you need (except for maybe I love that all the guards are color coded. My boyfriend loved his first hair cut. We should have bought one a long time ago. His hair grows really fast so we are anticipating significant savings. Make sure all the hair is going in the same direction (wet &amp; comb it thoroughly) so the lengths are all the same when being cut.</li>
    <li> This is a powerfull hairclipper and it comes with suitable accessories. Overall, it is cheap, powerfull but very very noisy.</li>
    <li> This is a great buzzer so far for it&#x27;s price I definitely reccomend it to anyone looking to cut their own hair at home.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent value and fine quality</li>
    <li> This is my first set, but I&#x27;m amazed by the quality, especially given the low price. I bought it to try my hand at cutting my own hair, and it came with an instruction manual that I&#x27;ve been using along with some tips online.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this to try to cut my own hair, but to keep my beard and &#x27;stache trimmed up. It works perfectly for that job</li>
    <li> Not too sure if I like this unit. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it cuts as close to my head as my old unit. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and cut my hair a few times, each time with different settings and still same result. Not the best unit i&#x27;ve used for shaving my head, but it&#x27;s worth the price for sure. Easy to use, color coding for each number length is nice as well. Unit&#x27;s heavy. Good for price .</li>
    <li> Very good. Not to heavy to handle. More than enough &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; the tools and accessories do the job as a pro will need.</li>
    <li> I got these for cutting my son&#x27;s hair since he won&#x27;t let anyone else cut it. He was excited to have his own clippers. The color coding on the guards is very helpful, but they are also labeled with numbers if that is more your speed. I have had them for 3 hair cuts now and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price and cut</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my old Wahl (fell off the counter top - broke the blades) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Love the color coded attachments and the included snippers/blade oil. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> very nice, the sound is pretty low but you can still feel how much power this thing has, and the rubber grip is great. the color coded guide makes it very easy. I got this to try to learn how to cut my own hair for the first time, I messed up trimming and stuff, left a bald spot so ended up buzzing it to 1 inch. I originally ordered it just to trim my beard but decided to give hair cutting a go lol. It leaves the perfect amount of trim on my beard for my liking and doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs at all, very smooth. it also has a very handy adjustable handle on the side so you can get it down to the perfect size you want by spreading out the blades slightly. awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months. It works well. One of the guides, however, was missing. The booklet mentioned a size that wasn&#x27;t among the plastic guides. I don&#x27;t particularly care because I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve used it (whichever size is under a #2). I left the smaller blade in alcohol for too long after a disassemble-clean and it rusted along the teeth. So don&#x27;t do that. Otherwise, the thing gets the job done just fine. I recommend it to any guy (or lady with a super low maintenance haircut) who wants to save $10-20 a month and has a spouse or a mirror/camera setup that allows for back-of-the-head touch ups.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair and we both love it. It has a much nicer cut that his old clipper and doesn&#x27;t get snagged on long or thick hairs.  It makes an intense POP when you turn it on, but I think that&#x27;s because it has a heavy duty motor in there.  There are so many accessories, and they are all color-coded! Great for guys for beard trimming or for cutting men&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my kids. But I could only use it on them if I wanted to give them industrial deafness. Otherwise, the kit looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this Haircutting kit ,easy to use ( I watch vdo how to use in Youtube) . I give my husband hair cut for a first time .It so easy to use . My husband love it and we save a lot money for hair cut now.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for a while now and I have got to say these clippers are awesome. Clippers in this price range tend to snag and pull hair, not these babies. Never pulled any of my hair and these things got some power. Very well built and comes with a 5 year warranty. Also I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about saying the clippers are very loud. They are actually very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to save a bunch of money and clip your hair at home this is the set to get!</li>
    <li> Great product and a very well built blade. Being a bearded man, and thick hair at that, I hate the few days after shaving with a razor so a clipper is best for me. I got this after my last cordless one died after 2 years, the one before that only a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel is solid and strong, and for trimming my beard it&#x27;s perfect. No bogging, no pulling just a clean even trim. Now on my head... The size guide is a little off it seemed, and it cuts shorter. Maybe just my hair but it made for an adventure the first time cutting, then trying to fade in the lines. Watching the youtube videos is highly suggested!</li>
    <li> I made a hair style for my boyfriend last month with this clipper, and this is the most favorable style for him. We are all like it very much.</li>
    <li> Its a heavy duty pair of clippers! My boyfriend loves it; for his head, face, and neck. I was super please to see it came with combs, scissors, and ESPECIALLY left and right ear pieces so you can have a super clean cut from yourself!</li>
    <li> With most things, I don&#x27;t expect something with a cheap price to work too well, however, these hair clippers are fantastic!!! Extremely easy guides, easy to keep clean, and it is powerful!!! Not to mention, shipping was fast!!!</li>
    <li> We’ve bought multiple clippers from local department stores and paid twice as much for them an in the end, they cut half as well as the Wahl Color Pro’s.  We’ve used these several times now and couldn’t be happier with how they cut and we really like the color differences for the sizes.  It makes finding your size much easier.  I didn’t find them any noisier than any of the other clippers we’ve used and they had plenty of power to cut through thick hair.</li>
    <li> Just finished cutting both my son and my husbands hair and it was so easy to use. Even my son who really does not like getting his hair cut didn&#x27;t mind it. It was not loud at all and that was great for him. I usually pay $26 for both their haircuts plus a $4 tip. This product already paid for it self and gave me a $8 and some change return. Every time I cut their hair from now on we are going to put $30 in our Disney fund for our next trip. This product is great for beginners and is very easy to use and the instruction manual is very helpful. I would totally recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money!!!!!</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit makes it so easy to cut your boys or husbands hair. The colored attachments help to easily identify the different lengths. The end result is a good looking haircut right at home! Also works good for beard trimming! It comes in a plastic case. This is one product that will definitely save you money!</li>
    <li> Just used this to cut my Boyfriend&#x27;s hair last night and first impressions are good. This trimmer is very heavy duty, not cheap feeling when you hold it in your hand. My only small complaint is that it does tend to get very hot just after 1 hair cut, but for the price, it&#x27;s more than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Feels and looks solid. Bought this because of my head and neck skin cancer. Hate to ask a barber to put up with the growths.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the job done on front and sides but did not attempt the complete back of head. All parts were included and are well marked and colored. Solid easy snap on parts that fit well. No batteries to replace just plug it into the A.C outlet..</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my dad and he loved it. Much better than the scissors he use to use to have crazy haircuts!!</li>
    <li> Was so eager to try this base on its great reviews after my Professional Wahl I had for 9yrs got uncomfortable for my son....I always cut my son&#x27;s hair; always use Wahl products.....this clipper couldn&#x27;t even cut butter of my son had...i had to literally dig i to get it to cut...finally after abusing my 5yr old for 20 minutes I got him dress and made a trip to the barber which i hate doing....sanitation reasons.....</li>
    <li> Good cut, has lasted much longer than a comparably priced Conair. One trimmer guide is slightly bent, and unfortunately it&#x27;s the number two, but it&#x27;s a minor issue fixed by careful cutting. All the pieces were otherwise in great condition and the trimmer was already calibrated. Love the color coding of all the accessories. Would have liked to see a bigger box to store it in so I don&#x27;t have to replace it so closely as well as a longer cord for those of us who have outlets in any reasonable place on a wall.</li>
    <li> A cousin in Cuba asked (begged) for this Wahl by name.  His second one in five years.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be for Pets but the package says for men</li>
    <li> The color coding made this super simple for my toddler to pick out the right size for his hair cuts at home!</li>
    <li> Use this on my son&#x27;s hair. It was my first time using clippers and so far so good. They were really loud at first but just needed adjusted. This comes with a ton of different attachments as well as a scissors. Great value! Got money&#x27;s worth out of just three haircuts vs. salon prices. People usually can&#x27;t believe I cut his hair myself.</li>
    <li> This replaced a 13 year old Wahl that had given up the ghost.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t cut as well as hoped.  It seems to pull hair no matter what the motion speed or angle.  The color coding is nice.</li>
    <li> These work as advertised and have lots of attachments. Worth the money, IMHO.</li>
    <li> The razor that arrived had clearly been used before. Although the packaging appeared unopened, everything inside was covered in fingerprints and food crumbs. This didn&#x27;t bother me as much as the hair stuck in the blades and scissors though, or the fact that the razor handle was scratched and the scissors had been dented. Everything still works fine, but I expected a NEW razor (as it was labeled) and I obviously did not get what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I have used it 5 times. Worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for while now, he says it cuts perfect.  Clean easy cuts, with sharp blades.  The product works great and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that it is insanely cheaper to cut my own hair on a weekly basis than pay for it. That&#x27;s the draw we all have in looking at a product like this. Saving money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with color coded sizes - which for me are entirely useless as I only use #1 and #2 - anyone want the other sizes?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main problem is durability. I use the oil and dry these off after every use, and yet the blade is still covered in rust. Once the clippers slid out my hand to the sink which knocked out 3 of the teeth on the blades, which makes it cut unevenly. And every other use the thing makes a horrible screeching noise until you adjust it for 5 minutes to calm it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t plan on using this for more than 4 minutes. After that, the blade is so hot it will burn your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is: I was taking it apart because I couldn&#x27;t figure out why this thing was screeching at me and one of the tiny screws bounced into the drain of my sink. So that&#x27;s always awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: buy this if you&#x27;re desperately low on money, want the cheapest, least durable clippers on the market and like the smell and pain from hot metal on skin.</li>
    <li> I started cutting my own hair so Ive been experimenting with different  clippers. I bought these clippers because i heard that wahl makes good clippers but compared to other clippers ive used i was very unimpressed. When I tried shaving my head my hair ended up very uneven. I tried using them a few more times but the result was the same every time. i threw these away and went back to using my remmington clippers. if you want cheap clippers Id recommend those</li>
    <li> Powerful and easy to use.  The clippers have a good fell in the hand.  Excellent device, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Looking to save some money I have been wanting to cut my boys&#x27; hair myself. It costs $12 plus tip per cut at the barber, even for my 4 year old! I read all the reviews and decided to go for this model. The more expensive cutters got identical reviews so I went with this one which was under $20. I have done 2 haircuts so far, the cutter has paid for itself. Very easy to use, dosen&#x27;t snag through hair and comes out even and neat. I am pretty impressed with myself and this product. My husband is even considering letting me cut his hair-that&#x27;s how good he thought the kids looked! I also watched some videos online which were a nice help.</li>
    <li> Much better than the Remington that it replaced. The cutter is quiet and cuts cleanly. Wahl is a great product line.</li>
    <li> I cut hair for homeless people and for the price/results i get this is worth eveyr single penny so gogo gog ogo go!</li>
    <li> Its been a month since ive been using it. Functionality wise, its been working quite fine for the short period of time ive had it; even though the build quality looks and feels a little cheap which is understandable given the price tag. For instance some of the plastic parts are not very well fit together , etc. But it functions quite alright. Very powerful too. I have thick hair, and the other cheap one I had just couldnt handle it. But the motor on this one is quite powerful and handles the hair no problem.&lt;br /&gt;If it broke down or anything, I&#x27;ll update the review.</li>
    <li> Package showed up with several pieces broken. Two combs and two of the plastic trimmer attachments came broken and I don&#x27;t expect the rest of it to last very long. Buy something good instead. His was a waste of money. If the trimmers aren&#x27;t even strong enough to handle shipping then how long will they really last. They also feel very cheap. Bottom line is the attachments are just too cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Our hair clippers finally bit the dust. I cut my husbands&#x27; hair every other week and needed a replacement. I love these! They are quiet and powerful. The only negative thing I could say about them is they make my hand tingle from the vibration. But that&#x27;s not a bad thing, right? :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price paid! Honestly, this thing does a lot of hair trimming. Easy to clean. A bit awkward to keep changing Left and Right sides, but, hey, if you get the right results, and you did not empty your bank account when you bought this hair-cutting device, then you are a winner!&lt;br /&gt;My next purchase will be a Wireless one.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! This is my second pair of Whal clippers. Can&#x27;t live without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Good product - solid, seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised! Great.</li>
    <li> Very well constructed and made in the USA. Great selection of guide combs.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying close attention when I ordered this item, so I was surprised when it arrived that the \\&quot;cleaning brush\\&quot; included was so tiny. It&#x27;s about 10 times smaller than the cleaning brush that was included with my last Wahl set.  It&#x27;s really more of a crevice tool, and it is virtually useless.  Luckily, I hadn&#x27;t gotten rod of my old set yet, so I just kept the old brush. It makes cleaning after a cut so much easier when you have a good brush with very long bristles that can clean inside, between the blades.  My other complaint is the numbering system.  They&#x27;ve color-coded this system by size, so they&#x27;ve sort of just given up on actually making the numbers on the actual plastic guards uniform or readable.  Some of the numbers appear on one side, and some appear on the other.  The ones that appear on the back side are tiny and difficult to read.  You can see two examples in the photos I&#x27;ve uploaded above.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Air Force and keeping my hair within regulations gets expensive.  I wanted to try doing it myself, but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much just in case I was horrible at it.    PROS:  Fairly strong motor  Easily adjustable blades  Various guards  Wahl product support    CONS:  Plastic guards are kind of brittle (be careful when attaching)  Varying sizes of the taper guards would be nice    Overall these are great for home use.  For replacement parts go to [...] their prices better than other places and if you use \\&quot;wahl10\\&quot; at checkout you&#x27;ll save 10%</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]]  I am disappointed because in this purchase the comb number 6 (19mm) 3/4, Lavender color, is broken of factory, and it is unfair... too disappointed, please help me with this comb.  Fernando A. Fernandez Cohen</li>
    <li> After a couple months, it&#x27;s been a nice set of clippers.  It&#x27;s very heavy-duty, making a huge thud when you turn it on like I remember from the clippers at the hair stylist.  No problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I trimmed my husband&#x27;s hair, kinda took me an hour to finish but overall, it looks good for a first time user!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replaced a set of hair clippers I had bought at Marshalls or TJ Max for around the same price as this one is available for.  When I bought those I was in desperate need of something but my previous set had broken and they were a cheap noisy piece of junk.  These are far better, work well to cut the hair, the color coded guides were a brilliant idea and make it easy to find the one you&#x27;re looking for, and they give a good clean haircut.  My only complaint is that I still find these to be a little loud, not as bad as my previous clippers but not as quiet as I was expecting based on the reviews here.  Other than that they&#x27;re great and I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive haircutting kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this more my husband for Christmas and he loved it! Not cheaply made, cut nicely, pieces fit perfectly and my husband was very pleased! He has very thick hair and this shaver gave him no problems! He thought I spent way more on it than I did ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this Haircutting kit a few months ago and I absolutely love it.  There are plenty of attachments to cut my hair to whatever length I want.  The clipper doesn&#x27;t heat up and burn my ears like I&#x27;ve had happen at places like great cuts. I think the worst part of cutting my own hair is cleaning up afterwards, but that is obviously not the fault of this product.</li>
    <li> Way superior to previos trimmers I have owned.  And at this price?!?!  This thing is a no brainer, buy it.  with confidence.  The case is cheap and sucks, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re buying here, the trimmer is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Perfect for home use. I&#x27;ve been using mine for two years without a problem.</li>
    <li> Cheap and effective if you&#x27;re looking to trim your hair before using a safety razor or looking to shave your head down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never seems to give me an even cut otherwise. To it&#x27;s merit though, it&#x27;s a cheap pair of shears and it does technically cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Everything you&#x27;ve ever wanted from a simple haircutting kit. Construction is robust and it cuts very well. Seems like it will last a long time. The color coded attachments are a plus as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this quite a few months ago... still running great. I&#x27;ve given myself a few haircuts with this so far and it&#x27;s been incredibly easy, very efficient... comes with all the guard sizes you&#x27;ll need. It&#x27;s paid for itself for me already.</li>
    <li> all the boys in my house love this.  I like the color coded mesaurements on the unit.  Decent price.</li>
    <li> Great value! I&#x27;ve used it several times and have been impressed so far.</li>
    <li> This is a solid piece of equipment that I would never be without. I use it on my dog and myself. Love it! Saves a lot of money for in between trims. I had another one that lasted for years (I cut 3 boys hair for about 18 years) but the case was an unbelievable tight fit. This case is nice and roomy and you don&#x27;t have to be an engineer to get it closed back up with everything inside.</li>
    <li> easy to use and learn</li>
    <li> It works great! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent item, and much cheaper than I would have expected! I love the color-coded combs, that added a nice touch to a product that was already a good buy. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great for cutting my own hair.  Yeah, I&#x27;m an adult (male) and cut my own hair.  (cesar/clooney cut) Piece of cake, until you get to the back and around the ears.  Dual mirrors don&#x27;t help because directions and angles are inverted.  My first time did not turn out well . . . .scorn and laughter from my GF and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 month later, I just did my second cut and this time I employed an intricate system where I sit in front of my sink, facing away from the sink, and position my iPhone behind me facing the back of my head, and my iPad in front of me on a small patio end table, and connect the two devices via Facetime so I can see the back of my head in the iPad and directions and angles are true (not inverted as they are in mirrors) . . . . more laughter from GF and friends about my intricate tech usage, but praise for the back hairline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. No more $50 haircuts.  Though I do miss the head massage &amp; shampoo from the girls.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use it. I enjoy using it to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> Really powerfull really good!</li>
    <li> vibra mucho, descalibrado</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly; works great.</li>
    <li> Saves a lot of money on haircuts.</li>
    <li> First time cutting hair was made so easy with these clippers. All the tools were there and it even came with instructions on how to give a good crew cut! The device does get a little hot but that&#x27;s to be expected if you are doing a slow and steady first attempt of cutting hair. Don&#x27;t forget to oil the device!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, buy a handheld mirror so you can cut the back of your hair more accurately.</li>
    <li> Great Deal! Love the color coded guards, and additional pieces that come with it. We have used them twice already and I am really getting the process down to an art. It makes it very simple for the non-professional stylist, for me . . . a &amp;#34;Mom&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> IT IS GREAT, I like it. The first time I used it, I made myself become a  bareheaded. Of course, I am home for two weeks until the hair grow longer.</li>
    <li> Broke after 4-5 uses. Doesn&#x27;t cut the hair, only vibrates. Unfortunately the internal plastic mechanism that makes the blade move does skips over the blade. To me it looks like a poor design.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to replace a 10 year old Wahl. Considering that a decent haircut costs about $15 these days, this is a deal. I cut my son&#x27;s hair with it in about 15 minutes when he sits still. The color coded guards are nice, the motor is very powerful and it has a nice color manual as well. The price is great for the performance. As soon as you start on the second haircut, it pretty much pays for itself.</li>
    <li> For the price, this little trimmer can&#x27;t be beat. I trim my beard and shave my dog with it. It comes with a ton of attachments I haven&#x27;t gotten around to using (still chicken to cut my own hair). I picked up a bottle of the blade oil, and it fits in the case with everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing paid for itself the week it arrived. Great Clips charges $5 for a beard trim and my local dog groomers charge at least $40 for appointments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the past 8 years and Wahl is the only reliable company for me. These blades aren&#x27;t loud or too rough when I cut my hair. The only complaints are the container and the scissors. The container is very small, so it&#x27;s like fitting a puzzle together every time I finish cutting my hair. Also, the scissors aren&#x27;t super sharp like the ones used in barbershops. It sometimes sticks when I cut my hair and I have to be deliberate as to not mess up when I use them.</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimmer, haircutter.. I had it for 3 months now and its still working great</li>
    <li> When oiled it pulled and snags your hair. The quality of the blade is very low.</li>
    <li> Already saved 100+ $ by doing self cutting</li>
    <li> Piece of junk!!!! After 2 uses unbearable noise and vibration!!!! Unable to fix it was a gift used overseas (used  a voltage converter) I&#x27;m highly technical guyI can fix almost every thing can&#x27;t send it back went to the trash. Not recommended!!!!</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Cheap case.</li>
    <li> great item only thing i fine weird is when i switch it on it makes a cluck noise....but it works fine</li>
    <li> Love this!  What a great value for a great product.  I&#x27;m trilled with this!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought in the last 6 months.  That&#x27;s not because it was bad and fell apart but because people see mine and want their own!  So, let&#x27;s start with the premise that it&#x27;s excellent and hit the bad points.  First of all, the instructions are a little lacking.  Right now I can&#x27;t recall what it was that I wanted them to have, but it wasn&#x27;t there.  Secondly, on the second machine I bought, the blade guard arrived broken.  I was due to fly the next morning; so I just slapped the smallest cutter on the blades and transported it that way.  I&#x27;m sure that if I had had some time Wahl or Amazon or whoever could have sent me a replacement part, but I didn&#x27;t have any time.  At any rate, yet another person has mentioned how much he wants one; so I guess I&#x27;ll be buying a third one in the next 6 months.  (Update: I&#x27;ve bought 3 more as my handsomer half&#x27;s workmates all want them.  I need to buy 2 more still.  Yes, a total of 7 in one year.)</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. LOVE THEM.</li>
    <li> Over six months now and still works. It is not as load and comes with alot of trim sets.</li>
    <li> Very bad product I bought one and it is too noisy and when you try to screw down the power to reduce the noise it won&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
    <li> does what it is supposed to  and does it really well, love colored attachments</li>
    <li> well  it feels good on the head and doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise  -- seems to be a very good product for the price</li>
    <li> RETIRADO Y CONFORME GRACIAS</li>
    <li> So far it has worked well on my husband&#x27;s thick course hair.  I love the color coding system with the appropriate clips for cutting lengths, very user friendly.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my military husband&#x27;s hair for nearly 3 decades. It was time to retire my current clippers and buy another pair. This Wahl is heavier (minus 1 star) than my old pair, which will take some getting used to, but I love that the guide combs are different colors! Trying to read the numbers on the guides gets harder as I get older and the different colors will eliminate that difficulty. Another thing that I really like about these clippers is that it comes with a 1/2 guide comb, making the military haircut a lot easier at the back and sides.</li>
    <li> Very solid product! I would recommend this to other people.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, comes with a complete set of accessories, this is the cheapest hair trimmer I found and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. No more $20.00 haircuts. Fast shipping great seller</li>
    <li> Awesome, works great.  Saves a lot of money, rather then going to to hair cutters all of the time :)</li>
    <li> Bought on sale, this was the best deal ever. My husband learned to cut his own hair in a 1/8th inch buzz-cut. He puts a Dollar Store $1 Plastic Shower Curtain over his head (cuts a hole in the middle to put over head) to keep the hair from going into the sink, then discards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have saved $10.99 plus tax, plus $3 Tip every 3 weeks, it has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a guy who gets a simple buzzcut, spend 20 bucks on this bad boy and never pay for/waste time on a haircut ever again.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this is the ability to use a guide that cuts hair 1-inch. The guides snap on, have numbers and are color coded. Makes the same sound as the barbers clippers, not overly loud. Forget the plastic case. Bought an inexpensive see through zipper case at a local store to replace the plastic case.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good... The #2 guard is way too short to blend into a #3 with. If you want a 90&#x27;s hip-hop haircut, that&#x27;s cool, but I have a tough time blending my kids hair with the eneven guards. Had to use guards off of other hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for this issue...</li>
    <li> Excellent  100 % positive</li>
    <li> This is a great hair cutting kit.  Just got tired of paying so much for a &amp;#34;crew cut&amp;#34; I now just cut my own hair with a #2 all around! The clippers paid for itself the first month. These clippers work very well and are an excellent choice for the price.</li>
    <li> comfortable, only a little heavy.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this. when they say pro there not kidding. I recommend this . its great. well worth the money</li>
    <li> Works great, ergonomic handle is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Very nice, I have very thick hair, and these went thru it without issues.  very nice, even cutting.  Definitely recommend, for the price.  More than enough attachments.  Extremely pleased with product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical given the cheap price of the product. However, after 3 uses I am convinced of its quality, not to mention value since it has already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> Being what is commonly called bald, I keep my hair short and like to trim it frequently.  Obviously, I will never use most of the attachments, but of those I do use, all are very good.  Everything stores in a nice case.  Previous Norelco units I&#x27;ve had, which cost more, have been very cheesy in comparison - the attachments broke with regular use and the blades seemed to dull almost immediately.  This is vastly superior.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper! It works better than the fancy expensive clipper from vidal sasson.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and not too loud.</li>
    <li> Horrible. The clippers pulled hair and didn&#x27;t work right out of the box. Very frustrating. If you purchase this product, open and try right away so you&#x27;re within your window to return it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great and saving money :)</li>
    <li> This set does a great job on a self hair cut.</li>
    <li> Finally got around to using this. It&#x27;s a solid product that&#x27;s going to save me a boatload of money in haircuts.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my son so he wouldn&#x27;t have to use mine. It&#x27;s a nice compact package that comes with everything you need. The colors are vibrant and mostly unnecessary since the thickness and number is printed on the pieces. My son just needs to remember &amp;#34;the blue one&amp;#34;, which works great for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much quieter than my old Wahl and it cuts faster with less pulling. I might actually order a second one for myself.</li>
    <li> Very good clipper / worth the price and I would buy the same thing again in future.  Thanks for affortable price</li>
    <li> This is the complete set, perfect for learning and trying out new things with it. I am impressed by this and would gladly recommend you buying more than one unit.</li>
    <li> Works great, does the job and its cheap.</li>
    <li> This is exactly how it was described in the ad.  Seems to be of decent quality and looks like it will last.</li>
    <li> Very happy with these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful enough to get through my beard, attachments are handy, cleaning is easy, price is good.</li>
    <li> This has saved us hundreds in haircuts.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older guy who is follicularly challenged.  I changed from my lifelong boy&#x27;s regular haircut to a shorter cut done by clippers and a #4 blade about 6 months ago.  I got tired of paying my barber $18 for a 10 minute hair cut.  All she did was use clippers like these with a guide blade, then trim around my years without the blade. I figured my wife or one of my sons could do the same for me for free, so I ordered these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of one hair cut, I was able to buy this entire 20 piece set.  It has more guide blades than I would ever use.  I&#x27;m good with either the #3 or the #4 blade.  I&#x27;ll cut my hair every 2-3 weeks, keep it neat and trim, and save myself the time and money of the barber shop.  $18 per haircut times 12 haircuts per year ends up saving me over $200 on hair cuts.  I&#x27;m good with that.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the color coded idea</li>
    <li> all I need to cut my own hair. I could buy a new one every month and still save money from dodging haircut costs, but it seems sturdy enough to last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I cut my my own and occasionally vist a barber from time to time (whenever i needed a \\&quot;Real haircut\\&quot;) but with these clippers cutting my own is SOO easy and simple i LOVE these clippers! They cut real close, No pull or snag, &amp; they dont leave a scar if you dont wear the guard.They feel like professional clippers and cut way better than my previous andis speedpro&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these %100!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to go to a barber every month to have my hair trimmed up, and at $20 a visit, I paid around $240 over the year to a barber to do the same job I could do myself with this Wahl haircutting kit. When I was first looking for clippers, I found this Wahl set and couldn&#x27;t believe the price... nor the reviews. Because it was so inexpensive, I decided to give it a whirl and try it out. It hasn&#x27;t disappointed. The clippers themselves look and feel high-quality - there is some weight to the clippers, which I like to see. The color-coordinated extensions are an excellent touch... something that every clipper set should have, really. Right out of the box, these cut like a dream and it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to the feel of them. In about a year, after spending less than $20 on these clippers, I&#x27;ve saved myself around $220. This kit has lived up to my expectations based on the Amazon reviews I read prior to purchase.</li>
    <li> Powerful, professional feel. However, when I cut with my #2 level it leaves noticeable lines. Now after my hair grows for about a week they aren&#x27;t distinguishable, but it still shouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;As someone who was looking forward to these clippers I have to say it was a little disappointing. I will continue to use them, but when it&#x27;s time to replace them I will look for different one&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive hair cutting kit.  Been in use for over a year and still going strong.  Carrying case is a must, and thankfully comes with the product.</li>
    <li> The plastic guides have a stipple (finish) on them which prevents the guide from traversing your scalp or beard smoothly.</li>
    <li> great. just as described. came quickly</li>
    <li> comes with up to 1&amp;#34; comb, which is nice. wahl does make larger ones, that would fit, as well. plastic case is a bit cheap, but the trimmer itself has the usual wahl solid feel to the construction. works well on very thick hair</li>
    <li> Works really well. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Its a good clipper, but the level adjuster lever moves in as you cut, leaving you with an uneven cut. I hold onto the lever to keep it in position :-(</li>
    <li> cuts well, but the clipper sizes are far too big to conduct a bald fade</li>
    <li> USE IT ALL THE TIME TO CUT MY HUSBAND&#x27;S HAIR, ALTHO I&#x27;M NOT A PROFESSIONAL, BUT IT SAVES MONEY!</li>
    <li> good product, fast service, best price</li>
    <li> It has  vibration but it is doing good job</li>
    <li> He buzzes his own head instead of going to the barber and he kept borrowing his brother&#x27;s clippers. I got him this set for a bday gift and he really likes it!</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit has worked great for me! Works well for the simple haircuts that I use it for. I save $10 everytime I use it so I definitely cannot complain about the great price. It has already paid for itself!</li>
    <li> does the job and great deal</li>
    <li> i was gonna use it to shave my head but decided not to but i do trim my face up with it and it works great, definitely something to get if you dont wanna spend 100+ on a trimmer!</li>
    <li> Very nice kit.  Many more sizes of clipper guides than I ever knew existed.  I have been cutting my own hair for years and I use a trimmer around the sides and back.  This unit is much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> cannot beat it for the price.  Purchased this because Great Clips screwed up my hair too many times.  I though I could save money and get just as good of cut from my wife.  There are plenty of attachments for all different lengths and this has held up well through a whole year of cuts so far.  This item paid for itself after two cuts,</li>
    <li> This is the first time we&#x27;ve used one of these.  Found it a little tricky until we got used to it.  It&#x27;s a good product, the only thing is we really would like a 1 1/2&amp;#34; comb but we can order that separately for a couple of bucks, so no big deal.  Other than that it&#x27;s working out well, saving us money and it was a good price.</li>
    <li> Works great and the price is excellent. Keep it cleaned and it will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Quiet, smooth and powerful. I&#x27;ve saved a bunch of money on haircuts since getting these.</li>
    <li> I bought these to be a sturdier, more long-lasting replacement for the $15 Norelco clippers that I have been shaving my head with for years but kept having to buy a new pair every year or two. These Wahl clippers are much more heavy-duty, no doubt. But for the purpose of shaving my head, after two attempts I have to say that the quality of the cut is uneven. Took entirely too many passes and too much time. So back to Norelco I go.</li>
    <li> Really nice my husband loves this.</li>
    <li> works great for shorter hair cuts, not very loud compared to similar products, and it doesn&#x27;t not pull on hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this 5 times already to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. I have never cut my husband&#x27;s hair before and this has made it super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different guide combs are really easy to switch out. I love that they are different colors so I know exactly which to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the scissors that come with the kit. They are really low quality and don&#x27;t recommend anyone use them. I use my own (Goody brand) hair scissors to trim the front of my husbands hair and to touch up around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I am able to cut my husband&#x27;s hair more OFTEN because usually he would go to the hair salon as a last minute resort when his hair got too long to spike. Now he can maintain a professional look without the dread (and cost) of visiting a hair salon. (He hates it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone, it has really saved us money and will continue to down the road! Haircuts every 6 weeks at a hair salon usually were (with a tip) ~$15, which is $130 a year! Glad I am saving money! Even if I had to buy this product every year it would be worth it, but luckily from reviews I see this product will last much longer. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Now I can easily clip my husband&#x27;s hair whenever it is needed. I don&#x27;t need all the accessories but the machine itself cuts well, clean and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price,works as advertised.</li>
    <li> devise works well for my use I use this to shave my head, so limited opinion.</li>
    <li> Great razor, doesn&#x27;t do as well with the blade all the way in the shortened position as well as I would like, but over all I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
    <li> Great! I buzz my head and after the 3rd time by myself I never miss a hair! Ha I love have simple and cheap it is!</li>
    <li> Given two haircuts with it so far and it works like a dream. A truly amazing deal for the money and it comes with oil for continued maintenance over time. Real heavy meaty motor in it also so I can assume its going to last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Use this monthly to cut my hair and it works great.  I&#x27;ve currently got my eye on Wahl&#x27;s cordless clippers to make the process even easier.</li>
    <li> I have gotten a hair cut every week since purchasing this. My girlfriend is amazing with this and gives me a smooth cut every time. I have gotten more compliments than going to a regular barber, and the haircut takes 10 minutes max.</li>
    <li> Great product and better for the money</li>
    <li> Did not like it, is very heavy and bulky</li>
    <li> Cuts hair very well. No one could be disappointed with the money they spend on this. Extremely worth it for home hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Excellent machine haircutting. Good quality. User friendly</li>
    <li> Simple to use, and now I don&#x27;t have to pay for haircuts anymore!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Love the colored gaurds</li>
    <li> Good set of Hair clippers, works great not noisy like some of the others, you won&#x27;t need earplugs. I&#x27;ve used them twice already with the guards, and I have to say that the cut was clean, crisp, over the entire head.For those looking to self groom, keep the barber money in your pocket, and still look good, then I recommend this Barber Set.</li>
    <li> For the price , its a great value</li>
    <li> Heavy duty. feel like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> WOW ! .. actually they surprised me with awesome quality and performance ! ... Highly recommend them ... better than what barber shop professionals use ! ... the best investment anyone can make !</li>
    <li> I am by no means a hair stylist, but I use this to cut my son&#x27;s hair in the summer.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes a great product.</li>
    <li> Second one of these.  My original still works great, but I needed to buy new combs.  Saw this cheap during X-mas, and decided to just buy a new whole unit.  Honestly, I think this one is better than the original purchased about 6 years ago.  This version is much lighter, and the blades look like they are stainless.</li>
    <li> Already have one that still works great after two years, and just bought another because of a 50% off Amazon deal, figured it was too good a deal to pass up and so when the blades eventually get dull I&#x27;ll have my new ones ready to go. I have shaved my head every two months most of my adult life and have used many different brands of clippers, for the price you can&#x27;t beat these. There is another model without the blade adjuster lever on the side that looks just like this model but it is not nearly as good, this is the model to go with.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Wife cuts my hair now instead of $17 each time to have it done.</li>
    <li> Bang for bucks! Easy and efficient :) Must buy if u want to save money :P</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few years now and decided to write a review. In about three years of regular haircuts and occasional beard trims, I&#x27;ve never had any issue with them. They cut my hair well, and I&#x27;ve saved a few hundred dollars doing it myself rather than going to the barber shop. If you&#x27;re going to cut your own hair/beard/forest of body hair, I recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was about the price of an average hair cut.  I thought if it did not work I would not be out that much.  I was quite surprised at how well this worked for me.  And this was from me cutting my own hair (no help).  Now I am able to keep my hair cut on a regular basis without putting out the money for regular hair cuts (can eat into a budget real quick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not perfect as in that it won&#x27;t give you a styled hair cut.  I will not use it on my daughters&#x27; hair but on my son&#x27;s I will.  But if you are looking for a hair cut or trim, this works well.  It comes with all the numbered attachments that the stylists use all the way to number 8 plus some special attachments such as for around the ears and eyebrows.  I do not mind it being cored so I do not have to worry about the battery going dead while in the middle of a trim.  It does have a bit of weight to it but to me that shows me it will not break after the first two or three uses. (I&#x27;ve had this for almost six months now with no problems).  Just make sure you maintain by cleaning and lubing it with the supplied oil.</li>
    <li> We needed to replace clippers and a beard and mustache trimmer.  The clippers work decent for personal grooming, but excel for cutting hair.  While they are not the top quality that barbers have, the self sharpening blades seem to hold up after a few cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone is looking for a good value and cuts the families hair at home, you can not pass this up!</li>
    <li> This is a great set of clippers, and the price is even better. I cut all three of my sons&#x27; hair regularly, plus my husband trims his beard, and this set is perfect for our family. The clippers are heavy-duty and cut evenly. All of the guards are color coded and clearly labeled. I recommend this to everyone now!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this product.I use it to cut my husbands hair.It does a nice job and we save money by not going to the barber.</li>
    <li> Perfect machine. Don´t hurt and cut very fine. I don´t need to go to barber shop anymore. It´s very easy to use this machine and work perfect. Maybe a llttle noise when you use it but nothing bad. I am very happy with this purchase. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> here my story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened box, everything fine, read instruction and made like there...oiled it before. on first power it was very very loud (I mean realy loud, like tractor), but but there was in instruction that I need adjust power and thats what I did...In instruction: &amp;#34;adjust power before u can&#x27;t hear noise and this is max settings&amp;#34; I adjusted power to low and noise was acceptable (much low than before, but steel louder than other clippers) ... but there was real problem, for that power it was&#x27;t clipp hair (and I have thin hair), than I crank up power so it can clipp (it was not as loud as first time but steel very noisy)...okey I started hair clipp and after about 1 minute work it just Blow, Smoke and it gone (now I am half clipped, thanks to Wahl)......after checking I noticed It was very hot, but I did not noticed when clipping (heat was front of machine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant return item sadly, this item is definitely piece of garbage, I want my money back!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is so loud, it sounds like a lawn mower!! Tightened the screw and blade wouldn&#x27;t work. Should&#x27;ve taken it out and tried it immediately, as the return window has passed. Looks like I have a rather expensive pair of scissors and a comb. Everything else is useless.</li>
    <li> This clipper does a great job. Smooth cutting and relatively quiet. Very good for the price. Wahl products never fail to satisfy.</li>
    <li> Only used it once, but it did exactly what we expected.  Boy was it great.  I highly recommend it.  So there.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how anyone can think this is too noisy. It purrs. I like this. I cut both my hair and my grandson&#x27;s hair and have been using a Flobee. Don&#x27;t laugh. It works but my grandson&#x27;s hair is thick and it takes forever so I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did. The color coded pieces let you change the length of the cut. I cut mine using the same clip but use 2 different clips for his hair. It cuts nice and doesn&#x27;t yank the hair. These are a heck of a lot better than the ones my dad used to use way back when. I can cut my own hair with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to use it 3 times before posting. I can&#x27;t comment on longevity of the product but I can say I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. The color coding is a terrific idea and you don&#x27;t have to keep the booklet as it&#x27;s shown on the razor. I recommend cutting with a longer cut and working your way to the length you desire. I didn&#x27;t. I just wanted it short.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality pair of cutters....especially for the inexpensive price. The color-coded guard attachments are nice, as well. Some cheap trimmers are not good (been there...done that). These will do the job for family use.</li>
    <li> One of the best home clippers ever.</li>
    <li> We previously had wahl clippers that we used for at least 5 years to cut my husband&#x27;s hair, but they had become dull and one of the ear shields was broken so time for a new one! Just cut my husband&#x27;s hair and they seemed very dull for brand new clippers. The guards also seem to have wider teeth compared to our old set so I think that is impacting the cut as well. I do like the color coding system but that&#x27;s the only good part of these clippers in my opinion.  I purchased this at full price and my analysis is fair and impartial.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair, and I have no previous experience. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These clippers were a replacement for another brand of clippers I have had for many years.  These are so much quieter and better than the old set.  Nice moulded case, plenty of attachments, and they have a quality feel to them.  The only thing I would change is the blue area in the picture is made of rubber or some other soft material.  This helps hold the thumb in place and is very comfortable, but short beard hair sticks to it and is very hard to get off.  Other than that small thing I really like this set of clippers.</li>
    <li> You can feel the quality of it, it&#x27;s also very cheap but it makes too much noise. This is the only reason why I&#x27;m going to buy another hair clipper. If that&#x27;s not a problem for you (like if you&#x27;re deaf) then buy it right now.</li>
    <li> My wife gave this to me for my birthday since my previous ones accessories have been lost over time.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would love this one due to the number of included accessories and it comes with a plastic carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;on startup the noise that came out of this thing was unbearable. I quickly went to the book to see if I needed to adjust anything.&lt;br /&gt;I tried tightening the plastic screw to the side and like another reviewer,&lt;br /&gt;I tried slowly loosing the screw and found out there are no shades of grey it is either loud or it wont cut.&lt;br /&gt;what I found out is the white upper plastic case is vibrating on the lower half, if you hold the top and bottom tightly this&lt;br /&gt;reduces the noise quit a bit but this cant be maintained through a haircut. Cut a long story short it is in a garbage bin. the positive is the attachments fit my old cutter. DO NOT BUY...</li>
    <li> for its price wow, what a deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this. After one haircut, it paid for itself. Also, its so much more convenient than driving to the barber and waiting for your turn in the chair.</li>
    <li> Great for manscaping, landscaping, and escaping the hairy struggle that is my attempts to give myself a haircut.</li>
    <li> I decided to save money by trying to cut my own hair, and, after seeing the positive reviews for this unit, I decided to pull the trigger so to speak.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m by no means a professional hair-cutter, but this machine, for all practical purposes, fits the build.  The fist hair cut went well.  I&#x27;m actually surprised with the quality of the cutter and I feel that overall this kit has good value.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical to buy this because of the price, but the reviews convinced me. Glad I did! Saving tons of money on haircuts! Very easy to use, comes with tons of different lengths attachments, I&#x27;ll probably never go get my hair cut again!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tool for any kind of hair, because it comes with all the things you might use it.</li>
    <li> im disappointed with amazons picture saying it has powerdrive as the box i received did not say it had powerdrive and after emailing wahl they confirm it does not have it. that was the reason i bought it as i wanted to not have it slow down or pull my hair when cutting. however it does that even without the power drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smooth, no pulling, quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 small complaints&lt;br /&gt;sometimes if you turn it off during the middle of cutting and turn it back on its like it gets hair in it and when it comes on its buzzing obnoxiously loud. i turn it off and back on and its back quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other is after cutting my hair i notice a small patch it will not cut correctly. several attempts different angles, perhaps its because im cutting my own hair, but weird i never had problems with any previous clippers, and i can get all but a small patch every hair cut?</li>
    <li> Works well an like the color coding. My husband has cut his hair and my sons&#x27; hair. He&#x27;s not a professional but it looked good.</li>
    <li> So far I am very impressed. I cut my own hair for the first time and thought it would be difficult but the hair, length combs worked great.</li>
    <li> Color coding makes it easy to pick the right guard, does what it is supposed to do and does it very well for a great price</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  SO MANY OF THESE CUTTERS ARE JUNK.  THIS WOKRS PERFECTLY FOR ME EVERY TIME.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  5 STARS</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I have 4 boys and I&#x27;ve cut their hair since the oldest was a baby. This is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s lasted the longest and has the best selection of combs. I was even able to get an invaluable 1-1/2 comb from Sally Beauty Supply, which makes it even more awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I&#x27;ve had this for 5-7 years, meaning I&#x27;ve saved over $3000 with this sucker. I&#x27;m going to DisneyWorld!</li>
    <li> Gave my kid a mohawk and these make it so easy. They are quieter then the lithum ones and cut better.</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit is great. Not only it&#x27;s good quality, but also the easiness to use. Several of my friends recommended me to buy this one, I am really happy with this purchase. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Update: I rated this item pretty low because not only did two accessories come broken, but also because they are pretty flimsy.  I, however, improved the rating because I called the company&#x27;s customer service department and they were beyond responsive. Any company with that kind of service will keep my business.    So I just found out why these are so cheap. I just opened this and the case where it comes is cracked and two of the attachments are broken.  The attachments seem extremely fragile.  Like someone else pointed out, if they&#x27;re broken out of the box, you can guess how long they will last.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the package! Love mine so much. My old trimmers were not cutting it anymore, literally! I&#x27;m so happy with these. Cuts my hair, beard, whatever else, with no issues whatsoever. I don&#x27;t use many of the longer guides but I&#x27;m glad I have them just in case. The color coding with a guide on the trimmers is excellent. It makes finding the right guide so much easier. This was a steal. I feel like it&#x27;s already paid for itself with just a couple of haircuts at home!</li>
    <li> Really nice for the price! High quality!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband and he loves it. The kit has everything you need to get your hair the way you want. Very lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> just the old one I had that was 10 years old</li>
    <li> These are great clippers for the price.  Not amazing quality, but for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> This razor was very quiet and did its job. I get my hair cut by it every couple weeks and it hasn&#x27;t failed on me. There is a number on every clip which tells me how high or low im cutting my hair(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), just like at the barber shop. Very easy to use, quiet, contains accessories,and a very good price. Very happy with it</li>
    <li> An affordable and useful tool that works quite well. The only problem that I encountered is the switch knob. It is not as easy to operate as one might expect or prefer. I use it sometimes to trim my husband&#x27;s hair and my thumb gets quite tired by the time I am done. Otherwise, I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Our old set was getting very dull and I didn&#x27;t know how to sharpen it and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that would do it for me. I decided to bite the bullet and get this set for my husband for Christmas. It&#x27;s just as good as all the other reviews say. Cuts like a breeze and I like the color guards, it makes it easier to figure out what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> For the price not bad. All came in nice package and in great condition. Only thing I do not like is when you use it go as slow as possible or it will pull your hair</li>
    <li> am very well satisfied</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set, with a few more attachments that my previous haircutter set had. Is well made and looks like a set that will be nice to own for a long time. For the price we got it for ($16.99 saleprice) you cant go wrong. I wanted to buy two sets at the same time, but the total for two of them came to over $60.00 at checkout. Couldn&#x27;t figure that at, so I just decided on getting one. Overall, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied at this time.</li>
    <li> Noticed finger prints and stuck hairs on the blade after opening the package. There could be some improvement made in the packaging of this product so that once opened it can&#x27;t be sealed back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cutter for 6 months now.  It works very well, and has a ton of color coded height attachments that make cutting your hair pretty easy.  It does have the same annoying fault every one of these cutters I have ever used has.  Occasionally it will make a very loud sound when you turn it on.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect cutting but I have never figured out what causes it.&lt;br /&gt;While this cutter is pretty much the same as most other cutters, the many color coded attachments along with the display on the cutter showing them all makes you feel very confident that your not going to mess things up.  Just start with the larger attachments and work your way down until your happy with the look.  That makes it very difficult to make a huge mistake cutting your hair.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to buy again right now, I&#x27;d buy this same unit again.</li>
    <li> Wahl has always been a great brand. Color code is also great.  Many useful pieces and plan to save money on haircuts for me and the boys.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and I really like the hard carry case.</li>
    <li> Horrible. To noisy and to much vibration.</li>
    <li> I use these clippers once per week, and they never let me down. After 2 years, the smallest guard (the 1/2 guard) has begun to wear through, but it&#x27;s had a lot of use.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I shaved my own head with the 1/8&amp;#34; inch blade (#1).  It didn&#x27;t get as low as I liked, so I removed the blade and used the lever to dial in the correct height.  I found that with the lever on the highest mark, it&#x27;s about the equivalent of a 1/2 blade.  Just guessing.  I used it for 20 minutes straight and it didn&#x27;t get too hot or anything.  It got warm. .  but not hot.</li>
    <li> have a trimmer for the beard others seem to use it no complaints</li>
    <li> oh iam in love with this wahl since i bought it i never gone for hair cut ouside it has blade for every side of my hair and good thing is you can give shape from angle as it has all the instructions and blade to cut according your style.</li>
    <li> Tried the cordless and they lasted only a few haircuts before the battery just quit taking a full charge.  Love the corded ones for full power and no battery to worry about.</li>
    <li> good enough for the job :)</li>
    <li> so easy to use. everyone that has seen has used it. Great price.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well - cuts hair with precision!</li>
    <li> great product!! inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It does the job so far. I cut my own hair with them and it&#x27;s pretty easy. Low fade.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I was impressive by the price, because people from USA say me: &amp;#34;sheap is not good&amp;#34; But this is REALLY good. highly recommend. A lot f features and the package is so durable</li>
    <li> Nice to have sharp clippers again. Color code makes it easy to find and remember the height  you like.</li>
    <li> Very nice, wahl is always a great product even the cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> I like very much.Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is 4 and afraid of going to the barber. It didn&#x27;t cut his hair at all. It was very noisy and he was afraid of it. I tried to adjust it but when it was quite it pulled his hair and it still didn&#x27;t trim.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and the color coded attachments make it easy to remember what you used last time. Nobody should be with out one!</li>
    <li> Strong motor, not too loud.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean by removing metal head (held on by two screws).</li>
    <li> Simple basic kit for quick trims and buzz cuts for the boys in the family. Has a good selection of guards for different lengths that hold on securely. It is not really &amp;#34;fancy looking&amp;#34; and the plastics feel and look cheap but it does a good job for what I got it for. Instead of paying $14 for a buzz cut for my 10 year old son (it is what he likes) I can do it in 10 minutes in my kitchen every couple weeks over the summer and after probably 20 haircuts is still working as well as when got it so has paid for itself many times over. I really have no idea how it would be for actual haircuts and styles but it had a nice assortment of guards for short styles and a special guard for tapering each side so it does not look like a done at home cut.</li>
    <li> Had no power and pulled hair OUT! Very painful! Also, it was extremely loud!     I returned this product immediately.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to cut my son&#x27;s hair. The cutter feels little heavy which is no bother to me because it just means it&#x27;s durable and will probably last a long time. The price is awesome too!</li>
    <li> I love the basic kit, but this one is even better.  Cuts coarse hair like a hot knife through butter, with no pulling or tugging like the less expensive one.</li>
    <li> NIce and precise, hope it lasts longer than a year.</li>
    <li> Unable to use it in my location due to voltage disparity. Where I am we use 220-240 voltage, and this clipper uses 160v. I feel like crying as neither me nor anyone in my location can use it. More so, I can&#x27;t sell it. It remains like a dummy to me. No rating.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality for its price.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and easy to use.  Love the snap on guides- made it easy to trim my beard evenly and quickly.  Why didn&#x27;t I buy this years ago?</li>
    <li> I bought this hair trimmer long time, ago but I had never got a chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it yesterday and the trimmer is not cutting at all.</li>
    <li> Works great! Wahl makes great hair cutting tools.</li>
    <li> The motor burnt out during the third haircut using it.&lt;br /&gt;Would not but again.</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper. Cutting ones own hair- not as easy as it sounds.</li>
    <li> They work very well and I love the color-coded guides and cheat sheet on the clippers themselves. I just ordered extra guide combs (#10 &amp; #12) for even longer lengths. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I didn&#x27;t know it came with a PVC cape to keep the hair off so I had already purchased one elsewhere.</li>
    <li> works like it says it does</li>
    <li> great price for all of the different size blades included.  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> They are awesome clippers, but I had to take of two stars because I cannot give myself a line-up with these clippers. They are not made to adjust to the point to where you can use them to trim facial hair either. I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> used it less than ten times, some water came on the blades and it just go rusted and stopped working, cheap stuff. spend few more and get you something better.</li>
    <li> I bought this with very little expectation and it&#x27;s way better than the expensive name brand it replaced! Absolutely get this one!</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and the shipping was fast :)</li>
    <li> Jams up on semi thick hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I actually bought it for my short hair cats and dog... Done an amazing job! No issues what-so-ever!</li>
    <li> Nice to have the color coded lengths.  Easy to use.  Cuts well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought hair clippers before, but I expected them to be at least $50+. I was shocked to see this was &amp;#60;$20, but the reviews were good so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I&#x27;m STILL surprised that these aren&#x27;t $50+, because they work like they are. If you need hair clippers, I&#x27;m hesitant to believe that there&#x27;s a better option out there than these, in terms of value and quality.</li>
    <li> It is nice and convenience.</li>
    <li> Works great on beard and hair. Easy to use and in the case of haircuts, easy to follow instructions.</li>
    <li> Best value in a full trimmer set.</li>
    <li> Clippers were so loud that my and the person&#x27;s hair I was cutting ears hurt! It sounded like they were about to explode or something. Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl, and I will never buy anything else. I love the multicolored attachments; my old Wahl had black guides and I made an unfortunate mistake once. That being said, these guides are definitely more flimsy than my previous black ones, and I the #6 actually doesn&#x27;t fit on my clippers; the mount opening is too small. I&#x27;m sure I could cut it or file it or something to get it to fit on there, but for now I&#x27;m just using my old #6. (I was going to dock the clippers are star for this, but the problem is fixable and nothing&#x27;s perfect.) My previous Wahl shorted after about a decade and I didn&#x27;t think twice before buying this to replace it. No regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! And for the unaware, you can buy longer guides on Amazon if you poke around here a bit. I have a 1 1/4&amp;#34; and a 1 1/2&amp;#34; that allow me to wear my hair a little longer. Really great.</li>
    <li> Honestly one of the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought for the price.  I have very thick and curly hair which I like to keep short and have been cutting myself for years.  Clippers for me generally aren&#x27;t that effective and don&#x27;t last more than a year or so.  This thing goes through my hair like butter!!! Amazed with how fast I was able to get my first cut with these done! I just hope they last...</li>
    <li> Ohhhhh! So nice!!! This is 10 times nicer than I expected! So much nicer than the Panasonic I had before. It&#x27;s sturdy and very professional, and I anticipate being able to use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> excellent! The color codes are a big help.</li>
    <li> No problems going through my old wiry gray beard. So far so good. Comes with a ton of attachments so I think the pooch will be getting a little love too!</li>
    <li> this kit is perfect. I&#x27;ve mastered many styles on my sons hair. I am a professional dog groomer, so I know good clippers when I see them, and these are just amazing. especially for the price</li>
    <li> Some parts came broken</li>
    <li> Oh I love these cutters!!! They cut like butter! The color guide on the clippers themselves is also a plus because I can look at the guide and quickly / easily know which piece I need.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. The storage case makes it easy to store and not loose the attachments.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter, and she really appreciates the ability to give herself&lt;br /&gt;a quick summer haircut.</li>
    <li> Happy with all functions of this product</li>
    <li> Perfect set of clippers. I use them weekly and have not had an issue to-date. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Super awesome!  Work great and a good deal.</li>
    <li> Bought to use on my dog for summer clips, works exactly as I&#x27;d hoped. Fantastic for the price! Love the guides included!</li>
    <li> I had my first set of these clippers for almost 5 years before my wife accidentally dropped them on a hard floor while cutting my hair and thereby breaking the clipper guide.  For the price I&#x27;m not sure how you could go wrong.  Granted they are just used for my hair about every 2-3 weeks but after the first use they had already paid for themselves.  Within 5 minutes of the first pair getting broken I had ordered my next set off of Amazon.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Not as loud as other reviews say.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Very cheap for the overall build quality. Got it delivered a bit late for no reason. Feels good in hand.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband who cuts his hair every week.  He likes the clippers and all the attachments that came with is. His only complaint is the case.  It&#x27;s a bit small and he has some difficulty getting everything back into the case each time he uses it.  The case that came with his old clippers is a canvas material with zipper, which he will likely continue using with this new clipper set.  Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.</li>
    <li> my wife love it very much, she cut my hair and the kids</li>
    <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair when cutting!</li>
    <li> This Wahl 20 piece kit is a great set to have for personal hair grooming. It comes with tons of clips and even ones for those pesky behind the ear ones.  The shaver itself is pretty heavy and comes with a decent length cord and the blades are adjustable with the little lever. So far I&#x27;ve used it about 15 times and I did have one time where it made a louder sound, but once I turned it off and on again, it was back to normal. It cuts pretty well. Normally with my last buzzers I had to go over 2-3 times, but This usually gets everything the second time.  It comes with all the other normal items like oil, scissors, brush, and combs. It doesn&#x27;t come with a hair schmock thing or whatever you call it. The container is great but sometimes it can get a little tight inside making it hard to close the container. Think of this...This one purchase is equal to one haircut. I&#x27;ve saved a ton of money with these.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;No issues. Worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Came with many many attachments for different hair lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Came with 2 combs and a pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wire is about 5ft long. Wish it was a bit longer. But even that is not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Such a phenomenal bargain. Had them for a few months now and they&#x27;ve easily paid for themselves already. These clippers work like professional. So easy to use and very powerful. The case is very nice to have and all the guards are of great quality and snap on perfectly.</li>
    <li> i need one of this clipper but i need one for my dog....is the same model? this is my mail fdmalavz@gmail.com</li>
    <li> So far this has been a great purchase.  I have thick hair and these clippers haven&#x27;t had a problem cutting through it quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guides do seem a bit cheap, but have worked fine so far.  If you pay attention to what you are doing with them you shouldn&#x27;t break them while you are attaching or removing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more hair cut and they will be paid for!  A couple more after that and I can afford to buy a whole new kit if I want spare parts!</li>
    <li> This Kit works much better than the older model Wahl we had, more consistent cut for the price we paid.</li>
    <li> Excellent product....works great...excellent price from Amazon....Amazon is great!</li>
    <li> These are so cool.  I always get sweaty hands when going somewhere for a haircut... these allow me to cut my own hair in front of a mirror.. and truthfully, it turns out really well.  I use the #7 on top, and go back to front, a #5 on the sides above my ears, and a #3 or #2 below my ears.  excellent, value added product!</li>
    <li> This kit works great !</li>
    <li> Love the colored clips and the quality of wahl is great. Comes with everything needed.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift to someone else. They liked it.</li>
    <li> Ibought it to trim my beard. Couldn&amp;#34;t be more pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive product. It&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> Everything seems to work great. A lot of good equipment comes with it. It seems very good for the money. Well put together.</li>
    <li> The haircutting kit got to my house fast, was well made and I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
    <li> This is the first time I cut my own hair. It turned out as good as you cut in the barber shop. It comes with good instructions, showing how to give different haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything works properly, and it works well for me. Best of all, it is cheaper than most comparable products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always buy from Amazon. Thanks to amazon and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So far great, I&#x27;ve been using it once per month and it&#x27;s doing everything it should, no complains.</li>
    <li> What can be said other than these clippers are amazing for the price.  The do what they are supposed to do.  If you cut your own hair just twice with these (or if someone else cuts your hair with these) then they have already paid for themselves.  Overall I am pleased with the quality of these clippers, but I have yet to purchase a Wahl product that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I love these. I have 3 boys and refuse to go to the barber shop every week. lol I cut their hair at home. I love the color size on the clippers. And the box to keep it all in. Would recommend to anyone. Love the price:) They were sitting on my doorstep the day after ordering them. Can&#x27;t get any better then that!</li>
    <li> Makes loud noise. 110 volts</li>
    <li> Cost less than a haircut. My wife cut my hair this weekend. Looks awful, but she will get better. I like it short and I got it short for sure. Fortunately hair grows back out. So I will wear a hat for a couple of weeks. I figure after a couple of haircuts my wife is bound to get better and I will begin to see a return on my investment. Like others here, I couldn&#x27;t get my barber to cut it as short as I like it. Moved to a new place and decided not to find a new barber so recruited my wife. For the price, you get a decent set of tools so no complaints there. Good instructions with it. I don&#x27;t know how others are able to cut their own hair. I might practice a little and see how it goes. I cannot do any worse than my wife and I have lots of hats. Good quality for the price. Shipped fast and free with Prime.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It cost as much ad one haircut for me so it was well worth the money. Especially since i get a hair cut every two weeks. My wife and I are learning.</li>
    <li> I am so grossed out, I want to vomit.  I opened the box when I got this shaver, excited to be able to give my son his haircuts instead of paying for them every few weeks.  To my horror and disgust, I see oily smudges on the front of the shaver, and little flecks of black contrasting with the top white section that upon closer examination appear to be SOMEONE ELSE&#x27;S STUBBLE.  Not only is shipping this product used wrong and unethical, it&#x27;s disgusting and unsanitary, and possibly dangerous if the person before me had lice or other issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at this item originally on Amazon, it had such overwhelmingly positive reviews, I didn&#x27;t bother looking at the small minority of 1-stars, and I wish I had.  It looks like I&#x27;m not the first person to have this problem.  AMAZON - THIS IS INEXCUSABLE!!  How can you continue to sell this item, and any items from this seller, after getting so many reports of this disgusting nature??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have emailed Amazon and asked them this question, and am awaiting response.  I have been using Amazon heavily for years, and have never had something like this happen, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the fact that Amazon sees this happening and doesn&#x27;t stop it is a BIG black eye for them in my eyes.  1-star for Wahl, whom I have also had previous good experiences with, and 1-star for Amazon for continuing to sell this item after repeated complaints!</li>
    <li> Used once,&amp; still in original box,(wearing out the old one entirely first! :)</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly. Then I realized with my blonde hair and blue eyes that I should probably keep some hair.</li>
    <li> The clippers are for someone else, however like Everything else I think.&lt;br /&gt;They will be a great gift! !!</li>
    <li> Motor very strong and vey quiet! Best cutters I have owned. The bad thing is the way the guards are shipped. Not really packed well no is there a good way to organze them. Other than the small stuff it is great!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my guy&#x27;s hair for about a year now with these clippers.  They work great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really solid cutter. I only use it without a guide or with the shortest guide, but it&#x27;s great for chest hair and beard.  I just wish it had more short-guide options because most of them are for really long hair.  Obviously it&#x27;s designed for head-hair, but it works for full body.</li>
    <li> I like the clipper, color guards are useful.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I died &amp; went to Heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are easy to use, easy to change combs, and the cut?  my barber is gonna be missing me before too long.  :)  The cut is even, precise, &amp; it has never pulled the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the attachments that come with it, make it possible to open up your own shop...&lt;br /&gt;also great if you have a lot of heads to cut.&lt;br /&gt;there is a pair of scissors(or two pair-I forget, I only use one)&lt;br /&gt;there are combs from 1/8&amp;#34; all the way to 3&amp;#34;, with a left &amp; right taper...there is even one that helps to blend everything.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommeded</li>
    <li> Everything you need to do your own hair cutting and more.  It has enough adapters to allow you to cut hair to many different lengths without effort.  Add in the other gadgets and it is a winner.</li>
    <li> This thing does exactly what it is supposed to do - exactly as it is supposed to do it. You can feel just how well made this product is and it is very quiet. I got tired of getting horrible haircuts at \\&quot;stylists\\&quot; in Miami Beach. A three-figure cut at a chic hotel was as bad as the hack job at SuperCuts. A few days ago, I went to a barber recommended by the local paper. I got up from the chair when it was apparent that he didn&#x27;t speak a word of English. I gave up, showed the white flag and ordered this in desperation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this reminded me of my first raw oyster. Both require a bit of courage. However, it really is a whole lot easier than one might think to give yourself a perfectly good haircut. If you start with the longer guide combs, it is easy to then do some fine tuning with a shorter comb. Again, this is a precision made device and the combs snap perfectly into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would whack a half-star off, if I could, because the case is not the same quality as the clipper. It has no dividers; It&#x27;s just an empty plastic box into which one throws everything.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well but kit could use a size between 1 (too short) and 2 (too long) in order to blend more effectively.  The lever doesn&#x27;t make these two meet halfway either.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for me and a friend so that we could start to cut our own hair, and when it got in the mail I was blown away.  The case it comes in is simplistic, and large enough to hold all the parts it comes with without issues.  The razor itself is on the heavy side, but the weight feels good, and the razor clips that come with it are very well varied and work well.  I would reccomend this product in a moment for anyone who wants to do their own haircuts from now on!</li>
    <li> It can cut hair, and your scalp too, also required to wear earplugs when using this thing, insanely loud, gets hotter than hell only to burn your head, pulls hair out, just a flat out waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for over 23 years and have used Wahl and Norelco electric razors.  I firmly think that if I simply keep this Wahl electric razor oiled it will likely last for another 20 years, easily.  The colored size guards are VERY useful.  I have clippers in one hand, a second mirror in the other and to make quick decisions on fading techniques or what size I want it is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Having 3 boys and hubby, we used this set. It&#x27;s eay to use it. Recommend it to anone who wants to do a quick hair cut.</li>
    <li> So good that I bought another set for my parents needs. My set was making some noise but a big screw on the side fixed the noise. I am happy with the product. Very sharp and fast. It takes some time to learn how to use it. First use the long sizes so in case you mess it up you still can fix it by using a smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> With two cuts these clippers have already paid for themselves. I cant speak on the durability because I&#x27;ve only had them for about a month but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to cut my baby&#x27;s hair but so far I have used it twice on my husband. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s worth $20 for sure! It isn&#x27;t the fanciest out there but the quality is fine and if taken care of will last a long time! Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Rather fine overall, except for the cheap quality of the combs and the fact that you can&#x27;t trim with it.</li>
    <li> Expected quality from Wahl...but got junk with no quality control.  One of the screws holding the cutting blade in place was completely stripped out and now the blade is held in place by only one screw.  Looks like I&#x27;m the one screwed on this deal.  Will be the last Wahl I purchase (have owned three others).  Inspect upon arrival to verify that it isn&#x27;t junk.</li>
    <li> After trying to cut my 2 year old&#x27;s hair (with scissors) so many times and always ending up with an awful hack job, I gave in and decided to find a decent pair of clippers. I really love these clippers. I can cut my son&#x27;s hair in minutes flat. It came with a lot of pieces... various lengths, special edge trimmers, nice scissors, and two different kinds of combs. Not to mention equipment/oil to clean the trimmer with, when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really my only complaint is --- this thing is LOUD. Seriously loud. I think it&#x27;s louder than my vacuum. It freaked my son out a bit the first time I used it (and me too, to be honest), but now he&#x27;s used to it and will play on my phone while I cut his hair. I still haven&#x27;t used the special around the ear trimming pieces because I can barely get near his ears with this thing. In part I think it&#x27;s the volume of these clippers (did I mention they are LOUD?), but it&#x27;s mostly that my son hates to have his ears touched. He&#x27;s incredibly ticklish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was an amazing price for a really nice high quality and seemingly heavy duty product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon. Once my twin boys get old enough to start getting haircuts, I&#x27;m definitely going to be saving so much money cutting their hair. And, they will have cute hair cuts! No more horrible uneven bangs. I feel a little bad for when my son grows up and looks back at his pictures of those horrible, horrible cuts one day. At least I only attempted to cut his hair for a few months before buying these.. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell -- Awesome! LOUD.</li>
    <li> The product once connected to power worked fine for 5 minutes, after which with a sudden thud smoke started coming out of the clipper and it stopped working completely.</li>
    <li> If you shave your head or want to cut your own hair this is a great clipper. I bought it a month ago and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. I&#x27;m considering barber school and a homemaker of just one son and these clippers made it easy to make sure my little man still got his head right on a budget(or lack thereof haha). My husband is tremendously picky on who cuts his hair and he allowed me to, Wahl got the job done. And good for the price including all the accessories. Love.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer for the price. More than perfect for home use! I always trust Wahl! I will buy it again if necessary.</li>
    <li> Hiya! I recently ordered this haircutting kit for me and my husband. My husband has thick, hard to cut hair and is in the military so he has to keep his hair clean cut and short. This cut his hair easily and looked like he went to the barber&#x27;s! I on the other hand have super fine wispy hair that is cut into a mohawk. This did an amazing job of getting close to my scalp and making clean lines where my mohawk starts! I love it!</li>
    <li> Wahl makes great products and this is not exception. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of clippers but this is probably the best built one I&#x27;ve owned. Feels sturdy, almost industrial grade and I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> This &#x27;home use&#x27; model (MADE IN THE USA) comes with color coded hair guides which makes it so much easier finding and choosing the right one with the code chart on the clipper. I might have chosen a different model but this one suits my needs and budget. The price is absolutely incredible! $40.00 56% mark down&#x3D; $17.95 + tax, Amazon Prime free shipping, &#x3D; about 19 bucks! I called Wahl but they don&#x27;t register this particular model . They told me to just save the receipt. My first Wahl clipper was larger with a &#x27;detail trimmer&#x27; attached on the back ( I didn&#x27;t see this listed anywhere; maybe they don&#x27;t make this model anymore).  It was very durable and would have lasted more than five years had I not dropped it so many times.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Been cutting mine and son&#x27;s hair and it so easy.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had one of these and it worked well, so I got my own.  Very sturdy, cut&#x27;s without resistance, plenty of attachments.</li>
    <li> Affordable and effective.  Does it&#x27;s job as advertised and at a fraction of a cost of some of the competitors.  Use it every 6 weeks or so, and it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using this pair of clippers for 6+ years. I&#x27;ve only oiled it once or twice, and it runs like a champ. Excellent value for quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased such a quality hair buzzer for so cheap before. Usually they break easily and can&#x27;t cut my hair well, but this one has not given me any problems. The packaging is weird and all of the pieces are assorted in one large bag, but that isn&#x27;t detrimental to the product in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Now I can screw up my haircut just like a real barber, only cheaper. The clipper works great, good choice.</li>
    <li> This is a great product not just for the price. It works great, just like any other expensive stuff out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m very satisfied so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these clippers one time, so I&#x27;ll update this review in the  future, but so far I am very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a heft to them so that they don&#x27;t feel cheap, while not being too cumbersome or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair (almost every time I&#x27;ve ever gone to get my hair cut, the barber has noted how thick it is), and have had trouble with clippers in the past not easily cutting through my hair. Well, that is a thing of the past! These clippers cut through my hair like butter. No resistance whatsoever, no tugging/pulling of my hair, just cutting. I cut the bulk of my hair in 5 minutes (then spent time trimming). Love these clippers! During use they never got excessively warm or hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box isn&#x27;t anything special, but does hold the clippers. The comb attachments don&#x27;t have any separate compartment and I was worried about them breaking, so I grabbed an old electric razor leather case and placed them all in there, and then put that leather case in the plastic case next to the clippers. I feel much better about them now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for $17.99 and don&#x27;t see how you could get a much better value than these for as well as they work (assuming they are durable and last). If you&#x27;re looking for a set of inexpensive clippers, these seem like great ones to grab.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!! Actually shocked at how wonderful this is! It is not some light weight throw away product...it has weight to it. It is not as loud as my Oster brand trimmers. And works like a dream. Everything was in a rather disheartening light weight plastic container, but the trimmer itself is good. Have used it twice and are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I like the colors of the different guards. They are so helpful when trying to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. I would recommend this kit to anyone! For the price I am thinking about getting one for my dad and uncle!</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my head almost bald. I&#x27;ve used several similar Wahl shavers for this exact purpose for over ten years. This one is too rough on the neck and leaves the neck red and stinging for a few hours - even using Sensitive Skin Jel after use. I never experienced this before with any Wahl razor. It does cut a bit closer than other Wahl razors though which is probably why it&#x27;s rough on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is probably much better suited for using the accessories for regular hair cuts.</li>
    <li> poor quality and weak motor.......dont buy</li>
    <li> Hard to use by yourself.  I gave up.  Great if you have someone to cut your hair though.  Very well made, especially for the price.  They&#x27;ll last a long time and earn back their purchase price after the first or second haircut.  After that it&#x27;s money in the bank.</li>
    <li> This thing is a beast. Powerful and easy to use. The guards are strong, which is actually why I bought this one, compare des to these flimsy Remington plastic ones.</li>
    <li> lasted about 5 months tried adjusting the power screw NOGO</li>
    <li> Trimmed my own hair for the first time and the very next day everyone was commenting on how awesome my hair look! 5 Stars for sure. Highly recommended. Also, just one trip to the haircutter is more than this and I totally regret not buying this sooner.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it twice and it works great!</li>
    <li> it is good enough considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;once I clean it with water, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I check the maintenance guide: clean it with the oil in the same bag. it works again.&lt;br /&gt;so the quality is good and maintenace guide is good.l</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is part of the &amp;#34;Long Beard Club.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought him numerous beard trimmers but they just burn out, especially the rechargeable ones. I found a Beard Blog (yes, literally a blog about beards) and many guys recommended a corded hair trimmer with multiple attachments for longer beards. For less than $20, I decided to give this one a try. My case arrived broken at the hinge. Boo. I could&#x27;ve sent it back but I didn&#x27;t, so no stars lost there. Love the number of attachments and the color guide right on the trimmer. Has a nice weight, really isn&#x27;t loud for a trimmer, and seems to have some guts. I know people have complained about the &amp;#34;cheapness&amp;#34; of the plastic attachments but they really seem to be the normal ones, in my opinion. For the price, I just cannot complain about that. Exactly what I needed, for less than half of what I was about to spend AGAIN! Has already paid for itself. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> does a good job on my hair, on - off switch could be improved.</li>
    <li> Works well - simplifies cutting our boys&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> Hi can this use 220v electricity</li>
    <li> HEAVY, NOISY and Not Smooth !!!!!</li>
    <li> This has saved me tons of money I use to wasted getting a #3 hair cut. Very good investment.</li>
    <li> WAHL COLOR PRO 20 PIECE COMPLETE HAIR CUTTING KIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with eight color coded guide combs to cut hair from one-eighth inch to one inch long.  The cutter blades are very sharp and are self-sharpening.  My husband gets a nice, clean, even cutting without any pulling of the hair on his head or his beard.  All of these accessories are contained in a light weight plastic case for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also included left and right ear taper combs, ear trim guide, brush, comb, and oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that are included is a large fold out ten step pictorial that makes the hair cutting procedures very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is in his sixties and is of the age where his hair has thinned on top.  Now he can do his own buzz cut with the number two comb and it looks perfect.  He also used the number one comb on his beard and moustache area - both he wears close to his skin, neither is long.  Now he can cut his own hair any time he wants to and it only takes him about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WAHL is a great product -- built right, has every accessory necessary for any type of shaving/trimming/cutting, and the price is right.  Add this to the savings of not having to go to the barber shop and being able to trim your hair at your own personal convenience, and you have a win/win situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome little kit and one that we are glad that we purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use these clippers on my dog, it works well, I just wish the chord was a bit longer as I have to sit on the floor to shave my doggy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for the same price as a single grooming session at my self-service groom shop and they worked great. I also bought a can of coolant/lubricant because I knew I&#x27;d be cutting a lot of fur and would be leaving them on for long periods of time. They did a good job cutting the thick fur and didn&#x27;t bite or cause skin irritation. They did get bogged down a few times and stopped cutting (thus 4 stars instead of 5). I don&#x27;t know if these were specifically designed for just human hair, or if they should be able to be used on a dog. I had to remove the guard a few times to clean the trimming blades before they would begin cutting again. I still think they did a good enough job to receive 4 stars, especially for the price I paid ($17). I suspect I put them thru a much more difficult test than what an average haircut would.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was after.</li>
    <li> Pretty good pair of clippers. I can&#x27;t say they are better or worse than any other pair. I just know they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sharp as heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Mechanical switch is prone to arching. Fixed the tool once. Almost posted a nasty video, but the world doesn&#x27;t need more hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to have a paid discussion with the engineer that approved the mechanical on/off switch. There is a lack of surface area on contact patches, tolerance problems, and many other problems for a vibrating tool that operates at ~120v.</li>
    <li> The lever that adjusts the length of the cut slides as you cut. I have to duct tape it in place to ensure that it doesn&#x27;t get shorter as I go. Other than that, it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> Have bought Wahl products before and they don&#x27;t disappoint. Men love it.</li>
    <li> Pays for itself in 2 uses! It&#x27;s great, and is very durable.</li>
    <li> I got this so I could cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home. He has to get a haircut every week (thanks to the Army). Unfortunately for him, I&#x27;ve never cut men&#x27;s hair in my life, and I&#x27;m not that great at it. These clippers were a huge improvement from the last ones we had. So easy to use, and the color coding makes it simple to give him a hair cut that even his CO approves of.</li>
    <li> Quality is not that good better to buy a good one putting little bit more money.  For the price this is a good one.</li>
    <li> Worth the price but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> great value, works great.</li>
    <li> it works and has everything you need to start trimming. My fiancé trims me up between cuts to save a trip to the barber. She has no experience but it is easy to use and she had no problems making me look like I just got a fresh cut.</li>
    <li> worth it , very happy with purchase,nice and sharp,cuts close</li>
    <li> This clipper has very good power, the attachments work well, and the price is right. A slight complaint is that the case is non-fitted. It&#x27;s just a space, and the kit rattles around inside, assuming you can get it all crammed in there. Still, glad I got it.</li>
    <li> My son has very thick and frizzy hair- his style of choice is super short (clipper #2-4). These clippers are great for what I need and I don&#x27;t have to deal with going to a salon for such a basic cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I ordered this item, most of the guards were loose in the case and broken. Amazon replaced immediately and I am very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could give my husband hair cuts at home and this product does the job.  We have the pet clippers that I use on the dog and these are much quieter than those and don&#x27;t get hot when you are using them.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love Wahl. We don&#x27;t use any other kind of clippers. Great product and I especially love the colored combs.</li>
    <li> Great quality, easy to understand. Comes with tips and instructions and even blade oil so you can keep it in good shape. Will save you tons of $$!</li>
    <li> every thing i wanted...</li>
    <li> this buzzer works great for the price. powerful and clean cut. very pleased with this purchase. would reccomend this to anyone trying to get a cheap haircut</li>
    <li> cheaper then blades.  no sense in paying alot of money for a shaver when this works fine.  Please click the yes button if you liked this review, thanks</li>
    <li> For The price you can not beat it. It is really Sharp and cuts hair fast but can&#x27;t cut skin.</li>
    <li> Best what you can get for this price.</li>
    <li> it was worst purchase i&#x27;ve ever done. after 2 minutes it just blow up. don&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is product was made to perform, and it serves that purpose very well. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase one bit. Also I love the start up kit it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my son&#x27;t hair.  The guards are easy to clip off and on, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Like that the guards are color coded.  My husband says the bare blade doesn&#x27;t cut close enough for him.  The only downside is the weight.  It is definately heavier than others we&#x27;ve had, but it is also quieter, which is nice when I get close to my son&#x27;t ears.</li>
    <li> The clippers worked perfectly and are a great price. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these! I have used them for years and no problem at all!</li>
    <li> Excellent Wahl shaved for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy to use 2 haircuts has already paid for itself</li>
    <li> This set of clippers is an amazing value. From the time that I opened the box I was impressed. These clippers feel solid, extremely well built, and made of good quality materials. If you are looking for a pair of clippers, look no further. You will not be able to find a better value, and higher priced clippers won&#x27;t compare to the quality of this set.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect. Easy to use. Amazing performance.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. It did a great job.</li>
    <li> Very good trimmer for the price. Many guards in various lengths (including left and right ear guards) help you trim hair and beards at home. Powerful motor cuts through even very coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> We just received this the other day and have only used it once. We had the Wahl Peanut for 6 years and it finally died. I don&#x27;t think we took care of it properly, but we vow to do better this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is great. It comes with everything you would need, but it all just piles into the case. There isn&#x27;t a way to organize it - so beware when you open it up! Also, it&#x27;s really loud. Much louder than the peanut and it&#x27;s heavy! Those are the only 2 reasons I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars. Other than that, for $25 it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Just fantastic, no more Super Cuts, saving a TON of money!</li>
    <li> Good quality, good price.</li>
    <li> inside kit, u will see more products.....this is good product for this price range. i highly recommend this one for you.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace 30 year old clippers.  So far I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> I went by the reviews posted on Amazon and I was very excited to buy this clipper. However, I am not satisfied at all with what I got. The Clipper itself seems to be robust but the combs which came as attachment are of really cheap quality. I used only red comb so far and it broke in the first usage itself. I wish I can return it but the cost of shipping back is half the price of product itself.</li>
    <li> Since Im in the military I have to get my haircut, but barbers around my city are like $15-$20 per cut even a buzz. This was such a great investment I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Silence and powerful.  It&#x27;s a very good product. I had one the same and have 10 years and just need oil and done.</li>
    <li> It is wonderfull, durable complete set</li>
    <li> Only have used it 5-6 times so far.  ~30 minutes each time.  A span of ~6months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vastly superior to my buzzer purchased ~2 decades ago.</li>
    <li> The noise is quite loud, otherwise it seems OK.</li>
    <li> the clippers work well.  They were shipped on time and arrived on time.  seven more words: one two three four</li>
    <li> Does a good job cutting my dad&#x27;s hair, doesn&#x27;t hurt him like his last hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Everything fine until a month to use a strange noise came out and it still does, otherwise excellent!</li>
    <li> I got tired of spending $20 each month at the barber for a haircut. I bought this and with a little help from my wife, I was able to give myself a great cut today. Now, I will be able to trim whenever I want and save $$ each time. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> works to buzz my head</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...works as advertised.</li>
    <li> works well on my two boys. easy to use. the included comb is very soft though. Overall a good product for the money</li>
    <li> I like the color coded guides. Easier to find a color than hunt for a number on the guide. The clippers work well for the price. I use the clippers to &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; cut my sons&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> Does the job! I used it to cut my man&#x27;s hair and he loves it! Different length you can chose from. works great!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. I cut my husbands hair every week and this product has helped us so much</li>
    <li> Good value for the price. I know there are more expensive products with many more features. However, this trimmer set  has served our needs well.</li>
    <li> Our old clippers was going downhill so I decided to look on Amazon for a better quality clippers and something that also would fit our price point. First of all, you cannot go wrong with the Wahl brand. The color coding that this clippers has as well is super convenient and well thought out. I really enjoyed using these clippers and hope they hold up for a couple of years!</li>
    <li> 2 months or so and it works well so far</li>
    <li> These are some of the best clippers I have used, especially for the price. Very easy to use and the color coded guards make it easy to find the one you are looking for (there is even a handy color guide on the clippers). Very useful for buzz cuts and beard trimming.</li>
    <li> My son bought these to cut his own hair and he&#x27;s done a great job with them. I was skeptical, but impressed now!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these a whole lot yet but so far they get the job done and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use! It cuts hair beautifully. The only problem I&#x27;m having with it is I&#x27;m trying to cut my 2 year old son&#x27;s hair and the motor vibrates which tickles him, so he giggles and jerks his head to the side!</li>
    <li> I just rate the product at average score of it, since my review is not actually review. It is an information to whom who are planning to use it in 220V country. I thought I would use it with 220V to 110V converter but realized that it is not the solution. Without proper conversion 50Hz to 60Hz it is extremely loud and shaky. Just converting 220 to 110V is not sufficient. You would need 220V 50Hz to 110V 60Hz converter which costs at least 150 bucks.</li>
    <li> This is great, especially for home use.</li>
    <li> I have two different clippers from this company: one small for trim &amp; this one for cutting all types of hair.  They&#x27;re both great.  I especially like the different colors for each size, it makes them easier to sort.  They also work on cutting both thick hair and semi-thin hair.  This one also has a 1/2 size making closer cuts easier without using the straight blades or having to use the smaller clippers.  So far, they&#x27;re better quality than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> been using these clippers for about well I&#x27;ll round up  so 3 months they cut well I&#x27;ve never had them jam or tug at hair but I also have really fine hair. I would recommend these to anyone on a budget and needs a trim or does simple hairstyle haircuts.</li>
    <li> These clippers are awesome. I don&#x27;t really use the color guide at all I mainly got these for the price. If you&#x27;re debating on weather to get these or the wahl pro&#x27;s get these. They&#x27;re the same thing just without the chrome and with less attachments. If you take care of these clippers and clean and oil them after usage they will last you a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one...but half the time it&#x27;s too loud and it shocks me...</li>
    <li> Comfort was doable during long hours. Held up for approx few too many cuts. The only issue was the complete wreckage that happened to the blades for some unknown reason. Girls at my work, who had spent years in the industry, were stumped and we could not put this humpty back together. Tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for cuts at home. Unless your the mom and you have three kids or three clients.</li>
    <li> This is a great, great product!  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  I cut my own hair with the color coded templates and it comes out no worse than supercuts or greatclips.  It pays for itself if you use it once.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. Cuts hair well. A lot of accessories that are needed. Was recommended by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one con: Is not a complete clipper / trimmer set.</li>
    <li> No complaints so far, though I&#x27;ve only had a for a few months and have only performed 2 haircuts on myself. But results have been impressive and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my haircuts (with even more compliments when people find out I did it myself). Sturdy, well-made, and the color comb guides and instructions are great for remembering your preferred lengths and proper trimming techniques. One minor caveat: I could have used the #1-1/2 (3/16&amp;#34; burgundy) comb, and it wasn&#x27;t included in this kit even though it&#x27;s pictured in the manual (though there is a disclaimer stating that not all combs are included. But still, would it have killed them to include another comb?). They do sell that comb separately, though I couldn&#x27;t find it on their website and I only found it by googling, &amp;#34;Wahl 3/16&amp;#34; burgundy comb&amp;#34;. But no biggie and overall, a great, inexpensive, solid product that will hopefully last for years to come.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too loud, horrible sound. I can&#x27;t shave. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this only half year, now it&#x27;s broken. I would give zero star if I can.</li>
    <li> No more paying for haircuts!</li>
    <li> Everything was good, fast shipping,  but when I used dint cut well,  it has a whier sound, also don&#x27;t have the power that the seller mention,  I used to have one,  the same brand and the same model and it worked  perfect but this one doesn&#x27;t have the same power wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a great piece for non-professional too. I used to cut my hair myself. I have this for last 1 year and no complaints till now. You feel the vibration on your palm when machine is on. I am taking away one star for that reason.</li>
    <li> Hefty construction. Color-coded attachments make using it for cutting hair fool proof. It works like a professional hair clipper. But don&#x27;t use it for close shaving for it will draw blood.</li>
    <li> working very good...first time used..it was easy to use,all are included to cut hair and perfect work done, very good product.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. Used it twice in the last couple of weeks and really loved it.GO ahead and but it...</li>
    <li> Gave my 3 little grandsons haircuts right after I received it. Will get better with practice but overall worked great! Only used 2 of the comb sizes so far but looking forward to experimenting with the others. Luckily they&#x27;re young enough to let me try new things!</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times so far with no problems.I would recommend this set of clippers to someone else.</li>
    <li> Very good entry level hair cutting kit. I recently decided to cut my own hair to save a few dollars every 5 weeks or so. Since I have the \\&quot;high forehead\\&quot; hairline and growing bald spot I decided to keep my hair very short but not shaven.  These clippers work very well and are an excellent choice for the price.</li>
    <li> From the moment I plugged the WAHL Color Pro in, I knew it was the perfect choice for me!  It hums and cuts hair very precisely. The attachments are color coded and snap on and off nicely. Great item. Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> more heavy than i wish  and it looks like  very good ,but i&#x27;m not try this tings and i expect it will be great</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers because I was tired of paying so much for haircuts.  I did my husband and sons hair and both turned out excellent!  The instructions are easy to follow and include color pictures. The guide combs snap on and off easily. The clippers themselves feel very well made and I think they will last a long time.  I like the 5 year warrenty and I just found out if you purchase between 1/1/11 and 1/30/12 you can get a $5 mail in rebate, just search \\&quot;rebates\\&quot; on wahl&#x27;s website to print the form.  Happy clipping!    [...]</li>
    <li> WE DID REALLY NEED ONE OF THESE.  OUR OLD ONE STOPPED WORKING AND WE LOOKED FOR ANOTHER ON THAT WAS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE AND YET WOULD DO THE JOB.  WHEN WE SEEN THIS ONE,  WE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS PERFECT.  NOT EXPENSIVE WITH A GOOD BRAND NAME.  WE BOUGHT IT.  NOW WE HAVE USED IT ONE TIME AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY.  WE THINK IT WILL FILL THE BILL FOR  MANY YEARS TO COME.  THANKS</li>
    <li> Was a gift to my son-in-law. He will use it to cut my husbands hair. Good product and colors help</li>
    <li> I DID NOT RECEIVE THE \\&quot;No.1 - 1/8\\&quot; (3mm) - red clipper guard\\&quot; with my product. This item is needed when cutting hair short. And was advertised with product, BUT NOT RECEIVED. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Got this to use on the dog because it was cheap and the other reviewes said it was sturdy, it worked great it was not too loud and it was really easy to use. The guards made it so that even with the skirming he did not get cut.  The unit it a little heavy but now my boyfriend uses it weekly to shave his head and the guards don&#x27;t move which he loves because it is easier to shave the back without asking for help. The only thing that would make it better would be to have it be cordless.</li>
    <li> Never used it, looks like a nice enough unit.  I&#x27;m went with a Wahl cordless and I&#x27;m giving this as a gift.</li>
    <li> not yest used but it is really good looking and for the good price!!!!!! and this is a amazing buzzer it you use it after 12345678days</li>
    <li> I purchase this because I have always like Wahl products especially in haircutting kits. When I used the item for the first time it was very loud even after adjust the settings and adding oil. I returned the item and received a replacement but still was having the same issue. Really disappointed with this item.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have owned it for over a month with approximately four uses.i use this for my own personal use and it&#x27;s very quiet!</li>
    <li> Very good. I have used it twice. It is fantastic. If you really want some hair cutter that is cheap and useful, this is a good choice</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This cutter is a good base line hair cutter.  If you are just learning to cut hair you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The next time around I will buy the upgraded model.</li>
    <li> This clipper set is great for the price. It does the job and comes with a standard set of guards. I used these clippers at Burning Man to cut hair in the desert, and they held up very well even in dry, dusty conditions, so they will probably last a long time in your home. Given the price, no complaints whatsoever. They probably are louder and heavier than more expensive models, but if you just want to shave your head then this is a great option.</li>
    <li> Great value and it worked flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;With the supplied attachments I have everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;And all for just about the price of one haircut</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought over 3 different hair clippers in the past 4 months and all of them have died within weeks. I bought this after seeing all the good reviews and I am glad I did! It shaved my head in less than 10 minutes. Very high quality!</li>
    <li> I got this for my poodle. I hate spending $40 a month getting her groomed, so I decided to do it myself. Dog shavers are soooo expensive. At LEAST $40, and more likely over $100. This shaver works wonderfully. I love all the little bits and how it plugs in. I hate cordless. GRRR. I&#x27;m not a man, so I haven&#x27;t had many bad experiences with shavers, but this works remarkably well for me. Much better than the dog shavers I&#x27;ve had before. Also, it&#x27;s pretty quiet and didn&#x27;t snag her hair once.</li>
    <li> We have years of experience using hair clippers in our household. We just bought this locally to replace a lithium cordless Wahl that died in 10 months after only 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl color pro looked fine but when my wife trimmed my neck we found out the hard way that the metal blade guard was screwed on slightly crooked and one side of the blades teeth were exposed to saw into my skin.  I had high hopes for this with all the positive reviews but this one is dangerous. I am going to go with a different brand after owning two defective Wahl products.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers less than two months ago to replace my old Conair clippers that I left behind while traveling. I use my clippers exclusively for beard trimming. After no more than five or six uses the blades got misaligned, causing an extremely loud buzzing and painful pulling of my beard. I whacked it back into place the first few times it did it, but now that doesn&#x27;t even work. Extremely disappointing and a waste of money. I never should have left the Conair brand.</li>
    <li> I like the color coding of the clipper attachments. On my old set I always had to get glasses to find out the right size. It is very quiet and has no problem cutting through hair or beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a beard trimmer because I was tired of all the cordless ones crapping out on me after a while. It comes with everything I need, and a lot more. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and its effortless and easy to use! No issues yet!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I typically just shave my head every time I need a hair cut and occasionally do touch ups around the back of my neck.  This razor works great and has saved me tons of money I would have spent at a barber shop. Also great for whenever any of my pals need a shape-up.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Other than it not being wireless, this thing is a beast. Functions perfect. Nice accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few years ago.. and I have to admit we really didn&#x27;t take care of it at all.. but I&#x27;m still getting pretty decent haircuts from it.. I had a son 10 years ago and he became my guinne pig.. then my husband  I am improving thanks to wonderful how to&#x27;s on line.. I even used it to cut my dog&#x27;s fur, and my husband would not allow me to get a replacement pair.. so he took it apart and we sat it in alchohol... I cut his hair and all was good.. However I did just get a new set.. same thing.. I just don&#x27;t want to do my son&#x27;s hair with the dog clippers hahaha... I am waiting to use these new ones with all the parts that we had once lost along the way.. :-D&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money, HOWEVER I got mine from the store that starts with a T and they charged me 24.99 and even online from that store it&#x27;s 21.99  Something seems amiss</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get much better than this for the price.  I have used them about 5 times now, and they work great.  I wish it came with a brush to clean the hair off the clippers and guards though.  All in all, great product and made in America!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband as a gift and was recommended by by brother so gave it a try, good product for a good price</li>
    <li> Words really well, the color coating for the different cut lengths is super helpful. I have always cut my son and husbands hair so this works well for home use.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband and he loves it! it is sturdy and the color coding helps plus is a great price</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.I works extremely well and I received more items than was shown.Just the case it comes in alone makes it worth the price</li>
    <li> used this straight out of the box, went on you tube, watched how to give a mans haircut, I&#x27;m pretty artistic already but so easy to use. my son said it was a great cut.</li>
    <li> I am currently using these to cut my hair in Afghanistan. Two mirrors and you are in good shape. Wahl dummy proofs the clippers by making everything color coded.  Go out youtube, watch someone cut there hair, buy these and save a ton of money!</li>
    <li> This clipper satisfied in every way. I have no complaints. I wish everything worked as well. Four and one more words.</li>
    <li> More than my expectations Did all I wanted and more and is very easy to use. A very good performer.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Wahl brand clippers that I had for 20 yrs. I like that this one includes a 1/4 inch attachment. Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and it works great and comes with colorful comb attachments.</li>
    <li> Cut well for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Noisy but worth the price, works perfectly alright.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these a couple times and they are amazing. A must buy!!</li>
    <li> Got it and cut my nephew&#x27;s hair that day...it&#x27;s was a simple cut but he liked it and I&#x27;m happy with it as well So it does the job</li>
    <li> Good set of clippers for the right price.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 4 years now without a problem! Can&#x27;t say that about a lot of things.</li>
    <li> first I had to buy an adapter as it comes with an American plug even though it was shipped to Australia.  I blew up the first time used lucky my husband wasn&#x27;t injured.  It is extremely noisy and the taper lever does not stay in the up position. NOT HAPPY AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought numerous $20-$30 hair clippers from various stores over the years and have always been disappointed with how poorly they cute, and the short lifespan. After buying this razor, I will never buy another again. The clippers cut very well and eliminate long times to cut hair. A+++</li>
    <li> Provides a nice clean cut.</li>
    <li> I am not a barber but I do cut my own hair as well as my friends&#x27; hair, and have had cheaper clippers which have been lost or broken, or thrown away in frustration over poor quality.  I have seen reviews here stating that these Wahl clippers suffer from a variety of quality related defects.  In my case it is just the opposite.  No, I don&#x27;t work for Wahls or know anyone who does, to make that clear, I&#x27;m just offering my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pair of clippers I got are very nice.  I never use scissors, only clippers like these.  I have bought clippers five times before, these Wahls are either the nicest or are tied for it.  The Wahls website includes video instruction which are clear, short and simple.  Once you have the confidence, cutting hair is a simple task, made nearly idiot proof and so cheap as to boggle the mind.  I&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars personally, and thousands if friends and family are included over time.  At $15 a cut, 12 cuts per year, it&#x27;s $180 a year per person, call it near $10,000 over a lifetime.  That&#x27;s a lot of hair.  Owning clippers makes this as easy as picking money up off the ground.  Would you bend over and pick up $10,000?  Then reach down and click your mouse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very well made clippers.  They are heavy and feel solid in the hand.  They are quite obviously designed for serious use.  They feel warm and solid in my hand, humming away with a low, steady tone.  A great feature in these clippers is the POWER screw in the side.  People who complain about the noise either haven&#x27;t ever used clippers or have a defective set or (probably) don&#x27;t realize that this screw is there to address the issue of a poor or low current to the unit.  Low power current results in a louder than expected buzzing sound.  The screw is adjusted with a Phillips head and results in a quieter unit that is more efficient.  It is an adjustment only found in high quality clippers, as it adds to the cost of making the clippers.  The clipper housing is heavy gauge extruded plastic which can absorb the occasional drop, smack and fumble.  I&#x27;ve mentioned owning clippers before.  Common problems are a cheap, plasticky feel, lack of heft so it feels like you are holding a squirt gun not a tool, and poor or dull cutting teeth which can rip or tear hair not cut it cleanly.  Cheap clippers also break over time.  None of these problems afflict my Wahl clippers, though I see complaints about them elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes in a clamshell plastic box which contains a color coded set of guides, which is very nice as the guides are commonly all black.  They identify length by number, #1 being shortest at 1/8th of an inch, #8 longest at an inch.  Ear guides are handy and clearly labeled for left and right ears.  Oddly, eyebrow guides are included, for the hobbits among us.  The colored guides are a handy system that prevents confusion.  The color key is added to the clipper body so you can glance at your hand to see both the color of the clipper guide on the unit and the length the color printed on the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set includes cleaning brush, comb, clippers, guides, oil (nice touch as a small amount prevents an additional purchase until it runs out) and scissors all held together in a clamshell plastic box with clips to hold it securely shut.  The box  has enough room to hold everything and not get frustrated trying to cram it all in.  It would benefit a lot from the addition of a single item, a cape to prevent hair from getting all over your clothes.  If this was included I would have given 5 stars as it would represent that thoughtful addition that demonstrates the manufacturer provides not just what is required but offers the consideration that goes that extra distance which separates a good value from the perfect purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you in your decision.housing is heavy gauge extruded plastic which can absorb the occasional drop, smack and fumble.

    <li> bought these because older set broke. works great. love the color coded guards and carrying case. helps keep everything organized.</li>
    <li> For less than the price of a singular hair cut, I can now have my hair cut for life! My wife now cuts my hair, and does an impeccable job of it. The clippers are much better than the others we used to have, which broke. They are quiet, powerful, and cut as smooth as silk. Seriously, not one snag the entire time. I have thick hair that grows with a mind of it&#x27;s own and usually get multiple pulls and snags, but not with these. Love the carrying case to keep everything organized. Ad definitely love the corded ones, as our last pair that were cordless didn&#x27;t have the same power as these, and the cut wasn&#x27;t as consistent. If the cord it too short, get and extension cord!</li>
    <li> These are excellent clippers. If you are one of those people that believes weight is a sign of quality, then these are for you. They are not uncomfortably heavy by any means, but do have more weight than other clippers I have used before. The design fits very comfortably in your hand. They run very quietly and do not seem to get hot like other clippers do. I saw complaints in the reviews that the guard sizes were hard to read; they are not. You can see the guard size very easily, and just in case you cant, they are color coded. Each guard is a different color and on the clippers it has the size/color guide. I use them to shave my head and they cut nice and short. I also use them to trim my beard and they have never pulled the hair. They came very sharp and I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Good clippers for the occasional upkeep. They get hot after about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li> Very good for the money.  I wish the cord was a little longer.</li>
    <li> This was everything I had hoped for. I read earlier reviews and it performs great. I would highly recommend this product. Can&#x27;t beat it for the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my boys heads and it is great. It is easy to use and is very durable. One of my best buys for saving money.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money and far less expensive than in the store. Would highly recommend. Very quiet and does the job and does it well.</li>
    <li> We use to have a cordless set of Wahl clippers that I purchased at the store and they just would not keep their charge... Decided to purchase these and I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how bummed I am that this happened. I was very confident in purchasing this hair cutting kit for my boyfriend because of all the 5 star ratings, not to mention the esteemed \\&quot;Wahl\\&quot; branding, but I have to say that this just doesn&#x27;t hold up. We were so pleased with the cut when we used it the first time and were happy with the product...until a month later. We reached for the Wahl kit, stored under the sink, only to find it completely rusted out and unusable. Before you say \\&quot;it was probably too damp,\\&quot; I will tell you that under our bathroom sink is very dry, and it was only there for storage for about 2 weeks (was in the closet before with his things). Maybe the metal they use is just cheap stuff because it oxidized quickly. Just a fair warning because the return policy only lasts for a month...and thats really how often a man needs a haircut. I just advise purchasing with caution. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;Strong motor, blades are sharp, and cuts well. The case holds the trimmer and attachments. The color coding is nice and does help find the attachment you are looking for. Cord is good average length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The plastic case of the trimmer has little peices that over hang where the body is put together. The switch (on/off) is small and feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am happy. You can see they had to cut some corners to get into this price point but the cuts are on items that are minor to me as long as it holds up longterm.</li>
    <li> Good quailty product,  will be using it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my head, cheast, beard and man parts. Works great, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, especially on my face or man parts.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. A bit heavy but they do the job just right!</li>
    <li> Better than most home cutters</li>
    <li> I own a Wahl haircutter from 16 years ago and it still cuts better than this brand new one. This company makes junk now.</li>
    <li> Got these clippers a few years ago but never wrote a review. Well, they are great clippers, my husband has given my son numerous fades and buzz cuts with these clippers, always looked good. Make sure you buy the Wahl oil too. Priced lower than stores. Very good quality!</li>
    <li> great clippers came with a lot of different sizes and great price too</li>
    <li> I used these to cut my husband&#x27;s hair last night and they worked great. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> This hair kit has worked perfectly for my husband. Has saved us money from the barber that he would go to twice a month! Great kit!</li>
    <li> for the price it&#x27;s great. A rare pull on my hair and it gets a little hot after extended use, but it works pretty darn well, and you can&#x27;t do much better for the price.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  The local store had it for a higher price, so I thought I would purchase it on Amazon.  Very loud compared to my other Wahl.  I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  The best thing about it, is the colored guide combs.  I figure if I use it at least once, I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth, since haircuts are so expensive!</li>
    <li> Cut your hair by number. Very easy, works well.</li>
    <li> Just got these today they were long overdue/hard to find the blue ones @ a decent price these days....&lt;br /&gt;I use them to bald myself and for my goatee/Believe it or not the last ones of this make and model lasted every bit of 6 years/as a daily driver!!&lt;br /&gt;Got the closest cut on these I&#x27;ve had in a long time!! Just like I remember them/but better improved button for on/off!! Thanks amazon!!</li>
    <li> Broke after 4 uses.  The tip is slightly too sharp that cuts my child&#x27;s ear when he wiggled around.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s quiet!</li>
    <li> Use it a lot! Works great! It has paid for itself many times over!</li>
    <li> My barber retired so the Wahl 79300-400 color pro replaced him.  Works great with all the different attachments.  Although there might be to many for my needs and thinning hair.  This is a good quality clipper and feels good in your hand.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the easy to use Wahl color guide set!  It has been my clipper of choice for many years now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use it. And it&#x27;s easy to use. It looks exactly like in the salon. You can buzz your hair perfectly. You can chose to cut your hair at any length.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a wonderful price. Been using it over a month now on a family of five, yet to see any flaw or downside to this product. Came with all the</li>
    <li> These clippers have been used by myself and my son to cut each others hair as well as my grandsons. My grandson is very sensitive to pain and had no issues with these snagging or pinching. They&#x27;ve already paid for themselves several times over. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Really cool haircutting kit!</li>
    <li> For the money it works</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it is impossible for me to review this item as the voltage is not compatible within New Zealand unless used with a transformer. This is a huge disappointment as there is nothing on the product description or information page about the exact voltage of the Wahl razor and I had to find out the hard way once I received the product. Wahl does indeed make great hair cutting products but this missing crucial information sorely needs to be fixed.</li>
    <li> after the experience I would have obtained at a low price, The clipper is quiet and works well. It gives the impression of a lot of power in reserve, and doesn&#x27;t heat up in the hand. I was pleasantly surprised by the left and right angled guide combs used for the ears, which are included in the kit. They made that part of the haircut really easy,excellent item.</li>
    <li> Great product and good shipping time.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gives a great cut. It has already paid for itself over and over just from the money I save by cutting my husbands and son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Has given several haircuts now with no issues whatsoever. Really liked the instructions it came with and all the attachments. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Tired of paying $20 plus for crew cuts for my son.  Offered to pay him $5 if he would let me cut it.  This is simple to use with clear instructions.  He is happy, I&#x27;m happy.  This payed for itself very quickly.</li>
    <li> I am a student and I bought it for saving time with finding a barber&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday my roommate and I used it and it was very easy to use. You just need to change the attachment.&lt;br /&gt;Everything goes well and it is cheaper than other haircutting kit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for the past 7 years with an older Wahl home clipper set that has worked exceptionally well, but as I&#x27;m now working overseas I wanted to have another set I could take with me and the price of this kit was too good to pass up. I was pleased with the overall construction and similar heft to our older model, and it seemed fine the first time I used it. The next time I needed to cut my hair I was overseas, and what had been a normal low buzz the first time had become a painfully loud racket - seriously loud enough to cause hearing damage over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered through that clip and stashed the kit until I came back home for a while and brought it along with me, thinking maybe the noise had something to do with needing to use a step-down voltage converter overseas. When I used it at home, though, it was still just as loud. Taking apart the blade assembly, I was able to ascertain that the noise had to do with the bar that&#x27;s supposed to lock into the movable part of the blade. The part that locks into the blade is plastic and appears to be poorly constructed, such that it doesn&#x27;t seat very well, resulting in a sort of rattle. Initially, I was able to push down on the blade and get it to stop for a while, but now that I&#x27;m back overseas again, I can&#x27;t even get that to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I do think that it clips well otherwise, and I do like the assortment of attachments that come along with the kit. I would like to rate this product higher, but I will not use it again. I need my hearing for my work, and I&#x27;m not willing to risk damaging that. I&#x27;m in the market now for other, more reliable, options.</li>
    <li> For afros (Black American) hair did not work. It would get stuck and then nick the person&#x27;s scalp. Yes, the hair was combed thru first.&lt;br /&gt;Even with attachments it did not cut smoothly at all. I&#x27;ve had better luck with clippers from the local store then with this certain style. Wahl is a good brand, just not this style.</li>
    <li> Great product! My husband use to trim the beard and my son uses to cut their hair . One product for various functions .</li>
    <li> Shipment was quick and clippers work awesome I use to spend $20 a month at sport clips for a simple haircut. Now I cut it my self and I&#x27;m not skilled at all but everyone thinks I get it done professionally.</li>
    <li> 2nd pair I&#x27;ve owned that had a power switch break mysteriously. Last time the thing worked for a few years. This time it broke after a single use. The power switch stops being able to switch to the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position.</li>
    <li> This clipper is one of the best I have purchased in a long time!  Easy to use for those quick trims without having to head out to the barbershop!</li>
    <li> We use these clippers to cut my toddler son&#x27;s hair. They&#x27;re efficient, easy to use, and were a great deal. For the price of one haircut, I bought this set and am sure it will last for years. My husband has this same clipper and it&#x27;s been going strong for three years now.</li>
    <li> not for 220v and this is not in description!</li>
    <li> Awesome clipper set. Love the color coded attachments. Makes it quick and easy to switch out for the needed length. Good power. No hair pulling either.</li>
    <li> This this is awesome for the price! Had one from walmart that probably cost about the same and it was garbage. Always getting too much hair stuck in it and not able to cut through. This thing goes through everything with no problems!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  My wife cuts my hair now and we are saving so much! I&#x27;m done with paying moody barbers and tipping them.</li>
    <li> exactly what I thought I was getting...</li>
    <li> it is a very nice product</li>
    <li> absolutely love this clipper and use it all the time for my head and my face. i cut my own hair and this one time investment saves me tons of money going to a barber for no reason when i only do a basic buzz and touch up with a razor after. also this is perfect for beard trimming to a level low enough to again touch up with a razor and you&#x27;re good to go. for the man who doesn&#x27;t need to look as good as a girl this is perfect to keep you clean and do it fast. this works like a breeze, keep it clean it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is great for the money.  I read tons of reviews on this before selecting this model.  Works great.  Had low expectations due to the price but it has exceeded my expectations.  I also like the colors for the different guards.</li>
    <li> This is my second one since I dropped the first one and ruined it.  I love it, paid only $16. and I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and my sons as well.  Saves us $20. each time and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saving a lot of money using these clippers instead of paying for someone to clip my hair for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, heavy and solid construction.&lt;br /&gt;Feels solid in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;The many different guide combs are very convenient and useful.</li>
    <li> Got this set as a replacement for my cheapie Conair clippers that broke. So much better than my old one. Comes with lots of attachments. The case was broken when it arrived though.</li>
    <li> Decided to keep a beard and got this to help maintain and groom it. Works like a charm! My roommate even uses it to cut his hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. Who could ask for more?</li>
    <li> Not the greatest trimmer but it gets the job done. Takes several passes to get all the hairs and it is not very precise.</li>
    <li> Cuts great for an inexpensive set.Lots of attachments and color coded as well. What more can I say, it&#x27;s a Wahl!</li>
    <li> VERY LIGHT WEIGHT EASY TO USE EVEN FOR ME WHOM HAS SMALL HANDS</li>
    <li> Excellent hair clippers come in a plastic case with all the combs and oil needed feels heavy but in a well built way cuts hair very good + ITS MADE IN THE USA I highly recommend if you are wanting to get these hair clippers to get them you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Great product, good packaging, and very reliable. I have been using it for a few months and have no problems!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different versions of Wahl clippers and so far after using the item 2 times it has done a great job. Seems to be better quality for the price.</li>
    <li> My hubby actually trust me to cut his hair, I can&#x27;t believe it. Lol I found this to be a great price and good quality too. The informational pamphlet left much to be desired. However, after watching a few YouTube videos on how to cut hair and a few trial runs, I have mastered it! No more expensive barber shop hair cuts for us anymore</li>
    <li> I wanted to save money on my haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;I have already used this for two haircuts, and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;Since my barber used to take $16 each visit, this also means that this tool has already saved me more money that it was bought for. And I see no signs of it breaking down or anything anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Yes great as always.  thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and very good quality!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, Many attachments, all color coded to fix length of hair.  Gives a good haircut with little effort.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use on my dog and so far it works very well. Bets paying more for his grooming than I pay for my hair!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this at an unreal price on Amazon and love it.  It works.  It&#x27;s high quality.  You could have told me it was a $40 clipper and I would have believed it with no hesitation.  Wish the cut was a little lower originally but at the same time I love how easy it is on your skin/hair - no pulling, no cuts.</li>
    <li> great product for the money.</li>
    <li> My husband was not sure he would like this, but the other guys at work use it so we decided to try it. Success and handsomer than ever!</li>
    <li> For the price you simply can&#x27;t beat it.  Works perfect and includes a wide range of trim options along with instructions.  The carrying case could be better (organize the various pieces instead of loosely holding everything), but for less than $20 it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker.</li>
    <li> The largest comb sizes is missing. There are combs only from 1 to 7. 8 and 9 are not in the pack. I want long hair and thus need those comb sizes.</li>
    <li> Looking for a pair of inexpensive clippers I could use to cut my already short hair. Perfect solution for me-saves money going to barbershop.</li>
    <li> Now I can cut my own hair without having to explain to someone what I want, and it being their version of what I said. Works great.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. I love that the clipper size attachments are different color and it easily fits in it&#x27;s case. The ear guard doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well though but it&#x27;s not essential.</li>
    <li> Its a nice product, I cut my husbands and brothers hair both curly and straight hair.  curly hair does really well. my husbands hair is straight and takes more strokes with the buzzer. glad i got the product.</li>
    <li> Excellently packaged and well organized. This product is be used regularly.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers + Wahl Blade Oil Professional Blade Maintenance &#x3D; Haircut Ready Tools.</li>
    <li> It has worked as advertised. It does not seem to cut as well after the first time.  I have only used it twice</li>
    <li> For the price it is a great trimmer. I use it mostly for shaping up my goatee. I will try to convince my son to give him a haircut.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the ultra fine short cut setting like my other one did.  I could have sent it back but I&#x27;ve learned to live with it.</li>
    <li> Not very durable, work but parts sound like they tend to come loose and makes a loud noise at times when the parts shift.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. It will pay itself off vs. paying $10 for a haircut. Close cut. Once blade is dull just toss it and buy new again.</li>
    <li> great this has saved me tons on haircuts</li>
    <li> I did not get the clippers as promised so I will like to get a refund since I can not get anything for time wasted.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a really cheapo Wahl that I got at walmart or something years ago. I have not been to a barber in years now, but I needed a replacement and this is constructed VERY well and works great. Minimal vibration, cuts very close.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers ~ Fast Shipping :)</li>
    <li> I have a better set but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for great price</li>
    <li> I used to spend 20$ a haircut now my girlfriend does it for me for nothing except maybe a back massage! very well made seems durable love that its USA product</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Works well, lots of attachments, fits neatly into the case when done with it.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the one I bought last year at TJ Maxx. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Saving money on hair-cuts now. Best investment I have made. This is better than other brands that I have tried. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> A very good razor, the color coding is nice, although probably not necessary since the lengths are posted on them as well, but still good to have. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was sometimes the razor will make a nasty grinding noise when started, but all I have to do is flip the on switch and try again. Still scared the s*** outta the person I was using it on, and myself...</li>
    <li> This is substatial machine, it&#x27;s got some weight to it, and is well worth the money. People were surprised it was so cheap! Works great and comes with scissors, a comb, extensions, and a carrying case.</li>
    <li> Went through five Wahls in forty years. Been cutting my own hair since I was in the military. Each one seems not to last as long as the previous one. Never had the motor quit but the blades get dull. I oil them every other time I use them. There might be a way of sharpening the blades but at the price of these I will just buy another.</li>
    <li> It takes me 5 minutes to shave my head and beard with these. If you&#x27;re looking for the crew cut, this is quick and easy. Works with ALL type of hair. Black, white, and everything in between.</li>
    <li> We have used this several times now.  It is powerful and seems very sturdy, much less cheaply made than the last one we bought for double the price!</li>
    <li> What more to say, great product. Cuts hair really nice and even, comes with all attachments. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting hair! I had one before and really liked it so I ordered another one to take it&#x27;s place!</li>
    <li> I have used it twice so far and it looks like it is a good product. I hope it lasts long. I am happy for what it is and for the price I got it.</li>
    <li> These are SOOOOO worth the money.  Love the case they are in and how well they work.  Very easy to use.  LOVE THEM!!!</li>
    <li> works pretty well for that price, what i don&#x27;t like it is kinda heavy and uncomfortable if you need bold head and you do this by your self.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, great price and shipping. Attachments made the purchase well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to those in need of a good clipper</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to replace a Wahl &amp;#34;Designer&amp;#34; which developed a problem after about 10 years of home haircutting and would have cost more to fix than this kit cost as a replacement.</li>
    <li> The tool and guides are well made and work well.  My only gripe is the case.  Everything just sits in an open space so all the guides move around and it can get messy and unorganized very easily.</li>
    <li> This a good product.  The clippers have only been used for 2 haircuts, but they feel nice in hand.  Good weight, the quality seems good and its easy to use.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that they don&#x27;t have all the useful blade guards.  I want a 1 blade guard!  not 1/16 and #3!  So basically what I don&#x27;t like about the product is that the guards were sufficient.  Other than that it works great, everything else it comes with is solid.  Best of all THE LID CLOSES without having to play Tetris with the contents.</li>
    <li> pro:&lt;br /&gt;- great clipper for the price&lt;br /&gt;- feel professional made for home use&lt;br /&gt;- many different sizes guard to choose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con:&lt;br /&gt;- they should make the power cord longer since there is not always a plug near the mirror.</li>
    <li> Basically a generic clipper. I use it on my dog and not on my my personal head. A god buy considering...</li>
    <li> I AND MY ROOMMATE USED THEM FOR A YEAR WHEN DEPLOYED AND THEY PAID FOR THEMSELVES MULTIPLE TIMES AND STILL GOING!</li>
    <li> My parents have had another Wahl shaver for some time that I&#x27;d borrow to shave our dog.  This does not work well for this and I cannot get a clean shave on her.</li>
    <li> Dont buy this piece of junk. I either got a lemon or its junk. Pulls your hair more than cuts it. The blades must be totally dull. I had to go back to the one Ive had 10 years which cuts much better. I was shocked how bad it was.</li>
    <li> I read many good reviews on this clippers, so I was hopeful that something nice could be bought for a bargain price.  I was disappointed.  I had to replace a unit that we&#x27;d been using for 15 years, which had finally given up the ghost.  This Wahl was much noisier, it grabbed and pulled my son&#x27;s hair rather than cutting it (hair was 1\\&quot;, and I was trying to cut to 1/4\\&quot;), and I had to go over the same are multiple times - still leaving uncut hair.  I ended up finishing the haircut with a battery-powered personal groomer that I had.  This one is going back.</li>
    <li> works great, we are still using this today and purchases close to a year ago. i would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> As a cheap college student, I didn&#x27;t want to pay 20 bucks to get a haircut so I decided to buy a clipper and have my friend buzz it. My hair was below my ears and it didn&#x27;t stop once, and honestly if it works again it&#x27;ll have paid for itself.</li>
    <li> I am an Andis user and for some reason wanted to try another brand and decided to try Whal. I must say that I was really disappointed with this purchase.  It is very noisy for one thing and adjusting it doesn&#x27;t help. I don&#x27;t find it all that powerful. I managed to give my son a haircut but it took much longer than usual as I have to go over the same area on his head a lot more than I did with my andis hairclipper. I will stick to Andis from now on</li>
    <li> I received these and used them immediately to buy my hair. I cut with a #1 guard. Unfortunately, my #1 guard came with a few broken teeth. It still works great with a few broken teeth and I didn&#x27;t ask amazon to replace it as I&#x27;m sure they would. Still, that is the difference between 4 and 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have recently been through several hair cutting systems available locally and none have lasted more than a few months or had enough power to so they get the job done and don&#x27;t take forever.  This is a very nice system with lots of guards and it&#x27;s VERY quiet despite it&#x27;s power.  It has no problem buzzing off LOTS of hair in one pass.  I read other reviews where it&#x27;s still going strong after 4 years.  I feel like if it only lasts a year for me, I will probably just buy another one.  Great machine at a great price!</li>
    <li> First of all, this is not a close shaver but you can use this for trimming facial hair if careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the price I paid for this and the quality is also wonderful.  The unit will heat up a bunch if you have it on a long time so just be reasonable with it.  That is the first &#x27;problem&#x27; with it...but its a no-brainer.  If it starts getting too hot for comfort...just turn it off a little while and wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second &#x27;negative&#x27; with the unit is that the various attachments for helping you cut to specific lengths are made out of what I consider to be cheesy low quality plastic.  Regardless the whole package (for the price) is an AMAZING value and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a little practice you can learn to cut your own hair and this will quickly pay for itself many times over.  Going to a barber or stylist is a waste of your money.</li>
    <li> I trim my beard with this.  For the price it works great, much better than a dedicated beard trimmer which makes no sense, but it is.</li>
    <li> Works great, comes with a very complete set for any kind of &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; that needs to be tackled. Noise is annoying, but seriously, who cares?</li>
    <li> My husband has been through three other trimmers before this one. The materials are sturdy and it seems to be well made. It looks to be plastic and light in the picture. But it is actually a heavy solid metal material. well made, works well, we love it. This thing will be in our family for years.</li>
    <li> If you take the time to read the instructions, you will be able to give someone a good haircut.  It has taken me three times and I am finally good at it.  Great quality tool.</li>
    <li> this is a great buy especially for the price I brought these to cut my sons hair and it works wonders we are happy@</li>
    <li> It works good but the kit is too heavy..prefer a light weight product rather than this heavy kit.I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this so my girlfriend could cut my hair for me and save us some money. Works like a charm. Comes with a little &amp;#34;guide to cutting hair&amp;#34; with basic mens cuts that I hold up for my lovely lady to see as she cuts my hair.&lt;br /&gt; The case keeps everything all in order and comes with everything needed to clean it. Great little purchase in my opinion. Even if it fails now, it&#x27;s saved me money already on hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Purchased this so I could cut my husband&#x27;s hair without it looking like a 2 year old did it. The clippers are powerful, cut cleanly and the guards that come with the kit offer many options. The directions were clear and the color coding is helpful. You have to take it slow at first if you have hair that is quite long or you may get some pulling.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great am glad I purchased them</li>
    <li> The other review about taking this Wahl to war and crush walnuts is true! I&#x27;ve used this every other week for about 6 months now. Much sturdier than other phillips wireless models I&#x27;ve owned, but the drawback is I have to be plugged in to the wall. I do my own hair, and the depth adjuster doesn&#x27;t have a lock on in. So I&#x27;d recommend keeping the guard all the way down, then no surprise lengths happen. Also, remember to oil the blades. I missed it on early trim, and a bit of rust from my post-clean up happened. Discoloration- no noticeable difference, but still- remember to oil.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband for me to cut his hair being that he cuts his hair so super short that it would make no sense to go to a barber when i can do it at home... this one is heavy and does not get close enough to his head and it also skips a bunch of hair which makes it harder to see uncut hairs. I would not reccommend this if you are trying to do a super short look.</li>
    <li> Have had it several weeks and it has already paid for itself in haircuts.  No problems yet.  The length attachments are plentiful, but I use the 3 shortest ones.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased the same clippers. I bought new ones because my old ones were just, well, too old. They lasted several years and I use them on my body so they took more wear and tear then just a head shave. I have never had any problems with this product and it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Works great. Get all the investment back with one time use only</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper to cut my toddlers very thick hair, as well as my husband&#x27;s. Three months into using it, we still like it. The sound is not too loud and the clipper moves smoothly through the hair. Doesn&#x27;t take much time to cut hair with this one. We apply WAHL oil to the clippers after every use.</li>
    <li> Looks a little cheap (and that&#x27;s to be expected due to the low cost on Amazon), however, gets the job done for my purposes of trimming sideburns and &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; looking beards. Might consider investing in a higher end model if actually cutting head hair with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my toddle son. He doesn&#x27;t want to go to barber shop and sit for hair cut. This machine is great, perfectly safe and with losts of attachements.</li>
    <li> I just bought this wahl clipper from rite aid,and it is a great pair of clipper.I been using wahl clippers for 22 years now,and there clippers always served me great.This clipper is sharp,so you may have to adjust the blades.</li>
    <li> Great machine for hair cutting, sideburns,moustache.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price. I use them to cut my hair as well as a few friends once a week. The kit is perfect and comes with any guard you would need.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money you pay.  It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Seems to perform very well, especially for the price.  Can be noisy though at times</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m in college. I don&#x27;t have lots of disposable income for much of anything, let alone haircuts. Because of this, I found myself putting off haircuts for months on end. This was a bad idea. However, using this fella, I managed to cut my own hair for the first time without making too many major mistakes. People seemed to be pretty impressed when I told them I did it myself. This set works as well as you&#x27;ll want it to.</li>
    <li> For the price these are great.  They do everything hair clippers are supposed to do.  My only complaint is that they are very loud, but I kinda expect that from hair clippers.  They are an excellent purchase for their price.</li>
    <li> This hair and beard trimmer is incredibly easy to use. Also, it works very well and, since it plugs into the wall, you will never have to worry about batteries deteriorating over time.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely outstanding razor. Amazing quality for the price. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These hair clippers are Made In USA.  We have used several of them over the years.  My wife uses them to clip my hair and my son&#x27;s hair.  We save sooooo much money over going to the barber for cuts.  These clippers pay for themselves many, many times over.  And Made In USA.  A super easy choice for me, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, read de user manual before using this awesome product, comes in a nice box with many accesories that make it very easy to use</li>
    <li> Great deal for a great clipper.  Has lots of guide/size choices and comes with a comb, scissors, and cleaning brush... everything you need to trim up.</li>
    <li> This clipper didn&#x27;t cut any better than my $7 Walmart one that was several years old.  But it did cut and didn&#x27;t pull the hair. Plenty of guides for for length.</li>
    <li> As a mom of two boys I read about these clippers on another site and decided to give it a try. We have always kept my sons hair short and in the long run decided to give these a try. Overall it was really easy to use. My husbands only complaint was that the pieces for the ear were a little complicated to get but that probably comes with practice. Happy so far though!</li>
    <li> I just got the product and I was not impressed. I´ve had Wahl products for a long time but this one seems below their standards. My principal complain is that the clipper vibrates so much making unconfortable to be using it for a while.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something more reliable than most of the rechargable trimmers out there because I have gone through so many, most just stop holding a charge or just cr*p out.  For short money, I should have gotten this a LONG time ago.  Comes with a ton of attachments and very quiet (another huge improvement over rechargeable trimmers).  The only thing I would say is that I would pay extra for a better case, something that keeps the trimmer and attachements a little more organized.  Great product, def recomend.</li>
    <li> It does the job well and does it quietly.  Not worth spending more money when this is available for less.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the colored combs which make it easy to determine which one I want to use ... and the color GUIDE printed on the clipper is very helpful!</li>
    <li> Great device, just wish it had a 1 1/2 attachment.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a basic set of clippers and maybe some of the combs, to trim my beard. I went with this set for the price. I see what people mean about the odd on/off switch. It doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it seems to bother others. Though I would have preferred a simple switch.</li>
    <li> Loads of attachments, does not pull hair when cutting hair. Had a real cheap clipper that pulled more hair than it cut. Ordered this WAHL clipper set, problem solved.</li>
    <li> They work great! Cut thru thick hair easily</li>
    <li> works great. No more paying for haircuts at the barber!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I cut my own hair and this clipper made it so easy!, it&#x27;s very powerfull, I&#x27;m very please with this product, just hope it will last a long time!</li>
    <li> This product is quality made and does what is supposed to do. The best thing is that I can now cut my own hair!</li>
    <li> I can say any thing good abut it&lt;br /&gt;well maybe 1 thing I will never use it on me my but it works for my dog&lt;br /&gt;so t stars for and not 1 sans my dog dint mind it</li>
    <li> Best $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent!  After owning many brands of clippers I thought I&#x27;d try these and I am pleasantly surprised!  They cut through the hair quietly and easily, fit my hands comfortably and have many different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;The little motor seemed to have no trouble at all cutting through my son&#x27;s thick hair without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the color coded sizes so you can easily find what you&#x27;re looking for instead of spending half the day searching for the size you want.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to anyone who cuts hair at home!</li>
    <li> very good clippers and very well made.</li>
    <li> The shaver did not work when I received it</li>
    <li> These are great.  I received them and had to try them out. I oil the blades and started to cut. They cut so smoothly,  my boys had no issues with any pulling or catching of hair.  Sharp and quick.  I would highly recommend. They are solidly  built.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;d get another if I needed it</li>
    <li> High quality product at a great price, I am very surprised with how durable it is … great bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> My barber says this kit had a very good trimmer. She thought the scissors were not very good. But she will spend $300 on a good pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> I bought this only half year. It get louder and broken.&lt;br /&gt;It is not build for last.&lt;br /&gt;Returned .</li>
    <li> There are 5,000 plus reviews and this kit is still carrying a four and a half star rating.  That, folks, is solid performance.  For the money, this kit can&#x27;t be beat.  I have owned this kit for nearly a year and it has worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good power. This replace a battery charged model that didn&#x27;t have the oomph.&lt;br /&gt;Works will in the hands of an artist.(wife)&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning you have to realize that hair does grow back.</li>
    <li> Definitely cuts very well!</li>
    <li> Not that good. any link where i can buy 240volts? please</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. I use it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair once a month. He loves it too.</li>
    <li> Very powerful and easy to use.  Works a million times better than the cordless conair one that I had before.  I just used this to cut my 10 month old boy&#x27;s hair for the first time.</li>
    <li> The product is of excellent quality while at reasonably low cost. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought a new product and it came up used (found blonde and dark hairs inside the blades and i haven&#x27;t even used it once).  Loud and vibrates too much, as soon as i plugged it in started to smell like burning after 15 seconds.</li>
    <li> I have a 10 year old one of these that still had had no problems other than a couple of the clips on the guards breaking.  I bought this and now have two minus three guards.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect any plastic clips to last forever, so this clipper has been nice and reliable.  It had more power than other trimmers at this price point, and I never have to worry about it slowing down on thicker cuts.  Great clipper for the money.</li>
    <li> We love these clippers. Use them for cutting my husband and son&#x27;s hair and they work great! Had them over a year now with no problems.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really shave well</li>
    <li> This product is good buy !!!!!!! Wahl really is the best brand of razor hair. It&#x27;s beautiful, very good quality, the fact that this material is resistant designs are full color and quality is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt; Really I recommend it to everyone, really good. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice quality.  Made in the USA.</li>
    <li> My hair is starting to go. I knew I couldn&#x27;t keep combing it like I was. I bit the bullet and bought this 18 dollar pair of Wahl clippers. Perhaps the best 18 dollars I have ever spent. Super easy to give yourself a brush cut/burr. I used the #3 (3/8&#x27;s inch guard) for starters. I think I would even lower next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great clippers, and value!</li>
    <li> For such a price effective bit of hardware, this thing is a beast. It tore right through the jungle on my head without issue. If you don&#x27;t care about fancy hair styles and just want your hair cut down to size, there&#x27;s really no reason to go looking around for some other one that&#x27;s overpriced nonsense.</li>
    <li> Very sharp blades, relatively quiet. Great assortment of attachments and very clear instructions for common hair cuts. Great price!</li>
    <li> Works really well and is comfortable to use.  Seems much quieter then most clippers.  I haven&#x27;t used the clipper accessories since I just use the razor.  I&#x27;ve come close to my ear a few times and it hasn&#x27;t cut them.  Hasn&#x27;t pulled any longer hairs either.</li>
    <li> Need a cheaper way to cut your hair? Well look no further, these clippers are wonderful, and it makes you feel powerful when you hold it 😉😉</li>
    <li> The clipper works perfectly fine even though some part were slightly damaged. The cable also has decent length and it works as advertised. Overall, i do recommend this clipper and Amazon shipping is amazing fast.</li>
    <li> My buddy in North Myrtle Beach gave me a trim with his and I was amazed......so bought one when I got home and so far I&#x27;ve had 3 haircuts by the girlfriend.......it&#x27;s so so easy for her-she&#x27;s a professional now with no training....however....ONE point of advice:  DON&#x27;T DO IT YOURSELF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....now I have to figure out a way to tell my friend who owns a salon that I&#x27;m not having her trim my hair anymore.......and what to do with ten dollars every 3 weeks!?  Maybe play more golf this year!</li>
    <li> i am very happy with this trimmer. color/number identification is actually helpful. This thing is so powerful it almost jumps out of your hand when you turn it on. The only improvement I would suggest is a storage case that makes it a little easier to organize. It works well enough but is basically a big mess crammed into a case. Still, I have to give the trimmers fize stars for quality.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair trimmer set before this one that served me well for over 10 years but eventually kept pulling my hair and cutting unevenly. These trimmers are head and shoulders (pun) above the Conair set. They cut faster and more evenly than the Conair ever did.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t realize this clipper is for humans...but i got it for my tshi tzus.  I&#x27;ve alrealy clipped one dog and if i do say so myself i did a great job for my first time.  It worked smoothly and easily.  My biggest challenge is yet to come when i clip the second dog.</li>
    <li> Good quality and loads of options for hair length, easy to use with the color coding.</li>
    <li> This is acually a really nice product.  But to be completly honest, I just use a #2 guard and taper the back and sides.  I wear ball caps most of the time and just don&#x27;t care much what my hair looks like as long as it is comfortable and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> work well but much prefer a ceramic blade as they don&#x27;t need oil and stay sharper longer.</li>
    <li> The Wahl clipper&#x27;s work great! They are managed easily for doing trims around the ears, side-burns and the nape of the neck.  Thanks Wahl for a good product!</li>
    <li> I recieved the item fast which is great but to try out the product it seemed broken. when i turned it on it sounded louder then a lawn mower</li>
    <li> First time using these clippers. A bit big and clumsy to use but they get the job done. CAN&#x27;T beat the price....only time will tell if they will stand up.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother. He loves it. Even travelled to Africa with it and it worked just fine. Great product! Sweet price!</li>
    <li> I previously owned a cheap Conway shaver that I bought at CVS. After using it for a few months, it broke half way through a shave... which left me in an awkward-looking situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for just a couple of months, I can already say it is of *far* higher quality, and is definitely worth the extra money compared to the cheaper shavers. If you go cheaper, you&#x27;ll just end up buying another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the units, especially, is much easier.</li>
    <li> Very loud. Even after adjusting screw.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise works as expected.</li>
    <li> At the price of 1 haircut (including tip), Wahl sold me a kit to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to butcher the job the first couple tries, but the kit includes an easy-to-understand guide that made it surprisingly easy, with results indistinguishable from the generic haircut I always asked my barber for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t get your hair styled, take the plunge and get this kit. It&#x27;s most likely far easier than you think!</li>
    <li> This is great. I use it for my son and husband (at least 20 times so far).  It has paid for itself.  I get the exact cut I&#x27;m aiming for.  I&#x27;ve never had any problems (clogging, slowing, etc.)  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Easy kid haricuts and fun memories</li>
    <li> cool feel and excellent haven&#x27;t hAD ANY PROBLEMS. I love this thing. Reliable power and easy to put away. Only problem I have is with the guards. They suck.</li>
    <li> What a great hair trimming product! I was worried that paying only $16 would mean it was cheap but to my surprise it didn&#x27;t at all!  It&#x27;s comes in a sturdy black case for storage or travel inside the case there are adapters for the Clippers that allow you to get different lengths cut into hair these are made very well and sturdy  not the flimsy plastic we are used to. Also the Clippers themselves are plug in no batteries need to be charged to use which is great because it gives it great power and there&#x27;s no pre planning needed to cut your hair, it&#x27;s also extremity well built. I was very impressed with this product and am glad I bought it for my husband.</li>
    <li> Package arrived very promptly and the item was as described. I am happy with this purchase. I also know that Wahl is a good quality hair clipper so I feel that I definitely spent my money well.</li>
    <li> i recommended it works very nice.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. No problems.</li>
    <li> It works fine and it has a nice selection of tools to use. However, the lever to adjust it always gets loose.</li>
    <li> I bought these just to shave my head so I went with the cheapest model I could find and it did exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with no problems.</li>
    <li> They work very well. I only bought for shaving my head, so I really haven&#x27;t used any of the accessories for adjusting the height.</li>
    <li> I use this razor on my sons hair alot, very dependable, reliable razor. Is exactly what I wanted, great price, fast and safe shipping. Thanks</li>
    <li> Cutting costs, so trying to cut the families hair at home!  Great product and easy to use!</li>
    <li> It works great.  I no longer have to someone to mess up my hair.  This is definitely a good investment!</li>
    <li> Very reliable and easy to handle.  Color coding helps to determine which size is needed. Like the silver and blue.</li>
    <li> These have plenty of power and a good set of attachments and instruction book. They are a bit heavy but that&#x27;s ok since they do the job.</li>
    <li> Comes with lots of choices to clip on so you can control the cutting depth. Quiet, light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> What a difference a new pair of clippers make.  I use the clippers to shave with less the plastic parts.  Much cheaper than using Rasors everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my son&#x27;s hair. He likes his hair a little short and needs to have it cut every 2-3 weeks. The savings on one haircut paid for the clipperes.</li>
    <li> Rocks! Shave your face, shave your head, shave your balls! Excellent purchase, I use it often to trim my facial hair and occasionally to trim other hair.</li>
    <li> Wish I had bought this sooner!  Great for the price and has decent attachments in useful increments. Will buy again if it ever breaks.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for giving my hair a touchup. Not brave enough to start cutting my own hair quite yet, but it&#x27;s a good start.</li>
    <li> We have had quite a few sets of clippers these work very well and are sterdy definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time last week. Works great. Never used anything but Wahl products. They last forever!</li>
    <li> Very good and powerful clipper for the price.  Just wish the smallest comb attachment had a more secure fit.  It&#x27;s a bit loose and has popped off when shaving at an angle.</li>
    <li> The motor is very powerful and it&#x27;s a very good haircutting kit.</li>
    <li> Strong and powerful clippers that don&#x27;t hang up in my husbands hair.</li>
    <li> Do you dogs and your own hair at home works great and great deal</li>
    <li> Great clippers, nice and solid weight in your hand.  Good and sharp and a real bargain for the price, I wanted one here in the US for when we return visit each year as we spend a couple of months a year here (LOVE IT HERE). I clipped my hubby&#x27;s hair yesterday and it went through his hair like a hot knife through butter.  Better than the clippers I have back home in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;5 big stars from me....hip-ray</li>
    <li> Bought this same clipper set at a retail store for a slightly higher price. Clippers work perfectly! I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews that say it vibrates too much or is too loud, and heavy... but I&#x27;d have to disagree. There is absolutely nothing wrong at all with it. Completely happy with this purchase. The only remotely bad thing I can say is the case is pretty simple, just a cheap plastic snap case with no organization, the scissors are quite poor but whatever. All in all a great buy for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> This seems to be pretty great quality for the price. It feels durable and it is easy to use. The plug-in chord means you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it before use. My husband has to cut his hair every week or every other week and really seems to like it.</li>
    <li> This works great and saves me a ton of money. For under the price of one haircut I can cut my son and husband&#x27;s hair whenever they need it.</li>
    <li> Works perfect already has paid for its self. 3 haircuts in and its already saving us money. Color coded clips makes it very easy to pick the right lenght. And with you tube you can learn to cut hair like a pro.</li>
    <li> great clippers for great price.</li>
    <li> works very well, very easy to use. 20 piece of attachments are too much to store in the case.</li>
    <li> Excellent machine, like its power and accuracy at the time of the faded. Myself short hair doing faded and it is extremely easy and without a great effort.</li>
    <li> worked great before my dog chewed the cord</li>
    <li> I use this to give myself a haircut/manscape once a week, yes my hair grows like weeds. i generally use it for about 15-20 minutes at a time and for what it is, it works great as long as you take care of it. after every few cuts i unscrew mine to clean the hair out, wipe out all the old oil and re apply new oil (which is provided in the kit). sure there are better products out there and i wish i had bought a wireless one because i dont have an outlet in my bathroom  and i have to link extension cords together. the cord itself is not a bad length if you have an outlet in the bathroom though. if youre just casually cutting your hair once a month then go for it, great value. if you plan to use it often you might want to invest in something alot nicer. it does its job well</li>
    <li> Great product and very cheap!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best set of clippers I have ever used. Having 3 boys I put these to use a lot and this thing never fails me or pulls on their hair like some tend to do. Loved it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year and it works great for me to cut his hair and for him to cut his beard.</li>
    <li> exessive noise, it&#x27;s 0 I want a refund</li>
    <li> I needed to replace the blades on my 12 year old Wahl clipper, which has run excellent from day one, being used twice a month since new. Replacement blades were about $12, this &amp;#34;Color Pro&amp;#34; clipper was $18 so I decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;. I assumed after 12+ years the quality might be even better, with improved ergonomics, and I liked the colored guides. Wrong. I&#x27;m assuming the motor is exactly the same, the sound is the same, vibrations are the same, and still gets warm/hottish in the same spot. I like the colored guides, but the quality of the plastics has taken a massive downturn. The clipper&#x27;s side taper lever is so flimsy I cannibalized my old clipper&#x27;s lever to replace the new one - very simple to make the swap but seriously disappointing. Even more alarming was the plastic in the accessories. The new hair comb design is exactly the same as my 12 year old one, but it says &amp;#34;Made in USA&amp;#34;. The new one says &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;, and it shows some of the worst plastic tooling marks I have ever seen. And the new comb was more flimsy than a wet noodle - no exaggeration, it is unusable as it bends between your fingers! Instant garbage. In the end, this new &amp;#34;Color Pro&amp;#34; clipper is only an improvement over my 12 year old one because of the colored guide combs. Otherwise, disappointing that Wahl hasn&#x27;t made any real improvements, and has obviously cut quality in the plastics.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, I use these about twice a month to cut my hair, has everything you need to do the job, they are really good quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> i needed new clippers and these work great! the price couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Used this 5 times this year already, works great, save tons of cash on haircuts!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my hair and beard from looking shaggy. The unit works really well leaving smooth, even cuts. It comes with enough attachments and accessories to keep anyone&#x27;s hair looking good. Works well for facial hair too.</li>
    <li> This is a very good set of cutters. It comes with everything you need to cut the styles you want. The machine is very effective. I&#x27;ve used it successfully and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works awesome for when I have to shave my male pattern baldness head of mine. easy to find the right side clippers for trimming up my beard as well. only thing I would suggest find a new case for it. The case it flimsy and I am afraid it will break on me at anytime.</li>
    <li> great! it is heavy duty and love the fact that it comes with a sturdy case. I bought it for two of my brothers and they really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year and it still works great.  I would recommend this model to anyone who want&#x27;s to save money on hair cuts.. watch out for the ear taper attachment... it will buzz the top of your ears pretty quickly..  i used it once and won&#x27;t use the attachment again.</li>
    <li> This product stopped working the first time I used it. It worked for a few minutes before it completely stopped working.</li>
    <li> Came in right on time,works just fine, love it. I only rated it 4 stars because it not top of the line product, did what it suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Purchased this a little while ago and it works like a charm. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and it stays cool! Great product.</li>
    <li> Like you, I read various reviews before deciding on this Wahl to replace my old Oster that finally broke. When it arrived, I used it right away to shave in a pinch when my battery operated shaver ran out of juice. Later, I opened &#x27;er back up to cut my hair and noticed two of the guards have broken tines. (the two large ones). It&#x27;s evident that the way they&#x27;re all crammed into the hard case causes the tines to crack. Thankfully, my old oster guards fit so there isn&#x27;t really a need to play the return return return game. The Wahl guards are a little thin in the tines compared to my oster guards. Clipper works well, just be prepared for possible broken guards.</li>
    <li> The one we had for 20 years finally expired.  This was a good replacement - it has a lower noise output so as not to freak out a little kid.  The edges are sharp and the attachments really useful.</li>
    <li> I owned a Wahl that I bought from SAMs club for the same price as this one which lasted me a good 7 years with regular oiling... it worked fine with no issues but I thought it was time for a replacement so I purchased this one... but this Wahl clipper jammed more than once and I had to stop mid cut to brush off hair and get it started again.  My previous Wahl can cut through my thick hair like butter... this Wahl unfortunately does not have the same performance...  I have a feeling that after a few more cuts to get my money&#x27;s worth I will purchase a more powerful higher quality one... don&#x27;t get me wrong - this one will do the job... but if you have thick hair and plan to use it to groom pets I suggest look elsewhere for a higher quaility and more powerful clipper...</li>
    <li> Sturdy design, strong looking appearance and performs well in terms of the cut, relatively low noise, and I like the fact that it has the ear pieces/guides.</li>
    <li> This is maybe my third Wahl purchase in 25 years as I am an ANDIS user for the past 18 plus years. I bought this to do my son&#x27;s hair and am satisfied with it&#x27;s performance thus far.  I dont know if it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t used one for quite a while but the only issue I have with it is the humming.  I tried to do some adjustment, but it did not minimize the humming levels.  Guess am so accustomed to my quieter Andis machines now. Good price and nice machine.</li>
    <li> More than paid for itself in a few haircuts.  Use it on the grandsons, and my husband and everyone is happy with their hair.</li>
    <li> Honestly I bought this to shave my dick hair and it&#x27;s so loud and noisy and it looks dangerous and I&#x27;m too afraid to put it anywhere near my junk. Safety first. Buttttttt I still use it to shave my head (with the pretext or things of course.)</li>
    <li> the sound came out from it made me think there is something wrong with it I don&#x27;t know what is the problem</li>
    <li> I purchased this cutter because of the brand WAHL, had this brand before; but nothing like this!  It&#x27;s just too darn loud!  No matter what position I adjust the power screw it&#x27;s just still too loud!  Minimum adjustment is nice &amp; quiet but blades don&#x27;t move.  Can&#x27;t say I will not buy this brand again; but this item is a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> I used to hate spending $15-$20 at the hair butchery for a buzz cut or simple fade, only to realize later that it wasn&#x27;t perfectly even. For the cost of 1 or 2 hair cuts, I got these clippers and I&#x27;ve cut my own hair ever since. Now I can make sure it&#x27;s perfect (you&#x27;ll need help for the back of your head until you have a LOT of practice). The clippers are solid and run very smooth. They may not be professional grade, but they&#x27;re perfect for home use and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Dad and he loves it! He likes it that he doesn&#x27;t have to buy batteries for it every other week and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Got a years use out of it. it&#x27;s now having some minor problems. maintenance is needed to keep it running strong, but no time in college.&lt;br /&gt;Completely worth the $20&lt;br /&gt;paid for itself with one use&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Well I ordered this one after getting a defective one first. I had one of these that was about 18 years old that I paid about $25 for back then. I think i paid about $22 for this one so not a bad price. I think if this one is built the same as my last one then it deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have been shaving my hair short for so long I cant remember having hair. My wife and I were talking about it in early October 2012 and she said that she would like to see what I look like with hair and wanted to see if it would still grow in. So I get this Haircutting kit and now I am only using it for a trimmer. It is December 2012 now and I can tell you that my Red hair still grows Red......Ok so Red and White :o)</li>
    <li> Great Christmas gift for my younger brother, its color coded so it tells you exactly how to cut your hair.</li>
    <li> Nice, but haven&#x27;t used them too much yet..time will tell how thy hold up!!  My husband was pleased with them though</li>
    <li> Good cheap pair of clippers. Saves you from having to run to the barber constantly. Check your package, The last time I re-ordered a few clipper guards were damaged. didn&#x27;t notice until after I&#x27;d used.</li>
    <li> Pretty much being bald was no problem after all being around a dad,uncles and cousins with the same lack of hair made it pretty acceptable and knowing what was going to happen anyway. The only problem was the lack of a standard barber I mean I have no hair so what&#x27;s the use for a stylist? So after trying many hair shaver with passing grades I found Wahl has been the most longest lasting and best hair shaver to have at such an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If You don&#x27;t want to shave all your hair off or what you have left this is also a nice one to have as it gives a detailed specifications on which accessory to use when trimming your hair or if someone else in your family is doing the trimming.  So if you&#x27;re one of my fellow bald brothers or a receding sibling who is secure enough not to worry about trying to comb over your two hair strands then this is a perfect product to have and for those who are looking for an affordable alternative to going to a hair stylist look no farther.</li>
    <li> Does not work on 220-240V. Specification shound mention this point as most haircutting kits double up as beard trimmers and are taken abroad</li>
    <li> Low rating only because, 1) Upon receiving and opening the first thing i noticed when i took out the clippers was that the clear cover that goes over the blades when they are off was broken... so that was disappointing, but not a huge problem. 2) The case that holds everything is not the greatest. If dropped the plastic would definately crack. There is no organizing or compartments. Everything just gets thrown in there and you have to make it fit to try and snap closed. I guess thats what you get for the price though, because otherwise the clippers themselves work great.</li>
    <li> Good clipper with good price</li>
    <li> Work great.  Make sure to keep them clean and oiled.  Bought a few spare guards off eBay but the kit comes with everything you need to start.  Scissors included in kit were already broken when arrived and the guards that are included all go pretty short so you may want to order some one-and-a-quarter inch or one-and-one-half inch guards off eBay.</li>
    <li> Very good set and the machine was fairly silent and cut hair smoothly.</li>
    <li> clippers are great, there are better out there but if you are on a budget they are really one of the best out there for the money. They cut your hair effortlessly and have not hung up or pulled yet, don&#x27;t think they ever will. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cheep case they come in, very thin and flimsy and every thing just gets thrown in there, no organization. not a big deal but would be nice to have some order about it. Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Cuts smooth and seems to have plenty of power. Case isn&#x27;t great but I didn&#x27;t but it for the case.</li>
    <li> Very good, quiet set of clippers with a lot of features.</li>
    <li> My son and I were really impressed that this is such good quality for under $20!  He tackled his hair while I was at work (a little help on the back from his sister) and it turned out so much better than I expected!  His hair was much too long, and very wavy, so I thought it would be very difficult for him to do by himself.  He looks good enough to go out in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper itself seems to be quite a nice quality.  There are very easy to understand instructions and all the accessories you could need, or at least that he needed.</li>
    <li> These were purchased to replace an old set. They work great and I love the color coded system. I use them to cut my husband and 2 sons&#x27; hair. Way less pulled hair on this cut. For the cost of one haircut, I paid for these clippers. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> In under five minutes this electric haircutter does the job. Saves the $35 to $50 dollars and 45 minutes in the salon chair. With a bad back, even a salon chair can be excruciating.</li>
    <li> Works great and love all the attachments</li>
    <li> Great product, I already saved a lot using it to cut my kids hair, i would recommend it to every one</li>
    <li> This thing is a lot more solidly built than the old cheap clippers I had been using for a while. However, after some months I ran into an issue with the head being very, very slightly out of alignment. This causes the clippers to become louder, shake a bit, but most importantly, not cut hair as well. I&#x27;ve even had it catch hair when it does this which is a bit painful. The problem is on and off, sometimes I can push against the moving head a bit to get it back into normal working order. I&#x27;d like to exchange it as I think I might have just been unlucky. The clippers are very solidly built and it&#x27;s a nice set otherwise, and even with that problem they still work. Unfortunately the problem didn&#x27;t persist until quite some time after I purchased them, so I&#x27;m stuck.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of clippers, I bought this exact same one about 8 years ago and while the first one still works it is getting tired from all the clipping of 3 boys hairs every month I of course had to get the same one again and it works beautifully every time it. The price is fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> Just received this nifty package today and decided to use it on my boyfriend of course! Worked great!! Gave him an excellent buzz! Good quality and a good deal for the price! No complaints, hopefully there will be a lot more home hair cuts in my future! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he used it and liked it. Now he doesnt have to spend $10-$15 a week. Shipping was fast without no damages. Really nice.</li>
    <li> Great for the price.  Colors are a little cheesy.  I prefer a much closer shave than what these trimmers can provide.  However my roommate began using them after I started shaving my head bald and absolutely loves them.  He said the only downfall is when you go to the barber and try and remember what length you need and the only thing you can remember is the color.</li>
    <li> My mom uses it to cut my kids hair and she&#x27;s not really a fan.  Just doesn&#x27;t cut very well.</li>
    <li> I am very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this trimmer. Unlike so many other electric razors, this is built to last. It really has some weight to it! Further, the packaging boasts a 5 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this exclusively for trimming my beard. The adjustable fine tuning lever is perfect for achieving the desired length. The blades are share and efficient - no snagging.</li>
    <li> Buy this. Worth your money.</li>
    <li> Comes with directions/pictures if you or a roomie want to cut your hair. Lots of different accessories to change, so it was pretty good. Hopefully it will last a while.</li>
    <li> Professional grade, comes with attachments for length from almost skin close to long enough to cut head hair.  I use it to trim my goatee and it does very well.</li>
    <li> This is the simplest and easiest hair clipper! How awesome! I am a beginner to cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home with this clipper. This is my first time trial for cutting man&#x27;s hairs.  He is so happy for home haircut by this. Also we can save money for haircut service monthly. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Works like a dream. I do wish however that they could get the blade a little closer so it looks like i have shaved instead of leaving the fuzz</li>
    <li> Received the clipper set, pulled the clipper out and turned it on..  The cutter blade went flinging across the room..  The plastic piece where the blade screws on broke.. probably in shipping.. Sent an email to Wahl with pictures, they stated I should call the 1-888 number.. Called the number and sat on hold for 30 minutes..  I gave up and said screw it.. I have always tried to buy American, but after this hassle, I&#x27;m going to go buy a chinese clipper set...</li>
    <li> Too noisy for my liking. If I knew it makes that irritating loud buzzing sound as soon as you turn it on, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it!</li>
    <li> This is an absolute disgrace on behalf of wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these (foolishly after reading the negative feedback) thinking that it was a very good price for a product I had known to trust for quality. This is the absolute epitome of waste product. IT IS ALREADY IN THE BIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read the negative feedback as stated, but also the good feedback with people posting that the sound wasn&#x27;t and issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a complete joke, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend thought I was being electrocuted in the bathroom when I turned these on - it literally sounds like a taser going off. I live in New Zealand, and yes, these do have an american output, however I have a very expensive power converter which fits this plug and does whatever it needs to do with the power strength (Excuse my lack of technical wording, this is not my forté.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buggering about for nearly twenty minutes, reading the manual, checking online, oiling the blades, adjusting the power strength (which btw, if you assume this is a feature - it isn&#x27;t. The power adjustment nodule does absolutely nothing), NOTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing that would silence this near deafening (I&#x27;m not exaggerating - this is so loud I couldn&#x27;t use it near my ear) was me clamping down with a vice like grip on the body of the razor, to prohibit any vibrations from rattling the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand this is a cheap product. I understand to not expect perfection, and to not expect this product to last a lifetime, let alone a year - but this product went from box to bin within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl should be ashamed to put a product out like this for purchase. I also think amazon should seriously consider pulling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BE A FOOL LIKE ME AND PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF UTTER RUBBISH.</li>
    <li> Used at least 20 times and still working great. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend whom has really thick, curly Italian hair and it worked great ! Didn&#x27;t get caught in his curls like so many razors before this</li>
    <li> Love it, did my own hair ever since</li>
    <li> works just like the pros.</li>
    <li> It is too loud，I can&#x27;t bear at all。</li>
    <li> Great item has strong motor and a multitude of cutting attachments, easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife has been cutting my hair for a few years and purchased this kit as the previous clipper was not working as well.  We have been very happy with this kit.  It cuts well and has all of the pieces needed to give great haircuts.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Lots of great attachments, easy to use. I use it to groom my dogs.</li>
    <li> Best hair clippers ever for the best price!</li>
    <li> Package looks good but still learning to use it.</li>
    <li> ok clipper noisy at times still works was  scared at first</li>
    <li> From some reviews I was worried about the quality of the sheers. OMG! These are professional grade. With the attachments, brush, and included oil, I am set for years! It paid for itself with my 4th haircut. Easy to use, easy to clean and well worth the price. SOOOO glad I went with Wahl.</li>
    <li> This is a well made hair trimmer with assorted attachments to trim and style.  Great for full grooming or a trim whenever.</li>
    <li> They do their job but they miss some hairs and you have to go over it more than once</li>
    <li> What a steal for the price. This review is coming from a guy with thin hair so take that into account, but it seems strong. it&#x27;s got everything you need and not much more. I&#x27;m a penny pincher so to cut my own hair 3 times would put me even with how much I spent on it. The product is sturdy and reliable, I don&#x27;t see why anyone would need anything fancier... unless you need a laser beam to cut a straight edge. I&#x27;d buy this product again, but I&#x27;ve got a feeling that I wont have to. I think these buzzers will outlast my hairline.</li>
    <li> Great product for home users.  I previously had a &amp;#34;Pro Series&amp;#34; Wahl clipper that was heavier duty, but was dropped and broken.  This set was purchased to replace and see if there was much of a difference.  They power through thick hair without any issue.  The most notable difference is the flimsy power cord, but really it&#x27;s adequate so that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Great clean cut and does not pull hairs like cheap clippers. Cheap price but great quality. Used them often when I was going through chemo and had only straggly thin hair that needed to be shaved. Now that my hair is back I use it to trim my beard for a nice clean look.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my own hair and works great</li>
    <li> Super heavy, but I love the color coded adjustments.</li>
    <li> I wanted to start buzzing my own head and these clippers fit the bill perfectly.  They are very well built and work great.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the clippers so far, and at a very affordable price!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. For under $20 this cuts my hair with such ease. My old clippers tugged my hair but these slide beautifully! I love the color code system. Just buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the excitement on Christmas.</li>
    <li> works AS ADVERTISTED.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product from Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;It is very effective and efficient for haircuts in addition to their excellent pieces that make the job easier.</li>
    <li> Color coded comes with Alot of attachments and works. so thats good....Right?</li>
    <li> It vibrate alot even though I just it to the lowest  stills vibrate, I could not use it so sad about the item.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Solid build, works great, lots of accessories.</li>
    <li> I go to college in Evanston, IL and something I learned quickly this past freshman year was how expensive haircuts can be in the Chicago area. Haircuts at the cheapest are $20, without tip. That&#x27;s a bit too much for me. I bought this Wahl set since I had a friend who also had a Wahl set that cut my hair a few times during the school year. It&#x27;s summer time so I thought it&#x27;d be a perfect time for me to do a little experimenting myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the kit and then went on YouTube and watched a few videos about how to cut your own hair. Aaron Marino&#x27;s video was especially helpful. After watching a few videos at least two times, I felt confident enough to go ahead and do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s all you need:&lt;br /&gt;Wahl haircutting kit&lt;br /&gt;Hand mirror&lt;br /&gt;Mirrors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially you always want to start with small cuts. Common sense right? So what I did was play it safe and started with a 7 going all the way around my sides and back. Then taking a 6, I went up to the middle part of my head, slightly above the top of the ear. With a 5, I went to about the middle of my ear. Essentially what this does is create a natural taper where it blends nicely since you started with the longer clipper going all the way around, and gradually got shorter as you moved down your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing this I thought it was a bit too long still so I repeated the process going 5-4-3. Looked great. The toughest part I&#x27;d say is getting the back. What I found to be helpful was if I used my hand as a guide. So I&#x27;d look in the mirror using the hand mirror in one hand and shape with my hand that wasn&#x27;t holding the clipper how the back would look. From there, your alternate hand serves as a \\&quot;guard\\&quot; against the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally for the middle, this is really where you cut to your own liking. I pretty much mimicked what I&#x27;d seen my barber do several times where you take chuncks of your hair and kind of filter it between two fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip I&#x27;d say is watch out when using the ear trim taper guards. If you aren&#x27;t careful, you may find yourself with a bit too much hair taken off the mid area of your ear section. This slightly happened on my left side but it&#x27;ll grow back. Honestly it wasn&#x27;t that noticeable, but definitely be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great product. Really easy to follow directions and combined with YouTube, just really easy to learn how to do. Skyped my parents a few days after and my Dad told me he wanted to cut his hair when I go home! Also received some compliments throughout the week. Friends were surprised when I mentioned I had cut it myself. Guess it turned out alright!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part of all is that this kit pays for itself after one haircut. It&#x27;s also quite a great skill to have because if you can cut your own hair, you can cut anyone&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product, the clippers are great and do a phenomenal job.</li>
    <li> excellent haircutting, but the clippers is garbage</li>
    <li> I tend to see my barber a lot less. Very high quality for the price, feels professional. Cuts through my hair like butter, give myself my own haircuts. I bought one for my dad and my brother too.</li>
    <li> Used cutters every couple months for 3 years. Worked great until recently when the unit started becoming erratic (losing power). Determined it was the wiring where the cord enters the body of the trimmer. Wahl said they would fix for $15 if I shipped it in. May buy a new set since it&#x27;s not much more than a repair.</li>
    <li> These clippers are easy to use for beginners. It includes all the attachments to go around ears and for any length. The color coding comes in handy as well. I live with two other guys who envy my clippers and often ask to use it despite having their own.</li>
    <li> First of all, the price is great. It is high quality and cuts my hair beautifully. It has never pulled once. Easy cleaning and oiling and comes in a wonderful storage case that I was not expecting when I bought it. I would happily pay MUCH more than I did for this. For any home hair cutter, I recommend this hair cutting kit. You will not be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on beards too!</li>
    <li> I love this haircutting combo.  My first cut went smoothly and the motor is STRONG.  If you are looking for something to replace the Great Clips visit once every few months, I cannot recommend this strongly enough.</li>
    <li> I useually buy dog clippers for my hair because they work the best. But I was searching on Amazon and found these they work great. They will never measure up the the dog clippers that lasted ten years but its a good second place. Maybe if I am lucky they will last ten years but I doubt it 5 stars tho they did the job came fast and I like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dome has been shaved nicely.&lt;br /&gt;;D</li>
    <li> Works great, plenty of power, better than cordless versions as their batteries will eventually go bad and are not replaceable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a powerful clipper! It comes with clippers of all sizes and I easily cut my own hair with it. I recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> The haircut is very good and easy to use. And better than the priveous one I bought other place. I will suggest it to my friend</li>
    <li> very happpy with this recent purchase, this is a great haircutting kit and Wahl delivers.. i would definitely recommend this to others</li>
    <li> Great price for this.  Does the trick, doesn&#x27;t jam up, so much more affordable, time-saving, and kind of fun to just do my boyfriend&#x27;s hair ourselves! Some of the guards are harder to use than others and at one point we cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair way too short in one area, but it grew back. I&#x27;m pretty sure that was my fault anyway, but practicing with one of these is hard just becasue, well, what are you going to practice on but hair? Other than that, great purchase!</li>
    <li> I buzz my hair once a week and this thing is amazing. It cuts really fast and will get the job done. One thing that is kind of confusing is the clips. I am used to having different number clips such as 1, 2, 3.... etc but you just have to play with it a little bit. For the price, this is a great investment. I would buy again if i needed to.</li>
    <li> The only difference out of the box that separates these clippers from a set that cost 50-100$ more is the noise when in use.  I love how the clipper attachments are color coated( really is more helpful than you think).  It has enough power to give hair cuts all day.  The kit comes with everything one would need to maintain the Whal color pro clippers for years to come.  It does come with oil and cleaning brushes .  I still don&#x27;t know how to use the &amp;#34;ear attachments&amp;#34; but they come with the kit , I guess that&#x27;s what YouTube is for.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 of these in the past that have failed. It&#x27;s $20 but $20 build quality too. However, it is worth it because I pay that much for a hair cut anyway. While the durability is low (do not drop it!) the quality is great.  The color coordinated attachements help me get a professional look every time!</li>
    <li> done a few buzz cuts on my son so far and seems to work fine.  You usually have to comb over an area several times since it never cuts every hair the first pass.  But I think that&#x27;s typical of any buzz cutters.  Reviewed instructions and a few YouTube videos and was able to do decent cuts right away.  Hint: always go too long to begin with, both on overall hair and on edges.  You can always cut more.  Has handy left and right angled attachments for doing around ears.  Lots of different length brushes to choose from.  Wish I could do more style on my son, but he&#x27;s too impatient.</li>
    <li> I love the color coordination of these clippers. It makes finding the size you want a breeze. The clippers are very powerful and I&#x27;m able to do my hair quickly and easily.  I have no complaints. The case works great as well.</li>
    <li> Wahl quality, and can&#x27;t beat the price, especially if you are trying to find it locally. Carrying case seems a bit flimsy, but it does the task</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I want! I searched a lot when I decide to buy a good hair cutter at this price, I think everything is okay about this product. specially that has a 5 years warranty and guaranty of repair... Do you need more?</li>
    <li> This is what i have been looking for and timed it right as the Kit was on Sale.&lt;br /&gt;also, it does a great job of cutting my hair.</li>
    <li> Great hair clipper for the price. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now... a few months, and haven&#x27;t had any problems. Great for clipping any unwanted hair on any part of your body.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend to keep his beard trimmed since the one he had pulled his hairs, and I saw reviews on here that this model doesn&#x27;t. They were right, he loves it! He even let me do a little manscaping on his back with it, and he definitely wouldn&#x27;t have let me do that with his other set (TMI, I know, but it works great for that too). When I saw it was only $18, I had doubts, but it&#x27;s nice quality, not flimsy at all. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Whal is a great brand, its true, great quality clippers especially this product. It has colored guards to help those who have never actually cut hair before. I cut my own hair and it worked out great.</li>
    <li> Great solid product I high recommend it.</li>
    <li> No mor expensive hair cuts for my husband!  Bought this nice clipper and it works very well.  No need to spend more, this one works fine. It does an amazing job for back of the neck trim.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This cutter is super sharp and works awesome. $18 is a great value. Buy his hair cutter . You can,t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my sons hair and it works as advertised. Great for the price and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> One son looks great with SHORT hair, the other looks like Denis the Menace if I get it too short. And then there&#x27;s my husband, who&#x27;s kind-of picky, lol. I can never remember who gets what #, but with the color-coding--luckily everybody has ended up with their favorite color being the right # for his hair. What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last one I bought (years ago, different brand) would *pull* hair instead of cutting. The boys would whimper &amp; complain, &amp; I finally quit using it. This one is much better--even my 5yo is happy to let me cut his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case isn&#x27;t awesome--it&#x27;s close to impossible to get everything back in, &amp; the first set I received had been broken because apparently, even the manufacturer couldn&#x27;t do it. After cutting hair for 4+ people, I&#x27;d really rather putting it away to be easy. *shrug* I still have the case from that first kit, so I&#x27;ll use it instead.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much money that I have saved with this product. It cuts through any grade of hair also. That is a definite plus in my family; as we all have a different grade of hair. My youngest has thick, fine hair, my oldest has a course grade of curly hair and my husband has hair somewhere in between. You do have to make sure that you take these apart and clean them periodically or they drag. In other words the guards will not comb through the hair as easily. I love the guards because: once you figure out which guard, for which head of hair, it is pretty easy sailing. These pay for themselves in the end, so I&#x27;ll always keep a set around.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> It make loud noise, but it work</li>
    <li> My son loves this! He likes all of the colored settings and it cuts great!</li>
    <li> The clippers work fine after 1 or 2 uses.  The clipper protective guard came broken in the box, and oddly some clipper attachments were in a bag and others not.</li>
    <li> very pleased 5 star in my book</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay we have to buy a new one every couple of years they seem to just crap out even if you clean and oil them not sure why may be the motor or the blades spread out, not a huge big deal just throw it out and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on, it was so noisy (in fact it is very very loud). It also get hot quickly. I read some comments here knowing that I need to tighten the screw on the side. After I tighten the screw and turned it on again, the noise was gone but it did not cut anymore because the screw was too tight that the blade did not vibrate at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosen it -&amp;#62; noise&lt;br /&gt;Tighten it -&amp;#62; does not vibrate/cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad thing is when I checked the warranty I realized that it does not cover Singapore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I went down to local store to get another trimmer - Philips QC5115 and it is better than this Wahl trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Works as expected... Good for quick haircuts and also regular trimming. Nothing to complain as such. It would have been great if they could have given a small CD on how to cut the hairs.</li>
    <li> Cut my kids hair very well, easy to use. Easy to clean. I have used it 4 times so far so good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good Haircutting kit for the price.  Since I&#x27;m cutting my own hair these days, I wanted something that was easy enough for self use as well as for my significant other to use if she is cutting my hair.  This works.  It seems durable enough to last a few years, though I only cut my hair once or twice per month and I don&#x27;t use a guard; I keep it short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up with two of these, because of a shipping error.  The second we donated to the Cancer Unit that my SO works on and she uses it to cut the hair of her patients and has also been very pleased.  It gets more use on her unit than in our home, but overall, both clippers have been as good or better than expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this for use on my husband (trim his hair every two weeks)...definitely worth the money.  Has alot of power to it - maybe a bit noisy, but not a big deal really.  Like the color coding too!  My girlfriend (she&#x27;s a hairdresser) says it&#x27;s something she would use in the salon - good quality.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I was spending ten bucks on every haircut until I got this.  Back then I was keeping my hair longer (not like Fabio or anything ... more like Rhett Butler in GWTW).  But now I&#x27;ve gone back to something like Tom Cruise in Top Gun for the winter time and more of an Air Force cut in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of two haircuts I got this machine and not only am I saving money out the wazoo but I can have it cut once a month.  (Believe me with an Air Force cut, once a month is a lot better anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife was not happy about taking up cutting hair but my cut is simple (a single comb/guard in the winter, and a couple of guards for the summer) so there was a little resistance at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About this particular machine, we were worried that for $20 it was going to be cheap and wouldn&#x27;t last long.  Wrong!  This machine is extremely solid and feels like it will last forever.  The kit comes with everything anybody would need and we didn&#x27;t actually need any of it but the machine and less than half the guards but each buyer will use different pieces so having everything makes it perfect.  The guards in this set are color coded so it makes using it very easy.  There is even a color chart on the machine itself so picking the right guard is even simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not used this for girls&#x27; haircuts and aren&#x27;t even contemplating it.  Girls go to the hairdresser mostly for the gossip (at least around here anyway).  ...Okay, I have to admit that I do miss talking about football, the crops/livestock/weather, and the local politics at the man-zone, err barber shop.  But even if only one family member gets their hair cut with this machine it still saves a lot of money.</li>
    <li> After realizing how much money we were wasting on getting my husband&#x27;s hair shaved at the hair dresser&#x27;s salon, we decided to take matters into our own hands, literally!  This wahl razor has paid itself back and then some.  Easy to use and does a great job.  There are different guard attachments to determine the length and I think it would be hard to actually hurt someone with this.  So, all around a great product and worth the money!</li>
    <li> it was a great buy, because it was inexpensive and a great quality. also it&#x27;s one of the most reliable brands.</li>
    <li> I had the clippers for a few days before I used it. I was rereading the instruction sheet (which includes pictures as well as text in 2 languages on how to cut hair) hoping that the info would soak in. The first thing that I shaved off was my (several inches long) winter beard. The clippers took it down to a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before I thought I even got started. No scratches, nicks or skin irritation and I was easily able to shave the rest off with a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I attempted to cut my own hair per the instructions and did pretty well for a first time. I missed a few places on the top back of my head. My sister-in-law who uses this same brand of clippers to cut my brother and their kids hair  finished it up and in time with practice I should be able to do it, although I suspect that the back of the neck will have to be finished by another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally pay including tip $17 for a similar haircut at Fantastic Sam&#x27;s. So with the next cut it will have more than paid for itself. It seems like it will last a long time. A small container of blade oil is included. In case anyone is wondering an [eye] brow trim guide is not included in this kit. An ear trim guide is included.</li>
    <li> Does what it was intended to do with ease and affordability.  Have had the wife cut my hair twice with it - so it&#x27;s now paid for itself already and will continue to do so many times over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I will use that money saved to do something profound... but don&#x27;t count on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good value for the price!</li>
    <li> Used it only twice, but it does the job and gets through the rough hair that other shavers will just quit on.</li>
    <li> Really useful tool, saves me a lot of trouble and money going to the barber. With a little practicing I can do just as good as the barber&#x27;s. Tools are complete inside the box--all sizes of kit, scissors blah blah. Definately good product.</li>
    <li> Having switched from a smaller, less powerful trimmer, this was a great improvement. No binding, no pulling and I can now cut my husband&#x27;s hair in half the time it was taking me!</li>
    <li> Second Wahl I have bought that wouldn&#x27;t clip my little dogs hair.  I bought a wahl several years ago to clip her and it worked great but it finally wore out.  Guess they don&#x27;t make them like they used too.</li>
    <li> i bought it for my boyfriend and he and his father love it. oh it does look somewhat cheap because of that colorful head but for 25 bucks, i think you can stand it.</li>
    <li> cuts my hair works great i&#x27;m still using it and i saved a bundle not going to the barber, will by again</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my boyfriend&#x27;s hair, and it worked great for the first few times. Then, one of the metal teeth broke and it no longer gave an even cut. But, I still use it. Just remember to cover the top with the black plastic piece.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my two year old throws a fit at the barber shop. I also was replacing the ones I had (I think they were conair from target total junk). The cheap ones I had I think I paid 40 bucks for so this set at 20 bucks I didn&#x27;t expect much. I was very surprised they are nice and work great. I would recommend getting these. I cut his hair as soon as I got them so they already paid for themselves because it was costing me 20 bucks for a haircut.</li>
    <li> Works great, came with numerous attachments and has a long cord.  For the price, I just didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it does.</li>
    <li> Around 10 years ago when mother nature decided that I no longer had any use for the majority of my hair... I no longer could justify going to a barber or \\&quot;Supercuts\\&quot; and paying $15 to $20 bucks plus tip for something I pretty much knew I could do myself and not mess up. So I purchased my first Wahl clipper and have been cutting my hair ever since. After 10 years of relatively no maintenance that first Wahl clipper died ... so I went on Amazon and purchase this one to replace the old one and have been absolutely satisfied with my purchase. Wahl has been making Clippers for many years.... it is a quality product that feels sturdy and well built and not cheap... I certainly didn&#x27;t need all the other attachments that came with it... all I needed was the Clippers and the #1 attachment and two haircuts later it has paid for itself..... I really didn&#x27;t think about it until I start writing this review... but before I started cutting my own hair, I figured I was getting my hair cut around 8 to 10 times a year... conservatively that&#x27;s $200 per year +10 years &#x3D; $2000... Wow... I wish everything I bought would bring me back such a return...this wasn&#x27;t a purchase... it was an investment.</li>
    <li> It does the job as needed.  Saves me getting a haircut at a barber shop.  My wife is an excellent barber.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these clippers.  They have a solid feel when you use them.  They work as advertised. I would choose Wahl clippers again.</li>
    <li> I first started cutting my hair with just a pair of scissors but after messing up countless times I decided to buy electric clippers. These things work like a charm. It comes with plenty of different size guides so that you get the right cut every time as well as hair cutting scissors, a comb and a guide on how to correctly cut hair. The first time I used it I had no idea how to even cut my hair with electric clippers and it came out better than I&#x27;ve ever cut my hair before. I can now cut my hair in the same amount of time it used to take to get it cut at a barber and it&#x27;ll look great too. Perfect for any man looking to save money from haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works great, many different guard lengths that I like, helps get length just right. Only con is that the guards seem flimsy, will see if they last.</li>
    <li> For the average Mom with kids, especially boys, I recommend strongly getting some clippers and doing this yourself. Clippers will save you time and money. When your kids get old enough, you may teach them how to cut their own hair, as well. You don&#x27;t have to wait at the hair salon or barber--or follow their hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that Wahl makes consumer products in the US anymore; thus, I wonder if parts will remain available in the future. Wahl was better about that than Remington or other consumer-intended mfrs. who use the PRC. I note on the Wahl site that accessories and parts still prove more available than from colleague competitors. More products are being made here again--I hope that Wahl will return to US manufacturing soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I own another Wahl clipper set (I misplaced this one), the Wahl clipper accessory kit, and a Wahl electric razor. I&#x27;ve tried Remington clippers and something else (cheap and underpowered) from the PRC--that simply won&#x27;t do. The Remington was OK except that the lever raises up--Wahl doesn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;ve given up on the Remington now and use this Wahl again. (I wanted to see Remington&#x27;s \\&quot;spin\\&quot; on this--really, it&#x27;s pretty much the same--even the cutters (blades) look the same: Do these all come from the same fabricator?) Wahl clippers are the best obtainable from common consumer sources, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the plunge and actually doing this oneself is hard at first: It&#x27;s not a big deal after one gets some experience, though. My first self-cut wasn&#x27;t bad. I think that many people purchase clippers and end up not using them (including my parents long ago)--they may not make the effort to follow the instructions and obtain experience. It&#x27;s likely that they scratch their heads--wondering (exactly) what to do--or they have doubts: They give up even before trying. (I guess it&#x27;s just plain fear.) At some point, if one desires to master this (at this level), one must \\&quot;dive in\\&quot;--trusting the instructions, the product, and its clipper-guides--ultimately trusting oneself. It&#x27;s not rocket-science--users quite likely will succeed--many others here did, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this for 5yrs.+ now. . What I did first was to get a good large hand mirror and a good floor mirror--I use them in concert with the bathroom mirror. (One likely could get by merely with the hand mirror and bathroom mirror.) I follow the instructions and trust the clipper guides. Then, I rid myself of too-long sideburns and scruff on the back of the neck with the clippers--sans guides. Afterwards, according to the mirrors, I go over the back and ears (carefully) with the included scissors to \\&quot;level\\&quot; them out. Fairly recently, I went down one size with the guides--my hair grows back well. My relatives and ladyfriend think that I do a pretty good job....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the \\&quot;cape,\\&quot; I obtained a cheap sheet set and cut a hole in the fitted sheet--the flat sheet is for the floor (to gather clippings). Afterwards, I shake these out thoroughly into a large trash can and then launder--the lint trap catches the remaining hair. Also, I use a \\&quot;Red\\&quot; exercise chair (a swivel exercise chair)--an office chair is OK, too. (Given I&#x27;m at home alone, I go \\&quot;Rambo\\&quot;--why get hair on my clothes anyway?!) After brushing hair from the clippers with the small brush, stowing the set away, and ridding the area of hairs (especially when I let my hair \\&quot;go\\&quot; too long), I shower directly afterwards to shed any smaller hairs left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now interested in exploring different cuts, techniques, and obtaining some other \\&quot;pro\\&quot; equipment--cape, etc.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so I could cut my own hair ... mine is simple, nothing layered or complicated.  All I need is a 4, 3, and 2 guard.  But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this thing is great!  It literally pays for it self in 1 or 2 uses, depending on what you typically pay for haircuts.  It cuts great, no pulls or tugs on my hair through 3 uses (at the time of this review).  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 starts in my book is because the packaging is prone to breaking some of the guards.  When I got the item, all of the guards and loose pieces were in one bag, which is okay usually, but in this case multiple guards got caught in one another and one was broken from all of that tangle.  The guards are not insanely flimsy, but they are not exactly strong either, so I would just say be careful with them and beware when you take the guards out in case they are tangled in one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well, although it will take me a while to figure out and get used to the many different settings! I wish it had a battery option is the only suggestion that I have for the manufacturers.</li>
    <li> Only used it once but it worked well and was easy to operate.</li>
    <li> Works very well and has many tips and components for a versatile trimmer set.  The case is nice too but the only downside is there is no way to easily organize the various length attachments in the case, the clippers fit in well but you just have to squeeze the rest of the stuff in any way you can.</li>
    <li> It is a decent clipper for the price. I buy the same one from Wahl every year at this time! That is about how long they last if you aren&#x27;t oiling them or a little piece inside breaks and bounces around. I use it for trimming my hair at home between visits to my barber and I also use it for my beard.</li>
    <li> First one started to rust before use and had to send it back. Got a replacement and is holding up well. The guards help make parring down hair disaster free and I like the long cord as my outlet is a bit a ways away from the cutting station</li>
    <li> Works great! I like the color coding for the different sizes. My husband&#x27;s hair is thick. No bogging down.</li>
    <li> This could possibly turn out to be the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. I pay about $18 every month to my barber who basically runs a #2 over my melon and calls it good. I&#x27;m pretty sure I can do an equally fine job of that. This set is high quality and includes everything you&#x27;ll need except a cape (just use a towel).</li>
    <li> These clippers come with everything. The motor is powerful and cut cleanly. I&#x27;ve been using them about 6 months. I&#x27;m sure I could find even nicer clippers, but I couldn&#x27;t have found a better deal.</li>
    <li> It is indeed a powerful machine. Cuts smoothly with the help of attachments. A stealer deal at this price. It also came with scissor (mine came with one broken handle that&#x27;s why deducted 1 star) and 2 combs which is also plus point.</li>
    <li> it is well to use. however, if you want to cut two people&#x27;s hair together, the machine is a little bit hot.</li>
    <li> Works well for the occasional trim</li>
    <li> Replaced another trimmer and the improvement was terrific. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Gets hot quickly so it does take awhile to complete the job, and the attachments are very cheaply made. I am giving this 3 stars because I was able to do what I needed, but definitely will not recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This thing is a powerhouse. I have thick curly hair, and this cuts with no pull. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> My wife is terrible at cutting my hair, but I don&#x27;t care.  This thing has paid for itself, and I have high hopes for better haircuts in the future....</li>
    <li> Had to give five stars mainly because of the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Price&lt;br /&gt;+ Included accessories and hard case&lt;br /&gt;+ Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Head too narrow&lt;br /&gt;- Cut length adjustment lever is plastic; I purchased this clipper because this broke on my previous clippers</li>
    <li> Been using this on my self and my boy for four years. He dropped it and now it&#x27;s broken and misaligned but for the price, I&#x27;m just buying a new one instead of fixing the one I have. Excellent product! Buying again as soon as I finish typing this.</li>
    <li> Works great. The clips are a bit sharp and it hurts sometimes.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price I paid!</li>
    <li> Good clippers, Wahl makes good products, but the is obviously the entry level product. It will be fine for an average consumer, but the plastic leaves much to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, Many different guards, clean cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the side switch, and the plastic head adjustment feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The smallest guard was made with too low of tolerance, so it&#x27;s sloppy in place, it will actually fall off if you aren&#x27;t holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other, I don&#x27;t know if this is a con or not, but the tips of the blades are terribly sharp, and scratch me up pretty good if I&#x27;m reverse trimming any body hair. That the tips, not the cutting edge.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a great machine, my son had previously owned one and it burned after so much use, he cuts hair as a barber but it lasted him a long time and i ordered this one for him.</li>
    <li> Works great and comes with everything you&#x27;ll need and also has a nice carrying case.</li>
    <li> For the money I&#x27;ve saved in the last couple years of using this I could have taken a trip somewhere. Solidly built and seems it will last forever. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> it is too much loudly , it is banging my head</li>
    <li> I bought this to cut my poodle-mix&#x27;s hair. Worked very well except for with the shorter guards, which just required more often cleaning. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. It will save me from 2+ groomer visits a month.</li>
    <li> I have never owned an electric razor like this before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  Because I am new to these, I can tell you that from a novice&#x27;s viewpoint, this trimmer is excellent.  The color-coded guide combs (hair length attachments) make trimming SOOO easy!  No idea why I waited so long to purchase these.</li>
    <li> This clipper has paid for itself ten fold and then some. Easy to use clipper, after months of repeated use these clippers are still holding up. Keep in mind I do service them before and after every use.</li>
    <li> great clippers heavy duty</li>
    <li> good set-I don&#x27;t use them much</li>
    <li> Wow, I have bought much worse razors for much more, I will never not buy a Wahl again. In fact, judging by the feel, weight, and general construction of this, I may never need to! This thing is rugged, and clearly powerful. Way more powerful than any razor in this price range, and I love the color coded clips, it keeps me from making serious mistakes.</li>
    <li> Cuts my beard well enough.</li>
    <li> Great bang for your buck. Does everything I need it to do. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent but pity it was 120V, bought it for use in a 240V country.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product which is heavy so you know it is there and can control it.  It comes with plenty of attachments to allow you to taper your cutting!</li>
    <li> Excellent cost performance.  We use this for three family members, and so have already saved more than the cost of the product.  The only minus is that it&#x27;s really loud.  Willing to live with that, given the overall value we&#x27;re enjoying.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I can easily remove body hair and trim where I want to.</li>
    <li> Great clipper, comes with everything I need</li>
    <li> This is the best!! I love that it comes in different colors for each attachment so I can remember easier which ones I like to use the next time I do a haircut.</li>
    <li> Great Product for its price</li>
    <li> I found this clipper when we moved into our house and assumed it was a dog clipper because the previous tenant was also a trainer at a kennel we were hired at... so I&#x27;ve been using these clippers on my dogs and rabbits! My husband LOVES these clippers for his hair and face, too. Imagine my surprise when I come on here looking for a replacement blade and find it&#x27;s marketed for people! LOL VERY nice clippers the only peeve I have is the little switch that moved the blade up and down on ours doesn&#x27;t stay where it&#x27;s suppose to so when I clip my rabbits it&#x27;s a pain, but again, I didn&#x27;t realize this was for people! For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it! This brand makes dog clippers too. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in New Zealand :(  Not worth sending back</li>
    <li> Good product. Works great,definitely a lot more powerful that the Wahl beard and hair trimmers that have a rechargeable battery. Lots of attachments, and easy to use instructions. Works just like it should, no unnecessary attachments or any such frivolous items.</li>
    <li> just used 2 times and can already notice the wear on the motor.. the machine got much slower then it was when new.</li>
    <li> easy to follow for the type of cut needed and did a great job is what I wanted for small jobs</li>
    <li> This clipper works well, but when the guard is off to trim my neck does not get close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far have been happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about those buyers who rated this product below 5*, but then again, everyone is entitled of their own opinion. THis hair clipper is wonderful, Unlike the \\&quot;ANDIS\\&quot;(I shed 50 bucks a piece- I own a couple)its heats up so fast and it needed some adjusting after overheating or it wont cut.I burned my side burn once. This clipper does not do that. I love it, it cuts great and the price is reasonable.SO I gave it a whopping 5 * baby!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because if was beginning to be a strain taking my son, who has development delays, to the barbershop. Waiting for our turn to sit in the chair was always a challenge because my son never wanted to sit the entire time. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the wait or the high cost of a hair cut without a shape up. The guards are color coded and the instructions include pictures. I love my Wahl and now I&#x27;m thinking about ordering one for my son who is in college.</li>
    <li> I have used it monthly for 15 months and it continues to work as well as it did on day 1</li>
    <li> It feels sturdy and quality. The package comes with every length of trimmer you might need. The unit itself feels like it will run forever. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Still cuts but it is loud, went on line for info. Cleaned, oiled and adjusted as recommended, I have 3 Wahl&#x27;s and all have the same problem after a few cuts. I will look for a higher end clipper.</li>
    <li> Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first electrical hair cutter. Before this I either use a comb and scissor with a mirror to cut my hair. But it&#x27;s very risky since it&#x27;s very easy to cut my own flesh, especially when I&#x27;m in a hurry. Moreover, my scissor + comb approach has great difficult cutting my hair even and smooth. With this new electric hair cutter, I was able to cut my hair within a short period of time and it&#x27;s safe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several things which I feel might be helpful:&lt;br /&gt;(1) The lubrication oil should always be added to the blade every time I finish my hair cut and clean the hair residue, so that the oil &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; the blade to make it sharp and function smoothly next time.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Add a few droplets of oil every time I start my new hair cut, so that I can be sure that the blades are lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;(3) The holding position of the hand is a bit critical. If I hold it too much in the front, I feel significant vibrations on my hand, which is not nice. So my adjusting my hand location, I hold it a little bit in the back near the stick labels. It might feel not very stable because the front end is heavier, but less vibration :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing is when I received this item, the blue cap with the stick label had fallen off. And the on of the snap-fits in the front was broken. Well, I used the super glue to glue the black cap and the white handle plastic together and they never separate any more!</li>
    <li> Thank you so very much!  Item shipped VERY fast and was exactly as described.  Hair cutting guide and fun colors make it easier to trip up fidgety toddler aged boys.</li>
    <li> I will make this brief. BUY IT! I have purchased so many of these cutters from various stores locally over the years. They dont cut, are noisy, the attachments flimsy,  come with very few attachments and just dont work. THIS IS THE BEST BUY in years. Amazonazing quality for a pittance!  Attachments are color coded and fit perfectly. It comes with scissors, oil, brush, comb...Oh my....what a buy!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine from Walmart, but it&#x27;s exactly the same. First time we used it, it worked fine but there was quite a difference between the second smallest comb and the smallest comb and we needed a size between. Second time, it started making a very loud buzzing noise and shaking violently. We had to turn it off and back on a couple times before it stopped. Now, that&#x27;s all it does. My boyfriend has given up me cutting his hair and has started going back to great clips.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic set and I&#x27;ve been using this for haircuts for the family for over a year.</li>
    <li> Bought in : March 2013&lt;br /&gt;This review : November 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this regularly over the past months. I use it to trim my hair. It has multiple attachments which means that a single unit could be used for different tasks. It is reliable and has had no problems till now. It has a long electrical cord, it is not bulky, and it is convenient to use and to clean. It comes with a nice box of its own where the trimmer and all its accessories can be stored. It looks good, and seems powerful for its size. For its price, this is the best on the market.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is great. It is made of durable plastic and quality steel. The clipper stays sharp even after hundreds of uses</li>
    <li> Owned several Wahl clippers over the years similar to this one. I use it for male haircuts and I just switched over to this model this time. Blades are sharp, lasting well. I was hesitant about the multi colored guards, but now i really like them and they limit mistakes. It also seems like the cord isn&#x27;t getting all wadded up as easily as other Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> Great product, have been using it for a year regularly. Still does the job well. 5*</li>
    <li> Item is as described and was a great deal!</li>
    <li> Use this to cut my son and husbands hair. Does the job and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Nice hair cutting kit with many different length to choose from.</li>
    <li> large in size, but good product</li>
    <li> Works well lasted me two years and still trimming haha!</li>
    <li> Does a reasonably good job.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazin I love them.&lt;br /&gt;With this you product you ddon&#x27;t need to take your kids to barber shop</li>
    <li> Overall great product.  The case is a bit on the small side so it is a pain to get everything back inside.  This is a pretty small complaint though as the functionality is great.</li>
    <li> I does the job. the cutting blade is a bit crooked at times and I find myself needing to adjust it before every cut. I had a Wahl set before which lasted about 10 years before finally blowing up mid-way through a hair cut. This one doesn&#x27;t feel as great as the other one but it fixed my half shaved head.</li>
    <li> These are really great clippers for the price. They have functioned great so far. My favorite part is that they come with so many different attachments. I&#x27;ve had a similar pair of Oster clippers for some time, but they didn&#x27;t come with nearly the number of guards that this kit does. It&#x27;s nice having them color-coded as well.</li>
    <li> This is everything the home barber needs. It has multiple attachments for most haircutting needs.</li>
    <li> What a great deal, this is by far the best place to buy clippers. Gave myself a haircut and the clippers feel great in my hands, nice and sturdy. The kit comes with everything you need. The blades are nice and sharp and cut hair smoothly. I would recommend this too anyone on the markey for good affordable clippers.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Gets a little warm after about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to give himself haircuts, and it works very well. No complaints of pulling hair! Lots of attachments to do specific tasks. It&#x27;s a well-built hair cutter.</li>
    <li> ORDERED BY MISTAKE ..... RETURNED HOME UNOPENED....</li>
    <li> it did not work for me because the top adjustment its still not enough to keep my hair long or medium long on the front so it looks like I have a military cut almost. Little bit more of an effort than I expected but I&#x27;m sure if you wanted to just use it to maintain a short haircut it would be</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have purchased so far.</li>
    <li> These work great!  I love the colored attachments because it makes it easy to find the one I need without having to look at the sizes in small print.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.. It&#x27;s been a month and no issues so far..</li>
    <li> I have already received the product and am satisfied with the purchase, thanks</li>
    <li> Sturdy clippers at a good price.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor . very good price. recommended product</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good razor since it has so many reviews. As far as i know, mine aren&#x27;t very sharp, but i guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Awesome buzzer for the price.  Really a great deal as it comes with a lot of attachments, scissors, and a comb.  I just use it for very basic cuts so for my purposes, it is awesome.</li>
    <li> This broke after only a month of normal (not heavy) use. It&#x27;s pretty cheaply made and not at all like the old sturdy Wahl my husband was using before I bought this one.The only thing we&#x27;ve ended up using is all the guards it came with. :(</li>
    <li> A very good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have shaved my thick head of hair to be bald every other week for 5 years and 8 months and the cord is just now starting to break. It isn&#x27;t even the clippers&#x27; fault. It&#x27;s the way I was wrapping the cord around. This is the most satisfied I have ever been with a product. I will buy these for the rest of my voluntarily bald life.</li>
    <li> Ive used it about 5 times and it paid for itself after the first use. Heavy (solid) feel. Feel&#x27;s like something the pros would use.</li>
    <li> Very happy to own this item.</li>
    <li> I use these clippers on a regular basis (every month or so). I think they are well made and an excellent value. They come as advertised and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> worked like it should</li>
    <li> Not recommended at all. Cheap? Yes. As soon you use it you will know why.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer, I save a lot of money by cutting my hair myself.  Once you learn all the tricks it&#x27;s pretty simple to do a short/style haircut.  I still mess up occasionally and have to buzz my hair, but that is totally user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a wide range of attachments and you can adjust the cutting blades&#x27; length to prevent having any hair length lines between changing the guard attachments.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast as usual, but this specific product was used upon arrival. The second I opened and saw scratch marks, bits and pieces of brown hair I sealed it back up and returned it. Never buying a Wahl product again.</li>
    <li> Used these clippers a handful of times already shaving my head. They are very powerful and give a big kick when you hit the power switch (almost frighteningly so). The case could be better designed. It kind of just holds everything like a bag, there are no placeholders for the clipper or the accessories, so it gets messy in the case. Compared to my old clippers I can definitely go faster when cutting my hair, but I find that I must go over the same parts more times since the clippers seem to miss a few hairs. I really have to go over my entire head with a &amp;#34;fine tooth comb&amp;#34; to make sure I got everything. I&#x27;m not sure why that is, even when I go slowly it still misses pieces of hair. Other than that very nice and cheap.</li>
    <li> Works great for my daily head shave!</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl, I cut my own hair, I probably had the first one for about 6 or 7 years. After many drops and use, I needed to get a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for about 6 months to cut my own hair.  I don&#x27;t understand the other reviews that complain that its too loud.  I&#x27;ve had many clippers over the years and this one no louder that any of them.  The clippers cut smooth and the color coded combs are a help too.  So if you want to cut your own hair for cost saving and conveinence this clipper is tough to beat!!</li>
    <li> Wow great price and best clippers we have bought.</li>
    <li> I got these on Amazon for less than $17.  I echo the other reviews that say these feel well-made.  I wish clippers game with more than 8 drops of oil.  Comes with a pair of scissors, two combs, and many different guards for different lengths.  I have used these only 3 times myself, and twice on my son, but already got my money&#x27;s worth, if a haircut is worth $3.33.  Some might say a haircut is worth more than that.  The more I use these the cheaper each haircut is.  That&#x27;s economics.  Last pair I had, (WAHL) lasted 150 cuts and cost $30, that&#x27;s 20 cents per.  Just make sure you oil the blades when finished.</li>
    <li> Great Clippers and i would recommend these. Excellent job Wahl on the different hair types and the clippers cut real close. Hence the title.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this a long time ago. My haircut is simple.&lt;br /&gt;Now I get to clean up at home whenever I want to and can do this every single day if I want.&lt;br /&gt;This paid for itself in just 2 haircuts. Again......I should have bought this a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;High quality. Easy to use. Perfect for home use.</li>
    <li> I shopped around a lot for something like this. It does the job well and shows no sign of wear after about 10 uses. HOWEVER, it&#x27;s so loud I almost can&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;m not fussy and I wouldn&#x27;t normally mind that sort of thing as long as it did the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I reckon it&#x27;s louder than our vacuum. I would send pi t back but I live overseas so it&#x27;s not cost effective. I Hope it&#x27;s just mine and that it works for everyone else.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these clippers.</li>
    <li> Very solid, great product, and easy to use.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> The clippers work great.  They are super sharp and cut well.  I have not used any of the accessories yet.  But I am sure they are up to par as well.  Great value for the low cost paid.</li>
    <li> Works great , Easy to handle .Also not heavy to work with , fits in your hand good . Color coded helps to determent how short you want to cut the hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect as mentioned in the item description.... Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought two of this unit.. TWO. and they were both extremely useless in cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;as a torture device I&#x27;d give it 5 stars,  It&#x27;s so LOUD to the point that it is deafening and it pulls hair instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;I hope someone will give an explanation for this.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the weight of the trimmer.  I had and older one probably from the 60&#x27;s that finally died on me.  I was expecting the new one to feel a little cheaper in all honesty.  This new one is every bit as heavy as the old one has a solid feel with a rubberized grip to make it even more comfortable.  Quite satisfied.  We use this as a home trimmer; couple uses a month.  well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> had these clippers for a while now, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Very shaky. I used to be annoyed by it.</li>
    <li> It worked great...and my husband finally got his hair cut!  :)  So he&#x27;s definitely happy! Love the way it cuts and works.</li>
    <li> I have light hair in the front and top of my scalp. I always keep telling whomever cuts my hair to avoid cutting in that area. Hair cut is a headache as I need to wait and always risk too short or too long hair cut. I decided to give this machine a try and it turn out its easy to use actually (on my own hair). It comes with 8 guards and another 2 for tapered cut around ears. I was reluctant the first time although i did great, but with the second use I am now confident doing my own hair cut at home. I can repeat it whenever I want without paying or waiting or even explaining to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like going to barbers or if you have children, you will enjoy this machine. You will also save money!&lt;br /&gt;It feels solid and well designed. You can use it on any hair on your body too. Oh, it comes with scissors and combs too.&lt;br /&gt;Great discovery for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend to cut my hair, and despite her protests it saves me a ton of money. As cheap as these clippers are, I don&#x27;t even care how bad of a job she does and uneven she may cut it!</li>
    <li> good service and product</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these clippers.  I cut my own hair and so when someone gives me a compliment on my haircut I want to bust out my new clippers and whip my head to the camera (if only there was a camera) and shout &amp;#34;Thanks, Wahl Color Pro!&amp;#34; followed by a wink and a cheesy product jingle.</li>
    <li> I had never used a clipper before but wanted to be able to give myself a basic buzz cut.  I got hung up on negative product reviews and didn&#x27;t know which clipper to buy, finally deciding on the Wahl 79300-400. I am so happy with it that I couldn&#x27;t not offer a complimentary review. The clipper is sturdy and powerful. That SNAP when it&#x27;s turned on is the strong motor coming to life. The blades were perfectly aligned; and I was a bit surprised at the preciseness of the cut, so they are sharp. I was unclear how short I could go and was happy to find a 1/16&amp;#34; guide comb. Seems like shorter than that is baldy sour, so I&#x27;m all set. I&#x27;ve used the clipper a bunch of times by now with no problems. Great product.</li>
    <li> Cuts through hair like butter. I upgraded from a poor quality one and very impressed with the whal. Good design.</li>
    <li> Works really well, especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> Save me money and time by doing it at home</li>
    <li> great lightning deal 50% off and its a Wahl product</li>
    <li> A complete kit featuring quality components.  Much better than the cheaper import haircutting kits at a bargain cost.  Glad we bought this kit.</li>
    <li> Excellent smooth hair clipper. Wireless would be much better</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice set for the money.Have no idea what ALL the colored attachments are for, but it has the ones I need so when I get tired of putting all the other ones back in the case I&#x27;ll throw them away.</li>
    <li> Learned to cut my hair in a matter of minutes and cut the back which I always have trouble with using just scissors. The results were gratifying. Nice taper without much effort. I used some u tube vids from the Clipper Guy to guide me in conjunction with the instructions that came with. My only complaint is that the carrying case seems a little bit to short to hold the clipper in place and it sits a slight angle. I&#x27;d also like to see a rack to mount the guide combs instead of a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> There is no information about the input voltage for this product. We bought this product for using in India and its no use. I might have not ordered this product if the Input Voltage has been mentioned in the product description. I might return this product once I come to USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I have tried to find the info about input voltage in Wahl.com too. But no luck.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of haircuts on friends and dorm-mates with many different hair types. This worked like a dream on all of them.</li>
    <li> The item worked wonderfully well the first time I used it. A week later, I turned it on and it broke. The motor stopped moving the blades after a single use. I got a grand total of five minutes of use before it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> Adjustable blade.  Has all the combs down to No. 1/2--in other words 1/8 inch.  Wahl clippers run at a very high speed so they cut evenly and do well.  This is a great pair of relatively cheap clippers.  I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> very good product for the price, I saw this outside amazon por like 300% more than the price listed on amazon, I have to tell that its a little noisy but it does a great job</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago (Jan. 09) and it performs great every time I use it. I use it probably once or twice a month. I keep my hair short all around (use the #1 attachment) and I always get a nice cut thanks to this clipper. Whenever I&#x27;m asked where I get my hair cuts, people are always surprised that such a great hair cut is done by myself at home (though, the girlfriend helps with my shape up at the back of my head ). This clipper has saved me hundreds in hair cuts already and if it were to fail anytime soon, I would not hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recognize that this is for heads of hair, but this product is easily the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It costs about the same as other beard trimmers I&#x27;ve owned but because it is built for thick heads of hair, it makes trimming my beard take literally seconds. I also enjoy that it has a cord because I have a terrible time with leaving the cord at various places during travel or destroying the battery life from leaving it plugged into the wall for too long. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable base for varying levels of five o&#x27;clock shadow and a clip on pieces for a little more depth in man-scaping other areas of the body.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. Perfect for cutting my son and fiance&#x27;s hair. My son says I finally have clippers that don&#x27;t pull his hair. The color coded sizes are very convenient too.</li>
    <li> been using this for months. its last this long so 5 stars. really nice guard sets with colors and comb and scissor. affordable and durable. does not get that hot. i recommend that u buy the 1 and 1/2 inch guard, number 12 from Wahl. 1 inch guards are too short for me, its a buzz cut all around.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a great value this clipper set is.  There are all the color-coded guard sizes, plus an ear trimmer guard and a graded guard to avoid leaving a clear line around the head.  It cuts beautifully and we are thrilled.  I have no formal training but cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel the need to pay $15+ every time I need to get my hair trimmed. This trimmer comes with everything you need to give yourself a decent haircut. Must have for guys on a budget.</li>
    <li> I chose to give this kit five stars because it totally deserves it! I purchased this haircutting kit to use on my son who is almost 3 years old. It&#x27;s a HUGE ordeal to take him somewhere to get his haircut because he has sensory issues and literally has meltdowns when he gets his hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better product, this one is very quiet and easy to use. The noise doesn&#x27;t bother him and this is the seventh one we have tried and it is the quietest one. The others were very loud and scared my son. He also likes how the clipper guards are colorful and he will play with them while I cut his hair. I also like how they are color coded as it is easy to identify which guard I want to use.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair with a clipper we bought many, many, years ago. The 1/4 inch attachment broke a while back, so we decided to replace the whole set. Ours was very old. This acts like it is going to be really good. The price was great. I had just cut his hair before we ordered, so it will be a while before we try it.</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t vibrate, grips well. I can give myself a good 6 dollar haircut already, but I am improving my skills.</li>
    <li> Works just as it should: easy to clean, easy to set up, easy to use. Also, the colors and numbers really help when you are trying to find the right length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when I turned the clipper on it would sometimes make a really loud and annoying noise. This I believe happens when the top and bottom portion of the clipper is very slightly misaligned. To avoid this from happening just hold the clipper in the front portion of the body with one hand while you press the button with the other. When I started turning it on this way, it worked perfectly and never had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must get!</li>
    <li> I have used this clipper for over a year and have had nothing but the perfect cut everytime.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several clippers in the past 10 years and none have measured to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color coated guards and the guard chart on the clippers are great so you don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting which ones are which.&lt;br /&gt;The design is very fitting for your hands. Doesn&#x27;t seem to get to hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they do what they need to do.</li>
    <li> I got it for my beard it&#x27;s got all sorts of attachments even ones for going round the ear.  The quality seems very good I can imaging it will last me for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer works great. The motor is strong and the blades cut well, they must be nice and sharp. I have never had it catch on my skin and cut me like I have had with a few other ones I have tried. Also, it cuts the hairs and does not pull or tug on them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for several years.  I just bought two more to put on the shelf.  I&#x27;m retiring a Conair because it is starting to get dull and it&#x27;s cheaper to just buy new clippers.  What I like about this Wahl is that it comes with a 1/16&amp;#34; piece.  Most kits stop at 1/8th inch.  It is quiet, more quite than some clippers I&#x27;ve had, and doesn&#x27;t seem to need to be cleaned quite as often as other clippers I&#x27;ve had.  I cut my hair and the hair of my two boys.  I&#x27;ve been doing so for about 12 years.  You do have to make multiple passes with the Wahl but that is no big deal when you save the cost of the clippers with one or two haircuts and then go on to save hundreds before the cutters become too dull to cut well.  For the price you&#x27;re not getting professional quality clippers and attachments, but you&#x27;re getting clippers and attachments that are quite good for cutting your&#x27;s and family members hair.  Before the Conair I had one other set of clippers.  That makes two sets of clippers I&#x27;ve retired.  I&#x27;m guessing that the Wahl i&#x27;m currently using and two new backups I&#x27;ve purchased will together last the rest of my life.  I won&#x27;t have to cut my kid&#x27;s hair forever, just my own.  BTW, on myself I use the 1/16&amp;#34; attachment and use it to cut my hair all the same length.  When I first started I used the 1/2&#x27;, 3/8&amp;#34;, 1/4&amp;#34;, and then the 1/8&amp;#34; (until I got the Wahl with 1/16&amp;#34;) and cut my hair 1/2&amp;#34; in length and then I tapered the back and sides. I&#x27;ve tried using the attachments that are greater than 1/2&amp;#34; on the kids but have had mixed results.  I think the 1/2&amp;#34; and smaller attachments work best.  If you want hair longer than that I suggest doing a scissor cut and then using the clippers to taper the sides and back if tapering is desired.  Lastly, one of my boys has very thick hair.  The Conair had a tough time with his hair but this Wahl had no problem at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl for cutting all my boys hair.  It is pretty good, but not as good as the one I bought at the beauty store.</li>
    <li> Very Good  product, has a sufficient amount of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Best brand in the market.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that it is only 127V.</li>
    <li> didnt even have this trimmer for a few months and it is already broken, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had started cutting my own hair sooner.  This does the job. I just watched some utube videos on how to do it with short hair.</li>
    <li> Pros: Cutter itself is very solid, the power cable means you never have to deal with batteries (I&#x27;d rather be stabbed in the face than deal with batteries), and the color coding takes away the pain-in-the-ass that would probably result if you had THAT many identical colored attachments and had to read through them each time to find the one you were looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Said &amp;#34;attachments&amp;#34; feel extremely flimsy. I&#x27;m hoping that there would be a way to order just one of them from the manufacturer in the event that I managed to break one, whether in use or in the carrying case since everything literally just goes in--there are no slots inside it to hold anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied, just have to be careful with those delicate pieces of plastic.</li>
    <li> it is the greatest one!&lt;br /&gt;I had one clipper before and that one sucks!&lt;br /&gt;so I decide to change another one. Wahi really impressed me a lot</li>
    <li> There are missing pieces that didn&#x27;t come enclosure, isn´t ther a quality check to stop this from happening? The hair cutter it&#x27;s ok thou</li>
    <li> I used to buy cheap clipper sets at clearance stores but realized the no brand name clippers got dull really quick and did not work that good. I decided to buy a name brand and give it a try. So far no hair pulling and they work great. Lots of accessories that I will probably never use but nice to have if needed.</li>
    <li> this thing is really good; I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap.  It&#x27;s got attachments up the ying yang. About 12 different clipper guides at various depths, a comb, nice scissors, a guide for doing around your ears (or my ears). I groom the dog on my own now and save $50 a clip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but it actually works pretty well, it&#x27;s the problem with my son sitting long enough for me to use it.</li>
    <li> As most of the other reviews state, this works wonders and pays for itself in just 2 uses. I use this on my husband for the sides, and then use the scissors to cut the top to 1.5 in. I will probably go out and buy a better pair of scissors, as the one that comes with the kit is, I think, just to get you by. I use his original Wahl beard trimmer to do around the ears and edging as that device is smaller and allows for finer detail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that, from time to time when I turn it on, it is really loud. Usually it stops after I turn it back on again--possibly it needs to be oiled. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This brand is the best! I bought this haircutting kit for my home. the only thing that I don´t like so much its feel little heavy</li>
    <li> Great price, shipped fast, and they work great. I was shocked the first time I turned them on, incredibly powerful and I could instantly tell that I had good clippers.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail a week ago, and I&#x27;ve given myself a haircut with them since then---and it&#x27;s a great quality kit. Initially when I found this I thought that the price tag meant this would be a horrible quality toy of a haircutting kit, but since it was so cheap I bought it anyways. Once it came in the mail though, I was surprised by the quality of construction in the hair clipper, its attachments, and the small and informative instructional guide on how to use the kit. It comes with more than enough sizes and fancy attachments than I would ever really need (an eyebrow attachment is even included), but best of all it works great. In function it feels sturdy, and the attachments with the clipper fit securely and cut evenly, while not being excessively loud or untamely (it doesn&#x27;t jump all over the place or something wacky like that). Overall, I highly recommend this product from Wahl, as it works fantastic for me and looks like it will last for a long time to come---two thumbs up!    UPDATE:  After having this kit for months now, I can confidently say it is worth every penny I spent on it. The clipper is intact, and it functions properly just as it did from day 1. This has saved me a lot of money on getting haircuts, and I plan to continue saving money as the months go by---just as before, two thumbs up for Wahl.</li>
    <li> Finally, I now have a real quality hair trimmer.  I bought a cordless Remington that barely works and doesn&#x27;t cut hair.  It had to go in the garbage because the battery barely worked, and the connection didn&#x27;t work anyways.  The cordless last a month or two, and still cuts hair bad.  This power machine is what the barbers get...I&#x27;ll have this for life probably, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it losing power.  The kit is easier and the parts are as well...I cut and shaped my own hair in a few minutes...perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never cared much for going to get my haircut mostly for cost.  I typically just buzz it off anyway to make it last longer before the next cut, which was often well overdue.  The cost of a simple buzz cut has risen enough for me to declare it crazy, this cost just over a single visit, so using it twice (already used it three times) has saved money and kept my hair/look more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers came with good basic instructions to follow for someone (me) who doesn&#x27;t know how to cut their own hair, these were clear and had a few good tips, including maintaining the clippers.  The case is nice, and easily packs back up without trying to puzzle the different parts until they magically fit.  The downside here, is I have found no nice way to coil the cord so I tend to push it in last in whatever shape it ends up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfying CLICK when you turn it on, just like a professional&#x27;s clippers.  It is quite heavy/solid, which I view as a good thing.  Feels like it will last me as long as I need it, assuming I don&#x27;t go throwing it at the floor...</li>
    <li> We had no experience with haircutting.  This clipper set includes everything needed to make it easy to come out with a decent if not professional looking haircut.  The only drawback is the weight of the clipper - it is pretty hefty, but the shape makes it easy to handle.  Instructions are quite clear and detailed.  For the price of less than one haircut, this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Good stuff. Almost too many accessories if you ask me, but I recommend it. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> useful  i can save much dollar.....recommand it</li>
    <li> I would rate it high if all the hair guides comes ok. In addition, I don&#x27;t know where  or how to to get the replacement since I do not like to return and replace the whole package. The plastic hair guides can be easily break since they are loosely packaged into a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Instructions provide a professional-looking haircut.  Unless you are appearing on TV or running for a political position this product will provide a good presence while paying for itself after the second use</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; is replacing a cheaply made hair clipper, and it really works great ! I&#x27;d absolutely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for all my manscaping needs.</li>
    <li> Works great!!  Makes cutting hair simple.</li>
    <li> Being a family with limited funds, buying hair clippers wasn&#x27;t exactly in our budget.  However, when I saw everything this package has to offer for such an attractive price, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I like to give myself a short buzz every once in awhile to save some money on going to a barber for such a simple trim. First use - worked fine. I was washing my face and accidentally splashed a little water on the unit (it was closer than I thought). I quickly dried it off.  The next night I was brushing my teeth and I looked at it and saw some orange in the blade area. I looked closer and it was rust. AND A LOT OF IT! I&#x27;d say about 60% of it now is orange. I&#x27;ve had previous Wahl products last much longer before the rust showed up. This is pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(here comes the generic answer from their customer server rep)</li>
    <li> I ordered in a Monday, on Wednesday I already had a new hair cut! Great! Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now using it once a week to shave my head. This has worked perfectly with no issues whatsoever. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> These clippers were a great purchase. They are pretty heavy duty for the price you pay. I could not believe how well they worked also. I cut my own hair with it and it actually came out nice. I have already made my money back because going to a barber would have cost the price I paid. Inexpensive, well made, easy to use, such a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I am sure it is a great shaver, but I purchased it after I saw the voltage will fit Where I am from. However, it makes really loud noise and smoke was coming out and it was also painful to use</li>
    <li> had the same set, SINCE HIGH SCHOOL...but they finally gave out on me...had to but another set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully these will last another 15 years</li>
    <li> product works great and easily cleanable. only wish it had a few more options for short hair.  i am stuck between two sizes that are either too short or too long but no big deal</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, well made feels and looks good in my hand comes with every thing any one would need from hair and beard trimming to buzzing the hair off your body smoothly with out a nick or scratch, and it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I never cut hair before my son was born 3.5yrs ago.  For the first 3yrs I cut his hair with scissors -- not very good results.  Then I bought this electric razor and the haircuts are MUCH better.  It&#x27;s easy to learn to use, it&#x27;s quick , and good results.  I don&#x27;t find the cord a problem (although I know a cordless version is available).</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had a very expensive haircutting kit for a couple of years that is mostly used for cutting dad&#x27;s hair...short and close to the scalp.  The expensive shaver always seemed to hesitate and ended up pulling hair, making dad yell &amp;#34;Ow&amp;#34;.  This was much less expensive, cuts much better, includes everything you need.  Good choice over more expensive kits.</li>
    <li> Quality hair trimmer set. Paid $18 . Worth 2x that. Come with everything you need, that fits in a hard plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have 4 boys ages 2-14, plus my husband that all got hair cuts last weekend, with the Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro. I can&#x27;t say enough about this trimmer. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. Blades very sharp and the motor purrs quietly, not scaring my little 2 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We usually spend around $10-15 for haircuts, that&#x27;s $50-75 every couple months. We are a single income, and we are trying to make every dollar count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus is the kiddos like naming off the colors of the adapters.</li>
    <li> No more barber for my kids. I&#x27;m a hair cutting machine now. Great value for price. Cuts really nice and comes with instructions</li>
    <li> I use this little fellow for trimming my beard. It has enough accoutrements to do more but it functions wonderfully for the limited amount I do with it.</li>
    <li> Hair cutter works great. It has a good amount of power. The unit itself was not in great shape when it got to my house. The cover plate to protect the blades was broken and the front panel displaying the chart with the color and corresponding cut length was scratched up and hard to read. Over-all I was just glad to have a cutter that cuts rather than pull your hair out by the roots!</li>
    <li> Awesome....Being a stylist this is perfect hair cutting kit</li>
    <li> I have only used it once so far on my toddler son&#x27;s hair but I love that I can even buzz the top part of his hair, because there are so many different options</li>
    <li> $17 to buzz my hair as close as possible for as far into the forceable future as I desire? Sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked perfectly. Cheaper than going to any barbershop/salon/whatever to have them chop all your hair off.</li>
    <li> Not bad for what it cost.</li>
    <li> meets expectations, 100% recommended</li>
    <li> Great Product All Youll Ever Need For A Decent Haircut In One Totally Worth IT.</li>
    <li> 100% ROI on this. Still using it.</li>
    <li> Saved some good money cutting myself.  Well my hair that is.  These are invaluable, esp. when you don&#x27;t have too much time.</li>
    <li> By far the best deal I&#x27;ve ever gotten on Amazon. Was expecting a beard trimmer (because that&#x27;s what I searched for), and got a hair trimmer of great quality. It still trims my beard like a GQ model, and I&#x27;m gonna try the hair next. I&#x27;ll be cutting my own hair from now on.</li>
    <li> Very cheap fro the quality of this. My first one lasted 12 years (with a few sharpenings). Even works on dog hair.</li>
    <li> i switched from a battery powered one and this obviously performs better. the old one the guard broke off. these seem a bit less flimsy. it cuts very well. a good value</li>
    <li> Excellent machine and great accesories!</li>
    <li> Does what you expect, better quality than the competition. Keeps my hairy head neat. Love the colored combs, they prevent mistakes and don&#x27;t rattle/buzz when the clipper is running. My last Wahl came with lower quality combs that buzzed, this is much better.</li>
    <li> Two haircuts and it&#x27;s already paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;Easy-peezie. Color-coded system is easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even need a helper to get the back.</li>
    <li> How can so many reviews be wrong.  I returned these. Cheaply made and cuts horribly.  I have the Oster 76 and Andis T edgers, bought on Amazon a few years back. Both amazing clippers. However, Oster doesnt offer a blade in between sizes that i need and i can achieve it from a Wahl, 1/2 step with the level all the way up.  I&#x27;ve owned Wahl for over 20 years and they&#x27;ve always been solid and cut well. My last Wahl was so good I didn&#x27;t even use my Oster till it died.  The only thing this cuts, is corners. Spend more and get a better model.</li>
    <li> This is my first haircutting kit. I may not need another for a very long time. It&#x27;s affordable, suits all my needs, and is saving me money on going to the barber. And becoming comfortable with handling your own hair is definitely a fun plus.</li>
    <li> Most definitely satisfied.They cut well,and comes with the oil for the clippers.glad I purchased these.</li>
    <li> Big fan of Wahl hair trimmer products. I like this one since the color guards make it easy to find the right size without having to squint at the beveled number below. I like the hard case it came with too. Nice and compact. Well done Wahl and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better clippers out there, but this is a great deal for the money. I bought them to use on my horse, and there was no problem. Admittedly, my horse does not spook easily, and the clippers were a little loud, but they worked perfectly for trimming his fetlocks and mane.</li>
    <li> NOT NECESSARILY TO DO WITH THE KIT&lt;br /&gt;it was my first time cutting my boyfriends hair&lt;br /&gt;he is in the marines and gets a haircut&lt;br /&gt;every week, i kid you not&lt;br /&gt;i thought it would be a good investment&lt;br /&gt;so i could learn how to cut his hair, or so he could to save money.duh!&lt;br /&gt;i watched tutorials online, just look up the brand or military reg.haircut or whatever&lt;br /&gt;well it didnt go so well with the haircut&lt;br /&gt;after months of asking for a chance to cut his hair i was doing pretty good with the reverse fade,&lt;br /&gt;my broblem was trimming the top and matching the top length with the fade, and the cord was a bit short for our liking, we cut his hair in the living room, i plugged it in behind the couch and there was not that much extra cord left.&lt;br /&gt;so story goes: i messed up his hair, or rather left it to where it could still be saved, he paid for a fresh hair cut and we havent discussed it since :(</li>
    <li> great for our son who is a chewawa. can&#x27;t spell it. he has skin problems &amp; wahl is a great product for the money.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning this clipper.  It is cheap! The attachments poke into head while clipping. I do not recommend buying.</li>
    <li> Color coding and labeling on the clipper is very helpful. And very affordable. Arrived promptly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Sounds like a chainsaw, doesn&#x27;t cut hair. Honestly this thing sounds so bad it scares my girlfriend (and me).</li>
    <li> The ripper is better and cheaper.I like it.I will talk my friends if they wanna buy.The same one is first choice.</li>
    <li> I was in the US Marine Corps a while ago and it was mandatory to get a haircut every week. Since I left, I had this bad habit of getting a haircut every week just because I had been so accustom to getting them. Essentially the money spent on a barber adds up and I remembered people cutting their own hair all the time so I figured I can try too. So I bought this product and watched a few youtube videos on how to cut hair. Now I am pretty good at cutting hair and have not been to the barbershop in over two months. The product comes with easily distinguishable color coded sizes to cut your hair to whatever length you like.</li>
    <li> Works excellent. Have had this product for a couple months now and it still works great when I cut my boyfriends hair.</li>
    <li> Its been a while since I have been impressed with function of a shaver. This is the exception. The color keyed guards with key on the shaver is a great idea. Also the rubber grip is a nice touch, worked well, and did a great job. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Seriously what&#x27;s up with the noise!? It is EXTREMELY noisy, can&#x27;t believe how anyone pointed out when I read about this product.&lt;br /&gt;When I first turned on almost freak out, thought it was going to explode or something.</li>
    <li> Great deal and powerful enough to shave an (former)East German&#x27;s dome whose hair is as think as baling wire and stubborn as the US policy towards Cuba.</li>
    <li> This electric razor busted after 3 months of use. I shaved twice a month, so after 6 shavings it broke. The switch on the side stopped working efficiently after 2 months, and at 3 months it just stopped completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive? Sure, but don&#x27;t expect much quality.</li>
    <li> My son asked if I&#x27;d cut his hair rather than making him go to the barber, so I bought this. I&#x27;m not a hairdresser, but have cut his hair in the past with scissors and done a pretty good job.  The Wahl buzzers seemed to be rather easy, intuitive and foolproof.  Simply decide how long or short you want the hair and use the corresponding color-coded blade guard.  My first attempt we decided to keep things on the long side to leave plenty of room for error.  It was simple and quick to use, but he looked ridiculous. I feel like I followed the guidelines closely, so would have hoped the length looked more consistent throughout his head.  I chose the next shorter blade guard and tried again, but it still looked pretty bad.  I haven&#x27;t used it since, but have considered using in on the dog.  She doesn&#x27;t care so much how she looks, so if I mess up, she won&#x27;t be embarrassed!</li>
    <li> It is really good to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Simple, easy to use, and much quieter than previous Wahl trimmers that I have owned.</li>
    <li> many pieces i dont need any more.</li>
    <li> it looks cheap but works fine.</li>
    <li> These are great. The instruction book that came with it was even better! I was not able to find anything equal to it online. I can cut his hair without. referring to the book now .</li>
    <li> Does a good job, lots of attachments</li>
    <li> Men with shaved heads are sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....&#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> Works great. Comes with tons of guards. Great price too!</li>
    <li> Good and value for money</li>
    <li> Honestly, I just bought this to trim-shave my dog&#x27;s hair once in a while, and I just took it out of the box... It works wonderfully, you can tell it has heft to it and a good motor like it touts on the box. It&#x27;s also MUCH quieter than the buzzing you hear going on in barber shops, so it didn&#x27;t spook my dog at all. He was all good, all the way through, and they worked sharp and seamlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dog in question is a lhasa apso and a Dutch smoushond terrier, so his hair is thick, coarse, and a long coat - the blades had no problem giving it a trim to a thinner and smaller coat.</li>
    <li> Loved it till I stupidly left it buzzing on the counter – three seconds looking away and it vibrated it&#x27;s way off. Doesn&#x27;t look damaged except the blade-heads aren&#x27;t aligned anymore and make an X shape. Will be buying the same model as a replacement.</li>
    <li> The build quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;kit set is good.&lt;br /&gt;shaving by this Wahl nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOO MUCH LOUD NOISY SOUND!!! you cant cut hair near your ear unless you are deaf or thats what you want to be! I has the sound concret drilling</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull at hair at all. Shaved my sack without a guard comb and no issues A+</li>
    <li> Present to the son-in-law. I think he liked it.</li>
    <li> Well made item. Keeps running even though it&#x27;s been dropped a few times &amp; had a trip down the stairs once.</li>
    <li> Working great so far.  I use them to shave my head and cut off my beard on occasion.  I like the variety of guards that come with it.</li>
    <li> This was gift to son in law who loves it.  The color coded depth makes easy, consistent cuts.</li>
    <li> I had the same model of the clipper except one that was purchased 5 or 6 years ago before this and it finally gave in. I gave it 3 stars because it does the job, but it is MUCH MUCH louder than the old one, and I can&#x27;t understand why. It&#x27;s not as if it does the job any better or any worse, but the motor just generates a lot more noise which becomes irritating over time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pro at shaving my own head.  I think these clippers did a great job - before, my dog and I shared the same clippers (hey, I buy like to buy things that serve more than one purpose!), but she passed away and donated them to me.  I broke them after almost 3 years of use (dropped; didn&#x27;t quit or break from w&amp;t), and was hesitant to order these because of the price.  For my first shave (I go guardless), they did great - only one pass, cut evenly, easy to hold and use.  They didn&#x27;t get warm fast like my previous model, so that&#x27;s a plus.  Also, they include sooo many accessories, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this set.  I would recommend these to anyone who is a savings aficionado - they get the job done, are cheap, and if you take care of it, it will last you.  ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CLEAN YOUR CLIPPERS.</li>
    <li> Straight up had these for 6 years with no problems. Are there better clippers out there? For sure. Is there a better deal for good clippers at a great price? Surely not. Really thick hair peeps may want to step up to a more professional set but man what a deal. Oil and clean them and you are money all day! I&#x27;m forced to give them 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Watched a few videos on youtube to learn how to use it...  Cut both my kids hair and looks the same as the barber does.  Considering I normally drop $30 to get both boys hair cut, I spend about half that amount on these wahl clippers.  They seem like they will last for years to come so all future hair cuts are gravy at this point.  This will be a great money saver and we won&#x27;t wait as long between cuts so they will look fresh.</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly good razor for the price. It comes with a lot of well made attachments. Cutting hair feels almost too easy, like butter. You have to watch yourself or you&#x27;ll cut too much because of how little resistance you feel when cutting. It&#x27;s a comfortable weight, easy to hold, and self-explanatory to use. I am new at cutting hair, but have used multiple razors now and this one is the easiest and most sturdy quality. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> gift for son, he loved it.</li>
    <li> Well made and with lots of attachments, I use it for my beard and my head. The attachments snap on easily and are color coded to make it easy to choose the right one. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> My husband has my daughter cut his hair all the time and the Wahl clippers work good.</li>
    <li> I used this in the costume shop of our ballet company to sculpt faux fur on several animal costumes - wolf, fox, raccoon, and deer.  Basically, I punished this poor shaver beyond all its normal duties for a full month, and it kept on ticking.  In fact, it&#x27;s still alive and kicking, which is pretty miraculous, which means I won&#x27;t have to buy another one to make a bear next year.  ;-)  If it can stand up to this kind of abuse, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good product.  It certainly worked for me and my Big Bad Wolf...</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  I have used for about 6 moths and they seem well made and work just fine.  The case is a little flimsy but thats not a big deal to me.</li>
    <li> CRAP, cut my neck first off trying to trim</li>
    <li> Purchased this on July 12th 2014. Written review on Jan 05th 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit Heavy when compared to the One I have used in india (Panasonic ER206 KK). I cannot find that in US, so has to go for WAHL. I found it bulky. It solves the purpose and have high precision cut. There are other additional blades / combs that can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Precision Cut, Oil for lubricating when the Cut is not up to the quality, Low Price&lt;br /&gt;Cons - A Bit Heavy</li>
    <li> It cuts my hair and hasn&#x27;t broke in almost a year, that&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
    <li> First of all this product was made in the \\&quot;Good Old U.S. of A\\&quot;. The quality is excellent, the price&lt;br /&gt;is about the cost of one hair cut (for a guy) and it is easy to use. I was in the Army and if you&lt;br /&gt;want a \\&quot;high and tight cut\\&quot; there is no need to pay $20.00 just get one of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and easy to use. To have your wife or a buddy help out makes it better but&lt;br /&gt;you can do most on your own unless you have some fancy gel job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d sure like to try these out on John \\&quot;Breck Boy\\&quot; Edwards!</li>
    <li> Must say I was surprised by the performance.</li>
    <li> As usual, after reading mostly good reviews for ithis item here on Amazon, I decided this would be the set of clippers to buy for our needs. I read the bad reviews too, especially noted the ones about hair on the clippers, but figured it must be certain sellers/vendors on Amazon turning around returned used clippers and selling them to another unsuspecting customer. Not willing to take the chance that this might happen to me ordering off of Amazon, I decided to buy it local. Saw it at our neighborhood Target, and also noticed a nice Conair clipper that was about $15 right next to it on the shelf. Both seemed comparable, about the same number of pieces and same type of pieces with just a little variance, and 5 year warranty. Decided to stick with my decision to try the Wahl clippers based on all the good Amazon reviews. First box right up front looked opened, seal broken, so picked out another one that looked nice and properly sealed, and ran home with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just the sellers/vendors on Amazon, because this one came right off a Target shelf and the packaging looked new and well sealed, not at all like it had been previously opened then resealed. First thing I noticed after opening the package and taking the guard off the clipper is a bunch of tiny black hair all over it. I showed it immediately to my husband, who replied with a disgusted &#x27;eww&#x27; right off the bat, which was my immediate reaction as well. Neither of us has black hair, so you can be sure it didn&#x27;t come from us. I was so upset. I figure it has to be the company that is turning around returned product. If the company wants to do that with a returned product they think is still in working order and still sellable, or they refurbish a non-working unit and resell it, fine. At least have the decency, however, to clean and disinfect the clipper and it&#x27;s blades before doing so. Paying full price, thinking it&#x27;s brand new, then have it looking like it was already used before yougot it is a total turn off. This was the first time ever buying clippers in my life, and my first time buying Wahl. Never again. I immediately went back to Target and returned it for a refund, no problems. Even the girl behind the customer service desk at Target said eww when we told her the reason for the return, and apologized, though it was no fault of her own. I bought the Conair instead, opened it and checked it in the car before leaving the Target parking lot this time, and no hair on these clippers. They look clean and brand new. Have yet to test their performance though, but at least they don&#x27;t look USED out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/09/12: It has been awhile since this review was written, and just had to add that the Conair clippers worked very well for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillia~ Bob&#x27;s Wife</li>
    <li> great .hope it stays sharp</li>
    <li> Just works great. Very sturdy construction and lots of accessories. Very heavy duty.</li>
    <li> Perfect for  home hair care. Multiple blade guides and Wahl quality.</li>
    <li> Great. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and cut great. I have used many different brands over the years and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Best Wahl razor we have ever owned and we have owned a lot!</li>
    <li> Wonderful, easy to use</li>
    <li> Good trimmer. Not for people with short hair. Clips don&#x27;t go that low. Get the whal senior if cutting real short high tight fades or ceaser cuts</li>
    <li> This item quite noise when I tried to operate it. At the moment I am not yet try to cut an hair. For the meantime, I&#x27;d adjusted the power to reduce noisy sound its look likes okey and will try to cuthair later.</li>
    <li> The de-facto standard for hair trimming, if you&#x27;re unsure which one to get, just get this one.  Do note: just like any machine this works best if maintained properly. It comes with a small bottle of oil which you should use as directed.  And when it runs out (which will take a while) just get more.  These trimmers will last for years and years and years, so long as you get more, and keep up the *extremely* *simple* maintenance.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting my family&#x27;s hair. Comes with the essential length tips, scissors, and two combs. My only complaint is the short cord, but it only bothers me because I prefer to cut hair in the bathtub and the closest outlet is about 5 feet away. The cord is probably 3.</li>
    <li> Average performance.  Strong motor like other reviewers have noted. However, I do find the head heats up a little too quickly and it is noisier than clippers this size should be...it does the trick for me (just to shave head). Had it for more than 4 years and still works great (like new)...never kept the accessories, because they were pretty much useless. My hair is very thick and it handles it pretty well, if I don&#x27;t go too quickly. I would buy it again if this one gave up the ghost.</li>
    <li> Clippers for hair cuts are difficult to know which ones to buy. For those that HAVE bought clippers, they know the horrors of trying to figure out what is what and goes where and does what. But here is the simple break down on these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It is a Wahl. Wahl is a very popular brand of clippers. They are popular for a reason. Reliability.The older clippers get, the more they rust, the more they pull hair, and the less effective the cut is. I had a set of Wahl clippers for more that 10 years while I was in the military. I bought news one because I lost all of the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;2) This is a 20 piece PRO kit. store brand clippers have cheap plastic parts that break, they&#x27;re all the same color, hard to differentiate between what is what, and worst of all, the clippers make weird noises when you turn them on. I have had this particular model for a couple years now. It sound brand new every time I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;3) The color coding really eases the anxiety of trying to decide which head to use for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;4) The case this is all contained in, is superb. No cheap locking clip, sturdy handle, and well organized interior to help keep your pieces from getting lost.&lt;br /&gt;5) By some chance you loose the instructions, it is permanently printed on the handle of the clippers. This is great for beginners. No need to do the math, or figure out what is what. Pick a length, and match the color. SUPER EASY!&lt;br /&gt;6) The instruction manual not only tells you the operation of the clippers, but also tells you how to actually USE these clippers to start cutting hair on day 1. These are the things you get with a PRO kit!&lt;br /&gt;7) If you get this on sale,.... buy yourself two or three sets, maybe even four sets. People will want them, and they will &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; them. They often do not find their way home. So give them as gifts, and keep your clippers!</li>
    <li> This works great for all of my family and friends. I have been cutting hair for over 30 years. Love Wahl clippers!</li>
    <li> Receive in a very timely fashion. Was as described in the description and came well packaged with clear instructions as to use.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  Price was very competitive.</li>
    <li> This is the most stupid hair clipper I have had so far. I bought this 7 months ago and now it is &amp;#34;rusted&amp;#34;. I had a German hair clipper before and I used it more than 10 years. I stopped using that after I moved to US and here the voltage is 110 not 220. This product is waste of money. Do Not Buy It.</li>
    <li> Great value good quality</li>
    <li> Works great.  Has everything we need for buz cuts at home, LOL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad clipper set for the money.  We bought ours at Walmart for $17.99, and here today this is in the Gold Deal section for up to half off sales at 17.99?  Sure, it&#x27;s got a line through the previous price of 40 bucks, but we all know there&#x27;s no store in the country that sells this popular kit for more than 25 bucks.  Just so you&#x27;re aware, this half price gold deal only makes it the same price you&#x27;ll find at your neighborhood discount store, particularly Walmart.  (Also, the attachment combs aren&#x27;t EXTREMELY durable, as in if you bend them they&#x27;ll give like a hard plasticy rubber.  We already had one break/crack and aren&#x27;t even sure how, so be aware that this is not an Andis with attachments, but it&#x27;s a Wahl with lots of bells and whistles that will last you at least a few years for a very low price. And it DOES wind up vibrating loudly requiring fudging of the comb to the blade, as with ALL DISCOUNT CLIPPER SETS, FYI.)</li>
    <li> Very sharp- runs like a dream. Great rubber grip</li>
    <li> Great item, works well, lots of attachments, good price</li>
    <li> Strong motor and good quality</li>
    <li> This kit being very cheap, I found the quality higher than expected. I&#x27;ve used it several times so it has paid itself already. Not an expert on trimmers but I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  UPDATE 11/13/2014  I still have it and use it every two weeks. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.  8/12/2015  Just used it a couple of weeks back. Blades seem to have lost some edge now as it is not as smooth as before. Might be time to retire this one. I stand by my 5 star review though.</li>
    <li> Wish they cut a little closer on neck hair.  My old pair did that I paid the same amount for from Walmart.</li>
    <li> Excellent Clippers, reliable and true. Don&#x27;t waste you time looking for other sets, there hasn&#x27;t been a CON I&#x27;ve found yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, look at the price, are you kidding? This is great!</li>
    <li> Good price, strong engine &#x3D; Fair Deal</li>
    <li> lasted for 2 yrs, for the price, it was good enough. something went wrong with the blade and started pulling hair</li>
    <li> very happy, thank you!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and compact machine, but great performance! sharp cutting edges factory, with all the quality of Wahl! I recommend! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Been cutting my own hair. Some times i manage a good hairstyle. Other times, i mow a chunk of the hair and have to wear cap for 2 weeks.But no complaints with the machine. Performs as expected and no trouble yet.Will update the rating the day it betrays me.</li>
    <li> I use it to cut my hair last week. In general, it works well. However, it maybe vibrate too much when you are using it for some time.</li>
    <li> I bought these because it is so expensive for my husband to get his hair cut($17 for the lady to take clippers to his hair) so we thought why not buy our own and save money in the long run? He may have some small uneven patches(he wears a hat all the time anyway) because I am definitely not a hair dresser, but these are so handy to have.&lt;br /&gt;We tried another brand for the same price and they were so bad we had to pay to get his hair fixed.&lt;br /&gt;When we got these we weren&#x27;t expecting anything super fancy because of the price but we were so pleasantly surprised that these clippers work so well!&lt;br /&gt; I only gave them 4 stars because they are a cheaper brand but they are well worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother and he loves it.</li>
    <li> good clippers, solid build</li>
    <li> Have used couple of times .. after some use it started making loud clicking noise. the &#x27;noise&#x27; away if I shake shake the device of hold it tight .. I think some part inside is loose.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little clipper! I previously had a Wahl that I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 years and it recently just stopped cutting/working. I could either spend $12 on new blades (not even sure that was the issue) -or- I could spend $17 and get a brand new entire kit. I opted for the latter. And WOW, this thing glided like butter through my dog&#x27;s ears to shave them down....could not believe how easily it cut them! I only wish I&#x27;d gotten this new version sooner. Works great!</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described! Works very well and is cheaper than regular haircuts! Very easy to use, easy to clean, and the carrying case is very useful if you need to take it somewhere.</li>
    <li> Wahl is the standard for a reason! The multisize clipper heads helps me give a professional-quality cut</li>
    <li> I BOTH THESE CLIPPERS 3MNTHS AGO THEY JUST DIED OUT , SINCE THEN I&#x27;VE PURCHASED ME PROFESSIONAL CLIPPERS ANDIS FADE MASTERS ALSO ANDIS T OUTLINER2</li>
    <li> Works great but rusted immediately. Kept dry and in it&#x27;s case</li>
    <li> This is a great flipper at a great price.  It comes with many clips and works very well.</li>
    <li> Feels alot better compared the horrendous con-air cheap hair-cutters from wal-mart. Best buy for someone who cuts frequently.</li>
    <li> great product....great brand....really works well</li>
    <li> Theres not a huge amount to say here. It cuts my hair and was a great deal for the price. It came with numerous plastic guides from 1/8th inch to 1 inch, a few combs, a pair of scissors, and the necessary mainenance items for the clippers. For a plastic trimmer itäs pretty hefty and has a strong motor. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.. I&#x27;ve shared this with my roommate and decided to get my own. It&#x27;s consistent and reliable.  Take good care of it, and it will take good care of you.</li>
    <li> This is a quality razor. It has a nice weight to it so that it feels solid without being heavy. I like that the sizes are color coded and that a 1/2 size blade is included. The storage case is a little tricky to fit everything back in.</li>
    <li> For $20 I am amazed at the quality. Plus there are a variety of length attachments plus scissors and two combs.</li>
    <li> Very useful, this trimmer makes it easy for my wife to trim my balding head.  High quality construction, and the color-coded multiple guards are nicer and more functional than I expected.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something quick and easy for the kids, this is it. Very easy to use and maintain, and the color codes make it even easier. Anybody can give a great haircut with this product. Heck, I even cut my own hair with this and a mirror!</li>
    <li> This this is sweet! I&#x27;ve used it a few times to cut my own hair and once on my brother&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has a nice weight to it, and feels like the build is high quality. The power is great, I don&#x27;t have any issues when cutting hair. THere are lots of accessories and extra bonus clips which make this kit awesome. I love the tapered guides as it makes it a lot easier to fade my sides when I cut my own hair. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever use the eyebrow trim guide, but its good to know that if my eyebrows ever get too bushy I&#x27;ll be able to get them under control easily.</li>
    <li> I got these clippers today and what can i say they work great. The directions were easy to read too and these clippers have saved a trip to get a haircut</li>
    <li> Cheap!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice with the different colors.&lt;br /&gt;Still trying to work the different sizes, but excellent product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice power and clean controls</li>
    <li> A little loud, but works really well. Pretty solid, easy to use, an overall great product, especially for the price.  If you have one haircut from this thing, it pays for itself (paid $18 for it). Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Quiet and works great.  Nice color coding as well.</li>
    <li> A barber friend recommended this and I must say its quite sturdy with a well build quality blade. On a whole different level  and provides a far better experience than The Black Series Professional Style Clippers I bought before.</li>
    <li> This kit is wonderful! I used it to trim hubby&#x27;s hair and I had no problems at all. It came with really good instructions and is incredibly easy to use. The kit came with different size combs so it&#x27;s easy to get the trim you want and it&#x27;s easy to use on someone else and help cut their hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to cut my own hair and it works great. Includes lots of extras. Really worth it and has a ton of value.</li>
    <li> Even though a couple of pieces were broken  I was able to get a really good hair cut with what I had received.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace this identical model which I had for years. It&#x27;s so cheap, but works so well.</li>
    <li> Nice cut, easy to use. Very reasonable priced.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Does the job... Not really looking for a pro job, but I could get a self hair-cut with an 1.5&amp;#34; attachment (bought it additionally)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already got an ROI (2 hair-cuts in 2 months)...</li>
    <li> Awsome works really well and will recomend to anyone .</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. Solid Wahl. Handy extras.</li>
    <li> This works very well and is quieter than my old one. My husband and I are happy with our purchase!</li>
    <li> Right out of the box the blades on mine seemed to be dull. When cutting my hair I had to go over the same spot over and over again even changing directions. I ended up buying another brand and did not have the same issue.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a year and works great</li>
    <li> adjustable head needs to be tightened frequently, but it cuts well.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Strong motor and easy to use.</li>
    <li> all things are perfect .</li>
    <li> More boisterous than I expected, but sharp and works fine. Use it for very short hair.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving my head :)</li>
    <li> For the price, this Wahl Haircutter and kit cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a while to become hot, but not hot to touch around the latch area.  If you have used haircutters before, you know that you should power it off after prolonged use, give it a minute, and power it up to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This haircutter is of high-quality.  Wahl does a great job.  I have used their lower tier products ranging from $8-12 and they are still working.  This is definitely a cut above those lower end haircutters that I have used from Wahl even though the price range is not very far off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be discouraged to purchase this excellent product because of the price.  It has a good weight to it, and you can feel that it is of quality material from the surface to the internal motor that powers it inside.  Wahl did not cut corners with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel obligated to send them more money for this product.  It is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a neat plastic case with a handle that stores the haircutter and all 20 pieces of hair clips.  It even comes with TAPER clips!  One for the left side and one for the right side.  It works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it cuts well like any good to great haircutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, HIGHLY recommend it.  Excellent value.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Ive saved so much money cutting my own hair. No more $25 trips to the barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a year and its held up great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it came with a few longer guides, but no biggie.</li>
    <li> This has been a great value to me considering that my purchase was about a third less than the cost of a salon haircut. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a while and used to do so by borrowing my brother&#x27;s Wahl clippers every month or so. Now I&#x27;m the one having people asking to borrow my clippers, or even asking for me to cut their hair! These have paid for themselves several times over, and I hope to continue that pattern with proper maintenance for months, if not years, to come.</li>
    <li> The motor is powerful and the blades are sharp. I zero my hair every other week so I need a good set of clippers. My only complaint is that it is significantly heavier than similar products but I guess that&#x27;s the trade off for a more powerful motor.</li>
    <li> Looks nice. Ha a lot of attachements. Co.bs and scissors. Havent tried it yet</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this. At less than $30 it has paid for itself in the first couple of uses. The case is just an open box with no slots for the gaurds so if you plan to use it often I&#x27;d store it differently or buy a more professional model with a more organized storage system. The clippers themselves seem quality. Again, these have more than paid for themselves within a couple of months and show no signs that they&#x27;ll quit on me any time soon.</li>
    <li> I always buy Wahl trimmers and have had my last one for ten years now. But since I used it as a dog trimmer I felt it was time to replace it with a new one. I&#x27;m so happy with my new one, it has such a close cut I no longer need to use a razor if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> Came packaged Amazon-style, nice and comfy. Product looks promising. I turned it on and heard that familiar Wahl sound that alerts me that it will be in the family for a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great!!  Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> great product if you wanna cut your hair yourself</li>
    <li> great haircutting kit!!! def recommend... :D</li>
    <li> Bought these a few years ago for self hair cuts (took me a long time to figure out how to do the back by myself. Funny results there- do not recommend) But great for normal, monthly/weekly, home clipping on what I believe to be average hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of attachments. Does not eliminate all hair down to a shave close, though. And sometimes you have to go over the same areas twice... but that&#x27;s hair doing what it do.</li>
    <li> great price and it works really good</li>
    <li> perfect item! It works very well when I used it for hair-cutting</li>
    <li> I bought this to shave my sons heads in the summer.  It&#x27;s a great little hair cutter.  I love that the guards are color coded, the kids know which color they like to have their hair cut too.  The blades are super sharp if you&#x27;re not using it with a guard though.  It&#x27;s also fairly loud compared to other clippers I have used in the past.  It&#x27;s not a super big deal but it definitely was a shock when I used it the first time.</li>
    <li> My old Wahl clippers were starting to get dull and make noise, so ordered a new one, this one is very nice, quiet and does the job very well. I cut my own hair and its easy with these, don&#x27;t need all the combs though, when you are old and have hardly any hair all you need is the very short combs!!</li>
    <li> it works as it should. color code is helpful</li>
    <li> As described, shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Works, just works well as ever.</li>
    <li> A well made clipper set</li>
    <li> After using this for many years, I&#x27;m back to buy a new one!  I like all the colored guides and accessories.  My old one had just dulled over the many years.  Glad to have this new one!</li>
    <li> I love these hair clippers. I also love the included carrying case. You will not find a better price for a better pair of hair clippers. You will not be disappointed so I encourage you to buy from Amazon. Very sturdy and well made!</li>
    <li> Great product with great price. It has lots of clips with colors so that you can easily distinguish. And I especially like that it has left ear and right ear clips that you can easily cut hair behind your ears.</li>
    <li> This is my first non-Remington set of Clippers, and I really like this unit. Not only does it run very smoothly, but it is extremely smooth and quiet - there is almost no vibration and minimal noise out of this thing, which is a big plus as I am trimming my infant&#x27;s hair as well. Really nice piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> I do not know how well it would work for heavy commercial purposes, probably not too well. But if you are buying it for home use, then it is pretty nice. I have cut my hair with it 5 times now, cost me $20, which is the price for one hair cut, so I have saved a decent amount of money. It cuts nice without pulling and the different pieces are easy to read. Not much more to say, will update if it breaks with how long it lasted. I try to take care of my things though, so I have been oiling it and brushing it clean after use.</li>
    <li> Works well, have had it for 6 months now!</li>
    <li> I was nervous at the thought of using this as I have never cut hair before but the guides and extensions fit on easily and efficiently.  I have also successfully used these on the fur of our Maltipom puppy which has been an invaluable lifesaver saving us extra trips to the groomer for this shaggy breed!</li>
    <li> Works as expected, love the color coding for clip sizes.</li>
    <li> i really love this hair trimmer. its powerful and has lots of different lengths to choose from.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers for the occasional mats and tangles on my long-haired cat, and they work just fine. Just clean the blades after every use, and they won&#x27;t get clogged up with hair and gunk.</li>
    <li> These clipper work like a charm... Just choose the guard you want and it controls the length. Tapered guards for the sides and back... It only takes my wife about 10 minutes to put me back in presentable condition.....</li>
    <li> Gives you a great cut at home and works exactly as you would expect them to. High quality clippers that should last a long time if properly maintained.</li>
    <li> A useful trimmer. Wish it had a closer trim and an attachment for longer hair</li>
    <li> My wife has started cutting the kids hair with these and has enjoyed using it. It really helped her to do this easily and helped her to do a good job. The kit comes with useful instructions that she found useful. It&#x27;s a great kit to get started and learn.</li>
    <li> We had a pair of Wahl clippers which we have used for many years.  The blades were getting worn but we purchased this entire new set for a few dollars more than new blades.  It works great and has many different applications.</li>
    <li> Really amazing clippers.. Powerful and quiet!!</li>
    <li> Great deal, plenty of attachments.  Runs smooth and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Color coded clipper guards.  Used it last night and cut very well.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 15 years, and my original pair of Wahl clippers is still going.  I got these because the original pair is going off to college soon! There is no way you can go wrong purchasing this product. If you factor the cost of just ONE haircut, you get your money back within one or two cuts.  Great instructions provided, and everything you need to &#x27;get clipping!&#x27;  So quit paying a barber and do it yourself.  It&#x27;s easy and so convenient.  These clippers do not feel cheap - they have a nice weight to them, and a good, strong motor and sharp blades.  I am loyal to Wahl!</li>
    <li> I like it. It works well, and the noise it makes is reasonable: it is not loud and harsh at all. almost no vibration.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I have to wait and use it  for a while but it is a good deal I believe by now.</li>
    <li> Works great, color coded for sizes, only thing didn&#x27;t like is that it vibrates quite a bit</li>
    <li> Works very well, no complaints.</li>
    <li> great value. this works great.</li>
    <li> Got this unit to do simple buzz cuts twice a month, and it has performed flawlessly. No binding or overheating problems. I only need a #1, so this exceeds my expectations!</li>
    <li> Works great. The trim attachments are a bit too flexible but other than that fine.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  Replaced a 12+ year old unit.  Amazing difference!  Should have replaced them years ago.  The Wahl unit is stylish and quiet compared to my old ones.  The motor is very powerful and had no trouble cutting right through my hair.  The comb attachments actually kind of &amp;#34;coral&amp;#34; the hair into the blades, so no pulled hair caught on the sides of the comb.  I would definitely recommend, can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
    <li> Attach the color coded combs, plug it in, and start cutting!  The shaver itself is sturdy and of high quality.  The carry case is cheap and not worth keeping after you&#x27;ve opened the package.  Trying to get everything back into it, then closed, is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  Just get yourself some kind of small leather or canvas storage case, and toss the plastic storage case.</li>
    <li> through the set time was fulfilled and I am happy with the item my son likes I highly recommend this shop is very responsible</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace another clipper set with a single cutter that adjusts to different lengths.  I was leery of all the separate cutters, but find them easy to use and get a nice graduated length from bottom to top.  I also like the ear trim cutters, which work very well.  The clipper itself has a nice heavy feel to it like the motor is substantial.  It&#x27;s quiet, and smooth.  Some have said it needs more attachments.  I can&#x27;t imagine why.  Five stars b/c it of its quality build and versatility.</li>
    <li> does not work well in countries with 240v. even with a step down transformer the machine is very loud. when i altered the voltage on the side of the machine to lower the sound it would not cut at all. it is a very disappointing product.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair buzzer and comes with a complete set of guards.  I recommend all of the Wahl buzzers. Saved me lots of money because i didn&#x27;t need to go to the barber.  Easy to do yourself too!</li>
    <li> This clipper is great value for the money. Around here, a haircut costs $20 after you figure in the tip, so this pays for itself after 1 haircut. It was pretty easy for me to do myself, but I didn&#x27;t get too elaborate either. Overall I&#x27;m impressed and I think it will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> These are awesome clippers.  I clip my son&#x27;s hair and my wife cuts mine.  They do the job well but make sure to oil them after each use a little and they will last for years and you save a ton in haircut costs.</li>
    <li> these clippers work great and have had no issues thus far,,It comes with great assortment of guards...I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> What a return on investment! I&#x27;ve been using this for the last year and a half and am able to do a great job cutting my own hair. It took a few times before I got the hang of it, but the results were never disastrous. Now I get a haircut that&#x27;s probably 90% as good as my barber/stylist used to do. Not once has anyone made fun of my haircut and I&#x27;ve even received compliments on it a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useful tips - the best time to use this is right after you&#x27;ve washed your hair. Towel dry your hair, then blow dry it if necessary to &#x27;fluff it up&#x27; so your hair is standing out from your scalp. This lets the cutter give the most even, consistent results. If your hair is matted down, or oily the results will be uneven. Don&#x27;t rush, especially the first few times. Think about how your barber/stylist gives you a haircut and basically try and replicate those steps.</li>
    <li> This is my first Wahl product. I read all the reviews before buying it as it was less than $20 on amazon when I purchased it. Good price but after using it to cut my son&#x27;s thick hair, here&#x27;s what I think;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper feels heavy. It will take some getting used to. I had a similar conair clipper that, after a while, became a problem for my wrist due to the weight. The most recent clipper I had before this was a conair light-weight clipper that was more comfortable to work with, for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pieces are very flimsy plastic. I was afraid they might unlock when I was cutting my son&#x27;s hair or break, but it didn&#x27;t. It will be a concern, though, every time I cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One or two of the pieces weren&#x27;t numbered like the others, as another reviewer pointed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wire is standard length as most clippers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp and cut very well.Overall, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for the best kit at the best price - this is it. It is the most complete kit and a very nice hard case cover.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy a pair of clippers to cut my own hair instead of getting it done.  It seemed hard to justify the $15-$20 for someone to pass clippers through my hair.  I read many of the reviews on these and they are as solid as people described.  It&#x27;s almost surprising what you get for the price.  It cuts very well, has a solid build and it&#x27;s already paid for itself after one haircut.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 10 months ago and it works great for me. The haircutting kit it also very useful if you are willing to use them. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to replace an old Revlon trimmer that finally kicked the bucket after almost a decade of service. For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much - a replacement of the relatively low-quality Revlon unit would have been fine. Instead, the Wahl arrived heavy and heavy-duty. It feels solid and has performed well both times I&#x27;ve called it into action. I would recommend it to anyone that uses a haircutting/trimming product. I can&#x27;t imagine a product being better for this price or, frankly, for 2 or 3 times this price. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Normally I pay 20 bucks for a haircut. I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t get anything special done to my hair so I figured might as well start doing this myself. Found these clippers on Amazon for 20 bucks and have used it once so far. Razor was very powerful and cut through my hair (which definitely isn&#x27;t thin) like butter. The color coding is nice and let me find the 2 sizes I use easily (after referring to the chart on the razor itself). It&#x27;s already paid for itself too. 5/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing about cutting my own hair is it&#x27;s tricky to get the hairline on the back lined up properly. Guess I&#x27;ll need someone else to do that if I really care about it looking nice.</li>
    <li> I have always cut my sons hair. It is so much cheaper than going to the barber shop. I had to practice a little when he was very young, but this set made it very easy to do. My daughter has two sons and I purchased this one for her. She is so happy with it.</li>
    <li> This machine has a good look and is a little heavy guess because of the good quality. It comes with a complete cutting guide that helps you cut your own hair. I bought it because it will save me plenty of money going to the barber.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and saves a lot of money not going to the barber.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the kit. It definitely saves money on not going to the barber for a haircut. Great price for it too.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my younger brother who recently chopped off his ponytail in favor of a buzz cut. He likes his hair one step away from being bald - a  real close shave. This obviously requires regular upkeep. Going to the barber&#x27;s every week was not an economical choice for him. So I got him these clippers. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. They get the job done. Results are consistent. The different colored razor guards make it clear which size you&#x27;re using. He loves using the thing. Great pair of starter clippers for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> been using it for quite some time. and I love it. I just wish the ear piece is more manageable</li>
    <li> I am very impressed, heavy duty, so well made. Feels so solid and literally heavy. Comes with like a billion attachments and some. Great buy, great price great product, I would definitely repurchase and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband can now give our 3 year old a hair cut. This kit is very cost effective in the end. Extremely easy to use with the color coded clips.</li>
    <li> Had this machine for a couple years now. Even though it&#x27;s always hard to clean hair off of anything this still works like day 1.</li>
    <li> Great performance at a great price.</li>
    <li> Costs the same as one hair cut, now I&#x27;m set for a long time. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product saves me money. Not only that, but it saves me bi-monthly chore of hiking over the local haircut joint to get my same old simple &amp;#34;1 on the sides, 2 on the top&amp;#34; buzzcut. Throw a few towels down under a folding chair outside, find a willing girlfriend/wife to woman the shears and you are in business! Unless your barbershop is like the movie Barbershop --- you won&#x27;t miss it. And you&#x27;ll be glad you invested in yourself with this nice set of shears.</li>
    <li> First razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I managed to shave off back-length hair into a respectable Biff style crew cut. Simple, straightforward instructions and color-coded depth-stops make it an easy process.&lt;br /&gt;Costs less than one haircut.</li>
    <li> bought this in order to cut my Fathers hair when I visit.  My husband decided that I could also cut his hair so I have tried it on him and it works great.  Love the different clip on lengths.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I&#x27;ve never actually used these to cut hair on anyone&#x27;s head.  That being said, I&#x27;ve used it as a beard trimmer, and a , a-hem, manscaper.  I&#x27;m not a hairy dude, but I like to trim a little here and there.  These things are perfect.  It comes with many different clips for those looking for different lengths of hair cutting.  They are color coded for convenience so you aren&#x27;t staring at each black clip looking for the size.  It comes with scissors and a nice little case but I don&#x27;t keep the clippers in their case, just the clips.  I wrap the cord around the clippers and leave it under  my sink.  Sometimes, the cord gets very wound up, which would be my only complaint, but other than that, I really like this.  It replaced an older wahl which I had for like 12 years.  Great price, and great quality.  Happy Clippings!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to cut my son&#x27;s hair in between barber cuttings. Normally, I like Wahl products, however this product could work better. I guess you get what you pay for. It does work, however the guards are cheaply made and leave streaks in my son hair. I ended up having to cut more off than I normally do. I used the red guard first but it barely looked like I cut any off. The second time I use the green one and that was just awful. I would recommend this product to someone who would like a longer hair look instead of short or if you have a good set of guards that can be used with this product which is one of the things I did.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
    <li> Used it couple of times and very happy with the result</li>
    <li> We purchased this as a replacement for our other Wahl that had served us well for 4 years.  With 4 people using this at least weekly, it is still working like new. I love the color coded clips as they are easy to grab and each kid knows their colors.</li>
    <li> I bought this just for trimming and straightening between hair cuts.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot for the fairly low price but honestly they are great.  You can tell that the build quality of them is really good, much better than any other brand I&#x27;ve bought before.  This is probably my third set up clippers in the past 20 years and by far it&#x27;s the best quality ones.</li>
    <li> Good quality like everyone else reviews. They are great and I would recommend to anyone. I really like all the different sizes that come in the box and the simple box for storage.</li>
    <li> I desperately needed a haircut, but my barber had quit. I got these clippers for the cost of a haircut plus tip and my wife cut my hair. They worked great and I&#x27;m very happy with my haircut.</li>
    <li> I bought for fun with my girlfriend, i feel it a little heavier than what i was expecting, by the way it does its work really well</li>
    <li> I had a Whal clipper before this one and it lasted 23 year&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very happy with the product but only give 4 stars because there is always room for improvement.</li>
    <li> This kit has just about everything you need for trimming and shaping.  Everything fits in the plastic case. (No dividers though for spacers, have to keep them in a bag.)  The only issue I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems a bit under-powered.....BUT for the price, I can live with that.  Pretty nice little set up.  Easy color coded spacers and reference right on the handle of the clippers.</li>
    <li> This replaced about a 5 year old Wahl that I never did any maintenance on or even oiled. For the price why bother, I&#x27;ll just order another in 5 years.</li>
    <li> This is honestly as good if not better than the trimmer my barber has.  I have a small trimmer to do sideburns and around the ear but it is amazing if you want to shave your head or clean up a beard.  The guides it comes with makes it hard to mess things up.</li>
    <li> I had never cut my boys hair on my own before (2 and 4 yo). Saw this kit and decided to give it a go since it is rather affordable and looks good with the reviews. I never regretted since. The trimmer with the array of adapters with different colour codes really made hair cutting easy for my boys. This coupled with some video teaching in youtube made my beginner days a much smoother. I love this trimmer!</li>
    <li> the main problem is the heat, it&#x27;s getting very hot after 3 minutes of using it. It also apply to the metal blades which are in contact with your skin.</li>
    <li> My fiance complained about his past clippers and how his hair made them stall out because of how thick it is. I buzzed his down and it didn&#x27;t get stuck once.</li>
    <li> Bought this to cut my Husband and son&#x27;s hair and it works great. It pay&#x27;s for itself in one haircut. :O)</li>
    <li> This works great and has been very easy to use. Amazing for the price, would consider it a good deal at twice the price.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly.  I cant imagine needing more than what this offers, it comes with everything you need.  It feels incredibly solid and the motor is powerful.  The only downside I can think of is that it is a bit louder than I expected.</li>
    <li> this product is great and amazon delivered on what was promised. its best to pay 20 dollars for a life time of hair cuts than 20 each time.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick and so wavy that every hair stylist I&#x27;ve ever met has looked at my hair like a mountain climber looks at Mount Everest or El Capitan.&lt;br /&gt;Very rarely was it tamed, and if I shook my head hard enough, a comb, or sofa, or small dog might fly out.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it didn&#x27;t grow down, it grew OUT.&lt;br /&gt;So, I do the clipper cut with the #5 blade.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this, because I was tired of paying $15 and waiting 20 minutes, just to sit in a chair and have a clipper run across my head.&lt;br /&gt;I had been in the service.&lt;br /&gt;A clipper cut is not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought this clipper, and was surprised at how nice it was. Has a nice heavy, sturdy, build, the replaceable blade guard was nice. The clipper holds the guide nice and snug also. And best of all, it had no problem with my thick hair. Sheered right through it and did a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a sideburn trimmer, but that can be done with the clipper alone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d never cut my own hair, but like I said: Clipper cuts are not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;Ten minutes out of the box and my hair was done.&lt;br /&gt;Checked the back with the mirror I bought with it, and it looked just like the $15 job.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the waiting . . .&lt;br /&gt;And the drive .&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a stylist who needs a good clipper, I&#x27;d buy this.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just someone like me who is tired of spending money just to have a clipper run over your head, I&#x27;d definitely buy it. I only use the one guide, but it looks like all of them are in there, so you could do baldies and fades too.</li>
    <li> It is easy to learn to use, however it is a little heavy. Anyway, I am satisfied with my first work.</li>
    <li> Love my hair clipper ,now I can keep my hair neat and my appearance looking,would be happy to recommend this clipper</li>
    <li> should i say more... better than my old chrome pro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also very precise, at least for plastic guards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it now :)</li>
    <li> What can I say, it works well and the money I saved on hair cuts (living in a city) paid for itself. Aside from the neckline I&#x27;ve been giving myself haircuts every 2 weeks, love it!</li>
    <li> I had read that you have to spend at least $50 to get a quality hair clipper, but I saw this one with the good reviews and figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;It has been working great for me. It cuts my hair very easily. It&#x27;s simple to change out the guards and the color coding is nice for telling them apart.</li>
    <li> Works well but it isn&#x27;t smooth on the scalp without the combs so the closest shave isn&#x27;t good. Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been buying these for years at Walmart, and now amazon ships them to my door step for a cheaper price than I used to pay, Wahl color pro trimmers have been a great household must have product for me for years. With good maintenance and cleanleness the trimmers last for a year or two with constant use. Saves me a lot of money to replace them when needed.</li>
    <li> Well im a college student which means I am dirt poor! Ive always wanted a hait trimmer thingy because it seems more cost efficient than going to a hair saloon every now and then. Needless to say based on a few other reviews this product worked perfectly, I had absolutly no issues, However I will note that I have only used it once so far, and will update this review if there is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with it pulling hair, It was a tad loud, but no more than the ones at the saloons, and it is definately heavy, I personnaly did not have an issue with the weight, however I would not want to deal with it more than once every month or so!</li>
    <li> Clippers cut decent but I was not real pleased with the clipper sizes as mentioned by many reviews here.  It also runs hot and relatively loud.  On the other hand it seems well put together and solidly constructed so they will make a good backup set.  I found my old set was quieter, had better clip sizes, ran cooler and cut just as clean.  Of course it was about twice as expensive, proving that we do usually get what we pay for.</li>
    <li> Long time I wanted to have a haircutting kit and now I have it Made In U.S.A.  Have shown it to one of my barber and he immediately offered his service without any fee just to test my kit.</li>
    <li> This is a gem of a purchase; you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1) price&lt;br /&gt;2) has all the equipment and guards that you could want for grooming (I use it to trim a beard and keep my face looking less grotesque than it otherwise would), plus they give you some blade lubricant so you can make sure you&#x27;re taking good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;3) hard shell carrying/storage case keeps it all nicely together and makes traveling with it easier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1) In the beginning, this this would pluck an occasional hair out instead of cutting it.  Something about the new blades, I think.  This made for a bit of an uncomfortable first few weeks.  The problem has subsided, however, and now I don&#x27;t have to fear that I am putting an Epilady to my face.</li>
    <li> Years cutting hair: 15&lt;br /&gt;Clippers used: 6 (4 brands)&lt;br /&gt;Best so far: this one, my first Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;Its &amp;#34;heavy, powerful motor&amp;#34; other reviews rave about uses only 9 watts, but never even changes sound in thick areas, and it clips every hair. I&#x27;ve had others that used 12 watts, but slowed down on every pass, missing hairs all over the place. I guess it&#x27;s all in the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other blades have overheated and burned me, pulled hair, pinched skin, misaligned mid-haircut, clogged easily, stopped completely, needed re-oiled mid-haircut, broken themselves on my hair, and cut so unevenly that my hair looked cat-chewed. Cheap, foreign-labor pieces of junk! Grrr! Don&#x27;t do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl, however, prides themselves on their blade quality, and it shows. I cannot emphasize this enough! Night and day difference for thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the cheap Wahl model, and I may upgrade later, but it&#x27;s still got it where it counts. I strongly recommend this kit (plus a hand mirror or good partner for the back) for anyone starting out, or trying Wahl after horrible disappointment in cheap clippers. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I received the product, upon review I can recommend it fully, comes with combs a briefcase to save everything. No doubt it is good product.</li>
    <li> Good delivery, good condition. it&#x27;s very nice. I can cut my hair my my self. It is miracle. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> My son has thick curly hair, buzzed right through.  Good price and works great.</li>
    <li> Clippers are great buy for the price thanks</li>
    <li> i think it deserve what u paid for!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t think you will get best quality if u paid 20 $&lt;br /&gt;not smoothed, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt also.&lt;br /&gt;good luck yo can try :)</li>
    <li> Feels heavy and solid, has worked good since I started using it. It did blow my bathroom circuit once when I was turning it off and on.</li>
    <li> This is a great set! Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow this thing is great.  I had to switch to a low buzz cut style because I am getting older, fatter, and hairy (all over  :(  )  What can I saw Northwest LA is just humid and hot about 1/2 the year long.  I been doing my own hair with this kit since I found out my barber I been going to since I was 15 (now 33) was charging his older customers 1/3 of the price of what he charged me when I usually take less time to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I bought this and did away with my old style of hair cut at least for what I plan to be for 6-8 months out of the year.  I can&#x27;t how much I love it.  The first use I paid for it.  Not to mention I use this thing guard off to pretty much save every inch of my body too.  Poor thing ahahahah I jest but not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have 2 friends and a cousin that have this one or a Wahl just like it.  One of them recommended it to me.  They love theirs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting hair.  Even your own isn&#x27;t that hard just takes some practice and time.  At least I don&#x27;t care if i mess up I&#x27;ll just go shorter and make it better looking.  I gotten alot of compliments on my new hair cut.  People can&#x27;t believe I am able to do it myself.  Sometimes I do need my brother or had a friend help me good straight tapered line where my hair starts on the neck.  Like the first 1/2 inch of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using mostly a 2-3 this summer has been that bad.  Also not ever 100 yet this summer (crosses fingers till fall).  But even 85 with 80-100 percent humidity is just killer for me</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He only uses it to trim his beard and he said they work great, especially for the price. The package came 3 days after I ordered them. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great. No problems. The color coded guards makes it easy to spot the correct one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this inexpensive clipper to use on my standard poodle. I use the plastic red attachment. She has a lot of hair that grows in her ears and the groomers do not remove enough of it so she shakes her ears when the hairs tickle.  I use this along with the hemostat I had purchased to pull ear hairs from her poor hairy ears.</li>
    <li> I gave gained more than I paid. I bought it about $18 and it is very efficient. I am very satisfied from my purchase.</li>
    <li> Refused to work any more after purchase 5 months later, just gently use 3 times. Can&#x27;t believe the quality is so poor. Is there any warranty?</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace our 14 year old Wahl clippers.  I like the hard plastic case. It comes with some illustrated instructions and trimming scissors. We use it often and it works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it cost me just about the same price as a haircut and I figured I might as well invest in a hair clipper and get my money&#x27;s worth instead of wasting my money every month. It works great! I have thick, wavy hair and it cut great! I had to go over a couple times just be sure everything was even, but it was no different than a stylist would&#x27;ve done at the barber shop. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a set of clippers.</li>
    <li> These clippers are high quality and work great. My son took these to college and uses them all the time, they are well built and are high quality.</li>
    <li> So many options.  Works wonderful</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> Cheap, sturdy, does the job--about all you need in an appliance.</li>
    <li> Good product, works as stated right out of the box. The comb attachments made it easy to trim around the ears and the neck line.</li>
    <li> great tool for any family with kids who wants to save money and have fun family experience. I wish they had one more bigger (longer hair) piece.&lt;br /&gt;Note that the combs and the scissors included are junk. The trimmers are what you are paying for (and benefitting from!). I recommend also buying a good pair of shears.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes a great product the price was unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Worked fine with no issues for 7 months. I will likely buy again for the price of $17.99 if I can&#x27;t find just the clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as nice as the old Wahl set of clippers I had for about 10 years that finally quit.  I bought those in a beauty supply shop and were supposedly professional grade or something.  I think they were maybe $60 or $70?  So when I had to replace them, I thought I would give these a try because they were so inexpensive.  The clip guards are a little flimsy on this set, but I was happy to discover that the clip guards from my old set are still compatible with this one, so all in all, I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and decided to buy but when it got here it was covered in hair. Really disappointed with this</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great one easy to use. I cut my son&#x27;s hair and we all satisfied with it. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> MY HUBBY IS 50%. SO I HELP HIM DO HOME HAIR CUTS. WORKS WELL. JUST REMEMBER ALWAYS HAVE A GUARD ON THE CLIPPERS...LOL.</li>
    <li> A nice clipper kit.  It works well.</li>
    <li> It will cut just about any hair, lots of size customizations</li>
    <li> Does the job. Maintains my cut and I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber.</li>
    <li> Only used a little for some quick trims and it worked great.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best purchases i have made in awhile. It came in a nice little red case and comes with a ton of color coated tops in which you really can cut your own hair and not have people ask you about it! hahahah def a must buy for someone who no longer wants to pay 16-20 dollars for a mens cut!</li>
    <li> I loves these clippers. With a little up keep (oiled and kept clean) they will last. My brother bought this maybe 3 years ago and still work very well. Highly recommended and would buy again if I really needed to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 25 years to cut my families hair so when my son was about to get married I knew just which hair clippers to purchase for him.  Thanks for an exceptional product.</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit does the job and does it really fast and easy.  I like that its even made in the US.....rare thing these days</li>
    <li> This is the only set of clippers I have ever used.  I got tired of paying $12-15 every 2-3 weeks for a haircut, only to come home and have to do extra trimming or correct mistakes.  For me, these clippers paid for themselves in less than a month, and I haven&#x27;t looked back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did go back and buy the fine trimmer later for my neckline and around my ears.  That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Pros: works well and has good power. Doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise and has a nice buzz to the motor. I only use it once in awhile, but for the price, its a good product.</li>
    <li> This package cost less than 1 haircut for my husband - and he was getting them every 3 weeks. He likes the way his hair looks when I cut it with these just as well as the salon cut, and it&#x27;s really cut down on cost for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- The guards work well - I have used multiple combinations to create different looks&lt;br /&gt;- We haven&#x27;t had any trouble with nicks or pinching&lt;br /&gt;- The blades seem to be staying plenty sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few small complaints:&lt;br /&gt;- the cord isn&#x27;t quite long enough, in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;- some of the guards don&#x27;t have rounded tips and my husband has told me that they aren&#x27;t as comfortable to use as the ones that do</li>
    <li> Its great but say you are a Marine, and like a high and tight then you might need something different to do the zero tapper but its great for everything else.</li>
    <li> I searched through all identical haircutting kits and settled on this one.  The price for what I got was a 50% plus savings over any local store sale prices.  The buzzer itself is great.  It is quiet and smooth sounding.  The pieces while well marked for size and color coded, feel cheap, thin, kinda flimsy.  I was apprehensive at first but it works well.  CANT BEAT THE PRICE!!!  I am satisfied with what I got.  Read the description well before you buy.  Each kit comes with basically the same things.  I didnt need a video or a cape.</li>
    <li> Love the different coloring on different sizes, it makes it a lot easier and fun.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Great item!</li>
    <li> I used to spend $20 including tips to have my hair cut. Now my wife is cutting my hair. Though she is still learning and my hair looks pretty weird after her cut. But I still love this product. (And I love my wife too, of course.)</li>
    <li> I have 3 men in the house that use these at least once a month. They are holding up well, still work like new after many months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Natural Hair stylist and at times I need clippers to cut hair, so I order these clippers. A  friend of mine who is a professioanl barber came to adjust the clippers for me and he commented that the quality of the clippers where good and he also said that they were heavy but not to heavy and over all after he trimmed his beard comment that they was a good buy for the price that I paid for them.. I have not used them as of yet but I look forward to making them part of my styling tool in my Salon...</li>
    <li> It works really well !! I definitely recommend it to everyone !</li>
    <li> My Wahl clipper was delivered in three days on a free shipping order.My experiences have always been very satisfactory with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is the perception of a man in his mid-eighties, limited with the effects of a stroke with tremors and poor peripheral and depth perception vision. Because of these challenges, I purchased this product with trepidation, especially after reading the one and two star ratings. However after weighing against the five star ratings, I concluded that many of the poor ratings appear to be over exaggerated.My initial experience is positive and perhaps I should have entitled this review \\&quot;IF I CAN DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT BETTER!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step one: To avoid the clutter of attachments, I removed the guide combs I will not be using and left only those I expect to use which will probably be reduced further. I then oiled the blade before using, despite the manufacturer&#x27;s claim of having done so, as the kit may have been in stock for a lengthy period which might have caused drying. Unfortunately, because of my tremors I over-oiled and hope this may not harm the motor.I compared the oil with mineral oil which I use on my electric shaver and find no difference plus I have read several reviews where the same conclusion was reached with no negative effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two: The noise level doesn&#x27;t exceed the clippers used by most barbers and is not in the least bit annoying. The weight is heavier than I would like but should not be a problem for most users (perhaps I should have chosen the \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; model, but it is manageable.) I felt anxious as I started cutting, especially without the benefit of a rear view mirror and felt that perhaps I made a mistake in trying to cut my own hair, but when I was through and asked for my wife&#x27;s opinion, she stated the result was better than the usual cuts I get from barbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel grateful for my success and sure that future cuts will be done in half the time with even better results.I highly recommend this hair clipper, based on price and results. It deserves 5 stars but I rated it 4 solely for its weight and my lack of dexterity. After a few more cuts, I will update my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/31/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Totally forgot to update sooner, but was reminded by a commenter.Unfortunately. old age and memory are not very compatible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is almost a year since my purchase of this product and I remain very satisfied with my choice. I do not labor long in the trimming process, but work within the  limited dexterity and visual challenges mentioned in my initial review. I use a #2 comb on my nape and the surrounding areas of my ears, then change to a #3 comb to taper below the top of my scalp which is very sparse and kept in a oomb-over fashion. This process takes less than five minutes and results in a neat trim appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly,if I was younger and going to business and socializing, I would take more time and care, or ask for my wife&#x27;s assistance.I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t heed the one star reviewers. This trimmer is powerful and solidly built and does not sound loud at all. The combs are sturdy. All in all, it is an excellent choice at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> VERY nice product. If you trying to figure out if this like the ones they use at the salons and Barbers the answer is yes. It has a very good hum to it and it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like many of the cheap ones. I AM SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, has a lot of options, very quiet</li>
    <li> My Conair clippers were supposed to be cordless with a rechargeable battery, but after a few years my husband had to leave it plugged in 24 hours a day (not merely when using it) in order for it to run at all. I finally decided I was tired of having the cord lying across the bathroom counter all the time, so I bought these clippers based on the other reviews. Having a corded clipper is not a hassle at all. My husband is thrilled!</li>
    <li> I want to like this trimmer.  It is attractive and has a wonderful user friendly design with lots color coded trimmer guide attachments with a convinient legend printed on the trimmer itself.  Corded means it should have no shortage of power unlike the cordless trimmers I have owned in the past which can run out charge mid trim - awkward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas it is not so.  This trimmer is so ridiculously underpowered it struggles to cut my hair.  Brand new fresh out of the box with supposedly sharp blades.  What happens over time as the blades lose their edge?  I suppose the upside is that it is so weak it won&#x27;t hurt much when it starts pulling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This set was more durable than I thought..Nice an heavy an cuts extremeley well.Attachments are easy to put on an off an gives you a nice clean cut...I highly recommend this set...</li>
    <li> I am a college student who didn&#x27;t want to pay $15 for a haircut on campus, so I bought this. It is easy to use, has all the attachments I could want, and now other people on my floor ask me to cut their hair too! Great value for a great tool. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking to cut hair.</li>
    <li> Great value and the clippers work great. The color coding is very helpful.</li>
    <li> maybe I got a defective product, this one made loud noise and shaked badly. I can barely hold it after 3-5min. I sent it back to amazon, the customer service refund it without any problem</li>
    <li> Received product in the mail earlier than receipt promised.  Very heavy duty &amp; high quality for how little I paid.  Definitely a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my 3 boys, and my husband uses it on himself. It works great and is still going after using it often for years!!!</li>
    <li> Used it for the first time yesterday.  Cuts great, quiet, and no pull.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> 30 seconds into cutting there was a pop and puff of smoke and the thing was dead.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product for the price.  I have used it about six times and after a few got my hair cut down to a pretty reliable routine. Saves time too, I can have my hair cut and clean up in way less time that it wold take go to barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews before I bought and I think some of the low ratings are due to user error.  Some people complained about the shaver losing power and then not working at all. There is an adjustment screw that adjusts low to high.  Too high and you get a loud buzzing and harsh vibration.  Too low and no power. Because of the mechanical motion I think the screw setting drifts overtime or maybe there is variation at electrical outlet.  In any case, it is very simple fix, adjust the screw setting.  Product instructions on this point are clear.</li>
    <li> Its good for head shaving, not good for facial hair shaving.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for the first few haircuts  but then the metal pice above the blades, moved and was cutting everyone who used it. itspretty shitty. I say spend at least 50 bucks for a haircut machine. i learned my lesson</li>
    <li> Current item was good smuts and gentle, I use it for my 5 y/o son he like it too. So we are happy.</li>
    <li> Nice item, good price, quick shipping. AAAAA</li>
    <li> Really happy with this set. I cut my boys hair at home. It&#x27;s a breeze with these clippers.</li>
    <li> Hair cutting is made so easy,I never thought I could cut my own hair that effortlessly in such a short time.Loved it .Will recommend or any one who doesn&#x27;t mind having short hair.Great product and great instructions on how to cut your hair.Well done.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and a nice case to keep all of the Goody&#x27;s you get with it ,&lt;br /&gt;it does the job</li>
    <li> wE HAVE 4 kids and cut all of their hair with this.  It works well and does not cut them but it does their hair.  Greta value</li>
    <li> great for dog- and/or husband:)  great price too</li>
    <li> Light and comfortable to use, but doesn&#x27;t do a good job of cutting real fine hair.</li>
    <li> When I first got these clippers, I was pleased.  They seemed to work just fine, and the price was right.  After five or six months, they were no longer cutting hair evenly.  Today, eight months after purchasing, the clippers won&#x27;t stay on.  They just turn off mid-haircut, and come back on after a minute or two.  I understand that they weren&#x27;t the most expensive clippers, but I did expect them to last for more than 8 months.</li>
    <li> Never went to barber shop again after having this thing. Saved a lot of $$$ !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the weight of this thing. Far heavier than I expected, and since I wanted it solely for trimming my beard and not cutting my hair, the weight is not welcome. But it works really well and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to last a long time in light of the apparent quality, as evidenced by the quality of materials and the heft. It&#x27;s a keeper and I&#x27;d recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re looking for something to use to cut your hair in addition to trimming your beard.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these clippers.  The first lasted about 5 years with occasional use (~1x every 3 months). The price was soo low here that it was too good to pass up, so I grabbed another.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck hair clipper bar none.  Upgraded to a Wahl Legend after having this set for approximately 10 years and may indeed may not have needed to.  Very highly recommend.  Still works by the way  just use for different body parts. Lol</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hear for almost $20 years now and I have always used the cheap, under $20 dollar clippers found at Walmart and Walgreen. When I ordered this I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything other than a $20 dollar clipper; however, this clipper has a much better build quality when compared to your typical department store budget clippers. The one thing I noticed right away was how powerful the motor is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I usually cut my hair very low almost bald and if there is sweat on my head the other machines would have a difficult time cutting it but with this clipper it had no problem cutting my damp hair. The blade is also of better quality and material. After adjusting the blade and setting it to its lowest setting, the clipper can cut my hair almost bald not a complete zero but close. You might be able to use it to tape if you have hair/high fade, but it you have a low fade you will need a separate trimmer for tapping.</li>
    <li> My Wahl hair cutting kit works well and is easy to use.  The instructions that accompany the set are clear and informative.</li>
    <li> Taught myself to cut my own hair with this bad boy. Every size and it&#x27;s color organized what could be better? One of my best purchases in 2014.</li>
    <li> Decent clippers with color coded combs helps keep me organized when I am cutting my husband&#x27;s hair. They work well enough to get the job done. Worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I think I needed to use this all of TWO times to save money on haircuts, with the added benefit of its beard trimming capacity. Highly recommended for the thrifty at heart!</li>
    <li> Works really well and you just can&#x27;t beat the price!  Such a great deal.  My husband uses it to trim his beard every other day and to trim his hair weekly.  It holds up really well and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;snag&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does everything you would need it to do.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, made in USA., delivered on time, what else could you want. How it holds up over time is yet to be determined, but the first Wahl I bought, similar to this one, lasted through two kids and wives. In fact, it lasted longer than the marriages. LOL.</li>
    <li> Present for my dad. He loved it and the settings make it easy for him to get the cut he wants. The other Wahl he had lasted him for almost 20 years.</li>
    <li> The motor seems to be strong and the blades seem smooth if you oil them regularly.The attachments are good and they have numbers on them to identify them. The case is small but has no dividers, so you can fit more into it.</li>
    <li> Great quality at a super price!</li>
    <li> no angled attachments as the previous one I had for 10 years</li>
    <li> I love the color coded guards. I just spent 20 minutes doing a full body shave, and used the lowest guards on the ball/testicle/taint/ass area with no injuries! Be aware that it makes a jarring sound when you turn it on but it doesn&#x27;t affect the actual trimmer. The packing is pretty neat as well, hopefully I won&#x27;t lose all the pieces in a month.</li>
    <li> Great haircutting kit. I got it for my friend who loves it. He says it&#x27;s very powerful and cuts the hair very nicely and evenly without leaving any patches. The color coded tips are also very useful! The product also shipped very fast!</li>
    <li> This product is too noisy. I have used a different brand for near 25 years and still good. It&#x27;s very light, quiet, and smooth-cutting.  I was just trying to see if something else is better but no. This Wahl is annoyingly noisy and hard on the skin and I am returning for a refund. Additionally, the switch needs some revamping.</li>
    <li> Many of my friends have this same buzzer, so I thought it would be a reliable product to buy. After a month it started making terrible grinding noises and no longer works. Unfortunately, it is now just a little too late to return it. Seems some have problems with this razor, some don&#x27;t. I suppose you get what you pay for with this product.</li>
    <li> Got this to start cutting my own hair. Im looking to avoid the wait and cost of monthly haircuts. This seems like it is well made, easy to use with comprehensive instructions and color coded guards. Seems like a great deal for the money. My only negative observation- not really a complaint, is that this thing is incredibly loud. Probably not an issue for most, but everyone in the house will know you are using it. I would, however, buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Feels sturdy, good for my amature needs of cuttign my husbands hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son as a gift and what a deal this was. This is a great set and you will not find this good of a price in the stores. I know I looked everywhere before I bought this one. Plus it works great!!</li>
    <li> The color coded parts gimmick is a little well, gimmicky, but they are the best.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d certainly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I used these to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and I am so impressed.  The color coding and different settings helped a novice like me give a professional looking haircut.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> The best full hair cutting set you can get in this price range, no argument.</li>
    <li> Once I tried giving myself a hair cut with a cheaper brand of clippers and butchered my hair. Luckily my barber was able to fix the mess I had made. After being emotionally scarred from that first experience, I was reluctant to venture out and try cutting my own hair again. Glad I got this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a printed &amp;#34;how-to&amp;#34; manual to cut your hair. Very easy/simple to follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to work after using these clippers the night prior. My peers could not believe I hadn&#x27;t gone out and had a professional cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now obsessed with these clippers....I am able to give myself and my 2 son&#x27;s great hair cuts and save lots of time and money. Wife won&#x27;t let me cut her hair yet...maybe while she&#x27;s sleeping.</li>
    <li> Good first cut! Nice to have a color coded system for the guards, too.</li>
    <li> i can now cut my own hair</li>
    <li> Seems Sturdy.will update after few uses.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my son he loves it. Color blades makes it easier.  Smooth shaving he is very satisfied with product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really quiet when operating !</li>
    <li> Powerful.  The many, color-coded and labeled attachments makes haircuts easy.  The full-color instructions are excellent.  I had never cut my kids&#x27; hair before but this machine has saved me a lot of time and money.  And kids are happy with their cuts!</li>
    <li> We got sick of paying $15 a haircut for two kids and adults. I learned how to cut hair on YouTube and it comes out pretty good because all my boys and men have short hair.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I have ever owned.  Very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> Works perfect and had every attachment that I needed. The price is great and I would definitely recommend to anyone on a budget.</li>
    <li> Great item from a great seller.</li>
    <li> Great buy! My 2nd of the same and the last one still in operation... Packaging was great too!</li>
    <li> It was so noisy. after two times using, It was broken during the cutting.</li>
    <li> Box comes with everything needed to use it quickly with no problems, recommended.&lt;br /&gt;multiple functions, including all cutting combs. Nice work</li>
    <li> Does not cut hair very well</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this haircutting kit and it arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;He read all the positive reviews from those that had purchased this product previously, so he asked me to order this for him.&lt;br /&gt;We used it right away and had good results.  It was easy to use.  Instructions are clear.&lt;br /&gt;Both of us are happy with this product and the price.</li>
    <li> An amazing value.  My old clippers needed new blades, and this kit cost just a bit more.  They seem to work even better than my old Wahl when it was new.  For the price of one haircut I will have four or five years of savings.</li>
    <li> Maybe because I am doing it myself, but it does not feel as sharp a cut as it should. The unit is strong. Again, it could be me. If someone else were using it while doing my hair, my hair would probably look a bit better. Honestly, I would buy it again. It has an array of attachments, motor is strong, and it feels super snug while in hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of hair clippers.  Cut smoothly and with the various combs most haircuts (especially for men) are pretty effortless.  Sure beats paying for a simple haircut at the local cutting places.  The weakest point is the cord connection at the base of the clippers.  It is reinforced, but doesn&#x27;t swivel at all.  So usually after about 2-3 years of use cutting two people&#x27;s hair once a month, the cord will short out at the base.  The cord can be fixed, but to be honest it with about 48-72 haircuts before the cord fails, it&#x27;s easier to just buy another unit for the low price.  This is my third clipper (same one) in ten years of use.  I will keep buying them every few years...new blades, new motor, new cord, near scissors,etc for another 70 haircuts.</li>
    <li> I use it to cut my husbands hair and will use it in the future for my son.  It&#x27;s a money saver for sure!  Easy to use and seems like a good quality.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once and it seems to do what i want it to do, time will prove its workmanship.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair, shaves the back of the neck. Only slightly difficult to figure out the color guide, because the colors on the combs don&#x27;t match the colors on the guide on the shaver. If you look at the numbers on the combs, you still get the right length.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really made very good use of it since i got it but came just as described. Familiar with the brand so I don&#x27;t expect any problems.</li>
    <li> I cut my boy friends hair for him and the clippers he has have seen better days. They needed to be replaced. I have always trusted Wahl clippers so I did some digging on Amazon and came across these. The reviews indicated this was a good buy and they were right. Love the color coding...eliminates the need to examine each guard to find the right one once you learn the color(s) you require. Cut beautifully. No strays or missed hair. With his old ones, I had to go over each section of hair 3 times and there were still little stray hairs sticking up. One run with these and we got a nice even cut. Great price for these and totally worth it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve owned three different clippers; they seem to last about two years each. this one is the nicest one that i have owned. it&#x27;s heavy (it feels sturdy), it&#x27;s not too loud, and it cuts well.</li>
    <li> takes a little practice. does an excellent job. recommended</li>
    <li> It is okay for the price. It is not professional but it works. Sharp edges of the blades might irritate your skin but for the price I am not going to complain.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the 12 yr. old Designer model that it&#x27;s supposed to replace, but not nearly the &amp;#34;clean/sharp&amp;#34; cut as the old model.  Made with obviously cheap materials.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works nice for cutting hair.</li>
    <li> I read from another Wahl haircutting kit that this one (79300-400) was made in USA. It was not fully made in USA -- it uses domestic and international parts). It has great quality. It cuts hair fast and easily. The many clippers are convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been using a Remington for years and was satisfied with it. But it got old so we got a new Remington, which was only several bucks cheaper than this Wahl. But this new one was barely usable the first time and not usable the second time (it cut very little hair off). Because it was made in China, we wanted to try something made in USA and Wahl did a great job!</li>
    <li> These clippers worked very well on my husbands very thick, coarse hair.  Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great product! Nice cut.</li>
    <li> The colored attachment with a color guide on the machine is brilliant. Great job!</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. This is the third one I bought, gave two for gifts. Use it for my beard and for a haircut in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Very nice shavers for 18 bucks.</li>
    <li> excellent article&lt;br /&gt;Am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Better than the others we&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> Hoy casualmente fue el primer dia que la use. Pude afeitar a mi sobrino y esta maquina funciona perfectamente.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband as a christmas present and he just used it yesterday. he really loved it since it is easy to use and it doesnt get stuck or anything on his hair and he said it took him less time to do his hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a while. I&#x27;ve purchased other clippers that were more expensive. This does the job and then some. Great price too!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wahl Designer as well as some other cheap one I got from other stores long time ago. Until the blade got dull, I saw this Wahl 79300-400 on Amazon with high rating on it. I decided to give it a try.  After 5 cuts into my son&#x27;s hair, I had to put it down and used my old Wahl Designer one, even though the blade got really dull. I am returning this. it doesn&#x27;t say clearly where it was made but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprise that it&#x27;s made in China. Spend $30 more or so for the pro series, it will be much worth it.     Cons:  1) It chews hair, doesn&#x27;t cut well.  2) The blade is bigger compare to Wahl Designer. the guides that came with this one can be easily mounted on to the Designer; a slightly push would snap on. But, It is really hardly mount on this one, You have to stress the small end plastic piece out and push hard to mount it, no it doesn&#x27;t snap.  3) The switch is too small, it hard to turn on or off, it looks very cheap and flimsy, especially the guides are made from cheap soft plastic.    Pros: NONE</li>
    <li> Decent razor that gets the job done. I was impressed with the sheer number of attachments that came with it. Unless you want your hair to stay really long, this set will probably last you a while and you won&#x27;t need extra pieces.</li>
    <li> Worked well til it was dropped in a sink once. Empty sink, 2 foot drop max. Won&#x27;t work &amp; can&#x27;t get any response from Wahl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re confident that you or anyone else with access to it will never drop it, then it&#x27;s probably a good buy. Otherwise I&#x27;d buy a more reliable product or an equally speciously made product from a company that will at least respond to email</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money. I have had this since it came out and we use it frequently. I am impressed with the overall design, much easier to hold than others and so much easier to use. My 15 year old cuts his own hair with this and always does a great job. It cuts as close or as far away as you want and really have had no issues  with dull blades or anything of the sort. I think this is the best buy for your money.</li>
    <li> No major concerns. Guards all good, arrived in one piece and all.&lt;br /&gt;However, it came with a pair of scissors, that were WAY too blunt. Tried to trim a bit off the top and felt like I was pulling my hair out rather than cutting. Overall though, I&#x27;m satisfied. And since I actually already have a pair of scissors for cutting hair, it&#x27;s not much of a problem.</li>
    <li> arrived on timeas described  exceptional gift</li>
    <li> I like the color system with the guards. As someone who does haircuts at home and doesn&#x27;t have as much space to operate,store and organize as a barber does in a shop, it really makes it easy/quick to find the guards. I really like how the 1 guard cut. A nice smooth cut. I use the 1/16th a lot with my clippers. I didn&#x27;t find this guard hit as close as I wanted it to, regardless of whether I open or closed the blade. The guards are a nice, sturdy plastic which I like. I&#x27;m somewhat meticulous when I cut my hair, so they take long. The clipper got a little hot but not much after about 25 min. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase, especially given the price. It&#x27;s not a set of Oster 76s but it&#x27;s better than a cheap set of Conair clippers and I paid about the same price.</li>
    <li> My husbands hair grows fast and he just shaves it anyway since he wears a hardhat at times, $20. bucks gets old fast for a 5 minute head shave.  The color coded lengths are  great to quickly grab the  size you want. The pieces for trimming over the ear are great, there are two options for that. I don&#x27;t typically use them as I&#x27;ve cut hair enough now that I don&#x27;t need them, but tried them and they work great. His hair is very thick and heavy, it cuts right through with no problem.</li>
    <li> Pretty good if you are not using it frequently</li>
    <li> I  trim my hubby on the weekends between hair cuts for his work and this razor/trimmer does not disappoint.  It has a nice feel in the hand and a large selection of edgers and trimmers to choose from.  The kit also includes oils and brushes to keep the set in top condition.  It is good value for the money.  My last Wahl razor/trimmer lasted for 20 years until I lost the charger.  This new kit offers so many options it is amazing!</li>
    <li> Wanted clippers that had a better motor than the one I already had, but I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend very much money. Was a good deal when I purchased it. I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Thanks good hair clippers</li>
    <li> Works well, no problems so far.</li>
    <li> Still very pleased with this set of clippers after dozens of uses.  I still have my Color Pro set from about 10 years ago but they have since upgraded the motor and because I was looking to replace the blade set anyway I grabbed the whole package.  Clipper-wise you can tell the difference in power but the clipper itself feels cheaper and lighter than my old model.  It&#x27;s nice to have a whole new set of guides and mine even came with a few that weren&#x27;t listed (but one is very short and the other long so I haven&#x27;t used them).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot if home grade clippers and was always disappointed until I got this, plus it&#x27;s the cheapest one I ever bought. Multi colored attachments was a great idea.</li>
    <li> Yes! with the price of one hair cut, get hair cuts for YEARS!! a must have for the DIY guy. the longest clipper guard is kind of short, but you can always hand cut the top with the included scissors. Cuts like crazy! never had a clog.</li>
    <li> It broke on me after a month.</li>
    <li> Weak motor, pulls hair.</li>
    <li> I like it, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I just used mine for the first time.  Very nice.  Cuts very well.  I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the black tapered &amp;#34;ear&amp;#34; attachments.  Very nice for a quick trip around the ears.</li>
    <li> Good machine does a good job for a quick at home haircut</li>
    <li> The product works great, still going strong, although the case, which is supposed to keep it neat and easy to store, was broken when it got to me. The latch was cracked, so I have to twist-tie the handles together to keep it shut. Inconvenient, but not really that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> Can be used conveniently</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I had them before but replaced with a different set after moving and getting rid of them in the process. Total mistake. Just repurchased to make up for my prior sin of getting rid of them. Great feel, solid construction and does a great job with an even cut .</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on our dog, his hair was matted and messy and the razor just went right through everything. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is high quality compared to the other clippers we owned. It&#x27;s a cleaner cut and doesn&#x27;t sound like an airplane taking off. Even my son loves the colors so he can pick his own length when we touch up.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery and product.</li>
    <li> Noise on this one is awful. If I trim near my ears, it&#x27;s like a shotgun shooting near them. I tried messing with screw, with blades, oiling, nothing helps. It does it&#x27;s job and is really good at it, but that noise... I&#x27;ve read some reviews here and people say the noise is the same as in barbershops. Nope, I&#x27;ve been in tons of barbershops, never heard anything buzzing like that.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Did you get a new haircut? Looks nice.&amp;#34; seems to be the usual when I buzz a bit with these clippers. Be careful, people.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is fine but the 1/8&amp;#34; guard that came with mine won&#x27;t fit, it&#x27;s deformed, melted looking but the big deal is it won&#x27;t lock on so I cannot use it, which is not ok, as the 1/8&amp;#34; guard is the one I use most. Please send me a 1/8&amp;#34; guard that&#x27;s functional and I will improve my rating.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how they&#x27;re able to sell this product for less than $50.  It&#x27;s quite heavy in the hand which seems to indicate its high quality.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it even comes with a special attachment for clipping around the ears.</li>
    <li> This product has been a great investment for a starter clipper set. I have no cons for this product, being someone who uses this kit to do routine maintenance on their hair every other week.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly high quality clipper for the price, great power on the motor. Cheap casing, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a consumer product rather than a professional one.</li>
    <li> My husband liked this product. Good weight to it, built to last and came with lots of attachable sizes. ;)</li>
    <li> Thanks. I recieved it as a gift. I hope my brother will like it.</li>
    <li> Well known name, great product, great price.  Used this clipper for four years with no problems.  Just keep it cleaned properly at it will last.  Color coding helps alot.  Best clipper for the money.</li>
    <li> Comes in a handy case, more accessories than I&#x27;ll probably ever use. Definitely built to last. A little large and unwieldy compared to my cordless/rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price can not go wrong , I will recommend this item to any one who needs it</li>
    <li> Love this product because I do not need to go to the barber anymore. Saves me a lot of money and time!</li>
    <li> It comes with a lot of attachments, its quieter the most I have used and is a good quality brand. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because hair sticks to the rubber grip and is kind of a pain to clean it off.</li>
    <li> I have used it to trim my hair and my son&#x27;s hair over the years and it has performed well so far. I like the fact that it is corded, so it will never lose power when the battery is drained or goes bad.</li>
    <li> Arrived and works as expected, have tried it once and it was nice and strong. Accessories are fine, though I care much more about its ability to cut.</li>
    <li> I simply shave my head every two weeks and it works pretty well. Unlike my last clippers with these I have to shave slower to get and accurate cut</li>
    <li> I bought these because I sometimes get lazy with shaving my head and the clippers that pop out of my Norelco&#x27;s back have a hard time with my thick hair if I let it grow more than four or five days. These clippers are surprisingly well made given their price range and while the plastic portion of the casing feels a bit flimsy the metal underside seems like it could take a beating. It managed to sheer through two months worth of my hair without too much of a struggle, and the shave was decently close to boot. Unless these suddenly give out within my next couple of shaves I&#x27;m pretty darn satisfied. I did have one minor hiccup with these though, the first set I got had clippers that were pretty clearly used, covered in greasy fingerprints with bits of hair stuck between the teeth. A quick e-mail to Amazon and they had a brand new set on my doorstep by the next afternoon and the second set was perfect. The only thing keeping this review from being five stars is the plastic upper casing, but for $18 I dare you to find a sturdier set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Great buy , quality excellent clippers, my 8 year didn&#x27;t mind me cutting his hair, and I didn&#x27;t mess him up lol.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, at a good price</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. High quality.</li>
    <li> We have used these clippers for years and really like them. I have only used this once so far, but it works great. The color-coded hair guides are nice, so you don&#x27;t have to strain your eyes to read the numbers on them.</li>
    <li> Read the directions first! I thought I was above directions.. My husband and son now think otherwise... When it grows out I will try again properly! I did get a chance to use it correctly following directions with my other son and it was beautiful, but skip the ear trimmer piece.</li>
    <li> These clippers do an excellent job, the included hair clips weren&#x27;t necessary for me due, but they can be useful if you want a desired length. They aren&#x27;t too loud and they are easy to manage.</li>
    <li> So I had extremely long hair, like about half a foot long plus and was starting to look like a woman. So I decided to go and get my haircut myself as a lot of barbers are ridiculous with what they charge for a haircut. So I found these while looking for my own trimmers. It was pretty cheap, very good reviews, and I decided to give it a try. I got them about 3 days later, which was surprisingly fast, and tried them out as soon as I got them. I put on the longest length guard and went at it. It came with some nice detailed instructions on how to do it all and helped me along the way. It worked amazingly well and I am very satisfied with it. This was a good investment for me. If you need to keep your beard in place as well as your hair, and no longer wish to have awkward conversations with your barber, then I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great name brand product but didn&#x27;t last even one year. I only buzz my kids hair once a month so we only used this maybe 10 times, I even oil this every time I use it, just like the manual stated. DISSAPOINTED, not a savings at all if I have to buy one every year...</li>
    <li> How can a company still make this product in the USA and sell it for less than a cheap haircut?!?  It boggles my mind... this product is great! And, apparently, the company is doing something right!</li>
    <li> No complaints with it. It works well and quietly, inexpensive, the color system is a little different than normal but the numbers are also on the pieces.</li>
    <li> We bought this clipper at Walmart for about the same price as it is listed on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the packaging is bad; and when we first opened it up out of the box, one of the clipper attachments was broken.  We immediately exchanged it for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor works as expected, but after putting it away and storing the clippers in the case (as is expected), we opened it up again to find another attachment broken.  I believe this is more an issue with the thin plastic walls than it is with the case; you can probably break the tongs off with less than 1 pound of force at the end of the tine.  That is completely unacceptable, and you would expect to see it survive basic handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that Wahl is cost cutting on such a basic element.  Here&#x27;s an idea; instead of thinning the walls of the plastic to save a quarter penny/each, how about eliminating one attachment altogether, and make it more durable.  A single tine failure is equivalent to the entire set failing, unless you are just shearing sheep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers. Motor feels super strong! Would definitely recommend. I didn&#x27;t read up on the color chart but am happy with the straight clean cut I get on the 1 blade! Only thing that would be better is if it had a shape up tool in the package!</li>
    <li> We have always purchased hair trimmers to keep costs down on my husbands haircuts.  In years past we have spent $20-$30 on the cheapest one in the chain stores and they last about 2 years.  Still a money saver but the quality of the clippers was mediocre...lightweight, cheap guards, and they tended to pull at his hair.  This time around I decided to shop online and see if we could get  better quality at the same price.  I came across these and most of the reviews were positive so we gave them a try.  Two haircuts later and we are very satisfied with the quality.  These definitely beat the store bought clippers and for the same price!</li>
    <li> Straight out of the box, these clippers feel heavy-duty and durable.  The eight different color-coded combs included are easy to use, and it&#x27;s nice to have the corresponding lengths printed right on the clipper handle, so you can just check the chart and grab the color/lenth you need without squinting to find the numbers.  Also included are a nice pair of scissors and cleaning oil and brush, along with a handy haircutting guide containing good instructions and photos.  It really is everything you need, all in one neat little case!  The clippers, while heavier than I was expecting, were easy to use and simple to adjust to desired length.  Even for someone like me who had never cut hair before, my husband came out looking just as good as if he went to the local chain salon, maybe even better.  I can&#x27;t say enough about what an exceptional value this kit is... At $22.00, it paid for itself in just one haircut.  Hubby is also using the clippers to groom his beard, and they work wonderfully.  No pulling at his whiskers, and no constant lack of power like the cordless trimmers he&#x27;s used in the past.  I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband as part of a birthday gift. He&#x27;s not really into maintaining fashion, he just wants to be neat and clean. He used it for beard trimming, and we found that it works better than the average over the counter trimmers you can buy in the drugstore. I also used it in conjuction with this product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00969BTTC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and found cutting my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair was much easier and faster! Love! Will be using it to trim the back of hubby&#x27;s neck and behind the ears!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. Sometimes he likes to just shave all his hair off or just trim it up and this makes it easy. He would recommend it. He does not like the container, no organization.</li>
    <li> Over my expectation. It looks high quality and manufactured from good materials. It has a great box which you can put all shaving needs inside.</li>
    <li> The unit is very heavy, the blades break easily if dropped.  Don&#x27;t drop them!  Replacement blades are easy to find on Amazon, and are inexpensive, if you do.  The unit also heats up fairly quickly and is hot to the touch after a while.  I&#x27;ve owned clippers before that were not as heavy, did not break when dropped, and were just as effective in performance.  Overall, these are good clippers for the price i guess.</li>
    <li> Great clipper and even better price. Stays very sharp and is a quality product and the best part; I am now saving money by cutting my own hair..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance for Father&#x27;s Day. He loves it. Definitely a product I would recommend especially if you are shaving your head bald. Also the delivery time is quick.</li>
    <li> Love them.  For the price they cannot be beaten.  My wife cuts my hair and with all the attachments they come with she has no problem.</li>
    <li> This is a decent quality hair cutting kit.  The only thing we did not like about it is that, when switched on - it comes with a bang sound.</li>
    <li> Good product made in the U.S.  Good quality! The color coded guide combs make it easy to remember when I use it.</li>
    <li> The color coded covers make this product easy to use.  So far it has been very durable and is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> These clippers rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp, provide a lot of options (levels) that make it simple for trimming the beard and giving a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little heavy at first compared to my previous pair, but that doesn&#x27;t stop from an enjoyable experience.</li>
    <li> Makes short work of what used to be a laborious endeavor--cutting my own hair--the back especially takes a fraction of the time.  I cut my son&#x27;s hair recently and it was a bit more difficult.  I don&#x27;t know if it was because his hair was much longer or that I was using poor form, or that his hair is made of some mutated protein, but I eventually got through it and it didn&#x27;t snag at all.  I bought this at a brick and mortar store with a bull&#x27;s eye logo.  I did this because I wanted a quick return if I didn&#x27;t like the product.  I like it plenty though.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments haven&#x27;t broken on me.  And the case is small, but I mean, it takes me maybe ten extra seconds to arrange everything so that it&#x27;ll close; not a deal-breaker.  Overall, for the price, it&#x27;s perfect.  It even came with a decent pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> The first thing I thought when trimming my hair with these is that these must be what the pros use because they work amazing and you can really feel the quality by the weight of the product as well as how it performs.  I would recommend this to anyone, with any hair style because it is very versatile and they even give an instruction booklet with some tips on how to cut hair.  They cut very evenly and even through thick or lots of hair.  These are great clippers!</li>
    <li> Works good for shaving and fading hair. My only problem with it was that it got hot while using it.</li>
    <li> Used it once and it worked perfect.</li>
    <li> Instead of it taking me 45 minutes to cut my husband&#x27;s crazy thick hair with salon scissors, it took me only 7 minutes with this haircutting kit.  I love the simple instructions, easy to change combs, surprising power of the trimmer, and the around-the-ear attachments are amazing, I struggled so much with that before.  If you&#x27;re a pro this probably wouldn&#x27;t cut it for you, but for us it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Works great, cuts well, lots of bits to choose from. This was the best deal I could find for a hair cutter.</li>
    <li> Keeps me trimmed up between trips to the barber.  Can prolong time between visits;  purchase paid for after first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair since high school and realized after seeing how haircuts range from 18-24$ without tip, and i get  haircut once a week, i figured i could buy a new one of these every week and still save money.  but you don&#x27;t. they last forever if you take care of them, (care kit comes with it).  last you for years.  great buy and cuts great.  nice travel case too.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, color coded guards help with measurements. And shaves close, just remember to clean the blades after use.</li>
    <li> The Hair clippers arrived in a timely manner. It flew out of the box and landed on my head giving it a perfect cut. No fuss. No mess. Easy to operate. It will take a little practice especially, if you do it yourself and are dyslexic. The &#x27;over-the-ear&#x27; trimmer guide combs are marked &#x27;L&#x27; and &#x27;R.&#x27; You must figure out if that means from your perspective as the victim or the no-good Barber standing behind you holding the clippers. If you screw up really bad you can always take a mug shot and display your work on face book.</li>
    <li> This trimer is just right and comes with all the attachments you&#x27;ll ever need to cut your family&#x27;s hair. Easy color coded and well made. We really enjoy using this machine. It&#x27;s very well made and priced right.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. Have only used a few times, but so far.....so good!  Love the color coded blades. Makes it very easy to follow and keep track of different cuts, etc...</li>
    <li> This was great! I bought it to groom my dog (shepherd mix/mutt), and it worked great on his coarse hair. My only complaint was that the guide that I think would have been the perfect length (3/8&amp;#34;) was not included. Not a deal breaker as this was just for the dog, but it was listed on the insert and then not available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color coded guides were very handy!</li>
    <li> Love this purchase.  Very user-friendly kit that comes with an instruction guide (with pictures).  Haven&#x27;t paid to get my hair cut in over a year and the purchase paid for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> A perfect gift and travel companion.</li>
    <li> I am basically replacing the same Wahl clipplers I bought six years ago.  They are not the best clippers out there, but for the price you cannot go wrong.  my old clippers were making a really loud noise and where not cutting any more.  I tried to adjust it/fix it and sharpen the blades myself, but nothing worked.  I was going buy a new blade kit, but it was almost $15 just to replace the blade.  It made more sense to just buy the new clipper for a few extra dollars.  I will keep the old one just in case I need extra parts.</li>
    <li> Good price hands down!&lt;br /&gt;And the whole kit basically has everything in it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once, and it cuts smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;The hair style turns out to be entertaining, but it is no fault of the cutter...</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I bought, after dropping the first one on a tile floor and breaking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years and these clippers work great.</li>
    <li> Your average cheap haircut it $20 so I initially figured that if I could get at least 2 haircuts out of this that it would pay for itself or so to speak.  I&#x27;m now at least 10 cuts into using it and have been buzzing friends hair as well as maintaining mine.  I was initially skeptical that a $20 razor would even work let a lone cut at different sizes but this, is surprisingly easy to use and maintain.  Literally, If it broke mid cut on my next cut I would buy again because it&#x27;s so easy to use, I&#x27;ve gotten so much use out of it and it&#x27;s cheap.  Gotta save that money while looking fresh ;)</li>
    <li> My old stand-by Wahl bought back in &#x27;93 finally died. This one looks to be similar quality.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend any more money than these. They work great, have a bazillion attachments and decent plastic case for storing it.</li>
    <li> I just opened up the \\&quot;factory sealed\\&quot; package and there is hair stubble all over the comb and trimmer as if it was used before. Gross yo!!</li>
    <li> this product is great and it cuts hair great came with the complete cutting kit, case and accessories it was worth every penny</li>
    <li> Just come to my country I find that the product worked as noisy (had to put cotton in my ears) and wrote many mails Wahl Argentina and never had answer for my money and replacement of the product. It&#x27;s a shame how people cheat. NEVER AGAIN I WILL BUY THE BRAND WAHL !!!</li>
    <li> For the money, man, this is a good purchase.  I do my fiance&#x27;s hair all the time.  Easy to use, great directions.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my husband&#x27;s beard.  It is not heavy or awkward, as some people have claimed.  There are a multitude of different comb attachments, but thus far, I have not used them.  Hopefully, my husband will allow me to &amp;#34;learn&amp;#34; to trim his hair.  This will be a win-win situation, because no matter the outcome, I will get to use those comb attachments, either to trim his hair or shave it all off.  Sounds like fun to me!</li>
    <li> Holds up really well with my husbands very thick hair</li>
    <li> Works good and case is nice. Depth of cut is still a little adjustable if within each clip which is nice. The only minor gripe is that I wish they had some smaller increments than the lowest at 1/8&amp;#34;. I would like an even closer shave. But all in all very good.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a very close cut….this isn&#x27;t the product to get.&lt;br /&gt;But it you are looking to leave the normal stubble behind.  Then this is just like every other pair of clippers you can find.</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl clipper I have purchased.  Both clippers perform exceptionally well.  I would not hesitate in buying another.  Good clipper at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> i liked it because it has so many options are there and easy to handle. its good i can tell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never given myself a haircut before. I would also drag myself down to whatever barber was closest, slap down $20 including tip and get it done. I don&#x27;t have a complex hairstyle; a 5 on top and a 4 on the sides. I hate getting my haircut with the awkward small talk and someone all up on your head. So finally I decided to take the plunge and try it myself. That&#x27;s when I stumbled to this little beauty. Cheaper than how much I pay for one haircut I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Got it and used it today and it was easier than I could have hoped and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between one I pay for and one I did myself. The ear trimmer attachment makes that part a breeze. Blending is even easier. I wish I had started doing this sooner. Now no more trips to get my haircut, no more putting it off until it&#x27;s beyond shaggy, and with one cut I&#x27;ve already broken even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself I don&#x27;t think I could have asked for better. It does not feel like I paid less than $20 for the clipper because the construction feels much more solid than what I would expect. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will hold up, but right now I&#x27;m completely satisfied. It&#x27;s easy to use, the guards work well, the ear attachment guard makes trimming around the ears a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the wall, go ahead and jump. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with this trimmer. Had a beard for many, many years and have used Wahl trimmers for as long as I can remember. It can be noisy, but, let&#x27;s face it - you&#x27;re using it on your face, next to your EARS. You&#x27;re also only using it for minutes - not sleeping with it. I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, their products - this trimmer kit included - have always treated me okay and I&#x27;d buy from them again without hesitation. Oh, and I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I can&#x27;t find a way to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; hair trimmers.  :-)</li>
    <li> It broke down in 3 months. I don&#x27;t recommend it. It first started making loud noise all of sudden and then the two blades got separated making it useless.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Very sharp&lt;br /&gt;2) Sturdy and feels strong and substantial&lt;br /&gt;3) Lots of attachments (but I really only use one)&lt;br /&gt;4) Free haircuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been cutting my beard and my wife has been buzzing my hair for a long time. These are the best quality of the three or so cutters I have yet had.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money!</li>
    <li> The most completed and great haircut kit</li>
    <li> I had been using the Robocut with good results for years. It&#x27;s like the Flow-bee, uses a vacuum, but has better reviews. But the blade needed replacing so I decided to give this a try instead. It arrived and I told my daughter she was cutting my hair. That took her aback but she reluctantly agreed and I must say, the results were impressive and the cut itself was easy to accomplish. Afterward I told her it was the best haircut I&#x27;ve ever had and in truth, I wasn&#x27;t lying. The key to a great haircut is making sure it&#x27;s all cut to the same length and it&#x27;s easy with these clippers, even a kid can do it.</li>
    <li> my flowing locks of hair have no chance with this easy to use hair clipper</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful clipper. I recently purchased this product to replace a very old version that was worn out. It works great and has a boat load of color coded attachments that makes choosing the right length guide a snap!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: The power switch became faulty. However, I got a full 3 years of use out of these $20 clippers before that happened, so after some consideration I&#x27;m maintaining my 5-star review. (I&#x27;m also buying a new set, which is cheaper than paying for two-way shipping to repair the old one, though it is still under warranty.)  The clipper is durable, simple, and comes with some instructions that are very helpful for the first-time DIY hair-cutter. Slightly more expensive than the made-in-China versions, but I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a little more and buy American when it comes with that crucial extra bit of quality. A great investment: by avoiding the barber, I&#x27;ve gotten my money back tenfold in savings.</li>
    <li> Pretty solid unit and I love all the attachments. Well worth the price. The color coding is worthless to me because I am color blind.</li>
    <li> Good price and works great.</li>
    <li> My son is loves it and works great. I love that he can use anytime and he loves using it. I am so happy that I bought this for my son. I will be getting one for my husband for sure. Thank you for making a great product. Peace.</li>
    <li> Sturdy build, quiet operation. I use it for a close cut, which is easy to do even solo. Good value.</li>
    <li> This is a super great razor.  Use it for my hubby, he loves the haircut.</li>
    <li> after first use, i ok with it.</li>
    <li> This is really a fantastic way to save money that pays for itself after one use.  The guards are fantastic and offer a lot of versatility.  The only con I might see is that it is really only useful for short haircuts.  It makes a great body hair and beard trimmer as well.  The unit seems relatively quiet and very solidly constructed</li>
    <li> Directions are easy to understand great buy for your money.</li>
    <li> Very well built and durable.  Price makes it a steal.</li>
    <li> Fantastic trimmer - glad I trusted the reviews.  Feels well made, heavy in the hand and plenty of power for thick hair, etc.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year (I cut my own hair) and it was completely worth the price of entry.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the Walmart junk that will die in a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a clipper or haircutting kit before. My father in the early &#x27;50s use to cut my hair and my brothers hair with clippers which was, at the time, typical. When I received the &amp;#34;Wahl 79300-400&amp;#34; kit, it seemed very sturdy and well constructed. I liked the the color coded combs and well written instructions. So, what did I do? I handed it to my 18 year old daughter, who had never cut hair in her life, and said &amp;#34;Give me a haircut.&amp;#34; The results were great! The clippers worked without a hitch and I received compliments at work of what a great haircut I have. I would recommend these clippers/kit to anyone just beginning to give haircuts.</li>
    <li> I love Wahl hair trimmers so much I have two of the same models (purchased second one because I needed a haircut while on vacation and it was cheaper to buy another set than to go to most barbers in NYC). for simple cuts like mine, its easy, safe and fun, and the shortest setting is nearly a shave, but so much safer that we cut our baby&#x27;s hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why Wahl vs other brands?  I have had others and they just aren&#x27;t as powerful or sturdy. Wahl powers through any minor tangles of your hair while other brands get painfully caught in the tangle. Wahl also lasts longer as it has more metal components (apparent in the weight and heft of Wahl). cheaper brands save you only a few dollars off trhis model. you make up the difference in your first use.  my first Wahl unit has lasted 4 years and still going strong. the unit I just purchased and which I am reviewing has one shorter setting piece than prior models and slightly quieter, otherwise identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any meaningful functional difference between Wahl entry models vs their more expensive models. they all cut well and the differences seem mostly cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now for a few warnings.  if you are going to cut your hair (rather than merely trim sideburns or beard), I would stay away from battery operated models which I have found to be underpowered for hair.  also, for this model you will need an extension cord. and I wiah Wahl would also include a compact mirror to check the back.</li>
    <li> Nice clipper set at an exceptional; price!  My old Wahl was about worn out and this set was less than the cost of repairing the old one. In addition I now have a full set of all the blade guides I have lost over the years.</li>
    <li> Qualitative and besutiful</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a buzzer I bought at Ross or Marshalls. This thing is a beast. Compared to the crappy one I had, this one can cut hair like its butter. My husband used to complain that I was pulling his hair with the old ones, but now those complaints are gone and I can cut his hair twice as fast. Good quality product. I also like the multi-colored guards.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers. Color code helps a lot for us older guys with bad eyes. Will have for many years!</li>
    <li> 1) the case of the machine was closed on one of the combs and bend it and it is usless&lt;br /&gt;2) there was NO spec. about the voltage of the machine or the electric plug. I had to buy a converter from 220V to 110V.&lt;br /&gt;3) the machine is noisy like I never heard before. I can not use it on my kids.</li>
    <li> Does not shave low enough as my older model.</li>
    <li> Too Loud. Bought it to cut my son&#x27;s hair (6 y.o.) and I could barely finish hair-cutting. Not a kid friendly in my case.</li>
    <li> would highly suggest this item to everyone !!! Highly satisfied Would definitively buy again,very pleased,does everything intended to do. thank you</li>
    <li> I like this buzzer. Lots of guards and easy to use. I use it on myself and it works great. Not noisy at all and easy to maintain. Nice grip!</li>
    <li> Very nice cut and great price. Comes with attachments and case.</li>
    <li> This is the world&#x27;s greatest hair cutter for men. I love it</li>
    <li> unproducto is quality, I recommend it, very good razor, and I liked the best is that you have everything in one product comb, scissors and machine</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my son.  The color guide makes it very easy to follow.  It takes some practice though feeling comfortable getting the right angle on his head.  Some spots looked shorter, but he&#x27;s 13, he didn&#x27;t care.  It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I could tell.  The cost of the clippers were cheaper than the cost of one haircut though!</li>
    <li> I started cutting my hair with clippers I bought from CVS, they were about the same price as these.  I got good, and was able to cut my own hair in about 30-40 minutes.  Got these; first time took me 10 minutes to cut, and it looked better than I had ever done before.</li>
    <li> We replaced an old unit with this one and wow, what a difference! These cut great and are very affordable. We did notice a slight difference in the &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; compared to our old unit but no big deal. We just went down a size.</li>
    <li> This Wahl hair cutting kit paid for itself the second time I used it, and two years later is still going strong.  Considering that a standard man&#x27;s haircut is between $12 and $16, I have saved between $348 and $464.  Because my hair grows so fast, I have to cut it every month, as seen in the figures.  That was the best $25 I ever spent!</li>
    <li> with all functions it have,the smoothness, low noise, functionality, different combs, reliability and... It is ranked one of the best compared to its pairs...</li>
    <li> Have only used once but very happy with product.  Feels like good quality.  I guess time will tell.  Happy so far</li>
    <li> this replaces an old set that was dropped one to many times. these work so well there was no choice but to purchase another Wahl. the dog like them too.</li>
    <li> My son will never need to go to the hair salon again!  We are so pleased with this haircutting kit -- I think my son&#x27;s hair looks better than it did when he was paying $25 each time he went to the hair salon just for a buzz cut.  He and a friend cut each other&#x27;s hair and they both came out looking incredible.  I must say we were a little nervous before he tried this, but it came out better than when he used to go to the salon.  He just wishes he had done this years ago!</li>
    <li> I like the Wahl cause it saves me money and time. I cut my own hair with the lowest number clip cause I still wanted it short and it was a good length. Also I did it in about 5 minutes. Never got caught in my hair or anything, works good.</li>
    <li> For this price it is one of the best that you can buy. It&#x27;s heavy and not good looking but you won&#x27;t buy it for the looks. Simply, if you want your hair cut fast and good this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> These trimmers work great, have a solid quality feel like that of barbarshop clippers. The attachment assortment gives you everything you need at a very good price for what you get.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain. Paid 16 dollars for the thing and the comes with everything i need to take care of my own hair. Works better than my old Wahl clippers as well so that is a plus. The guards don&#x27;t feel as solid as the black ones, but they make it easier to find quickly when you are going through the box cause you know what color you need right away. Case is also sizable so i don&#x27;t have to crush stuff to fit it all in.</li>
    <li> I ordered these so that my wife can cut my hair.  She is far from an expert, but my hair still looks great.  The storage case is sleek and simple, as well as compact.  The attachments are heavy duty and not at all flimsy.  The clipper itself is also awesome.  We have used it many times and are very happy.</li>
    <li> These clippers are of great quality for the price!  Easily changeable trimming guards...  I also like that it came with a sturdy carrying case to store them in.</li>
    <li> Works great, as soon as we got it i used it right away. Easy to use guides and sizes and it came in a small carrying case for easy storage. I&#x27;m a first time hair cutter and I found this super easy to use.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm on my sons hair.  The comb guides are easy to use.  The only limit to getting a good haircuit is your own abiliity!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-High quality, feels sturdy and solid in your hand&lt;br /&gt;-Rarely pulls hair... the only time it pulls is when the hair is super super thick&lt;br /&gt;-Great price for such a quality set of clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-... none... its colored blue and maybe some people just can&#x27;t stand color?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely purchase these if you are thinking about it, I would do it again and I probably will if my current set ever dies.</li>
    <li> Great item, works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He used it that wk and loved it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, save lot of time and money!</li>
    <li> We got this so I could give my handsome hubby haircuts to save $$. It was super easy to use and in clean up. My only con to this product is that it does not do the job when it comes to getting super close behind his ears and making fine trimming/ shaving to the edges  by his neck. Luckily he has a beard trimmer that did the job. Other than that, pretty great!!</li>
    <li> It is working great so far.</li>
    <li> Awesome! works wonderfully. worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great set from Wahl!&lt;br /&gt;Over the years (more than 30 years) I have used sets like this from many vendors (including Conair, GE, and others) but none ever compare to the Wahl. The combination of the carbon steel cutting head and a motor large enough to power it is just excellent. But this set has two more nice touches, the heavy duty plastic case is actually useful, and the brightly colored combs virtually ensure that you can&#x27;t make a mistake by inadvertently selecting the wrong one. All of the combs look pretty much the same anyway, and when the only differentiation is a size noted in black raised numerals on the already black comb, well ... mistakes will happen, and you&#x27;ll wind up going into work with a much too short haircut.&lt;br /&gt;So step up to the Wahl. At this price you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Everything came as it was suppose to, but it either came used or had poor packing There was hair on the razor, filth on the clipper head, and all around dirty.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this kit, it works great and the price was quite low. It&#x27;s quiet and easy to grip along with the numerous sizes of clips.</li>
    <li> Usually you can use these (carefully) with no guard. My partner has used one for years. This one left him with redmarks and cuts all over. The lowest guard is not low enough. This is not usable for us.</li>
    <li> When I first got this product it seemed to work great, however after having only had it for about 6 months, it&#x27;s already broken. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but the on and off switch no longer works properly. When flipping the switch it&#x27;s like I had to hover it between off and on in just the right location to make it work, and even then it eventually just gave out and the switch wouldn&#x27;t even move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also don&#x27;t use stainless steel so the metal blades rust. I noticed this almost immediately. One time, because of this, after turning it on, the blades seized up and wouldn&#x27;t work. After moving the height adjustment switch (which moves the blades), all of the rust broke off and it started to work again...I mean what the hell!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> What a bargain.  This is a well made set of clippers that comes with a wide variety of guards for trimming hair.  Perfect for cutting boys hair (of all ages).  I would recommend these to anyone.  Simple to use, and they even come with a nice fold out card that describes how to cut hair well enough to get the inexperienced over the first time jitters.</li>
    <li> The Wahl clippers are a great set for those who wish to start cutting their own hair. It provides a number of different attachments, allowing you to try many new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to be careful of is taking care of the attachments and possible breakage during shipping. Being that everything besides the clipper is plastic and in a tiny space, it is easy for thing to bounce around and get broken. The scissors and combs are not the best quality, but for this price you can easily pick up a better set for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this set for anyone who wants to cost effectively cut their or their loved ones&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> does the trick and was really cheap to boot!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, well built. Comes with a lot of accessories.</li>
    <li> Great machine.  It has color coded pieces so it is easy to see what size you are picking up without needing a magnifying glass, a bright light or comparing it with the other pieces.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily as a beard trimmer. It&#x27;s a bit of overkill for that, but it&#x27;s also cheaper than most of the dedicated beard trimmers. It&#x27;s worked great, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t expect much for a $17 trimmer... But it exceeded my expectations.. Good for haircuts... Can also be used as a regular trimmer...</li>
    <li> I like this product and the brand y very like. I used this many times and is very nice. I like it.</li>
    <li> This works great for cutting my son&#x27;s hair. I love that the clips are color coded, we can easily remember which clips he likes for his hair. Plus it has an instructions and tips for cutting hair, I followed them the first time and it was easy and people thought I had taken my son to the barber shop. Plus these clippers don&#x27;t seem to get clogged up with hair and quit working like my old ones.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised I can easily see it working well for a few years as a long as its maintained.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. The clippers are very noisy and don&#x27;t give good results.</li>
    <li> When I received this wall kit I took it out of the box and the top cover kept falling off the clippers every time I held it or used it.&lt;br /&gt;I had to put a rubber band around it to hold it together.&lt;br /&gt;Why: in manufacturing they forgot to put two small retainer screws in the retainer screw holes on the back side. The holes are there, the screw receptacles are there, but no screws.&lt;br /&gt;They were missed in both  Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing process and in their quality control inspection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second Wahl product that has been devoid of quality control that I have received and used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think the Wahl company has an effective quality control function within their overseas low-pay suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;Price was excellent, but apparently not high enough to actually control quality, appearance was good, but where is the quality control in this company?&lt;br /&gt;I now have to take my time to go find two small screws and finish their missed manufacturing job. They need to put on their product descriptions:  PRODUCT MAY NOT BE FULLY MANUFACTURED OR INSPECTED BEFORE SHIPPING.&lt;br /&gt;At least then we would know that we are paying less to get less and my have to finish the manufacturing job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know how others define incompetent but this would seem to be one way.&lt;br /&gt;On the performance side, once you put a rubber band around the handle to hold it together, it seems to cut well.</li>
    <li> what can I say, it works. but it also has insufficient safety on it so if you aren&#x27;t careful you will be cutting your skin with it if you use the shaver itself without any of the clips on it so you can get a really low cut.</li>
    <li> Good price, received as promised, excellent performance--good product.</li>
    <li> This kit was perfect for my husband. It is smaller than most, and the grip on the handle makes it easier to hold onto than most.</li>
    <li> After 12 uses it still works as good as new.  It has already paid for itself 8 times over.  Seems well built and is made in the USA.  Very happy so far, hopefully it will last another 100 uses.</li>
    <li> Great set and great price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolute garbage. It lasted about 90 seconds before the motor blew up, it almost electrocuted me.&lt;br /&gt;Must be made in China even though it says made in the USA.</li>
    <li> For a 17 USD you might believe you&#x27;ll get a low quality haircutting kit but this one exceeded my expectations. The machine feels heavy and the motor seems strong, also all plastic parts feel durable. They add a couple of long combs to untangle hair and scissors.&lt;br /&gt;A little plus is the retailer kit, which is handy when you want to keep all the kit in a small place.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for older model.  Works very well. Has nice little case.  All the hair cutters are different colors to make it easier when cutting hair.  Doesn&#x27;t come with a cape though.  Over very happy with product and would definately recommend.</li>
    <li> The machine makes a lot of noise and can&#x27;t change however much you adjust as per the manual.</li>
    <li> purchased clipper set so i can cut my sons hair and i works great. For the price it&#x27;s a good deal. Also the color coded clips make it easy to find the size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice and very easy to use</li>
    <li> I loved it, I read some bad reviews and almost didn&#x27;t buy it, I wanted to cut my own hair because I&#x27;m low maintenance when it comes to hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product works very well and feels very strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend it if you have doubts</li>
    <li> Very efficient and easy to use!!</li>
    <li> Loved it. So easy to use, with the color coded guide and combs, it made it easy to choose and remember which setting I used. So cheap in cost but not quality. Fast delivery. Comes with lots of pieces for salon quality haircuts. I did drop it the first use (on tile) and a tiny price broke off the comb, but I expected the entire machine and all  to be broke as hard as it fell so it is durable as well just not indestructible.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this trimmer to trim my body(chest and stomach) hair. What can I say, I like when it&#x27;s neat.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is quite solid, does not vibrate, does the job quickly and nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many units of this type, Wahl does not come with a rechargeable battery, but its cable length is long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that its price is unbeatable?&lt;br /&gt;More, it&#x27;s Made in the USA!</li>
    <li> To heavy, hard to handle is a &amp;#34;vibrater&amp;#34;, OK for the price, but I definitely won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> These clippers really do work great.  Plenty of power, and plenty of extras included.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is due to the shoddy carrying case that these clippers come with.  The latch on the case can probably only be opened and closed a handful of times before it snaps off completely.  Still, for the price this is pretty tough to beat.</li>
    <li> Clipper guides are very flimsie...4 out of 8 of the guides were broken. I didn&#x27;t bother with a time consuming return because the guides from my old clippers fit.</li>
    <li> I changed my hairstyle~</li>
    <li> Very good product and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Has saved me many $ and many hours on hair care. Doc could be better, but once you learn how to use this it is MARVELOUS.</li>
    <li> Was surprised how well it worked also some reviews have complaints of it being loud I didn&#x27;t think it was any louder than any other clippers.</li>
    <li> I can make myself a haircut in the ease of my home, I have enough time with the machine and I found an excellent investment.</li>
    <li> Great for the price and for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper, works great, and the color coded combs are a nice plus.  I bought a 2nd one for a gift.</li>
    <li> I use it once a month for 2 years now, and it holds up well. I have not yet needed to change blade/clips or whatever.</li>
    <li> Got this for my grown son, as he likes to do his own hair.  Does a really great job.  He is really pleased with the outcome.</li>
    <li> First set of clippers I ever bought and works great! Very happy with this purchase and would recommend. I&#x27;ve cut my own hair twice with it and have had no complaints. It&#x27;s a bit noisy but it&#x27;s what you expect out of an electric buzzer.</li>
    <li> It is cheaper then going to the barber and since much of my hair has already gone awol the short buzz cut this provides is ideal. I haven&#x27;t used it to cut and styles but it does great with the short cut.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these clippers about 5 years ago and then I could not find them in stores for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: color identifiable guards, cuts very close, not loud, great price!&lt;br /&gt;cons: a little heavier than other pairs I have bought</li>
    <li> I love this hair clipper. I&#x27;ve always cut my sons hair even though I probably have no business doing so (I am by no means a barber/hair stylist). Now that my son is used to the noise of clippers I decided to move up from scissors and my husbands mustache trimmer to real clippers. My son has his daddy&#x27;s thick course hair and I just decided it looks better shaved especially during the summer plus it&#x27;s easier on him and me. I really like the color coded attachments to this clipper - they are easy to pick out and attach. The trimmer itself seems to be well made - it doesn&#x27;t shake or vibrate at all and it cuts through my sons hair with ease.  The price is also great - you can&#x27;t beat it!  I&#x27;m very pleased with these clippers and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> very good for the face and head. Super sharp</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I am a very frugal person and as such felt bad paying $10 everytime I was uncomortable with the length and distribution of my hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I howled to the moon that is Amazon and they came through delivering this majestic piece of engineering, taking the money out of those cosmetologists and italian dude&#x27;s named Luigi and Piero, putting it back where it belongs : Spongebob&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I said it, spongebob&#x27;s house, thats how he manages to live so well while working minimum wage for Mr. Krabs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for close to a year now, and well even after 0 maintenance works perfectly. It has several sizes of combs so you can make your hair as long as you need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It come with an okay scissor that is very hard to use if you&#x27;ve ever cut anything in your life, but well, leaves strands okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sure if you are like 90% of guys that just shaves it off after it grows too long. Do yourself a favor and invest in this for yourself :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 2 haircuts make this a moneysaver.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. I&#x27;m pretty sure that the person who received it loves this item.</li>
    <li> Got this a month ago, its is easy to use and well made. Also, it is easy to clean and maintain theses clippers.</li>
    <li> I used this clippers and it so easy. I am litterally almost blind and my cut was given thumbs up by family. It so easy an almost blind man can do it.</li>
    <li> YOU ARE GIVEN MANY SO MANY CHOICES OF DIFFERENT SIZES FOR CUTTING YOUR HAIR OR BEARD THAT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD VALUE.</li>
    <li> Consider haircut cost, tip, gas, and time.......... and it pays for itself in one use and just use on the dogs or kids if you decide it&#x27;s not for you!  I&#x27;ve continued to use on a fairly simple hair cut using 3 different guides to do what my long-time stylist couldn&#x27;t do as well with scissors and all the training.</li>
    <li> did well the first time; only time will tell</li>
    <li> Fast shipping &amp; packaging was fine. This was a gift and I&#x27;m told it is very versatile and works well so far. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> The first thing that strikes you is the build quality, this is a solid shaver, not flimsy or sketchy! it went through my hair without a hitch! i haven&#x27;t had any bog downs and the attachments are all quite nice too!</li>
    <li> I gave these as a Christmas gift and my  husband loves these clippers, He trims his own hair. Very lightweight and quiet.</li>
    <li> This clipper is so easy to use. The color coded clipper guide takes the guess work out. It is neatly packaged, The clipper is quiet and very gentle in the hand during use, It is a great value. I bought it to cut my 89 yr old dads hair (whats left of it :) He thinks it great too!</li>
    <li> I like the colorful sizes to help distinguish which size is which. I don&#x27;t have to read the size every time. I just have to look at the color and I know which one to use. There&#x27;s not much I can say about this product except the blade. The blade is not good at all. I ended up buying a new blade and it worked out better. The bottom and top blade that it came with made this clipper not very efficient. It would not function rapidly, which did not cut hair in one single swoop. I used a zero and it took me 4 brush strokes to actually get it to zero. I recommend getting new blades because it does not come with a good one.</li>
    <li> My roommate owned the exact pair that I used for approx. 6 months and I loved them. Decided to get my own because I knew what I was getting. Strong motor and you get a great cut. I have thick hair and these are the best clippers I have found that aren&#x27;t crazy expensive. Would recommend again and again.</li>
    <li> The haircutter was not thoroughly well described: it&#x27;s fitted with an american plug and it works at 120 volts. Neither into the description nor into any pictures  this feature was explained. I cannot use it in Finland where the plugs are differently shaped and where, most important thing, the voltage is 230 volts. I already bought an universal adapter for the plug but a voltage converter would be too expensive, so not worthwhile. I tried to ask for a replacement, the same product designed for european market (and it does exist) but it seems that it is not possible.&lt;br /&gt;For these reasons, for this lack of competence and trustworthiness, I&#x27;ll never buy anything again from amazon and of course I&#x27;ll never recommend people I know to buy anything from this misleading site.</li>
    <li> Great price for quality!</li>
    <li> This thing sucks, u will feel everything. You will feel like your head being open, I used to many different ones but this one just so bad. cheap for a reason.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper a couple of years back. My boyfriend was spending $25 a month for a haircut. I have no hair cutting experience, but figured I wouldn&#x27;t need much just to buzz his hair. Well, 2+ years it&#x27;s still going strong! There are so many sizes to choose from. It&#x27;s easy to use. If this one kicks the bucket, I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> As advertised, and delivered promptly by Amazon.</li>
    <li> came quick I used it to cut my 2 bichons hair and it did a wonderful job the price is good</li>
    <li> We used it all the time. It&#x27;s not super heavy Luke our last wahl. The shape of it fits better in your hand. Loved that the gaurds were color coded for easy use. Overall I would buy over and over especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Decent clippers for head and body shaving, but not much good for facial hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my son has decided he wants very short hair. I&#x27;ve watched the girls at the salon buzz his hair and it didn&#x27;t seem too hard. And he&#x27;s a boy. Trimmed his hair easily. We aren&#x27;t planning on fancy haircuts, so this works just fine. No complaints at this time.</li>
    <li> Powerful.  Quiet.  Easy to clean.  Solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Remington for years and thought it was really nice.  Then I got this one.  Man, don&#x27;t look any farther.  Just buy this one.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Does a great job!</li>
    <li> the thing I really like about this shaver is that it is electric and it doesn&#x27;t die on me. I have gotten through 1/2 a hair cut and have my cordless shaver die. What a bummer. You do have to figure out which guard to use there are so many. (Good thing not bad)!</li>
    <li> Works very well, shaves my son clean unlike oster feed i had brought earlier and returned. Value for money.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this haircutting kit about 1 month ago, and I&#x27;ve already cut my hair twice. My hair does grow pretty quickly and thickly, but this cut straight through my hair without any issues. The razors I&#x27;ve used in the past get jammed with my hair, but this one had no issues. The variation in lengths is great, although I stick to a shaved head with #1. Best razor for the best value.</li>
    <li> The haircutting kit is very helpful. I and my friends have used it. It brings a lot of conveniences. I got it very quickly.</li>
    <li> A monster clipper!!! I love mine. It&#x27;s heavy, a little bulky, and maybe noisy, but hey, I am a college student trying to same some money on barber shops. So I go in the bathtub with this guy, and just trim my entire head with a #2 comb. Very easy maintenance, very easy to clean. It doesn&#x27;t lose power easily, either, it can have a big bulk of hair in between the blades and it will still cut nicely.</li>
    <li> I spent this much per haircut and now I just do it myself. Great way to save money</li>
    <li> It looks professional. It comes with a lot of guide combs from #1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, ... a lot. You even have 2 special for cutting over the ears.&lt;br /&gt;The blades cut fine (at least on my first cut).&lt;br /&gt;I only miss the powder neck duster, commonly present in other brands.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice travel hard plastic box to store all the items.</li>
    <li> great price, works great...</li>
    <li> My partner used this for less than a minute before it burned out and completely stopped working and filled my room with smoke!&lt;br /&gt;Would like seller to contact me.</li>
    <li> Work very good perfect for the price I will recommended this Clipper  compare to other this one is the best I have use it the first day this Clipper work the way I was expected I will probably get a second one I give this Clipper a 10+</li>
    <li> The product is not bad, but it only lasted a year and the motor will burn down even though I used it just once a month.</li>
    <li> Have had Wahl clippers in the past and this model doesn&#x27;t disappoint. They feel very study in your hands and cut without any grabbing. I use these only for facial trimming and they work well for this. I can see how the color coded attachments would help for the head.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the product. Easy to use. The trimmers are made with quality. I would recommend this product. I&#x27;ve used them 2x and had didn&#x27;t mess my boys half up.</li>
    <li> Thank you  great  job</li>
    <li> pros--lots of attachments and options &amp; no batteries to replace&lt;br /&gt;cons--very stinky plastic pieces &amp; wife is sensitive to chemicals</li>
    <li> Great blades good coloring makes it easy to use.I cut my hair at home using it always without problems.</li>
    <li> I order this for my grandson, and he is very happy with it. He has a good shaped head and looks very good with his hair buzzed very short. His girlfriend does it for him. Saves him lots of money on going to the barber.</li>
    <li> For the price of a single haircut, this thing is hard to beat. Hadn&#x27;t cut my hair in over a year and this things buzzed right through it. Diffrent razor lengths were also very easy to snap on compared to others I&#x27;ve dealt with.</li>
    <li> Good product. Hope it last s long as previous machine.</li>
    <li> Pays for itself with the money I save cutting my husbands hair. I&#x27;m not a hair dresser but my husband has been complemented on his haircuts not knowing I cut his hair vs him going to a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that things are color coordinated.</li>
    <li> not very powerful&amp;not enough blade guildes</li>
    <li> very good give u a clean cut</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband after reading all of the positive reviews.  He used the cutter twice (once on our 3 year old son and the second on himself) and it just didn&#x27;t work well.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because they both have thicker hair, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to cut very well.  We are planning on returning it and purchasing a different one that will, hopefully, work better.</li>
    <li> Use this to trim my hair. Easy to use with many attachments!</li>
    <li> This works so well, and has such an even shave. For the price, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant when looking for cutters. I kinda knew that brandwise Wahl was the way to go but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what model to go for. After a lot of thinking and looking around, I finally decided to go with this one. I must say I made the right choice. I have had this cutter for a little over a month, and I I have easily maintained my hair nice and stylish thanks to this. The only downside is that it is kinda large so it gets in the way when you are trying to shape up your hairline, but that is nothing that a smaller trimmer can&#x27;t solve. Nonetheless, this has been a great purchase, I sure can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Best buzzer I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> Replaces the one, same brand that I have used for many years</li>
    <li> Work great, but the fine adjustment won&#x27;t stay put. The vibration always makes it move toward the shortest cut.</li>
    <li> I used it many times very easily use and no problems occur.</li>
    <li> Work so smooth and quiet compared to our old hair clippers.  My husband has cancer and is losing his hair. We can take the lowest setting attachment and buzz his remaining hair real short so that when it does fall out it is just little pieces. Also they are so quiet and gentle they didn&#x27;t bother his head after brain surgery.</li>
    <li> Works great and was cheap to purchase. I love the color coded guards as well.</li>
    <li> Have not used it yet, just received. Cutting blade is not even, slightly crooked on one side, not sure if this is considered a defect or not, will investigate further, otherwise seems to be fine for under $20.00</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and its very precise as well as easy to use.</li>
    <li> easy to use, I like it.</li>
    <li> I never buzzed my hair before so I was pretty excited to get these. They are really nice entry level clippers and for $18 you are really getting your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> Works great, I wasn&#x27;t sure for the price if this would be as good as it is, but it is heavy duty and cuts great.  I had a different model clipper that was more expensive and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this.</li>
    <li> Heavy, but works great</li>
    <li> This is a heavy, solid piece of equipment. Quiet, smooth, and comes with a lot of attachments and its own case. Incredible value. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This has worked great so far and I am 3 cuts in.  The hair is removed with great precision and the color coordinated levels of cut make this product very easy to use.  The only tough parts are cutting the sides and the back.  The area around the ears is a little tough to get.  My wife just helps out with that and there is no issue after that.  This is a great product for the price.  The razor is about the same price as only 2 haircuts!</li>
    <li> This has the worst sound I ever heard. I cant even put it on for a sec, I feel the whole neighborhood hears this wild machine.</li>
    <li> Best bang for your buck! They work just fine!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Well worth the money. Quality product</li>
    <li> At 71 years of age and with a bum right arm with limited motion and strength I wouldn&#x27;t dream of trying to give myself a complete haircut with this item. Read the directions and then used it to clean up the mess hanging over my ears and sideburns. Bought myself a few weeks until I will need to go to my stylist for a real haircut. With the time I bought completely worth the purchase. If I was married I would ask my wife to go for it and do a complete cut. Directions are very clear. Unfortunately I live alone so ain&#x27;t gonna happen.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good for about 2 months, then I started hearing an amazingly loud buzzing/clanking noise that would sporadically come and go.  During the 2 following weeks the loud noise (metal on metal grinding) got worse and worse to the point it was not tolerable.  Also during this this time the trimmers stopped cutting hair and began just pulling it.  Maybe I just got a bad pair, but the pair I received I rate one out of five stars.</li>
    <li> So now I am the official hair dresser in the family.  My sons hate going for haircuts so now I am IT.  The kit has everything you need to do short haircuts.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a real money saver.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use.  The long cord makes haircutting easy to get around .  The color coded attachements with easy to read sizes are definitely a great feature.</li>
    <li> PROS: It doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Many other clippers pull hair. It even worked on my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The ear guides poke the area around the ear. If you cut your own hair, you need to be REALLY skilled at handling this when using the ear guard or ear blenders. The unit gets very hot and it chafes a little when no guard is used (for example when squaring off the bottom of the back of your head). But, I also gave myself 3 haircuts. Basically when the ear guards left streaks in my hair, I experimented with shorter sizes since I was gonna have to buzz it all off anyway. I don&#x27;t plan on doing that always.</li>
    <li> best clipper ever!!! better than professional ones!!! you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Works well, but it&#x27;s super loud. Comes with a bunch of attachments so you can probably do a lot if you know how. Doesn&#x27;t do a super good job of explaining how to do some of the styles it lists.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  The clippers work great and you can&#x27;t beat the value for the money.  I used them to shave my head so I really don&#x27;t use any of the guards or attachments.  It cuts at a decent pace but will probably bind if you are in a rush.  They&#x27;ve worked great for me and my purpose.</li>
    <li> They do the trick. My wife cuts my hair now, which saves us money. Also, when she cuts my hair I proof of evolution as my head is the missing link. Seriously. Monkey head. I believe it&#x27;s called monkeyheaditus. She likes it because I get hit on less, which is approaching absolute zero.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 18 year old son to use, as he likes a pretty short cut. He went online, you-tube I think, and watched the videos. His first do-it-yourself cut was a little shorter than he wanted, but it still looked really good. I like the colored attachments for the different lengths, it makes it easier to remember what one used previously. Works great, easy to use, very happy with this purchase and price. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this to cut my newborn baby boy and it worked as intended. Very good tool and will definitely make good use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if this does operate using battery.</li>
    <li> These work and feel well so far. I bought them to replace a worn out 10+ year old Wahl, hopefully they last at least as long.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! will never pay for a haircut again!</li>
    <li> great product! fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great barber haircutting kit. Based on the reviews I tested it and worked great. In addition,unlike others reviews that mentioned loud buzzing noise from this model and was in fact was quite with no noticable noise. Don&#x27;t know what the others are talking about.  This should last quite a long time for usage. Great for trimming the back and ears and saves money without buying an additional trimming cutter this does it all and no additonal attachments needed.  Other reviewers were of great help in answering my questions and the reason for puchasing this model.</li>
    <li> It got broken the first time I used it..</li>
    <li> Excellent hair cutters.</li>
    <li> This this is heavy but it works really well for cutting my husbands hair</li>
    <li> So many good reviews for nothing because after 2 uses it makes a loud knoise like its defective.Save your money!!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer hair, use primarily to shave all body hair and pubic hair, I recommend it for men and women, leave the extremely short hair, almost looks like you waxed (not just clear), but without side effects of redness, itching, etc. And the incredible price.</li>
    <li> Wow, great product, easy to use and does a great job</li>
    <li> these work great I purchased them for the second time.  I am happy and they are so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This was one of the best purchases I have recently made. I have a wiggly 3 year old boy, and have now used this trimmer for 4 haircuts. It is fairly foolproof, though I do not recommend letting your 3 year old pick what combs he wants based on color (after the first cut, I over trusted my skill, and let him pick a comb that was far too short.) It has saved me not only money, but time and hassle in dealing with getting my 3 year old to the barber. My family would never let me live it down if my son had &amp;#34;mom&amp;#34; cuts all the time - so far, there have been no negative comments. So, a good deal!  EDIT:  I have had this clipper for over 2 years now and it is still awesome! My boys are now 6 and 3 and I use it on both of them. The older one has stiffer hair, so it works really well on him (I use the 4 comb on the sides and the 8 comb on top typically), but it also works with my younger son who has light curly hair. I bought an additional 1.5&amp;#34; comb to use on top for him, and use the 8 comb on the sides so it is a bit longer to accommodate the curls, but I can still get a very nice cut and it is so much easier than taking them out!</li>
    <li> Way better than all the wireless razors I had been using</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never given a hair cut before. This works great for me, the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; is sharp and precise, it does exactly what you expect it to, the color coded heads representing lengths also help greatly. I can&#x27;t comparatively speak but I&#x27;ll buy this exact model again if this goes bad, like it that much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it now like 3 times and I can&#x27;t complain. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming tool for my cocker spaniel&#x27;s thick coat.  I am able to cut  my dog&#x27;s hair effectively and safely.&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
    <li> Great quality, and the price is right!! I use this to cut my son&#x27;s hair, and a few others. Comes in a nice case with all the attachments!</li>
    <li> trimmer works great and I like the color coding ,but the  generic case makes it hard to fit everything in it, and impossible to make case content neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> I used them for cutting my grandson&#x27;s hair but you have to be careful because the corners of the blades are sharp.</li>
    <li> It works good, my wife like it. &amp;#34;I can be a barber now&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Okay! careful, then where is my hair. &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re giving yourself haircuts, expect a little bit of a learning curve! This thing is awesome for the price and has saved me a ton of money over the last year. Worth it.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find it so complete.  Works great, now working on my self grooming skill.</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as I hoped. I bought these after an older pair of Wahl clippers broke after dropping them. Occasionally they have tugged on my hair, but then again I have pretty thick hair. Maybe the motor will smooth out over time.</li>
    <li> Just awesome!  just replaced a Vidal Sassoon clipper that lasted 10 years and hoping this one will be the same.  So far so good and it is quite powerful</li>
    <li> Very smooth transaction, with fast shipping.  Clippers work like a dream, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> No complaints,cuts hair great</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut my hair at all.  Loud, heavy, and difficult to use. Avoid this cheap product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in December 2012, for about $20.  Now you can purchase it for the price of a haircut + tip, so if you use it just once, it pays for itself.  Now it&#x27;s been 2 years almost, which means I&#x27;ve made $378 off of this product by not having to go to a barber.  It&#x27;s amazing, and still feels like new.  I buzz my hair all around using usually a 4, then have my wife come in and trim up the neck part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is you have to commit to an all around buzzed cut unless you know someone with the skill to do fades with 2 clippers.  There are times I want to grow my hair out a little more and have it styled, but then I think of the costs and it&#x27;s totally not worth it.  Even if it broke down today I&#x27;d still purchase this again because of the costs saved.</li>
    <li> Pro: price is low, so it is a good deal for this low price (lower than 20 dollars). Also it works well, and I can save lots of money cause I don&#x27;t need to go to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coin: noise is too much and vibrates hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: In overall, this price for this device is preety good, you can cut your hair easily by yourself, which can save lots of money. But if the vibration of it can be lowered, it would be prefect. Love this first purchase in amazon.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. The power button broke after 2 uses. This is my 5th Wahl product that broke less than a month after purchase. bought a Deluxe Chrome pro, lasted about 4 weeks, power button failure. I then bought a Balding Clipper, lasted 3 weeks, motor failure. I sent both of those items to repair at Wahl on my own money for mailing. I got them back, they both break after 1-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 2 years and I am in need of another clipper. I figure why not, I&#x27;ll try Wahl again. This was a good price. So i bought this product on September 16th 2014. I use it once per week on my face only. Today is Oct 3rd and the power button is broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible horrible products.</li>
    <li> Shaved my shaggy head as soon as it was out of the box. Has some heft to it, ran smooth without any tinkering before use. Just add oil and it&#x27;s ready to go. I rock a zero-cut but the scissors, length combs and styling comb could come in useful some day for cutting kids hair or something. Was skeptical that it was cheaper than other similar clippers but I ended up highly satisfied.</li>
    <li> Seemed nice, but the power switch broke within two months.</li>
    <li> The noise is so loud and the vibration so strong you turn it on that could not use it.</li>
    <li> Great mooney saver, make your money back in no time.</li>
    <li> Works great. Color coding is nice. Quiet motor. Tons of accessories. Would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars if the carrying case had some sort of organization or slots for the accessories. Everything just kind of floats around inside.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I have cut my hair 3 times with this item and my sons twice and I have yet to encounter any issues. My hair was quite long the first time and the blades never got stuck or gummed up. The longest blade made my hair look short compared to before I cut it. The color coded blades make it easy to identify if you don&#x27;t want to remember exact measurements. The guide is helpful if you&#x27;ve never tried to cut someone&#x27;s hair before. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use these clippers for simple crew cuts, and the clippers are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor seems larger and more powerful than the motor of e.g. the Remington HC-920.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s no internal battery, because i always use the clippers with the electric cord, and in fact an internal battery can be significantly counter-productive -- on the Remington HC-920 there were times when the clippers would not function sufficiently to cut, even with the electric cord attached, because the battery was not sufficiently charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor, strange negative on these Wahl clippers is that the built-in length chooser has no markings or clicks, so that if one wants to create the exact same length the next time it&#x27;s a bit difficult.</li>
    <li> I got these after our last pair broke.  It had good reviews for the price so I went for it.  It has worked well for me. It doesn&#x27;t get a lot of use, but I have had it for 6 months and it is still working just fine without pulling hairs or making grinding noises when in use.  It comes with all you need for cutting hair...buzzer, attachments, over-the-ear attachment, scissors, and a comb.  Plus the case fits it all well and it comes with a cleaning brush and lubricant to keep the machine running smoothly.  I recommend this to any home user.</li>
    <li> My husband decided I should cut his hair since he doesn&#x27;t have that much of it. Love this product. The color coding of the guides is helpful and makes it easy to do a good job even if you are totally inexperienced. I try to get him to cut mine, but no luck. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm so far, lots of nice attachments, and I love the color coding. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with this product I received .</li>
    <li> Just used it to trim my hair! Very clean even cuts! Although one of the little attachments that came with it had a chipped tooth, I&#x27;m still very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I gave up on my expensive clipper and bought this after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on my beard, my hair, and my fuzzy little dog.</li>
    <li> This Wahl clipper is great! I can trim and edge my beard and it works wonderful to cut my hair (what little I have left).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair to save some dough and the clippers are decent for the price. Didn&#x27;t have any hairs pulled from the first time I used them. If you keep the blades oiled per use, the blade with last. I like the #1/2 clipper comb it makes it easier to fade the hair from a no guard to the #1 guard. Blade looked pre-oiled opening the box.</li>
    <li> These are great and last. I dropped the last one so that is why I needed to get another.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations, as its using an American voltage rating of 110 Volts. I&#x27;m in Nigeria, and we use 220 Volts. Didn&#x27;t foresee this, as it wasn&#x27;t indicated in the product features. Another issue is this: the motor is just too strong and always almost vibrates furiously. My barber checked it and says with time, the noise will reduce.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from these, its a nice home equipment, at least I don&#x27;t have to go to the barbershop to shave my beard.</li>
    <li> Great clippers!  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Got this to save money by doing my own haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;I usually just buzz cut but there are some good easy to follow guides in the booklet it comes with for blending hair lenght.&lt;br /&gt;Easy enough to follow that I just might try it for fun next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opperation is extreamly quiet. Yet it doesn&#x27;t bog down when cutting through thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> We have been through about 6 -7 trimmers over years of cutting hair in our house.  This product has held up well.  The blades haven&#x27;t needed sharpening and cut really well.  It&#x27;s also quiet.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and has a multitude of lengths available.  The guards are arranged in color and stack nicely into each other.  I know that sounds stupid, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> machine protector damaged</li>
    <li> Well, I thought the color system would be awesome.  It&#x27;s OK.  For some reason it always takes me a minute to remember that the color system is even there and to start searching for the right attachment based on color.  Old dogs, new tricks, etc.  As for the clippers themselves, they are OK.  Very average in terms of form and function.  If you want some cheap, essentially disposable clippers, then these will do the trick.  Biggest problem is the case.  Some genius decided to make a case so tiny that the clippers can only fit inside if you turn them just so, run the cord through the handle of the case, and then hold it all in place while you latch it.  Nevermind the fact that the attachments all have to be perfectly interlocked and arranged to even reach that step, and there is absolutely no room for a single extra accessory--like a pair of scissors, maybe?  This is the kind of thing where you hope someone was like &amp;#34;Hey, let&#x27;s make this case more efficient so it will fit in the drawer easier.&amp;#34;  Instead, I can just hear some up-and-comer saying &amp;#34;Hey guys, I just figured out how to make $0.08 more profit on the case!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this corded one. We have had others with rechargeable batteries and phooey, they are for the birds. Even fully charged the others petered out after one haircut.  These corded ones are the way to go, and get an extension cord if needed.</li>
    <li> I like to keep my head shaved as low as I can get it, but without using a razor. This clipper works great and I can get really close with it. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Very smooth operation. Quiet too!</li>
    <li> This Clipper is a piece of crap...&lt;br /&gt;On the first day I used it, it burnt.&lt;br /&gt;It made a lot of noise first and all of a sudden it burnt.&lt;br /&gt;I don´t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Ohhh yeah, cut my hair right quick, easy as hell, who needs to pay to have their hair cut? i mean i paid for the clippers but you know what i mean. Great machine. Thanks for sellin!</li>
    <li> close and consistent cut. Used 3 or 4 times without any problems. Definitely read the care instructions on using brush to remove small hairs after each cut and only lubricate every so many times.</li>
    <li> A very impresive product for the money. It came with everyting as advertised and in a sterdy plastic case with moderitly enough room to hold all the color coded attatchments and accesories. It fit well in my hand as the rubber padding didn&#x27;t alow for slips and near misses when trimming around the ears or trying to straighten a neck line. I am not a proffesional barber by any stretch of the emagination but if I can give myself a proffesional looking haicut following the simple easy to read insructions that came along with this product, then so far I feel I have made a worth while investment.</li>
    <li> Decent quality! I got this as a Christmas gift for my thrifty husband. He can&#x27;t stand paying $30 for a haircut every 6 weeks, so now I am his barber! Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t over-heat.&lt;br /&gt;Great all-in-one tool kit, complete with scissors and comb guides for all lengths of hair from 1 - 12...&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that the kit was missing comb numbers 8 &amp; 9 - it skipped straight from 7 to 10, making it a little more difficult to blend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for over two decades. The last one I had lasted me over ten years before it started to &amp;#34;stutter&amp;#34;. Maybe I should have oiled or aligned the blades more frequently but nonetheless, those clipppers lasted a long time with barely any maintenance on my part. And I give these things a beating too with about 75 cuts a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one to replace my last Wahl clippers and I have little doubt it will another ten years. When compared the older generation clipppers, here&#x27;s my take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly lighter&lt;br /&gt;- Accurate cutting (or shaving if using no blades)&lt;br /&gt;- Seems like same motor inside (based on sound)&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent value&lt;br /&gt;- Kit comes in a case with many blades and other cutting tools&lt;br /&gt;- Blue grip area feels nice; less slick than other parts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;- The construction does not seem as sturdy (likely from using lighter plastic casing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;After several uses, this has not disappointed. Based on experience, it will be at least another ten years before I buy another and by then, I would have used this to cut/trim my hair and my two sons hair about 750 times. The next one will be Wahl&#x27;s too.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, especially for the price.  Haircuts were fast, and the clippers were also quiet when running.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used the Wahl clipper to cut/trim my own hair twice, and I really think it&#x27;ll do just fine.  It&#x27;s a scary prospect to take a trimmer to your own noggin, but with a bit of patience and a fair amount of hutzpah, you&#x27;ll do just fine.  I also took a bit to look at the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on YouTube, and considering that I take a standard &amp;#34;#2 all over&amp;#34; cut, there&#x27;s not a lot I can screw up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main unit seems perfectly sturdy and works well (so far), the blade/guide doesn&#x27;t fall off mid-stroke (like an old one I used to have did once), and I have no doubt that I&#x27;ll be able to get several dozen or more cuts done before experiencing any problems...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the set came with a &amp;#34;#1.5&amp;#34; guide, as a #2 is too long and a #1 is too short, but hey, I spent $16 on the kit, and so far, I&#x27;ve already saved $30 on the two haircuts (counting tips), so who am I to complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it...  Would do it again...</li>
    <li> Wahl makes solid products that are built to last. As long as you oil them every so often, they&#x27;ll last you years. Would recommend over Conair grooming products.</li>
    <li> very low quality.. dont buy.. spend some more money and buy a better quality.&lt;br /&gt;It vibrates too much and make big noice when you start and stop the trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Good little machine.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use! I like it very much, and it can help me save a lot of money.</li>
    <li> MY BOYFRIEND LOVES THESE CLIPPERS!!! ITS A GREAT BRAND OF CLIPPERS THAT WORK GREAT ! IT INCLUDED THE GUARDS OF DIFFERENT SIZES, OIL FOR CLIPPERS AND SM brush , as well as scissors and a guide to the art of cutting hair!!! Hands down it makes a great gift! !!!</li>
    <li> Great clippers and very affordable. Hold charge well and cut hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Nice clean cut. A bit heavy for my hands as I cut my significant other&#x27;s hair, but it gave him a nice clean cut and he liked the results. I like the tips on how to use. I thought it was a great price for a decent product.</li>
    <li> Nothing better that cut your hair by yourself, the manual is really helpful.</li>
    <li> Good price and Wahl always works great.</li>
    <li> As someone who needs a trimmer for occasional beard grooming, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about whether a trimmer is low on charge and going to pull my hairs instead of cutting them.  The 1&amp;#34; comb is perfect for my beard, and the color coding is nice so I can grab the right one just a bit quicker.  The unit has a nice weight to it, the motor is strong, and the switch has a nice satisfying thunk when you turn it on or off.  It feels well made, which is surprising for how inexpensive it is.</li>
    <li> This arrived broken, with a lot of power, so much that I am afraid to hurt myself or getting electrocuted. Therefore I won&#x27;t use it. Money lost</li>
    <li> It was better than I expected. Does not grab or pull hair like some other trimmers. The color coated sizes is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised and what we needed. Such a variety!</li>
    <li> Has paid for itself many times already!</li>
    <li> Got these to replace some crappy old clipper set. These work well, much quieter than the old ones (which is excellent!) and it has all the attachments I&#x27;ve come to expect.</li>
    <li> Really great product, I&#x27;m glad I invested in this.  I usually wait 5 or 6 months before cutting my hair because of convenience and money, but even with my thick hair this was able to cut it.</li>
    <li> is perfect for me,&lt;br /&gt;just what I was looking for..&lt;br /&gt;is really easy to use and I can save some money..!</li>
    <li> Been using Wahl products for years. Best quality.</li>
    <li> My husband has VERY straight, VERY fine, VERY thin hair.  It is particularly a problem at the lower edge of the back of his neck.  No matter what I do, it sits like a ledge back there and sticks out noticeably; it doesn&#x27;t lie down &amp; conform to his neck.  So I saw the video on these clippers, where it shows I can use different size &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; attachments, start at the bottom of the neck and gradually rock up &amp; out as you go up from the bottom.  I did that, but I&#x27;m still stuck with the &amp;#34;ledge&amp;#34; on the bottom AND another &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; at the point where I went &amp;#34;out&amp;#34; away from his head.  I did it very gradually, but his hair is such that it accentuates every cut.  I&#x27;ll have to go back to scissors cut, which doesn&#x27;t solve the extreme bottom of back neck issue, but at least I won&#x27;t have the line across the mid-back of his head.  I&#x27;ve always cut all my children&#x27;s hair, and all my prior men&#x27;s hair, with great success, but this one has me beat.  I guess I&#x27;ll keep him anyway ...</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great. I already used them to cut off a bunch of my hair. Worked like a champ. Get these.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so I could cut my son&#x27;s hair on my own. I had never cut hair before so this was my first time using a razor like this. It was easy to understand, use, and I love how many length options there are.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item believing it to be a &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34; grooming kit..  I don&#x27;t see any of the clip on accessory guides that are appropriate for  small dog (Shih Tzu) grooming.  Was this listed in the catalog mistakenly?</li>
    <li> I like this one. It&#x27;s easy to use. The quarlity is very good. And the price is acceptable. If you are a Chinese student, I suggest you to buy one.</li>
    <li> This have been the best clippers we have ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and son love using these.&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t loud either like other clippers seem to be.</li>
    <li> This company has a reputation for making quality hair clipping tools at lower prices. The different tools included are easy to use and clean. Good product.</li>
    <li> as it is described by the seller, the product is excellent</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price but very very loud motor, it sounds like a tractor.</li>
    <li> The clippers feel really well-made for $20 and the accompanying accessories (clips, two combs, oil and brush) are everything you need. It also includes a quick beginner&#x27;s guide pamphlet for tips on cutting your hair! I use this kit to maintain short sides so I don&#x27;t have to go to the barber as often. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> great quality and has everything you need in a clipper set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color coded length guide attachments are very convenient.</li>
    <li> Clippers are ok for a beginner set. I try to clean them regularly to keep it running as smooth as possible but over time it seems as though it loses cutting ability. I bought them based on so many 5 star reviews and I can say for the price they have definitely paid for themselves since I&#x27;ve been using them for 8 months but I will be searching for a better set soon.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Wahl products.  I have a heavier cutter I used for trimming my pet.  It is VERY old and still works like a charm.  I know I will get the same results here.  Great deal for the money.</li>
    <li> These are a great set! My first time cutting my boys hair at home, works great, no pulling, color coded is very handy! 100% satisfied! Recommend and will buy again if needed!!</li>
    <li> Perfect clipper for the aspiring at home barber. I am the guy that used to wait months so my hair would grow out before cutting it short so I would get value out of my haircut. I decided it was about time to find a better solution. For this price once you do two haircuts you&#x27;ve already gotten your money&#x27;s worth and you have also gained a skill. This set is priced right for someone like me who has never cut hair before and comes with most of the necessary tools. It comes with many guides even a behind the ear guide, comb, small bottle of blade oil, and a carrying case. For less than $20 I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I would recommend getting would be hair clips if your hair is longer and you don&#x27;t want to cut it by accident and a handheld mirror. Also be careful about evening the neckline as that was rather difficult for me, I used something to basically make a straight line across and cut up to it, perhaps in the future when my spacial skills while looking through a mirror improve I will be able to do it freehand. It takes a lot of practice but gets easier. First few times just cut very slowly especially if you are on a short setting, I went without a guide to cut my sideburns and ended up cutting a little bit too high by accident! Watch some videos and just go for it, you will never be ready the first time because you&#x27;ve never done it before and that is part of the process. After just one cut you already get the feel for it and are ready to do it better next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a cheap option to try out cutting your own hair at home. If you really mess up then you can just buzz it or go to your normal stylist to fix it. Not a big risk purchase here, low investment but potential high reward.</li>
    <li> Unable to use product in Australia unless I purchase a power converter (120v to 240v). While this could be considered a &amp;#34;rookie error&amp;#34; on my behalf, perhaps some sort of warning about electrical appliances operating on a different voltage system would be appropriate. No issues with the delivery system tho...outstanding service, product was well packaged, and correctly addressed, and arrived on time, I was also able to track my delivery throughout.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Brown.</li>
    <li> recommend standard machine</li>
    <li> Works great. Clipping guide really helps</li>
    <li> Wahl is quality. great price. comes with everything you need even the oil. 5yr warrenty</li>
    <li> Ordered to do home haircuts for my husband.  Comes with some pretty clear and easy instructions for beginners, and works well.  I&#x27;m not a hairdresser, but he has said that home haircuts are just as good, if not better than what he would&#x27;ve had to pay for at a salon/barber shop.</li>
    <li> For the money and what we use it for a GREAT value.</li>
    <li> When the clipper came to me, it&#x27;s looking very nice. it&#x27;s heavy &amp; feels in great quality. but when I turned it on....really BADLY NOISE is killing me....... I contine to use it cutting my hair, Since my hair is no more than 3/4&#x27;&#x27; long, so it&#x27;s working fine for cutting. but when i finish my work, a headache is coming... the whole process is about 15 to 20 mins &amp; I am very sure it was caused by the CRAZY NOISE which is not possible for bearing!!!!!! the good thing is that Amazon is issuing me a full refund for the stuff so till now i will keep trusting amazon.com but no more than WAHL...... Next time i will refer to PHILIP for my 1st choice.</li>
    <li> These clippers had plenty of attachments, and really detailed instructions on how to use them. I was very pleased with how they worked, although it may take me some time to perfect the actual haircuts (and hopefully my kids will someday sit better for the haircuts too, lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again- the instructions were very helpful!</li>
    <li> The Haircutting kit performed without a hitch.  I have still to use all of the attachments, but so far I am very pleased with the kit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and have used it regularly for over a year.  At first we used a 2 and 1 and I&#x27;d do the slight fade.  There are lots of tutorials on YouTube to help with how to actually give a haircut I found beneficial.  Now he uses a 1 and can do it himself.  Only down side is the cord gets a little twisted up, but it&#x27;s definitely well worth the cost and we&#x27;ve saved money in the long run since he doesn&#x27;t pay for haircuts.</li>
    <li> The product is good One, But it is not working properly. So I got a new.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair weekly and have for years with a Remington. The Remington died on me so I tried this one. It is so loud and vibrates so much that my hand and head hurt. I emailed the company and they told me to call them. I called them and was told that the vibrations are normal.</li>
    <li> This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve done in a while. I bought it because I have a very complicated hairstyle which it has to be shaved[half of my head] each month. so instead going to a hair stylist or a salon each 2-3 weeks to pay almost $10-20, purchase this and have same me the trip of gas and money to go and have my hair done how i really want. Plus, now even my dad use it and we all save money, which we cut our hair constantly. i HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Feels like it pulls out more hair than it cuts.</li>
    <li> Great price great clippers</li>
    <li> Great value. I had a few different trimmer before. Con air was horrible and died in a month. This one is great with color coded length. It has a good heavy feel in my hand when I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair. Very functional!</li>
    <li> The clipper is extremely noisy. I bought  it because my old Remington clipper came to age Wahl had good reviews but in reality, the noise level I measured is 95 dB. You don&#x27;t want to have this kind of noise next to your ear. It is a health hazard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for the price.  Very sharp.  Maybe more accessories than I need, but it does cut hair.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> thanks for all, i like it so much</li>
    <li> I ain&#x27;t paying $10 to shave my head, and this little robot is making sure I remain in this path of enlightenment.</li>
    <li> We bought this same product at a big retail store around three years ago.  I bought this replacement this year since that other unit&#x27;s blade was starting to tilt, making it crooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We cut his hair once a week, but don&#x27;t use any of the guards on it so I can&#x27;t speak to how well the guards work.  The older razor held up for around 150 home haircuts (saving us around 3000.00!) and was still functional when we bought the replacement.  We only oiled the blade one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor holds up extremely well and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to save money by cutting hair at home.</li>
    <li> I love this hair shaver! I cut both my sons and my husbands hair with it at least twice a month, it comes with plenty of different sized guards. And its not loud like most are! Great investment.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever bought online.</li>
    <li> The quality is very good !</li>
    <li> Had it for about three years now. Still looks new, great and works great. Combs are a little fragile though, but superb.</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing and durable. I use this bad boy on every part of my body with hair and it gets the job done. Comes with a plethora of sizes that you can use for every purpose or occasion.</li>
    <li> Great clipper for giving hubby haircuts at home. I like that they are color-coded, so it&#x27;s easier to tell the sizes apart. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Item is okay.  Feels cheap and a little flimsy.  Also, I thought this would be a nice, small trimmer, but it is actually a little larger than I expected.</li>
    <li> Met my expectation. Powerful motor but still quiet . Far better than my old Con-air one.&lt;br /&gt;My kids also liked it because unlike my old one its quiet, cuts faster and absolutely no hair pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer is great</li>
    <li> Cant say much as I used it very less. But so far no issues. Only thing is the product looks slightly heavy.</li>
    <li> wow this is the 3rd set of clippers i have had so far all different but this one is really nice , and for this price wow , and with all the extras that came with it, very nice and cuts really clean.</li>
    <li> Good quality, lots of attachments.  And even comes with instructions and suggestions.</li>
    <li> great razor. Only used it twice.</li>
    <li> work good, great price</li>
    <li> This kit is what I wanted.. seems to be well constructed, cuts well, nice looking.. The case could be somewhat better, the device is much nicer than what is put in...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much yet but damn this feel like it&#x27;s professional quality. The labeling, packaging, and guides are all cheap quality but the actually clipper feels like it&#x27;s top notch.</li>
    <li> This thing is junk, it doesn&#x27;t even cut my hair, it just shreds layers of skin off of my face.</li>
    <li> My last WAHL (which I purchased 25 years ago) was built with sturdier materials (not so much plastic), but it accidentally fell on the garage floor &amp; broke.  This newer one cuts just as well.  My last WAHL didn&#x27;t have the tapering comb &amp; that&#x27;s very nice to have.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It works great. Fast deliver. Great product to own. Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Sincerely, the machine does what it says, it provides a clean, powerful cut.  I liked a lot the color coding.  The machine has also great power.  The only cons I have are: 1) cord is quite short, I would say;  2) trimming short seems dangerous compared to other machines; 3) plastic pieces seem that they would break after 10 uses.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for the price, nevertheless.</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Need to find the bigger guards for it though</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful do-it -at-home system.The clipper has good power and all the accessories were very helpful.I especially liked the carrying case.</li>
    <li> Recieved used clippers. hand and fingerprint smudges with traces of hair in/on the blades....</li>
    <li> Very quiet clippers, great for use on kids and toddlers. My nephew doesn&#x27;t even realize what&#x27;s happening. The color-coded clipper heads are a plus.</li>
    <li> Second set I&#x27;ve bought, as I cut my son&#x27;s hair, and Whal is the best brand yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Conair and the clippers didn&#x27;t last but a year as the plastic inside broke and I keep my clippers clean every cut.&lt;br /&gt;The guide on the handle is very helpful for precision cuts as many other clippers don&#x27;t have those for quick reference.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend his clippers to any home-hair-cutter!</li>
    <li> Working good! !! Worth the money that we paid !!! Thanks a lot!!! Reviews was really helpful and my husband is happy)) thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding a good beard trimmer and decided to try this trimmer as a beard trimmer.  It&#x27;s a bit bulky and I&#x27;m not crazy about the cord (cordless would be better) for my purpose but it does cut extremely well.  I use it without any of the plastic guards.  The blade itself has a small amount of adjustability and that is enough for me to set the right length of trim which is enough to give me a stubble look.  It is solid and seems to be well-constructed.  One problem I&#x27;ve had with other beard trimmers has been that some piece of cheap plastic here or there has broken on the ones I&#x27;ve tried, making them almost useless or at least difficult to use.  Given the price, build quality and my needs, this has been a good fit so far.</li>
    <li> I had an old Wahl that was about 8 years old and completely worn out.  LOVE the color coding of the guards; which makes it so much easier to remember what I need to use on my husband and son&#x27;s hair.  Was going to buy a version that was slightly cheaper and when reading the reviews, took the advise of another reviewer to spend the extra $2-$3 for this version.  So happy I did.  This was well worth the money.</li>
    <li> cant cut anything, i set it low, high, medium, all doesnt cut. i think i got a defective product and it frustrates me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now over a month, works great mainly use to trip my goatee and to shave my head.</li>
    <li> the machine works great, now is my turn to learn!</li>
    <li> PULLS AND MISSES HAIRS WHEN USING ON FACIAL HAIR. TURNED UP POWER, WHICH HELPED A LOT, BUT STILL PULLS AND MISSES HAIRS. IT&#x27;S THE LOWEST LEVEL, SO WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT, RIGHT?</li>
    <li> For the price, these are awesome! I have had some pretty awful clippers before that have been more expensive than these. These work very well on my hair which is very course and thick. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> the perfect home clipper set to have</li>
    <li> After extremely slow shipping, this clipper set finally arrived and we were happy to have it at last... until we opened the box and saw that the cardboard surround was opened and banged up at the corners.  When I opened the plastic storage case, the bag containing the combs  had been opened and was crinkled and punctured.  Some of the items were out of the bag, and two combs were missing and one was broken. Has it been used?  I&#x27;d rather not take the chance.  Very, very disappointed with Amazon over this purchase, and Amazon should be embarrassed that mine isn&#x27;t the first review stating such a bizarre and completely avoidable problem.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for one that I purchased 9 years ago. I&#x27;m hoping it holds out that long. Though when I received it, the case was broken, I moved it into the old case anyway as it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Tired of going to the barbers&#x27;? Get this clipper! It is a high quality clipper, with clear and easy to follow instructions that make it very simple to give yourself or someone else the prefect cut. The attachments are all color coded, so it is impossible to mess up. The clipper is very well made, doesn&#x27;t feel light and cheap like most do. It is very sturdy and durable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit and tried to use it for the first time today.  Only to find out that the guide combs do not fit on the clipper.  Well some of them fit and they are the ones I do not use. Plus they were very hard to get on and off.  Seems to cut good though, but what good is it if the combs do not fit on....unless my hubby wants a buzz cut! Don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent price. Love these clippers!!&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I use it weekly and it works great. My wife got it for me and at first I had my doubts but after using it the first time I think this product is great. Especially since it was under $40 you can&#x27;t go wrong.  If you go too fast, it will pull hair but that&#x27;s not a problem as long as you go at a normal pace.</li>
    <li> The product made so much noise when switched on. The noise was so deafening that I have not been able to use it. It also becomes so hot when switched on for a long time. Indeed, I have been so disappointed with the product. It looks sleek but it&#x27;s performance is far below what I expected. I am still the using the old one I have.</li>
    <li> These work great.  They are sharp and cut hair very well. The colored plastic clippers are comfortable to use though a little tight going on and off.  I suppose they will loosen some with time and use.</li>
    <li> good clippers for a good price. replaced a pair of 3-4 yr old wahl clippers i should have taken better care of</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp. Love the color coded clips. Been about 2 years now and still going strong. Cuts through hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I just love this Wahl Clipper and haircutting kit. Since I&#x27;ve gotten it a month ago I&#x27;ve cut my hair twice. Its a great starter kit for someone learning to cut his own hair. The color coding of the clipper cards also helps provide a guide to what length you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite Amazon orders ever.</li>
    <li> THESE CLIPPERS ARE BETTER THAN I EXPECTED THEM TO BE!! SUPER THRILLED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO CUT BOTH MY GUYS HAIR AT HOME NOW!!</li>
    <li> my wife is a hair dresser and uses these daily.  She said they work good and are much quieter than the last pair she had.</li>
    <li> Good product that works as expected.  I actually got this product to shave my cat&#x27;s rear end because he gets litter stuck in it constantly...</li>
    <li> No problems with this at all.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life.  So much better than the ConAir package that I bought at Target.</li>
    <li> Very complete product. It comes with a manual that explains how to do everything, the colored code for the different numbers for lenght of hair is very helpful. No one can argue that the price is bad. It&#x27;s a very good product... And in case you didn&#x27;t know, an average male spends $144 per year plus tips on hair cuts. I would buy it again! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Worked great but the switch is hard to turn on or off.</li>
    <li> Love this clipper set with our 5 boys!  Stands the test and lots of the guard choices!</li>
    <li> Everything you need for a good cut. My wife loves the kit. The clipper stays cool. Oil after use. Stays sharp. Color chart and hard case.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the purchase of the machine, was safe and reliable, I recommend a 100%, no shipping was on time I have no complaints</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15yrs now. I&#x27;ve tried many brands before but only wahls has a smooth cut to it and blades that last long and stay sharp.</li>
    <li> Makes a very nice gift, the case is hard and of good material with a handle for easy carrying.  Ship fast and reasonably priced as well.</li>
    <li> This item exceeded our expectations, and to be honest, I think is nicer than what our local big box hairstylist locations use.  My wife uses it to cut my hair as well as my two little boys.  Comes with a case and instructions.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This thing works great for how cheap it is. I have used it to trim my own hair about 8 times now and have not needed to re-oil or clean it extensively yet. Has paid itself off three times over in what I was paying for &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; haircuts.</li>
    <li> excellent item for the cost</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT, GOOD FOR THE MONEY WITH ALL THE ATTACHMENTS TOO</li>
    <li> I use this all the time!  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this after several months of ownership and I would recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> Thank you. Good seller. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair cutting kit, but i feel like after 3 uses the motor is starting to act up. Sometime i start it up and it makes a weird noise, but then i turn off and on again and it works fine. However, the machine is solidly built and i have no concerns that it will last me several years, regardless of this little issue</li>
    <li> I use it mainly as a beard trimmer as I have a pretty thick beard that chokes up those battery powered trimmers.  Its high quality, feels hefty, works great.  My only minor gripes is that it was a bit scuffed up in the case it came it, as it wasn&#x27;t secured it any way.  Also, the trim lengths of 1/16, 1/8 and 1/4 skip over the much needed 3/8 size for short beard trimming.  But those are minor issues on a great value trimmer.</li>
    <li> We love this product with the color coded gauges.  It&#x27;s nice to have sharp blades again (old one was much more dull than we realized).  We prefer the soft zipper carry bags that our other kits have come in (as opposed to the hard case this came in), so we just used an old case.  Great value - we&#x27;ve saved lots of $ over the years.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! If you are a man and you do not want to waste $20 on a haircut anymore by this product. It took me two tries to figure it out. Both haircuts that I took turned out just as good as the barber could do. Maybe not as good..... Still it was A really good haircut. Simple to use powerful machine and worth the $17 price tag without shipping.</li>
    <li> Only used it once was chicken turned out pretty good. Will start using 2-3 times a month since I&#x27;m getting semi bald I cut it pretty short. Great buy paid for itself the 1st use.</li>
    <li> Like the variety of accesories</li>
    <li> It has worked well the several times I have used it over the last two months or so. Only a 4 star from me because it is a little too big and makes it some what uncomfortable to shave beards with it due to the size, but you still can do it.</li>
    <li> It works. The color coded thingy is nice I guess, but I can read, and count to eight. It cuts very poorly compared to my last Wahl. Leaves noticeable lines in your hair. I am keeping it to give the dogs a trim. Going to spend a little more money next time, and try an Oyster.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, will always buy Wahl from now on. Had a old pair that lasted me 9 years with occasional hair cuts, never got dull. Then one day i dropped them and a tooth from the clipper broke. At first I bought conair clippers from the store, and they were so dull it hurt when i cut my hair, returned them, got these and back to fantastic performance :_)</li>
    <li> I used the 20 piece Wahl hair cutting products and got a fairly good haircut for my husband.  I now know I need to start with the 4 comb on the sides and then graduate to a 5 comb around the sides at the top.  It actually worked very well and I was pleased that my husbands haircut came out looking quite professional.  Just be sure to read the instructions first and then try to evaluate what sizes to use first.  Start with the largest, then graduate.</li>
    <li> The colorful guide comb set  is nothing because the LOUD NOISE dominate everything else!&lt;br /&gt;first time and never again!&lt;br /&gt;really disappointed with this!</li>
    <li> I got tired of going to the barbers, waiting for a haircut, paying anywhere from $10-20 plus the tip.  Thank goodness crew cuts are in style because i cut my own hair and have for a year now!  It makes me feel cleaner and i hate very much the feel of my own hair on the back of my neck.  I&#x27;m married so i don&#x27;t care at all if other people like my hair or not. I reckon its more then paid for itself.  I lube the blades before and after a haircut, and blow out the unit with compressed air afterwards til it is spotless.  It&#x27;s a very good quality machine and if it broke tomorrow, i&#x27;d just buy another!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very Satisfied with my Purchase of the Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20&#x27;Piece Set&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; Purchased Another Wahl Hair Clipper for Myself &amp; My Father</li>
    <li> Works great! Use this to extend my barbers haircut for a couple weeks. Quality product no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great value! These are high quality and have worked great for the past 4 cuts that my wife does for me! The price is amazing and so if the quality!</li>
    <li> Mine broke after one use and now makes extremely loud buzzing noises whenever you try to use it.  I am scared to hold it anywhere near myself now.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the build quality of this.  I was looking for something to trim hair and beard and this works nicely. It is on the heavy side but I take that as a good indicator of the quality of blades and internals.Price was extremely affordable and I am well pleased with my purchase. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using it for some time  now. Great product, easy to use and those interchangeable heads with different colors really help. Absolutely recommendable</li>
    <li> Although not ideal, it does the job and costs less than one haircut in NYC and Jersey City</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re in the military or any other profession where your hair has to be under a certain length, get this bad boy.  Every two weeks instead of paying somebody &amp;#62;$20 to shave you for two minutes, you can instead make your significant other do it and look the exact same.  I especially like the tapering guards- don&#x27;t have time for a haircut, but your hair&#x27;s starting to touch your ears?  Give it ten seconds&#x27; attention on both sides and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was on sale for $20. It does the job well, and comes with about 8-10 attachments, two combs, and a pair of nice hair cutting scissors. Old fashioned value at old fashioned prices.</li>
    <li> Works great and in less than 2 haircuts I already made up the cost by not paying for haircuts.  If you have a simple haircut like a # 1 or a 2 buzz cut, buy this and you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Has everything you need, I have two little boys, so cutting hair cut cost this way. They play with the other colorful heads while I cut hair. Definitely recommend this to mothers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. These things are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Razor cuts well...however, there is a heavy vibration the comes from the unit unlike any clipper I have used in the past.  I will definitely spend more on a quality razor in the future.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This was a score!  It is quiet, sturdy, and really gets the job done. I shave my hubbies head and he is able to keep his goatee neat and tidy.  I have tried more expensive clippers but this is by far the best.  The case keeps the included scissors, combs and guards together and compact for storage.</li>
    <li> Works great. Comes with quite a few attachments, scissors, and a couple combs. There was also an instructional guide to show how to cut a man&#x27;s hair. Completely satisfied</li>
    <li> not spectacular, it had a slightly hard time getting through lots of hair, but hey good price and hair is cut.</li>
    <li> Awesome  product .....</li>
    <li> Just received a dirty unit with clipper blades covered in oil and brownish stuff...  Not cool amazon...</li>
    <li> it is what I want to get!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Works great!!! I bought this for my husband &amp; he really liked it! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good pair of clippers.</li>
    <li> I shave my head on a regular basis and these puppies make it so much easier. With propper care I&#x27;ve never had it jam or fail to work. The only reason I replace the last set was because I got wet and shorted out the motor. They cost the same as a regualr hair cut. If I wanted to I could buy a new pair every time I want to cut my hair.</li>
    <li> The fuse pretty much overheated and tripped after 10 seconds after i plugged on the clipper. I would say bad luck. Will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> FREE haircuts!!, if your basically bald and have a significant other to lend a hand. Works great and many &amp;#34;depths of cut&amp;#34; to choose from, actually, almost too many!</li>
    <li> Works really great, I use it for my dog, who has thick hair, cut right through, in a fraction of the time it has taken me in the past.. So happy I bought them!</li>
    <li> Great clippers, bought them to cut my 3 year old sons hair, they cut so good everyone tight I took him to the barber shop.... Wait!! Maybe I cut hair so good I make the clippers work look awesome</li>
    <li> Christmas present &amp; they loved it! Work great! Saving a fortune on home haircuts! What more can I say they are clippers lol</li>
    <li> Based on the price, I didn&#x27;t expect these to be as effective as the expensive pair I bought years ago at a salon, but they work great.  I&#x27;ve cut my husband&#x27;s hair a few times already and it has been easy to use.</li>
    <li> IT IS A LITTLE HARD WITH THE LEFT HAND BUT IT SERVE THE PURPOSE GREAT TOOLS I DO RECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I just replaced the exact same one I had for 10 years - 10 years! with this model yet again. I was so pleased with the razor the first time around that I couldn&#x27;t buy anything else to replace it with. For the price, the quality is incredible. Two people in my house use this razor- it gets a LOT of use, and I had it for a decade. It comes with a great kit that has all sorts of must-haves for folks who cut their own hair/ beards. Absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> Its so convenient usually there when i need to do something in a hurry with it. So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day seems like i find endless uses for it...</li>
    <li> It cuts hair optimum.&lt;br /&gt;The overall feel is very cheap and the switch is really really bad. It is really inside and I have to try for 10 minutes to get the thing going.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. I&#x27;ve had it over 6mo. and it shows no sign of wear. I oil it once every 3 uses or so. It is very loud and it gets pretty warm once you use it over 10-15 minutes. That doesn&#x27;t really bother me. LOUD</li>
    <li> I got this model to replace my Norelco clippers that had worn out after about a decade. I researched a large number of clippers to get similar results in feel, shape, and accessories. At a price of $20, this Wahl kit really can&#x27;t be beat. It has more comb lengths than I would need but they attach well. I don&#x27;t really care for the style that the &amp;#34;around ear&amp;#34; combs make but they&#x27;re just supplemental. The clippers themselves have been very sharp and don&#x27;t tug. It also includes scissors, cleaning brush and blade oil as you would expect. Very easy to recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Appears to be durable.</li>
    <li> Should have simpler way to remove attachment for &amp;#34;no comb&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I cut my hair &amp; my sons hair with professional results &amp; a lot of length options.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this clipper work great, they give you 2 pair of scissors, combs and other accessories.&lt;br /&gt;For the price is can not be beat. It is a winner.</li>
    <li> The Clipper came with a very beautiful carrying case but i don&#x27;t like the buzzing sound it makes when i used it to cut someones hair.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Lots of options.  Runs strong.  Feels well made.  I just use it to trim my neck and beard but I think you could use it for just about anything.  However, I am not a barber.</li>
    <li> I liked these in as much as they worked well for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Strong moter and nice set of guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the blue plastic cover was loose and rattled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This alone was enough to make me return it and get the Wahl 8451:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000ZMAL2U Wahl Professional WA8451 Hair Clipper]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figured why not get a pro grade product, it saves so much money over its lifetime in haircuts :)</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Cuts nice and clean, no pulling, etc.  Pretty quiet.  Comes with an array of plastic combs that fit onto the head if you want to use it to cut an entire head of hair.  I use it for clean up around my ears, sideburns, etc., so I don&#x27;t know how the combs work but there are about eight of them, some angled and numerous depths for cutting the whole head.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very good quality and appearance, highly recommended for future buyers of this item, I hope they serve as much as me I served.</li>
    <li> I started getting my head shaved about 4 months ago at my local barber for 16 bucks a visit, every 2-3 weeks.  That entails the hassle of getting all the way there, waiting in line, and then having to explain how I want it done, as well as spending a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this buzzer, I have saved so much money already, and it feels great.  The product is strong and heavy, has tons of different options, and is even color coded for ease.  It comes with haircutting scissors too!  I really couldn&#x27;t have asked for more, even in a kit that costed 5 times as much.  You get your money&#x27;s worth very quickly.  It&#x27;s a great buy for sure.</li>
    <li> cuts fine ,I purchased this to see if new was better than 15 year old stuff .The new seems to be as good as old stuff .By the way ,if it will last 15 or20 years this is pretty good.</li>
    <li> These are what I would have expected from Wahl, it does the job well. The only complaint I have is the minor adjustment lever on the side feels cheap, unlike the version I used before.</li>
    <li> Using this for 6 months now and still going strong. This one pays for itself after one haircut. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have a beard trimmer I use to keep my wily whiskers in check and I used it to cut my hair once while I was working in a part of the world that was lacking in barbers.  Anyway I cut my hair and I said hey I could probably do this regularly so I looked for a clipper set.  The Wahl was one of the first that popped up and wow for that price I thought even if I could just get two decent haircuts out of it before it dies it will have paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short I have been cutting my hair with it usually once every two weeks and the results are great.  The clippers power through just about anything quickly.  They don&#x27;t snag or pull my hair.  I use them for both my beard and head now.  I like to keep my hair pretty short or &amp;#34;high and tight&amp;#34; as it were.  I can now do it whenever I feel like it and since I&#x27;ve been doing it I&#x27;ve gotten faster and more proficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you aren&#x27;t afraid of it or someone else using it on you then give it a shot.  I have saved over a hundred dollars plus gas and time in trips to my barber by this point.  If it dies I will purchase another but I don&#x27;t see that happening anytime soon.  The thing feels solid and comfortable like I would think a full on professional set would.</li>
    <li> I had a WAHL  hair cutting kit before, so I knew what to expect. This one is a very good tool; my only complain is that it is a little to heavy for comfort.</li>
    <li> Was a little leery of cutting my husbands hair myself, but with the different size guards this clipper makes it really easy.  Runs really smoothly and easy to use.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I cut my son&#x27;s hair because he&#x27;s too young to get it done with a barber. These clippers are inexpensive and work so well! I love it. My husband also uses these to trim and shave his beard.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a while now and they have not let me down yet.  I usually cut my hair every two weeks and these clippers are up to the job.  Can&#x27;t beat these for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but if the blades were sharp I could possibly love it.  I thought with the Wahl name it would be like top of the line.</li>
    <li> Works great. Cutting thru is smooth. A lot of spacer to choose from. I have no problem.</li>
    <li> Save money on haircuts by convincing your kids you know what you&#x27;re doing.  I had the same unit for 15 years and it recently went kaput. Recently repurchased it because I really couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the cost/quality equation.  You should buy them just because they&#x27;re cheap.  You never know when you&#x27;ll need to shave the neighbor&#x27;s cat.</li>
    <li> Purchased for in-between regular grooming appointments for toy poodle. Has already paid for itself. Dog tolerates noise well. Be careful to &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; clipper blades occasionally. The very fine hair can accumulate at blades and cause uncomfortable pulling. The clip on blade guides work well to help give an even cut.</li>
    <li> I like keeping my hair short so I was spending a fortune on haircuts (and time waiting in line). This seems to work well and so far hasn&#x27;t had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a haircutter I recommend it. I have tried some other brands in the past and they were far inferior in quality (grabbing the hair instead of cutting it).</li>
    <li> THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS WAHL CLIPPER AVAILABLE AT THIS PRICE &#x3D;&#x3D; I LOVE IT AND SO DOES MY CLIENTS AT MY HAIR SALON &#x3D;&#x3D; :)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. The set is everything you need to get a haircut and the instructions are really helpful for first timers.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I decided to purchase clippers after realizing it was a waste of money to pay $15 every three weeks for a haircut when I could have my girlfriend give me almost the same haircut with these.  After two at-home haircuts, they&#x27;ve paid for themselves.  The guards are all color and number-coded.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am happy my purchase, excellent product, and satisfies my job, my order arrived on time and in perfect condition! thank you very much very happy.</li>
    <li> These are great for my 2 year old son.  They aren&#x27;t noisy and very easy to use. Definitely a great purchase!</li>
    <li> it does the job alright, shaved my head quickly and without any jams</li>
    <li> This would have been great if i wanted to shear a sheep!!!  It was insanely loud and vibrated violently.  Total garbage.  DONT BUY THIS MODEL!!!!!!!! Wahl is great but this model is junk.  I dont know what they were thinking.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper set over 7 years ago and I&#x27;m still using it to this day. I cut my hair, trim my beard and body hair with it and it has worked flawlessly every time. At once a week that comes out to over 350 jobs completed with this great little grooming tool. At $20.00 I&#x27;d say that makes this probably the most solid tool purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. The only small complaint I would have would be that the plastic case it comes in doesnt have nearly the lifespan of the clippers themself. But that doesnt detract from how awesome this thing is.</li>
    <li> For the price...this is an excellent bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with it at all.  It&#x27;s not the quietest...but not the loudest either.  It worked pretty well and didn&#x27;t pull a the hair. I would prefer a higher quality cutting guides, but these were fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy similar kits at local stores (Walmart, Kmart, Walgreens, etc) for the same price...but trust me...they are NOT as good of quality.  Those I&#x27;ve bought locally have very cheap accessories...and are much louder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not professional quality.  If you are going to use it daily, I&#x27;d recommend paying a little more for a higher quality clipper...but for occasional use to do a quick trim or clean up, these are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the guys -- if you are going to use these \\&quot;other places\\&quot; besides the head...be careful!  Trimming chest and arms/legs are fine...but \\&quot;other places\\&quot; be careful ... it&#x27;s not designed for that and will do bad things to you (if you catch my drift).  If you need something for \\&quot;other places\\&quot;...invest in a Norelco Body Groomer (costs a little more)...but well worth it!</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers, it gets down to business even when it comes to manscaping!! Used it a handful of time and no issues.</li>
    <li> I learned the hard way.</li>
    <li> I wore out one set of Wahl Clippers and this is my second.  I would be lost without them. They work great!</li>
    <li> They seem heavy and well built. However, you need to make more passes because it does not cut all hair in a single pass. The Conaire I had before this cut much better.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with quality of haircut :( maybe I got deffective clipper. No matter how many times I go through the hair it still misses many long hairs</li>
    <li> cheap and good product</li>
    <li> I like this hair cutter very much. Although a bit heaver than I thought, I can see it will last for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Bought a Conair and it was HORRIBLE. Hardly cut my hair at all. This worked on the first try and it was worth the price. Don&#x27;t go for a super cheap one, it won&#x27;t cut your hair and you will just get annoyed and have to return it!</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl clipper. The other was the smaller &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; and had trouble getting through thick hair. It also was a bit of a nuisance to clean out, as you had to remove the head to brush out hair. It was also loud. This bad boy hums quietly and goes through facial hair like butter and refuses to get jammed up on head hair. All the different trim guard, the comb, and scissors made it a great buy while on sale for $17. Plus it&#x27;s super easy to clean off after use.</li>
    <li> My hairy husband researched and overly researched and, based on reviews, decided to try the Wahl 89300-400 Color Pro.  Wow!  This motor is powerful.  These clippers plowed right through his thick back hair.  Shaving his back and arms took me only 5 minutes and provided a clean, close swim-ready shave.  Our previous clippers would repeatedly jam with freshly cut hair, requiring several blade cleanings in the course of one back shave.  My husband finds his hairiness unattractive and refuses to be seen shirtless without a fresh close shave.  Thanks to the Wahl Color Pro, I have an enthusiastic swim partner this summer!</li>
    <li> Contains a ton of attachments, out of the box it did the job perfectly. Seems to be very well made.</li>
    <li> We had never cut hair before. After a couple Youtube \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos and 1 \\&quot;trial\\&quot; cut we&#x27;ve got this nailed due to the simplicity and ease of this product. It cuts great and comes with a nice variety of guards of varying lengths. I would recommend getting a layering/razor scissor from a local salon to get the best results.</li>
    <li> Very fast, reliable and transparent. Received in my mailbox on the expected term.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. Has saved us over $100 already.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a quality clipper set for a good price then I highly recommend. I have used this for about two months now and I am still impressed with it.</li>
    <li> The moment I turned it on, the noise was EXTREMELY loud that possibly may damage your hearing if you use it near your ears. It&#x27;s also very heavy too. Horrible product! I regretted buying and I cannot do a return because I&#x27;m not living in US. Shipping back is going to cost more. Next time I will definitely look out for specifications that guarantee for ultra quiet mode. Think twice before you purchase this one.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all. It was too too loud. Never ended up using it.</li>
    <li> Great! Love the colored guards!</li>
    <li> I agree with others that it doesn&#x27;t seem up to past Wahl products, but it gets the job done.  Just have to make an extra pass or two.</li>
    <li> Money I saved, I bought a KINDLE. It does a great job on hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Ohhhhhh SNAP!&lt;br /&gt;My carpet is so finely trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
    <li> Great product, only two downsides that I&#x27;m aware of.  Cuts very well with guards.  Without a guard it&#x27;s not great on direct skin (pulls and doesn&#x27;t cut very close).  The guards are mostly good, but the smaller ones are more flexible and can fall off easily.  I had a Wahl Balding that lasted for about nine years without regular oiling, so I trust the brand.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband who had worn out his previous Wahl clippers. He is in the military and gives himself a haircut every week. The color coding was convenient, but he couldn&#x27;t even get it to cut his hair! He does have thick hair, but this thing was terrible. The blades were ten times duller than the old clippers he had worn out. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th one, I forget which. I get a new one about every 2yrs. They work great!</li>
    <li> wow- right out of box cut hair -very sharp-lots of heads. All color coded. I live in AZ. Buzzed myself real quick and clean.#2.</li>
    <li> Works so good and the best part is the low price!!!  I bought a higher model, paid twice as much and it didn&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Used for a few months now no issues</li>
    <li> I wish the cord were a bit longer. Otherwise, I like this one much better than my cordless Remington. Sharper and faster!</li>
    <li> For the price is really good feels good on the hand and cut well the only thing not so good are the combs i think the plastic is soft and can broke easy but is only a month of use and so far don&#x27;t have a problem</li>
    <li> This is a no-brainer. It&#x27;s a multi-year hair clipper which costs about as much as a professional haircut.</li>
    <li> IMRIS -I phone charger I don&#x27;t recived every thin I miss 2  usp  mal conected to the wall witch I paid for it</li>
    <li> These are great!  I didn&#x27;t realize these clippers could be so affordable.  My old Wahl set just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; it anymore:)  They work great and would have easily been worth a $40 or more price tag.</li>
    <li> great product and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> For the price it does the job I wanted it to do. I have used it once so far and it did a great job of getting the hair the length I wanted and cut evenly. Can&#x27;t beat it for $20.</li>
    <li> Works ok but doesn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
    <li> Works great, I&#x27;ve had it for like 2 years now and it still cuts great. My only issue is maybe the plastic 1 and 2 are too far apart in terms of actual cutting length and what it should be but a great clipper for all your home haircutting needs.</li>
    <li> excellent.&lt;br /&gt;its exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Broke after 9 uses. Usually clippers don&#x27;t cut as well after a while. These just stopped working in the middle of hair cut. Would not recommend them</li>
    <li> Smooth cutting,  doesn&#x27;t drag like other cutters I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Very good for a cheap kit. Holding case is flimsy and wish heads for clipper had a storage compartment in case instead of it being thrown in a plastic bag. Great kit otherwise</li>
    <li> Some of the plastic guards warped rather quickly, one of them broke off a tooth.  The metal part/blade cover is kind of uneven when I got it but was a quick fix with a screw driver.  All else is great.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving the...yeah, you know.</li>
    <li> Love this hair clipper.  With my first haircut I recouped my investment.</li>
    <li> This is one seriously well-built hair trimmer, and it is about the quietest one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Works great. Bought it for my brother because I broke his old one from using it on my dog. But anyways, I borrow this from time to time to use  it to shave my dog while brother is at work and it works great!!</li>
    <li> Love the great quality of this haircutting kit. Trimmed my hairs twice with and first time I was unsuccessful as expected. But the second time I was able to give a nice haircut to myself. The only thing I&#x27;m not very happy is that even the biggest piece leaves you with such a short hair. I wished that I can leave my hair longer than that.</li>
    <li> This thing is very well built. It&#x27;s sturdy, tough, and cheap. Quality on a budget.</li>
    <li> Thing only worked once</li>
    <li> Perfect for the job on hand.</li>
    <li> Great setup for the money. These clippers are quick and efficient. I have never used clippers before in my life and they were really intuitive, I used them to cut my brother&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s the best haircut I&#x27;ve ever given him (used to use scissors). Speaking of scissors, this set even comes with scissors and a comb! I can&#x27;t wait til my boyfriend&#x27;s hair gets long enough to need a cut.</li>
    <li> I always use these clippers and I got them at a great price.</li>
    <li> works great strong motor and it feels well made I have used wahl products for years and they hold up well I have only used this a few times but it seems that it will last</li>
    <li> Awesome, highly recommended</li>
    <li> as advertised...you get a bunch of attachments of various sizes for whatever length you desire.</li>
    <li> Great for cutting hair or beard. I have used this several times without any issues. I cut my beard every couple of days and cut my hair once a month. Easy to use and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well, paid for itself after one haircut. This is not cheaply made or lightweight. Has a heavy motor and sharp blades. Comes with everything you need to give yourself a buzz cut and more.</li>
    <li> The quality of this item seems very good and it powers through my hair. Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but my hair is fairly thick and has jammed a barber&#x27;s buzzer. This product powered through it like a hot knife through butter. Can&#x27;t beat the price as well. In just 2 uses you&#x27;ve pretty much paid for it.</li>
    <li> Work great just make sure you go slow. It&#x27;s not going to make the hair just fall off. Have to give it a second if your hair is longer, as expected</li>
    <li> Love these clippers and i really don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with buying wahl clippers!</li>
    <li> Loved It!!Would buy again and recommend to friends and family. Great product and just what I needed at the right price.</li>
    <li> The wife cuts my hair about every 10 days.  It works great no more pulling hair all the time. Nice case and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;m on my second one. Dropped the first after 4 years still works but the corner tooth chipped off and the blade guards started to wear out. I cut my hair every week for $20 bucks this is well worth it after 4 years.</li>
    <li> I like the item, I&#x27;ve owned one for 8 years and it worked nicely but time to replace it.  I was very pleased to find the same great quality for cutting my sons hair!</li>
    <li> Junk!, the motor blew up in my hand after only using a few times. poor build quality for the whole item..adjustment lever never worked..this must be a counterfeit as i cannot believe Wahl would sell this and damage its reputation .. THIS THING IN MY OPINION IS DANGEROUS</li>
    <li> Buy 1 of these and it pays for just 1 haircut.  I love that they made these color coordinated so you aren&#x27;t digging through a ton of black clips trying to read which one it is.</li>
    <li> This is my first pair of clippers. So far they are fantastic. I use them to trim my beard and haven&#x27;t had any issues. The color-coordinated heads are pretty helpful. I no longer have to pick up each one to read the number. Remembering which colors are which numbers safes time and frustration. The clipper itself is very powerful and hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.</li>
    <li> Buy this article a few weeks ago and today tried to use and I dont could use because it makes an infernal noise. the regulator dont work. The article should have some damage and dont get any help.</li>
    <li> Awesome haircut kit. It&#x27;s a very powerful device that does the job well.</li>
    <li> This product is much easy to use and proved working on Asian hair. After the first trial without any experience, my husband got a nice hair cut.</li>
    <li> Came lest than a day..perfect condition..n ready to cut..thanks</li>
    <li> This haircutting kit is so convenient, I&#x27;m extremely glad i bought it. Everything is color coded, which makes it so easy to get the hairstyle that you want in just minutes. I bought hair guides along with this, but it definitely wasn&#x27;t necessary. This kit saved me tons of money and lots of time as well. The boys in my family always complain that their barber never listens to what they tell them to do on their hair, and this was a great solution to that problem. Now they can cut their own hair, and if they mess it up they have no one to blame! Hahah</li>
    <li> Pretty much took it out and Cut My Hair and I&#x27;m Good, Now I feel better and Clean looking. Yes!</li>
    <li> I just purchased the Wahl 20 piece hair cut kit from that store with the red bullseye for the same price as offered here.  The clippers do a great job at cutting your hair, even as close as a buzz cut that you can get without pulling or feeling uncomfortable at all.  The color coding system works well and helps you select what you need to get the length that you need.  The instructions are adequate and although it will not make you a master of hair cuttery, it will help you do a basic cut with little difficulty.  Although a little noisy, most clippers are, I don&#x27;t think it was a big deal.  It does lack the eyebrow attachment, which I wish it would have had to trim the eyebrows, but overall it this item seems solid and well built and comes with a 5 year warranty.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m new to cutting my hubby&#x27;s hair at home and this allowed me to cut his hair very fast and very nicely (he looks as nice or even nicer than from barber shop). The very first time I cut his hair, I used my hubby&#x27;s very very old clipper and a regular scissor. I took forever. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible job, but it looked home made. I ordered this clipper and a goody hair cutting scissor right away. So the second hair cut I gave my hubby went much better with this new clipper and the new scissor. I took half as long as last time to cut his hair and his hair cut looked decent. Today, my third time cutting my hubby&#x27;s hair, I used this clipper only. It took me about five minute at the most! #3 on the sides and back, #8 on top, and right and left fade guards for his side burns.  I did use scissor to blend two spots (5 seconds). We were both impressed how good it looks and how quick it was! I highly recommend this clipper. Best $16 we ever spent! The box it comes in works for me- I just keep the four guards, scissor (not the one that came with clipper- that one is trash), tiny clipper brush, and the clipper. The rest of the numerous guards, I store else where. By the way, I searched long for a hair cutting cape to make my job easier. GEM brand white fabric cape is awesome ($8). Happy hair cutting at home!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it was a hair cutter or not. I feel cheated. Probably the &#x27;machine&#x27; was sent not because the Wahl worked but simply because the seller thought I, the buyer, lived far away, no way for me to return and blame electric power for the malfunction (with some trick to cause some shortage in electric circuits). I did not even use it once. I was adjusting the power as instructed, the sound went down as indicated and suddenly i heard abrupt sound and very small fire; the machine went dead. After around 40 dollars, what do i get? A trash! I wish i had time to check with technicians and expose what was wrong with the machine. But no time and i have to minimize my loss (unfortunate also i had to buy  a converter since the one sent to me could not fit b/s the machine&#x27;s plug was not standard and anyone can tell it was manufacturing defect)...but this is a terrible experience for first time Amazon buyer...</li>
    <li> This thing came with various sized guides. I chunked them. I like to keep the hair on my noggin cut closely - without using a guides. I managed to cut open a spot on the back of my head though. These clippers are sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the sharpness though. Much more effective than the dull worn out Conair clippers they replaced. I&#x27;ve used these clippers a couple of times now and they are excellent for my needs.</li>
    <li> used for 2 years and not problems so far</li>
    <li> These are great clippers for their price. They get the job done effectively if you know how to use clippers.</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed with Wahl clippers. This is my third set. They do wear out or get stolen from me sometimes.</li>
    <li> i like the way it buzz my hair and the fact that it tells you what color to use on the buzz</li>
    <li> This hair cutting kit works really well, and definitely worth the investment. it&#x27;s got well enough cutting power, and self sharpen blade&#x27;s definitely a plus.</li>
    <li> Cheap ass clipper. Plastic, and even with nothing attached to the blades, it still leaves about 1/8 of hair. Next time I&#x27;ll spend more money and get a decent one.</li>
    <li> Good sturdy clipper.  Does not over heat. Color coded guides.  I use it  to clip my dog.</li>
    <li> Hands Down. The best for the money. Really like the plastic height adjusters. Worth much more than what I had to pay.&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT~</li>
    <li> Purchased this to give home haircuts to my husband and sons. Came with good instructions and easy to use. Can&#x27;t beat the price on this for as many attachments as you get with it!</li>
    <li> What a deal good quality for the money one cut and it pays for itself..hayoo!</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl that I have purchased, and it&#x27;s solid. This helps me shave my head without going to the barber. I admit, I&#x27;ve gotten a lot better in my old age, so I don&#x27;t know how beginners will do with this. It comes with a lot of accessories, but I only use 1 of them. I like it overall, the price is right and definitely solid. However, I don&#x27;t see it lasting more than 6 months to a year with heavy use, so 4 stars is all I can give it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to start cutting my kids&#x27; hair. I was nervous because I can&#x27;t even cut with scissors in a straight line! But this looked like a good one for beginners and the price was amazing so I decided to give it a go. Once my son&#x27;s first cut was done I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it looked! The razor is super easy to use. The color guide really helps. It was way easier than I was expecting. I can&#x27;t believe I waited 7 years to get a razor. I&#x27;ll never take my kids to the salon again!</li>
    <li> Ordered this but received a cordless Conair trimmer instead. Woah. Please send me the right unit.</li>
    <li> The kit container is a tight fit for all it contains as well as for a bathroom sink vanity drawer. It replaces a Wahl haircutting kit I used for fifty years.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with this set. It&#x27;s easy to use and completely idiot proof.</li>
    <li> Works great. Excellent price, I use it for my hair and beard grooming. Never feels like its pulling my hair, nice easy cut</li>
    <li> It has different combs to play with and nice basic, intro-to-hair-buzzing. I don&#x27;t know if you can do professional things with this, but when I bought it in college, it was fun to play around with this buzzer for simple trimming and styling.</li>
    <li> Wahl stuff is just better.</li>
    <li> Works well. Wish we&#x27;d have gotten the cordless but that is my fault. Already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> It runs beautifully and helps me keep my beard trip regularly! Greatly improved from my old clipper. The different colors help immensely to get the right length done.</li>
    <li> came in fast, and works great.</li>
    <li> This is the second of these that I bought from amazon because its an awesome item the first was for a gift, this one for myself great price great item comes with every thing you need to cut hair, includes a hair cutting scissor</li>
    <li> very nice! I use it very convenience!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Cut hair okay and has many accessories, but the power switch does not make good electrical contact consistently when switched on.</li>
    <li> Being one of those follically challenged folks like Amazon&#x27;s Maybe-Evil-Overlord J.B., I have long considered it a waste of money to go to the barber.  My first pair of clippers was a Wahl professional unit that I bought for, I think $70+tax.  It got locked up somehow and didn&#x27;t work anymore, so I went looking on the web and found this one for just $20.  The reviews were good so I thought &amp;#34;well, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t have the gray and black &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; look to it...and doesn&#x27;t have as much &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34;.  Yet it feels every bit as well-balanced and came with a lot more cool attachments.  I don&#x27;t really use them and just clip directly to the skin like a razor--because I don&#x27;t grow hair worth keeping.  But if someone else needed a haircut there&#x27;s quite an assortment, and even used it to trim my friend&#x27;s dog.  Dog gave it a paws up too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As power tools you keep in the bathroom go, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this $20 item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for a Christmas gift... 2 years have passed and these clippers are STILL sharp and working beautifully. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my beard. It works very well. I am very happy i bought this. Good well built and well priced. Recommended...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it does its job well. First cut with it seems to be very good.</li>
    <li> This is a great haircutting set. It has all the parts that you need and comes in a handy storage case.  It operates smoothly and not very loud.  The color coding is a nice touch.  Much easier than trying to read the black on black raised numbers on my old set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite recommend if you&#x27;re looking for one of these.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s amazing powerful,next time if I need it I will be by same one</li>
    <li> First haircut went great. Already saving money and cut looks very good.</li>
    <li> Very complete kit was received on time and works as described for the price it is a good hair cutting kit for beginners</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My hair looks neat and tidy, specially over the ear. Would have loved the eyebrow attachment. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well but noticed it makes a REALLY loud buzzing noise when you turn it on sometimes and I have to push hard on the middle of it to make it stop.</li>
    <li> it was a bad experience,  I bought the first one and when I operated it was very very noisy,  like you hold 2000cc engine in your hand !! I said to myself this is a defected item , purchase another one, when I order the second one , its the same problem !!</li>
    <li> not easy to do back of head with this</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and works professionally.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and with lots of different sized clippers.</li>
    <li> does its job. shaves pretty well. noisy.</li>
    <li> Comes with only 120V so u have to buy an adaptor of 220V worth 5$&lt;br /&gt;Other than that its great clipper for hair</li>
    <li> Cost effective, but not pro level</li>
    <li> Good price and works great</li>
    <li> excellent, fast and secure evios</li>
    <li> I bought these hair clippers for my boys hair. Usually when I use store bought hair clippers my children complain because the clippers pulled their hair while trimming. This one is very easy to use, comes with several attachments for blending, and is very precise. The children nor my husband complained about hair pulling problems, in fact they rather enjoyed the haircut. Easy to clean and easy to use! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast shipment</li>
    <li> Decent razor for cutting my children&#x27;s&#x27; hair. Lots of guards to chose from. Not super loud which is great for my one son&#x27;s sensory issues. Already used it a dozen times and still going strong.</li>
    <li> The razor seemed to have some sort of residue or hair on it when it arrived. Nothing a little liquid soap couldn&#x27;t fix. I highly recommend people to thoroughly inspect/cleanse the product for any residues before using it on your head or other part of your body. The attachments come in an unopened plastic bag so there weren&#x27;t any problems with those.  The razor works alright, you get for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great price for what it offers. My husband prefers my cut than the barbers.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed and great price!</li>
    <li> great product! very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Great hair cutter.  Great price.  The clip ons to cutter are fragile...be careful with taking on and off</li>
    <li> I did not see in the specs, but this is 9 watts. Look at the one you have now. 3-6 watts maybe? It cut right through my hair that had not been cut for a month.</li>
    <li> Buy the recommended oil along with these clippers - they don&#x27;t tell you this much in the product description - worth noting.</li>
    <li> it is very noisy that I couldn&#x27;t use it ,when i tight the screw it doesn&#x27;t work ?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my head for years, this is by far the best buzzer I&#x27;ve had. I owned my first one for years and never did any maintenance whatsoever, like oiling etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to complain, I&#x27;d say that the device outlasts its accessories (which will break after time), but I suppose that&#x27;s a good problem to have. Also, they can&#x27;t seem to get their boxes right. Both that I&#x27;ve owned are flimsy with the latch breaking easily and barely are able to hold the components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those issues are secondary. This buzzer is very durable, very well made and works beautifully.</li>
    <li> I like the design and ease.</li>
    <li> Works very well so far, and it&#x27;s nice to have such a wide range of attachments. Cheaper than the one it replaced; I&#x27;ll see if it lasts as long.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. A definite must have.</li>
    <li> this is SO LOUD. it sounds like there&#x27;s an entire construction crew in this. it&#x27;s honestly way too loud to use.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not that precise for fine trimming of beard. It&#x27;s not stainless and if moist, blades catch rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would had been better if had two separate combs for creating guiding line near right and left ears.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly for Wahl, this clipper broke down in just a few days. Maybe mine was just defective. I had to return it. Good news is they took it back and paid for shipping. It&#x27;s also very heavy and difficult to maneuver. I don&#x27;t know what else to recommend - I found it easier to just go to the barber and give up on cutting my own hair.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly; works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned it for closer to two years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  The color make it easier to find the suitable length.  Definitely worth for $18.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really recommend this machine because it&#x27;s very cheap and high quality and it has 20 pieces. Also, Ive seen this item in Walmart but it&#x27;s more expensive than Amazon, so buy it from Amazon is better</li>
    <li> A good value.  High quality.  Easy to use.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for a great price.  Shipped super quick!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this item. Been a customer of Wahl products for a while and I&#x27;m pretty content with their performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but I can&#x27;t imagine a buzzer better than this. This thing has insane value and I&#x27;m sure it will last me years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also colors.</li>
    <li> I cut his hair and mine they work very well and we got fast delivery on them.</li>
    <li> Worked fine. Not too pricey.</li>
    <li> I use this cutter to cut my own hair - works great, easy to use, good control.</li>
    <li> For such a great product I am really surprised how cheap it is! I would highly recommend this product and have purchased several more for friends / family.</li>
    <li> Used for trimming my dog. It does a great job but could be a little better. It runs pretty warm.</li>
    <li> A money saving gift for my son. Does everything he wants it to. Easy to use, and easy to store in it&#x27;s case.</li>
    <li> worked great, a lot of attachment, maybe to many.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, great price</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks to this awesome clipper I&#x27;ve learned to cut my own hair with the help of a few youtube videos. No more going to the barber for a $17 haircut every 2-3 weeks. Great investment!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality, works well, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, got them to replace another set of Wahl clippers that were about 8 years old.  Lots of pieces and works great.</li>
    <li> I bought these to cut my toddlers hair and husbands hair.  The clippers are quiet enough they didn&#x27;t scare my 21 month old.  The cut was super fast, which is what I need with a wiggle worm!  I haven&#x27;t tried them on my husband&#x27;s hair yet, but I am looking forward to it!</li>
    <li> professional quality clipper. Works great, tons of guides, easy to cut my own and my son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> These clippers have paid for themselves many times over in the amount that I have saved from going to the barbers.  Great clippers and they work perfectly.  Very easy to use.  Wish that I had been brave enough and / or smart enough to have bought them sooner.  I will purchase this same set if mine ever fail.</li>
    <li> As a result of using this product my beard is now much shorter and therefore more aerodynamic than before and I go faster on my bicycle as a result of my new-found reduced wind-resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, however, my haircut has made me more handsome, resulting in increased interest from the ladies (mostly Brazilian supermodels asking to rub sun cream on my back and the like). This has caused significant tension in my relationship and my wife is considering divorcing me as a result, which is why I didn&#x27;t give the product five stars.</li>
    <li> I actually find the motor to be too powerful and the vibration is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the vibration, it works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and it has worked great so far. The oil included is enough to run it for the foreseeable future, but the combs feel a little cheap. They are definitely made of a softer plastic than barbers ones. The scissors are sharp, but aren&#x27;t the kind you can sharpen when they dull. The instructions should say that you should only use the left and right ear faders when getting a cut at a length of 3 or below. I ended up with an awkward one that made me look like a marine cadet for a couple weeks. It will cut all the hair you want it to, but be gentle if you need to cut through a lot of thick hair at once. Everything looks like it should and the loudness is really about the same as the professional ones. Buying from this seller is giving you a discount of a few dollars even over Walmart, but there are some cheaper cutters that you can find even in your local department stores that give the same quality if you don&#x27;t use them every week.</li>
    <li> This product is great when it decides to work. The fist day that i got it i turned on to make sure it worked properly and it did it sounded okay and everything seemed fine. When i turned off and back on again it made a terribly loud noise, I have no idea what it is. This problem happens around 2 out of every 3 times i turn it on. I&#x27;m turning it in for a refund, i had high hopes for this product from reading all the great reviews it has. It&#x27;s a shame i got a defective product.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy. Attachments perfect for cutting my silky terriers hair. Low noise. Easy to clean.  Love the storage case.</li>
    <li> Had a Conair trimmer and was not satisfied. The Wahl does not get hot. Has great attachments. I am giving my husband and son much better hair cuts now in less time.</li>
    <li> Granted I am by no means a barber or professional stylist, but for trimming up around the ears or just getting rid of some weight for the summer, these are great.  There are plenty of guards to choose from so you have a lot of options for length.  Also includes the ear guards as well as some combs and scissors.  Pretty great deal in my opinion.</li>
    <li> the product is very good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and comes with a lot of hair cutting utensils.....trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair clipper, great for the price. It doesn&#x27;t snag or tangle the hair. The only thing to consider is that it&#x27;s quite loud.</li>
    <li> This is a review that truly only time will tell.  This product is replacing another set of Wahl clippers that had lasted over 15 years, and survived four deployments to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan - an outstanding pair of hair clippers.  Out of the box the new clippers have the same solid feel; however, the blade adjustment bar seems to be less sturdy.  This set of clippers use the same blades as the old set so the cut quality is the same and the Wahl blades last forever.  I had just changed out blades in my old clippers just before they decided to die. That set of blades had lasted through all the dust, dirt and sand of over 44 months in SW Asia plus use every 10-14 days over 15 years.  The kit contains a few more combs than my old one, which is nice especially when using for my kids hair.  The case is cheap plastic and I don&#x27;t expect the latch to last long, so once it breaks the set will go into the dopp bag that I used for my old set.  For now, no complaints and if they last as long as their predicessor did then I will have had two outstanding sets of Wahl hair-clippers.</li>
    <li> I have had this for months and no complaints. I just use it to shave my head because it&#x27;s cheaper than paying 20$ each time.</li>
    <li> Updated after less than 10 uses: It broke. It simply stopped working. Very disappointed. I could have sent it back for repair under warranty, but decided to let it go, case &amp; all.  Initial review: Hefty piece of machinery. Does the job very well. Follow the guides &amp; move from the longest comb to the smallest (don&#x27;t skip, as I did, &amp; find your hair in funny cuts). Really like it &amp; at this price it is a steal.</li>
    <li> The Wahl kit is very complete for the price.  The clipper is quiet and effective.  Note that the shortest setting is short, but not balding.</li>
    <li> I previously had a wahl razor but it broke so i needed a new one. this one barely cut my hair. i had uneven peices and i had to go over every little section multiple times. this razor did not meet my expectations. now i have to put forth more money to get a working razor.</li>
    <li> These Wahl clippers are awesome!!!!! I purchased a different pair at another store and they were more expennsive and did not work well. The other set over heated very quickly where as these were able to cut with out overheating. I&#x27;m very very very pleased with these. I have a friend that recommended these because he has them and said they work really well. And I was not by any means dissapointed</li>
    <li> Works remarkably great!!! I have used it on my husband and kids they all look great when I cut their hair with the Wahl haircutter.</li>
    <li> This hair cutting beast is absolutely wonderful. It slices through unruly hairs like a table saw through butter. Easy to handle, good selection of blades and trimmers, easy to clean. 10/10 would shave again.</li>
    <li> Came out of the box working fine...no problems. Good value. Storage is very compact and fits in closet with little space used.</li>
    <li> Love it, you can feel the quality when you handle it. it was recommended by a college classmate.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers.  The instructions were great and give clear detail how to cut your own hair.  I give myself a cut once a week, using the # 2,3, and 4 heads.  The clipper is very well made, solid.  The razor portion cut effortlessly.  The motor seem very strong.  I have already paid for the clippers 3 times over in the last 6 weeks.  These are really great clippers!</li>
    <li> Works great, great attachments, good delivery, great price</li>
    <li> I love, works well and like the different colors-fancy.</li>
    <li> I cut my boys hair with this the day we got it. I have never cut human hair before although i have clipped the horses. The kids hair looks great and we will now save about 200$ a year on there haircuts.</li>
    <li> Had this for a few months now and am very satisfied. Good set of clippers for a good price. The color coded attachments is a nice feature. Good quality, seems like it will last for a while.</li>
    <li> Very nice unit, works very well and a very good price</li>
    <li> i love the colored pieces which makes it so easy to find them&lt;br /&gt;also, the machine is quiet so i don&#x27;t disturb my neighbors when i use this lol&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s really nothing that i don&#x27;t like about it actually</li>
    <li> well made. cuts without pulling.  a lot of pieces in the kit, which comes in a nice plastic (reusable) box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then...I dropped the blade on the floor and chipped it.  Guess what: they actually sell replacement blades!!!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible clipper. I cannot believe how terrible this is. It is much heavier than the Con Air that I have had since 2008. It also shakes like a lawnmower that you&#x27;d think you have Parkinson disease once you&#x27;ve held it for a minute long. So I added some oil to it and adjust the power input on the clipper to no help. Also, my box was missing the left and right guide clips. I&#x27;m gonna order a Con Air now.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and cuts hair fast. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance and he loved it</li>
    <li> Short and simple.  Do not purchase!  On first use, it left metal barbs in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it quickly cut me twice, as is always possible with any kind of razor, but there was no blood.  The pain didn&#x27;t go away, and the barbs were small enough that they were barely visible to the naked eye.  I had to use a jeweler&#x27;s loop and tweezers to get them out.  Under magnification, they were clearly metal barbs lodged in my skin.  I&#x27;m just glad they didn&#x27;t go deep enough to get completely underneath.  Consider this your warning.  I don&#x27;t know if Wahl had a bad manufacturing batch, or if this kind of quality is the norm, but it has certainly turned me away as a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the metal barbs, my impression was poor in the couple minutes I used it.  Loud, heavy vibration, etc.  Poor quality to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is without a doubt, the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon - and I do a lot of shopping here.  Credits to Amazon for making the return effortless.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Comes with everything that you need &amp; then some. Makes hair cutting easy! A great buy!</li>
    <li> Just buy it!! If you have a girlfriend you are throwing your money away....It brings you closer as a couple and it pays for itself immediately.... No waiting in lines, just show up to your girls house and be like....&amp;#34;Yo do this&amp;#34;....if she cant then break up with her....If you have a sister...there you go....If your alone and 35 in your moms basement.....There you go... If you don&#x27;t have a single friend that is a girl that will do it for free.....Then I&#x27;m sorry but you probably don&#x27;t cut your hair anyway.......If someone makes a bet they weren&#x27;t plan on keeping at a party because they lost flip cup.....There you go.....Seriously very elaborate and worth every penny....Just get a little plastic box for it so hair doesn&#x27;t get everywhere....it comes with a case but I ain&#x27;t no magician so i cant fit them all back in perfectly......Shave in the shower with your girl or just outside.... #20percentlessmesses....Oh and tell your girl to skip the ear clips she&#x27;ll mess up your ears and make you look like you had chemo on the sides of your head when she goes the wrong direction with them.....Have over a year not a single issue....Except lots of extra money I saved on hair cuts</li>
    <li> Works good very heavy built am very satisfied keep them coming</li>
    <li> Only used the Wahl haircutting kit once &#x3D; seems to do a good job.  I&#x27;m still getting use to it.</li>
    <li> I was more than a little disappointed when I opened the case and discovered that half of the clips were reduced to small plastic shards.  Amazon was more than cooperative in resolving the issue; however, do not order this product expecting it to be pristine and intact.  Trimmer itself is fabulous; clips are shoddy.</li>
    <li> Great upgrade from the previous set that i had. Same makers. I would give it 4.5 rating. 0.5 docked off as it has to be plugged at all times</li>
    <li> I bought the Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit thinking I could give my son (age 2) haircuts. The trimmer cut well and there is an instruction guide for male hair cuts in the kit.  I have tried three times now, waiting for his hair to grow out each time.  Each haircut was super bad, so the instruction guild was not fool proof.  What I learned was cutting hair is a lot harder than it looks.  I think I will give up and take him to a barber.</li>
    <li> We bought this on Amazon for about $22 no shipping.  It works really well.  I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because there is not a small blade to shave around ears and under back of neck on the hair line.  Otherwise great purchase and would def recommend.  We cut our kids hair at home and it works great!</li>
    <li> Super comes with all full team</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using similar Wahl trimmers since the 80&#x27;s. They simply work. The new color-coded system is nice if you have different lengths that you prefer, and the entire unit comes in its own sturdy, plastic, easy-storage case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These trimmers are inexpensive and, if they&#x27;re anything like their earlier models, will last a very long time with the proper care.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the Wahl I bought for quadruple the price. There is no reason to spend more money on a wahl than this model.</li>
    <li> Have used Wahl for years. Good product for the money.</li>
    <li> This was returned. The noise was horrendous! It frightened my son, who is used to having his hair cut at home. It was truly awful. Our cheapo conair clippers were better.&lt;br /&gt;Returned these and purchased the awesome Oster clippers instead!</li>
    <li> amazing, I can design my hairstyle with it.</li>
    <li> The kit is great for the price I paid, but the wire is inconvenient. Would be 5 stars if it was wireless.</li>
    <li> great haircutting kit with all the accessory parts you&#x27;ll ever need!</li>
    <li> I needed a new clipper after my previous one died from a few years of wear and tear. The advantage of this clipper is the color-coded combs, easy weight, and rubber grip. Be sure to oil the blades before and after each use.</li>
    <li> this machine is practical. i use it to cut my hair and trim my chin. it is a bit heavy, but i like it because it kinda give you a feel that you&#x27;re carrying a machine not a toy.</li>
    <li> It worked fine the first two weeks I had it, then later on every time I turned it on it made such a loud noise it was like someone was drilling in my wall. I would spend a little more on more quality instead of buying this.</li>
    <li> I used it 2 times and it broke ..not happy😞</li>
    <li> Works well, not too noisy.</li>
    <li> Great clipper for price. I shave my head 2 times a week and wanted a heavy duty clipper.  This is perfect and has weight and strength</li>
    <li> Not a professional hair clippers but very good for the price.  Probably the thing I like like the most about it is that it was mad in the USA</li>
    <li> Awesome, best clippers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> A well built set of clippers with every attachment and accessory you could ever need. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Well made. Could have used a larger brush for cleaning the clipper.</li>
    <li> Gave my first haircut to my son!  Works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two sets of these clippers, and they just don&#x27;t hold up all that well.  Situation of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  Fine for casual use, but I use it 2-3 times a week, and it just wears out quicker than I&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> They work great have a good color size system</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this clipper kit.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 8 months and it paid for itself by the end of the second month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on myself.  I just bend over the bathtub and clip away, using the clipper guide I need for the length I want.  The cut hair drops into the tub and is easy to clean up with a damp paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more shaggy head for me!</li>
    <li> I used to be a hairdresser, and am used to using $300 professional clippers. I bought these because I thought it would be cheaper and more convenient than having my other clippers professionally serviced. I was pleasantly surprised by these. They also come with instructions for haircuts that I think would be very helpful if you don&#x27;t have any training or experience cutting hair.</li>
    <li> It cuts hair and beard very well, but it makes too much noise! I can&#x60;t use it without wake up ereryone in the house!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend beacuse he refuses to get his haircut more than twice a year, and at certain points he needs one. He loves that he now can cut his hair at home. I have shaved it for him and it was easy and smooth with no problems. Although we have only used it once so far, I am hoping it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> My hubby uses them to cut his own hair an he is please with this item.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd set of this exact model I have bought. The previous set was purchased in 2006, and did not dull until 2013. I cut my own hair about every two weeks, keep it short. So for these to last around 7yrs is fantastic. I was very happy to see this model was still available. If not, I would still only buy Wahl clippers. They have always worked great for me. I really love these clippers. I am not sure how any other clippers could be better. Just as good? Maybe. But better? Nothing I can see to improve on. I highly recommend these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note about shipping. I have never seen shipping this fats and still have no idea how they did it. How in the world is this possible!! I will NOT complain, but this shipping speed is mind blowing. I ordered this item at 10pm on a Saturday night (3/16), with 2 day shipping and an expected delivery date of 3/20 (figuring it would ship Monday the 18th). No kidding, but I got the package on Monday the 18th! It came to VA from KY!!! WOW!! Not even sure how that happened, but thank-you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> vibrates and loud... doesn&#x27;t work properly</li>
    <li> These clippers cut ok, but they were incredibly loud.  I only used them twice and threw them away.  I bought more of the remington self-sharpening clippers, which work great.</li>
    <li> Works fine with the correct voltage and frequency.</li>
    <li> For less than twenty dollars how can you go wrong. These clippers make short-work of my thick hair once a month.  The only thing my wife complains about is they vibrate a lot but that&#x27;s what clippers do.</li>
    <li> This clipper isnt as expensive as others thats listen here on amazon, but this clipper does the job well. Better than the expensive ones that are listed. Cheap and affordable and it comes with different sizes and also a taper fade for begginers. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Works well, good selection of different sizes, scissors aren&#x27;t the best.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> So far so good but i havent use it more than 2 times, i does have a bunch of sizes to choose the lenght if your hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. The product looks almost for professional use, it has everything you need to start, and it comes with instructions. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Cut my own hair for the first time and got professional results. This clipper is well made and the fact that it is so inexpensive is amazing. It seemed like it was a bit hot at end of haircut but that was all I noticed as a con.  I used the info in the inclosed instructions and watched a few videos on the internet and didn&#x27;t even have to blend it when I finished. I did kind of a 4,5,6 from bottom to top and done.  Home barbers can&#x27;t do much better than this deal.</li>
    <li> just received my wahl clippers,very fast delivery all 20 pieces were in the case and no broken pieces,can&#x27;t wait to try the clippers very nice clippers for the price,i will update my review when I use them so far very nice clippers</li>
    <li> Love this.  Having a house full of boys it was time to update to something new.  This set has every guard I would ever need and it worked with no problems.  So worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> We used to have a different trimmer and this one is better!  It is easy to use, not too heavy, and my husband can cut his hair himself.  The blades are easy to replace, as well.</li>
    <li> I had this exact same clipper before and it is very good, solid and powerful. When this one came though it was obviously used, the guides, combs and other accessories were all new though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this was a replaced item or a refurbishment but it works fine and I can&#x27;t be bothered to return it as it was only $22. Amazon was the seller and not a 3rd party so I would expect better from them.</li>
    <li> No problems with this little buddy. Do the job was it made for and has a lot of toold to use!</li>
    <li> Upon opening the packaging box, I found the paper sealing wrap around the plastic container of the clipper was broken. Immediately I realized it was used. After taking the clipper out and examing it, my feeling was confirmed: used clipper sent to me with someone&#x27;s hair still on the teeth of the clipper. I have been a loyal customer of Amazon since maybe 2000 when they were still a book seller. Now this kind of thing really makes me disappointed. It may not be fair to Wahl as this is a product review.</li>
    <li> it is not a smooth trimmer to handle</li>
    <li> just what i needed.....plenty of power...zip zip zip</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed and I have already given close to 10 haircuts for my son and husband with it!  I actually enjoy cutting their hair and its much less traumatic then the barber shop for my son.  I watched a few You Tube videos on how to cut hair, I&#x27;m not going to be spending another dime on cuts for my boys anymore!</li>
    <li> If have really thick hair, and the buzzer has yet to give me trouble. There are many attachments for different lengths.</li>
    <li> For the price of two haircuts, I got this clipper instead. The old Chinese man once said that it&#x27;s better to fish than to eat fish so it must be true. I am learning to cut my own hair it&#x27;s a challenge but I&#x27;m getting great results! I highly recommend this if you are a highly skilled artisan of great craftsmanship just like me!  Just kidding I&#x27;m just a dude on a budget LOL</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers!  They don&#x27;t get too hot like others so you can finish a whole haircut or two without waiting for the blade to cool down.</li>
    <li> I love the colored guards. It makes it much easier finding the one I want. I&#x27;ve owned several clippers in the past and this is definitely one of my favorites. It just works really well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a solid device. Not too loud or &amp;#34;buzzy&amp;#34; if that makes sense (it cuts well without vibrating the hand a ton).</li>
    <li> Great product. The color coding size attachments are fast and easy to identify and chang. The price is fabulous. Just one time cutting my two sons and my hair paid for this clipper. Save your money buy cutting the family hair&#x27;s. Its very easy with this clipper. I estimate I will be saving $400 a year just cutting hairs at home instead of costly barber visit.</li>
    <li> I recently started cutting my own hair and this kit was not only the most affordable but still comes with a slew of accessories that I don&#x27;t really need. A bunch of different sizes, two combs and a carrying case for all the goods!</li>
    <li> Very good. Works well. The company made a good thing which is useful to the people. This is what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about the quality of this product.  The blades are sharp, the instructions are simple yet contain good detail, it offers a good grip, has nice attachments, and a decent case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is in the closeness of the cut.  I am a bald man that has the typical pattern of no hair on top or on the crown of the head, with hair on the sides and back of the head.  I shave what hair I do have as close as I can without the use of a straight razor.  I have used a handful of this type of razor and this one doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as others have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wish it offered a closer shave, it is a bit safer than ones that do shave closer.  Ones that shave closer can remove moles, skin tags, and get caught on scars and such.  This one won&#x27;t do that as bad as a closer shaving razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a give and take...</li>
    <li> I read many reviews of this product and decided to buy two, one for me and one as gift to my brother. It turns out to be embarrassed. The noise is terrible, and I dare not turn it on the third time. Sadly, return policy is not applied to this product, and hence I want you to be alerted if you want to order this. Unusable!</li>
    <li> I use it to trim my beard weekly.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I have never used clippers before but wanted a pair to keep my hair nice and short during the summer months because I work outside.  These were a good price and had favorable reviews.  I skimmed through the directions and had my first hair cut within minutes.  They worked great.  My only complaint was that they did get fairly warm just after a few minutes of use.</li>
    <li> These clippers are an excellent value from a great company! The quality is even better than I expected! They function extremely well and don&#x27;t pull or snag the hair at all. The color codes are a very good help for those that are novice at cutting hair. I recommend these clippers to anyone!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s little heavy for me</li>
    <li> I need to cut my hair myself instead of going to the barber to cut my hair. I looked at a lot of similar electric cutters. Non of them got my attention. This one works great and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair I would recommend getting someone to help you. Then it will be easy to cut your hair after the first time.</li>
    <li> when i first got them i gave my friend a buzz cut and they worked great but you you should make the clippers sound not so loud</li>
    <li> Not  sharp....if the hair thick can&#x27;t cut...</li>
    <li> The quality is salon worthy. My husbands barber retired so I took on the task of cutting my husbands hair since all he used was this tool. My hairstylist recommended this brand in particular. The kit is fantastic and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Oh......... how I love this clipper! So I bought this because the barbershop around either didn&#x27;t cater to black hair or would keep changing barbers all the time! Learned how to cut off of a YouTube video and decided to get this clipper. The color coded clips makes it super easy!</li>
    <li> Its nice, very useful, save me some money. I now can hair cut at any time as I want. but the first time, you would need some practice.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews for this product.  We just needed something simple, reliable and of good quality and this clipper has more than foot the bill, it has far exceeded out expectations and I don&#x27;t know what better endorsement you can have than that!  5 stars from me and it really deserves them.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this haircutting set. It cuts hair good for 2-3 years and then its time for another set.&lt;br /&gt;Thats good considering it cuts the hair for 4 boys.</li>
    <li> Bought a year ago still working nicely.</li>
    <li> At first I was going to give it three stars when the first time we used it, but after calling Wahl&#x27;s customer service dept. the issue of the broken guard was taken care of immediately.  It works great, and I like the fact it has the color coded hair guards.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> Yup made another good pic up here</li>
    <li> My Wahl clippers recently broke and I found these. Work great and they are so much more quiet than my old pair, I sadly had to retire.</li>
    <li> Shipped quick my wife cuts me and my boys hair works great</li>
    <li> Clippers worked great, love the color coded combs for different hair lengths, soft-touch grip is very nice, makes for easy use. Overall, the kit performs perfectly, no problems...</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT GOOD HAIR CUT</li>
    <li> Tons of attachments, works well right out of the box and fits my needs, I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who wants a cheaper way to trim their own hair.</li>
    <li> A must have clipper for hair cutting at home.</li>
    <li> Works great, thorough instructions, affordable! My son loves his haircuts and I love that I can do it myself. Nice product.</li>
    <li> As you know, you can get cheap clippers, almost anywhere. I have bought such clippers in the past, and they last for a couple of months. That&#x27;s not the case with these clippers. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. These clippers are great. They aren&#x27;t too loud, and they work well at cutting all that hair, and not leaving little strands behind. I&#x27;d recommend these clippers to anybody.</li>
